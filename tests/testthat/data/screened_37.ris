AB  - Cyanobacteria are widely distributed photosynthetic microorganisms that can be found in almost every terrestrial and aquatic environment. In heavily eutrophicated water bodies, massive proliferation of cyanobacteria can lead into excessive surface water blooms. Over the last decades the presence of Aphanizomenon sp. dominated blooms have also been reported in the Curonian Lagoon. Recent reports indicate that removal of wild cyanobacterial blooms from the Curonian Lagoon as a management measure should be prioritized. In this study, the utilization of wild cyanobacteria as a potential source of high-added value products by means of supercritical CO2 extraction (SFE-CO2) is reported. Central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were employed to optimize SFE-CO2 parameters (temperature, pressure and time) to obtain high yield lipophilic extracts. Under optimal conditions (42.5 MPa, 55 degrees C and 120 min), SFE-CO2 yielded 4.43 g/100 g DW of nonpolar extract, showing 20% higher extraction efficiency at 3-fold lower extraction time as compared to the conventional Soxhlet extraction. SFE-CO2 fraction was rich in alpha-linolenic acid (27% of total fatty acids) and alpha-tocopherol (293 mu g/g extract). Moreover, the total phenolic content and the in vitro radical scavenging capacity of extracts and solid fractions were evaluated too. Furthermore, preliminary life cycle assessment (LCA) showed that SFE-CO2 had a higher life cycle impact as compared to the hexane system. Thus, SFE-CO2 could be utilized to valorise wild cyanobacteria into valuable products with various industrial applications.

AB  - The application of a non-destructive analytical procedure to characterise the mineral phases in meteorites is a key issue in order to preserve this type of scarce materials. In the present work, the Elephant Moraine 83227 meteorite, found in Antarctica in 1983 and originated from 4 Vesta asteroid, was analysed by micro-Raman spectroscopy, micro-energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence and the structural and chemical analyser (Raman spectroscopy coupled with scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectroscopy) working in both point-by-point and image modes. The combination of all these techniques allows the extraction of, at the same time, elemental, molecular and structural data of the studied microscopic area of the meteorite. The most relevant results of the Elephant Moraine 83227 were the finding of tridymite for the first time in a 4 Vesta meteorite, along with quartz, which means that the meteorite suffered high temperatures at a certain point. Moreover, both feldspar and pyroxene were found as the main mineral phases in the sample. Ilmenite, apatite, chromite and elemental sulphur were also detected as secondary minerals. Finally, calcite was found as a weathering product, which was probably formed in terrestrial weathering processes of the pyroxene present in the sample. Besides, Raman spectroscopy provided information about the conditions that the meteorite experienced; the displacements in some feldspar Raman bands were used to estimate the temperature and pressure conditions to which the Elephant Moraine 83227 was subjected, because we obtained both low and high formation temperature feldspar.

TI  - A sustainable Arctic: Making hard decisions
AU  - Trump, B. D.

T2  - Arctic Antarctic and Alpine Research
AB  - The Arctic is experiencing substantial increases in human activity in areas ranging from fossil fuel and mineral extraction to transport along Arctic waterways. Such actions may yield new sources of economic benefits and further objectives to promote national defense, yet they may also generate potential risks to the Arctic environment. As such, concerns from various stakeholders have been raised regarding how to make Arctic operations better meet sustainability goals and balance defense and economic objectives with environmental degradation. This article describes how decision analytical tools, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), may help identify policies and project proposals that minimize the potential for environmental degradation within a framework of maximizing economic, industrial, and defense objectives. Specifically, MCDA conducts value tradeoffs to assess the utility of various decision alternatives against disparate criteria; for this case, this includes the evaluation of Arctic operation sustainability. This article demonstrates through an example of industrial mining in Greenland how MCDA might serve as a tool to guide uncertain decisions for various Arctic projects, and potentially indicate opportunities to structure such projects to provide greater sustainability for their longer-term operations.

Elements of the technogenic ore-mining landscape have been revealed to have a negative impact on the environment within the identified centers. It is shown that mining works are one of the main sources of ecological tension and potable fresh water pollution in highly hazardous copper-pyrite deposits. A range of mine engineering, geoecological, and social problems of the mining republics of the northern Caucasus are evaluated.

AB  - In the present study, we examined the subcellular distribution of metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Cu, Se and Zn) in the liver and gonads of wild white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) collected downstream from a metal mining operation (exposure area) and in a reference area. Metal partitioning among potentially metal-sensitive fractions (heat-denatured proteins (HDP), mitochondria and microsomes) and potentially biologically detoxified fractions (heat-stable proteins (HSP) and metal-rich granules) within cells was determined after differential centrifugation, NaOH digestion and heat-denaturation steps. Metal-handling strategies between liver and gonads, and between sexes, were examined. Hepatic metal concentrations were significantly higher in exposed compared to reference fish, especially for Se (14x), Cd (5x) and Cu (3x), and did not vary between sexes. In contrast, gonadal Cd, Cu, Se and Zn concentrations were consistently lower in testes than in ovaries; marked differences in Cd and Se concentrations between exposed and reference fish were observed for both sexes. Overall, metal-handling strategies were similar in both liver (male and female pooled) and female gonads, but differed from those in male gonads, likely due to the different functions assigned to ovaries and testes. Subcellular partitioning of As, Cd and Cu showed that the HSP fraction was most responsive to increased metal exposure, presumably reflecting Cu regulation, and possibly Cd and As detoxification. Zinc concentrations were tightly controlled and mainly found in the HDP fraction. Interestingly, changes in Cd-handling strategy in female gonads were particularly evident, with Cd shifting dramatically from the metal-sensitive HDP fraction in reference fish to the metal-detoxified HSP fraction in exposed fish. It seems that Cd detoxification in female gonads was not fully induced in the less contaminated fish, but became more effective above a threshold Cd concentration of 0.05 nmol/g dry weight. Partitioning of Se was different, with the largest contributor to the total liver and gonad Se burdens being the putative metal-sensitive HDP fraction, suggesting that excess Se in this fraction in exposed fish may lead to Serelated stress. The present subcellular partitioning results demonstrate that metal handling strategies vary among metals, between organs and (in some cases) as a function of metal exposure. They also show promise in identifying metals of potential concern in a risk assessment context.

TI  - Early mining and smelting lead anomalies in geological archives as potential stratigraphic markers for the base of an early Anthropocene
AU  - Wagreich, M.
AU  - Draganits, E.
T2  - Anthropocene Review
AB  - This article reviews possible lower boundaries for an early Anthropocene period. Although a noticeable environmental impact of humans, caused by hunting, the use of fire, forest clearance, animal domestication and agriculture had already occurred in the Neolithic, these early signals are strongly diachronous and localised. Here, we examine early significant, synchronous and regional stratigraphic signals indicating an anthropogenic influence as consequences of mining and smelting-related trace metal contamination. A first regional lead contamination event in the Northern Hemisphere is recognized during the (Eastern Mediterranean) Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age, between 3500 and 2800 BP, with a peak at around 3000 BP. Another pronounced anthropogenic lead peak is recorded around 2000 BP, during the Roman period. These events, as defined by lead enrichment and changes in lead isotope ratios, accompanied by other trace metal enrichments, are found in several types of archives, such as Arctic ice-cores and European peat-bogs, speleothems as well as fluvial, lake and marine records. Potential stratigraphic correlations and secondary markers may be present using tephrochronology, climate events, and magnetostratigraphy. Such a definition of the base of a formally defined (early) Anthropocene stage/period allows the application of the GSSP (Global Stratotype Section and Point) concept by using a point in a physical archive, and, in contrast to the late Anthropocene, includes a significant quantity of anthropogenic strata as evidence for an Anthropocene chronostratigraphic unit.

T2  - Austral Ecology
AB  - The extraction of mineral deposits in ecologically sensitive landscapes can lead to conflicts between mining and conservation interests (Tibbett 2015). Determining any effect of mining operations and how far these impacts spread from a mine site are therefore important issues in assessing the likely ecological impacts of proposed developments. Matsuki et al. (2016) examined the effects of mine-generated dust on plants at two sites in semi-arid Australia: Barrow Island and Windarling Range. They concluded that there was no evidence that dust accumulation on plants caused negative impacts, such as increased mortality. For the Windarling study, however, there are shortcomings in the methods on which this conclusion is based. Indeed, there are data available that clearly show the opposite conclusion: that mine-generated dust at Windarling Range resulted in a substantially higher mortality rate of the threatened perennial shrub Tetratheca paynterae subsp. paynterae (Elaeocarpaceae) between 2004 and 2005.

AB  - The Diavik Waste Rock Project, located in a region of continuous permafrost in northern Canada, includes complementary field and laboratory experiments with the purpose of investigating scale-up techniques for the assessment of the geochemical evolution of mine waste rock at a large scale. As part of the Diavik project, medium-scale field experiments ( similar to 1.5 m high active zone lysimeters) were conducted to assess the long term geochemical evolution and drainage of a low-sulfide waste rock under a relatively simple (i.e. constrained by the container) flow regime while exposed to atmospheric conditions. A conceptual model, including the most significant processes controlling the sulfide-mineral oxidation and weathering of the associated host minerals as observed in a laboratory humidity cell experiment, was developed as part of a previous modelling study. The current study investigated the efficacy of scaling the calibrated humidity cell model to simulate the geochemical evolution of the active zone lysimeter experiments. The humidity cell model was used to simulate the geochemical evolution of low-sulfide waste rock with S content of 0.053 wt.% and 0.035 wt.% (primarily pyrrhotite) in the active zone lysimeter experiments using the reactive transport code MIN3P. Water flow through the lysimeters was simulated using temporally variable infiltration estimated from precipitation measurements made within 200 m of the lysimeters. Flow parameters and physical properties determined during previous studies at Diavik were incorporated into the simulations to reproduce the flow regime. The geochemical evolution of the waste-rock system was simulated by adjustment of the sulfide-mineral content to reflect the values measured at the lysimeters. The temperature dependence of the geochemical system was considered using temperature measurements taken daily, adjacent to the lysimeters, to correct weathering rates according to the Arrhenius equation. The lysimeter simulations indicated that a model developed from simulations of laboratory humidity cell experiments, incorporating detailed representations of temporally variable temperature and water infiltration, can be scaled to provide a reasonable assessment of geochemical evolution of the medium-scale field experiments.

AB  - Parameters of electromagnetic responses (EMRe) generated during uniaxial compression of rock samples under excitation by deterministic acoustic pulses are presented and discussed. Such physical modeling in the laboratory allows to reveal the main regularities of electromagnetic signals (EMS) generation in rock massive. The influence of the samples mechanical properties on the parameters of the EMRe excited by an acoustic signal in the process of uniaxial compression is considered. It has been established that sulfides and quartz in the rocks of the Tashtagol iron ore deposit (Western Siberia, Russia) contribute to the conversion of mechanical energy into the energy of the electromagnetic field, which is expressed in an increase in the EMS amplitude. The decrease in the EMS amplitude when the stress-strain state of the sample changes during the uniaxial compression is observed when the amount of conductive magnetite contained in the rock is increased. The obtained results are important for the physical substantiation of testing methods and monitoring of changes in the stress-strain state of the rock massive by the parameters of electromagnetic signals and the characteristics of electromagnetic emission.

AB  - A large number of economically disadvantaged people live around protected areas. Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: 6-98) want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: 87-96) want to retain or own more livestock over the next 5-10 years. Understanding current and future resource use will help plan context-specific conservation efforts that are better aligned with reducing specific pressures around protected areas.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss and among reptiles has been attributed as a cause of species decline. The negative effect of habitat fragmentation has also been shown to be worse for species that are habitat specialists. The Dunes Sagebrush Lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus Degenhardt and Jones, 1972) is a species that specializes on the shinnery oak (Quercus havardii Rydb.) sand-dune landform of the Mescalero-Monahans Sandhills ecosystem in western Texas and eastern New Mexico, USA. This landform has been fragmented by roads and well pads used for the extraction of oil and gas resources. The effects of fragmentation on the home range and movements of this species can lead to the effective isolation of populations and increased risk of localized extirpations. We showed that home-range size was larger in an unfragmented area and that the mean distance of movements was greater. We also observed that roads in the fragmented areas restricted movements of S. arenicolus. We concluded that roads can be barriers to movements even though only narrow strips of habitat are altered.

AB  - It is difficult to obtain high-grade concentrates for layered minerals, such as graphite, by mineral processing due to the existence of impurities between interlayers. Conventional grinding mills are inefficient in liberating the mineral layers. Upgrading a graphite concentrate by re-grinding with a designed stirred mill is investigated in this paper. Better liberation of mineral layers was achieved, compared with a ball mill and a rod mill. Through re-grinding with the stirred mill followed by a two-stage cleaning flotation process, a low-grade graphite concentrate containing 84.59% fixed carbon could be refined to a high-quality concentrate containing 98.62% fixed carbon with a graphite recovery of 94.15%. It is demonstrated that the stirred mill is more suitable for selective grinding, mineral flake protection and upgrading of layered minerals.

AU  - Van Den Berghe, Martin D.

T2  - Environmental Pollution
AB  - The controls on the mobility and fate of arsenic in lakes impacted by historical gold ore roasting in northern Canada have been examined. A detailed characterization of arsenic solid and aqueous phases in lake waters, lake sediments and sediment porewaters as well as surrounding soils was conducted in three small lakes (<200ha) downwind and within 5 km of the historic mining and roasting operations of Giant Mine (Northwest Territories). These lakes are marked by differing limnological characteristics such as area, depth and organic content. Radiometric age-dating shows that the occurrence of arsenic trioxide in lake sediments coincides with the regional onset of roasting activities. Quantification by advanced electron microscopy shows that arsenic trioxide accounts for up to 6 wt% of the total arsenic in sediments. The bulk (>80 wt%) of arsenic is contained in the form of secondary sulphide precipitates, with iron oxy-hydroxides hosting a minimal amount of arsenic (<1 wt%). Soluble arsenic trioxide particles act as the primary source of arsenic into sediment porewaters. Dissolved arsenic in reducing porewaters both precipitates in-situ as secondary sulphides, and diffuses upwards into the overlying lake waters. Geogenic arsenic phases are present in sediments in low concentrations and are not considered a significant source of arsenic to porewaters or lake waters. Sediment-water interface diffusive flux calculations suggest that the diffusion of dissolved arsenic from porewaters, combined with lake water residence time, are the predominant mechanisms controlling arsenic concentrations in lake waters.

TI  - Early chemical and toxicological risk characterization of inorganic constituents in surface water from the Canadian oil sands first large-scale end pit lake
AU  - White, Kevin B.
AU  - Liber, Karsten
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - End pit lakes (EPLs) have been proposed as a method for the long-term reclamation of process water and fluid fine tailings (FFT) produced from surface mining within the Canadian oil sands. These waste products contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organics, metals, and salts which reduce surface water quality and are toxic to aquatic organisms. This study measured the concentrations of inorganic constituents in surface water from the industry's first large-scale EPL over the course of a three-year period (2014–2016). The toxicological risk was subsequently assessed to identify constituents of concern that may impair surface water quality necessary for the development of a functional aquatic ecosystem or for release to the surrounding environment. Changes in surface water concentrations over the three-year period were strongly correlated with hydrological processes occurring within the lake: advective-diffusive chemical influx from FFT pore water to the overlying surface water was offset by efflux via continuous manual pumping (freshwater in, process water out). These processes resulted in a net dilution effect of approximately 5–10% per year, however, a significant chemical mass is expected to persist within the underlying FFT. Elevated salinity (as Na+, Cl-, HCO 3 -) and concentrations of boron and nickel were predicted to pose very high toxicological risk to aquatic organisms. Despite these risks, the discovery of wild Daphnia pulex in the August 2016 sample suggested that surface water quality was sufficient to support populations of certain salt-tolerant zooplankton and primary producers. However, the time required for development into a robust aquatic ecosystem remains unknown. Highlights • Surface water quality improved slightly over the three-year period (2014–2016). • Attributed to manual freshwater input and process water output resulting in dilution. • As of 2016, most metal concentrations pose negligible risk to aquatic organisms. • Salinity (as Na+, Cl–, and HCO 3 –) is expected to pose a persistent risk for decades. • 2016 surface water quality was able to support a wild Daphnia pulex population.

AB  - Topsoil and grass samples from 14 sites located in different distances from three copper mining factories and a copper smelter were collected in Srednogorie, Bulgaria. The paper discusses results of studies on the mobility of potentially toxic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) from contaminated soils to wild grass Cynodon dactylon in terms of transfer (TF: soil to plant) and phytoavailability (PF: EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)-soluble to plant) factors. Soils located close to mine and smelter factories were heavily contaminated by As and Cu reaching levels up to 500 mg/kg and 2400 mg/kg, respectively for As and Cu. At seven sites arsenic and copper in grass were over the normal levels (1 mg/kg As; 20 mg/kg Cu). The content of Cu in grass averaged 63 mg/kg exceeding the maximum allowable for sheep. Relationship between PF and TF values was found for As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn but not for Mn and Cr. To some extent the soil pH, TOM (total organic matter) and CaCO 3 content are related to the phytoavailability of As, Cd and Cu since for Zn and Pb this relation is attributed to Al- and Fe-content of soil. Statistically significant correlation coefficients were determined between the EDTA-soluble fraction of soil and content in grass in the case of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn and Pb indicating the suitability of the short procedure for phytoavailability studies of those elements. The application of hierarchical cluster analysis and self-organizing maps of Kohonen made it possible to reveal specific hidden relationships between the soil variables and transfer factors as well as between the sampling locations. This additional information helps in more detailed interpretation of phytoavailability and transfer processes in the region of interest. The novelty in this study is achieved by careful consideration of the possibility of using EDTA extracts of the toxic metals in investigating of the phytoavailability and transfer processes soil/plant. Additionally, chemometric expertise used makes it possible to differentiate the behavior of each toxic metal in the processes studied. The combination of easy option for rapid extraction and intelligent data analysis gives a new perspective for contributions in explanation of the complex interactions between soils and plants when assessing pollution events in a certain environment. Graphical abstract fx1 Highlights • Application of soil EDTA extracts in phytoavailability and transfer processes studies. • Chemometric assessment of the soil to grass mobility of potentially toxic elements. • Elucidation of the relationships between basic soil parameters and phytoavailability. • Assessment of the phytoavailable soil fraction of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn and Pb in an industry affected region.

AB  - Field evidence has been scarce about soil (or technosol) formation and direct phytostabilization of base metal mine tailings under field conditions. The present study evaluated key attributes of soil formation in weathered and neutral Cu-Pb-Zn tailings subject to organic amendment (WC: woodchips) and colonization of pioneer native plant species (mixed native woody and grass plant species) in a 2.5-year field trial under subtropical and semi-arid climatic conditions. Key soil indicators of engineered soil formation process were characterized, including organic carbon fractions, aggregation, microbial community and key enzymatic activities. The majority (64–87%) of the OC was stabilized in microaggregate or organo-mineral complexes in the amended tailings. The levels of OC and water soluble OC were elevated by 2–3 folds across the treatments, with the highest level in the treatment of WC and plant colonization (WC+P). Specifically, the WC+P treatment increased the proportion of water stable macroaggregates. Plants further contributed to the N rich organic matter in the tailings, favouring organo-mineral interactions and organic stabilization. Besides, the plants played a major role in boosting microbial biomass and activities in the treated tailings. WC and plants enhanced the contents of organic carbon (OC) associated with aggregates (e.g., physically protected OC), formation of water-stable aggregates (e.g., micro and macroaggregates), chemical buffering capacity (e.g., cation exchange capacity). Microbial community and enzymatic activities were also stimulated in the amended tailings. The present results showed that the formation of functional technosol was initiated in the eco-engineered and weathered Cu-Pb-Zn tailings under field conditions for direct phytostabilization.

AB  - Kobresia grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau comprise the world’s largest pastoral alpine ecosystem. Overgrazing-driven degradation strongly proceeded on this vulnerable grassland, but the mechanisms behind are still unclear. Plants must balance the costs of releasing C to soil against the benefits of accelerated microbial nutrient mineralization, which increases their availability for root uptake. To achieve the effect of grazing on this C-N exchange mechanism, a 15NH4+ field labeling experiment was implemented at grazed and ungrazed sites, with additional treatments of clipping and shading to reduce belowground C input by manipulating photosynthesis. Grazing reduced gross N mineralization rates by 18.7%, similar to shading and clipping. This indicates that shoot removal by grazing decreased belowground C input, thereby suppressing microbial N mining and overall soil N availability. Nevertheless, NH4+ uptake rate by plants at the grazed site was 1.4 times higher than at the ungrazed site, because plants increased N acquisition to meet the high N demands of shoot regrowth (compensatory growth: grazed > ungrazed). To enable efficient N uptake and regrowth, Kobresia plants have developed specific traits (i.e., efficient above-belowground interactions). These traits reflect important mechanisms of resilience and ecosystem stability under long-term moderate grazing in an N-limited environment. However, excessive (over)grazing might imbalance such C-N exchange and amplify plant N limitation, hampering productivity and pasture recovery over the long term. In this context, a reduction in grazing pressure provides a sustainable way to maintain soil fertility, C sequestration, efficient nutrient recycling, and overall ecosystem stability.

AB  - Due to the wide range of uses of water-soluble polymers in commercial products, water contamination by polymers has become a serious environmental concern. Adsorption onto an acidic clay, obtained from Tsunagi mine, Niigata, Japan, of water-soluble polymers from aqueous solutions was investigated as a means of purifying water. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) was used as a sample polymer in an attempt to find optimal conditions for extracting the greatest proportion of polymer from the aqueous solution. The adsorption isotherms at lower equilibrium concentrations were of type L, indicating a strong affinity between the acidic clay and PVP. A larger amount of PVP was adsorbed when a higher-molecularweight PVP (comparison between MWs of 160,000 and 10,000) was used. From the Langmuir equation, the adsorption capacity was calculated as 0.029 g/g clay for the adsorption of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) from an aqueous solution. The adsorption of PVP from a NaCl solution (simulated sea water) was also possible though the amount of adsorption was slightly less than from an aqueous solution. A polymer removal efficiency of >90% was achieved when 200 mg of the acidic clay was added to 50 mL of 0.001 wt.% PVP aqueous solution. The acidic clay was also used for adsorption of poly(ethylene glycol), poly(vinyl alcohol), and polyacrylamide from aqueous solutions.

AB  - Three monogenetic cones in the Baossi–Warack area, Ngaoundéré, Adamawa Plateau forming part of the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) are documented in this study. Basaltic lavas (< 1 km3) scattered around these vents and restricted volcaniclastic deposits were emplaced by Hawaiian and mild strombolian style eruptions. The lavas are porphyritic, mainly composed of olivine (chrysolite) and clinopyroxene (diopside and augite) phenocrysts and plagioclase (andesine) microphenocrysts. Accessory minerals include titano-magnetite and titano-hematite, nepheline, apatite and amphibole xenocrysts. Sanidine occurs in some samples and sodi-potassic albite in others. Some olivines and clinopyroxenes exhibit resorbed margins and thin reaction rims while plagioclase displays oscillatory zoning, and sieved textures as a result of magma mixing. Whole-rock geochemistry data indicates that the lavas are silica-undersaturated, composed of basanites and basalts, showing little compositional variations (SiO2: 39.20 wt.%–48.01 wt.%, MgO: 5.29 wt.%–9.70 wt.%). Trace elements patterns of these lavas suggest they are enriched in LILE including Pb, probably due to crustal contamination. REE patterns suggest cogenetic magmas below Baossi 1 and Baossi 2 volcanoes, and distinct sources below Warack volcano and nearby lavas. The lavas studied show affinity to high-µ (HIMU), enriched type I (EM1) and Oceanic Island Basalt (OIB)-like mantle signatures and thus indicate a heterogeneous mantle source underneath the vents as noted at other monogenetic and polygenetic volcanoes along the CVL. Primary melts derived from low degrees of partial melting (0.5%–2%) and encountered low rates of fractionation, and crustal contamination coupled with magma mixing. These melts evolved independently through structural weaknesses in the basement.

T2  - Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences = Journal Canadien des Sciences Halieutiques et Aquatiques
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are subject to multiple interacting stressors that obscure regulatory mechanisms and reduce the effectiveness of management strategies. Here we estimate the unique and interactive effects of continental climate systems, regional meteorology, river hydrology, and internal lake characteristics on patterns of landscape-scale water quality in six productive lakes within a 52 000 km2 catchment. We quantify variation in mean summer and monthly algal abundance, surface bloom intensity, water clarity, and density of potentially toxic cyanobacteria during 16 years on the Canadian Prairies. Internal lake characteristics best predicted overall water quality change, while climate systems, regional weather, and river hydrology characterized indirect pathways that influenced physicochemical environments. Scenario analysis of future environmental change predicted that atmospheric warming (3-5°C) will have the strongest effect on water quality in these productive lakes, but unexpectedly predicted that even severe industrial water extraction (1% of inflow) will have negligible effects on transparency or algal abundance. Instead, nutrient management represents the only practical means to sustain water quality, although atmospheric and lake warming may override re-oligotrophication of eutrophied sites in future decades.

T2  - Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology
AB  - The upper parts of the floor cumulates of the Skaergaard Intrusion, East Greenland, contain abundant features known as troughs. The troughs are gently plunging synformal structures comprising stacks of crescentic modally graded layers with a sharply defined mafic base that grades upward into plagioclase-rich material. The origin of the troughs and layering is contentious, attributed variously to deposition of mineral grains by magmatic currents descending from the nearby walls, or to in situ development by localised recrystallisation during gravitationally-driven compaction. They are characterised by outcrop-scale features such as mineral lineations parallel to the trough axis, evidence of erosion and layer truncation associated with migration of the trough axis, and disruption of layering by syn-magmatic slumping. A detailed microstructural study of the modal trough layers, using electron backscatter diffraction together with geochemical mapping, demonstrates that these rocks do not record evidence for deformation by either dislocation creep or dissolution–reprecipitation. Instead, the troughs are characterised by the alignment of euhedral plagioclase crystals with unmodified primary igneous compositional zoning. We argue that the lineations and foliations are, therefore, a consequence of grain alignment during magmatic flow. Post-accumulation amplification of the modal layering occurred as a result of differential migration of an unmixed immiscible interstitial liquid, with upwards migration of the Si-rich conjugate into the plagioclase-rich upper part of the layers, whereas the Fe-rich immiscible conjugate remained in the mafic base. Both field and microstructure evidence support the origin of the troughs as the sites of repeated deposition from crystal-rich currents descending from the nearby chamber walls.

T2  - Canadian Geotechnical Journal
AB  - Regulatory policy and regulations in Alberta require oil sands companies to reduce their production and storage of fluid fine tailings by creating deposits that can be reclaimed in a timely manner. To meet the regulatory requirements, some companies are adding flocculants to the fluid fine tailings and then using thickeners, inline flocculation or centrifuges to increase the solids content. Freeze–thaw and drying processes are then used to further dewater the tailings. The effects of flocculating, thickening, and freeze–thaw treatments were investigated by performing large-strain consolidation and shear strength tests on these treated fluid fine tailings. The consolidation and shear strength results were then compared with those of untreated fluid fine tailings. All of the treatments increased the hydraulic conductivity of the fluid fine tailings to some degree, but had little to no effect on the compressibility and shear strength. The effects of the treatment processes are discussed and evaluated.La réglementation et les règlements en vigueur en Alberta exigent que les entreprises de sables bitumineux réduisent leur production et leur entreposage de résidus fins liquides en créant des gisements qui peuvent être récupérés en temps opportun. Pour répondre aux exigences réglementaires, certaines entreprises ajoutent des floculants aux résidus fins fluides, puis utilisent des épaississants, de la floculation en ligne ou des centrifugeuses pour augmenter la teneur en solides. Des procédés de congelation–décongélation et séchage sont ensuite utilisés pour déshydrater davantage les résidus. Les effets des traitements de floculation, d’épaississement et de congelation–décongélation ont été étudiés en effectuant de grands essais de consolidation de la déformation et de résistance au cisaillement sur ces résidus fins fluides traités. Les résultats de la consolidation et de la résistance au cisaillement ont ensuite été comparés à ceux des résidus fins fluides non traités. Tous les traitements ont augmenté la conductivité hydraulique des résidus fins fluides dans une certaine mesure, mais ont eu peu ou pas d’effet sur la compressibilité et la résistance au cisaillement. Les effets des processus de traitement sont discutés et évalués. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

T2  - Canadian Geotechnical Journal
AB  - At tailings storage facilities, a geomembrane may be used to contain tailings from relatively more permeable foundation or embankment materials. A “filter incompatible” condition may arise between the tailings and underliner materials. In this study, the potential for piping erosion of tailings through a 1 cm diameter geomembrane defect was evaluated in a series of physical experiments. The geomembrane defect was sandwiched between silty sand tailings and various underliners (DF15/DB85 = 5.6–13.5) not meeting typical retention criteria for filtration. The leakage rates and visual findings revealed that a critical stress condition existed where erosion occurred continuously for up to 24 h. This stress condition could be encountered during early deposition or development of a reclaim pond at a tailings storage facility. When allowed to occur, erosion during this stress condition resulted in subsequent leakage rates that were 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than previously observed with “filter compatible” conditions and higher stresses. Practitioners unaware of this potential for erosion near the defect may significantly underestimate leakage and underpredict pore pressures within the embankment.Aux installations d’entreposage des résidus, une géomembrane peut être utilisée pour contenir les résidus d’une fondation relativement plus perméable ou de matériaux de remblai. Une condition incompatible avec le filtre peut apparaître entre les résidus et les matériaux de la ligne de fond. Dans cette étude, le potentiel d’érosion de la tuyauterie des résidus à travers un défaut géomembranaire de 1 cm de diamètre a été évalué dans une série d’expériences physiques. Le défaut géomembranaire a été pris en sandwich entre des résidus de sable limoneux et divers revêtements sous-jacents (DF15/DB85 = 5.6–13.5) ne répondant pas aux critères de rétention habituels pour la filtration. Les taux de fuite et les résultats visuels ont révélé qu’il existait une condition de stress critique lorsque l’érosion continuait jusqu’à 24 heures. Cette situation de stress pourrait être rencontrée lors du dépôt précoce ou du développement d’un bassin de récupération dans une installation de stockage des résidus. Lorsque cela se produisait, l’érosion au cours de cette situation de stress entraînait des taux de fuite subséquents de 2 à 3 ordres de grandeur plus élevés que ceux observés précédemment avec des conditions compatibles avec le filtre et des contraintes plus élevées. Les praticiens qui ne sont pas conscients de ce potentiel d’érosion près du défaut peuvent considérablement sous-estimer les fuites et sous-estimer les pressions interstitielles à l’intérieur du remblai.

TI  - Permeability function for oil sands tailings undergoing volume change during drying
AU  - Zhang, Feixia
AU  - Wilson, G. Ward
AU  - Fredlund, D. G.
T2  - Canadian Geotechnical Journal
AB  - The coefficient of permeability function is an important unsaturated soil property required when modeling seepage and contaminant transport phenomena. Inaccuracies in the estimation of the permeability function can lead to significant errors in numerical modeling results. Changes in void ratio and degree of saturation are factors that influence the permeability function. Presently available methodologies for estimating the unsaturated permeability function make the assumption that there is no volume change as soil suction is changed. As a result, volume changes are interpreted as changes in degree of saturation. The commonly used estimation techniques for the permeability function are reasonable for soils such as sands that experience little volume change as soil suction is changed. On the other hand, inaccurate results are generated when soils undergo volume change as is the case with oil sands tailings. Revisions to previous methodologies are proposed to render the estimation of the permeability function more suitable for simulating the drying process associated with soils that undergo high volume changes. The revised methodology independently analyzes the effect of volume changes (i.e., changes in void ratio) and degree of saturation changes (i.e., changes in S-SWCC (degree of saturation - soil-water characteristic curve)). Laboratory data on thickened oil sands tailings are presented and interpreted within the context of the proposed methodology.

AB  - The oil sands (OS) of Alberta, Canada, which are classified as unconventional oil, are the third-largest oil reserves in the world. We describe here a 6-year effort to improve the emissions data used for air quality (AQ) modeling of the roughly 100 km  ×  100 km oil extraction and processing industrial complex operating in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of northeastern Alberta. This paper reviews the national, provincial, and sub-provincial emissions inventories that were available during the three phases of the study, supplemented by hourly SO2 and NOx emissions and stack characteristics for larger point sources measured by a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS), as well as daily reports of SO2 from one AOSR facility for a 1-week period during a 2013 field campaign when the facility experienced upset conditions. Next it describes the creation of several detailed hybrid emissions inventories and the generation of model-ready emissions input files for the Global Environmental Multiscale–Modelling Air quality and CHemistry (GEM-MACH) AQ modeling system that were used during the 2013 field study and for various post-campaign GEM-MACH sensitivity studies, in particular for a high-resolution model domain with 2.5 km grid spacing covering much of western Canada and centered over the AOSR. Lastly, it compares inventory-based bottom-up emissions with aircraft-observation-based top-down emissions estimates. Results show that emissions values obtained from different data sources can differ significantly, such as a possible 10-fold difference in PM2.5 emissions and approximately 40 and 20 % differences for total VOC (volatile organic compound) and SO2 emissions. A novel emissions-processing approach was also employed to allocate emissions spatially within six large AOSR mining facilities in order to address the urban-scale spatial extent of the facilities and the high-resolution 2.5 km model grid. Gridded facility- and process-specific spatial surrogate fields that were generated using spatial information from GIS (geographic information system) shapefiles and satellite images were used to allocate non-smokestack emissions for each facility to multiple grid cells instead of treating these emissions as point sources and allocating them to a single grid cell as is normally done. Facility- and process-specific temporal profiles and VOC speciation profiles were also developed. The pre-2013 vegetation and land-use databases normally used to estimate biogenic emissions and meteorological surface properties were modified to account for the rapid change in land use in the study area due to marked, year-by-year changes in surface mining activities, including the 2013 opening of a new mine. Lastly, mercury emissions data were also processed in addition to the seven criteria-air-contaminant (CAC) species (NOx, VOC, SO2, NH3, CO, PM2.5, and PM10) to support AOSR mercury modeling activities. Six GEM-MACH modeling papers in this special issue used some of these new sets of emissions and land-use input files.

AB  - In recent years, rockbursts have occurred frequently during the mining of thick coal seams in China. Use of the top-coal caving or slicing mining method to extract these thick seams may result in distinct geomechanical responses in the strata and, in turn, the pattern of rockburst occurrence around longwall layouts. To establish a thorough understanding of which method (caving or slicing) is better when it comes to preventing rockbursts during the extraction process, a suite of in situ rockburst measurements was conducted. Six typical rockburst-prone collieries were monitored during which a total of 110 rockburst events occurred. Numerical modelling was used to help interpret the observations. Here, we focus on the analysis of these field observations and the numerical simulations employed to develop a conceptual model for rockburst occurrence during caving mining of thick coal seams. We find that caving mining has a certain rockburst-reducing effect in that the method significantly decreases, or even avoids, the occurrence of rockbursts at coalfaces. Moreover, it reduces the scope of the damage likely to be incurred and the severity and frequency of rockbursting. According to the conceptual model, the rockburst-prone area during caving mining is generally the roadway section located a certain distance ahead of the coalface. This distance, which is roughly 10–54 m, is consistent with the rockburst damage observed on site (mostly 10–50 m ahead of the coalface). This rockburst pattern arises because caving mining results in reduced stress concentration, less bottom coal being retained, and wider-ranging fracture zones around the mine openings, especially ahead of the coalface. This makes the rock surrounding the mine openings less likely to accumulate high levels of elastic energy that need releasing and hence it is more difficult to induce rockbursting. Therefore, it is recommended that the top-coal caving method should be the preferred method of extraction when mining coal seams of a certain thickness.Au cours des dernières années, des éboulements ont fréquemment eu lieu pendant l’extraction minière de couches de charbon épaisses en Chine. L’utilisation de la spéléologie de charbon supérieur ou la méthode d’exploitation par tranchage pour extraire ces couches épaisses peut donner lieu à des réponses distinctes dans les strates géomécaniques et, à son tour, la tendance de l’occurrence d’éboulements autour des emplacements de longue paroi. Afin d’établir une compréhension approfondie de quelle méthode (spéléo ou tranchage) est mieux quand il s’agit de prévenir les éboulements au cours du processus d’extraction, une suite de mesures d’éboulements in situ a été effectuée. Six colliers sujets à des éboulements typiques ont été suivis dont on a connu un total de 110 événements d’éboulements. La modélisation numérique est utilisée pour aider à interpréter les observations. Ici, nous nous concentrons sur l’analyse de ces observations sur le terrain et les simulations numériques utilisées pour développer un modèle conceptuel pour l’occurrence d’éboulements pendant l’exploitation minière de spéléologie de charbon épais. Nous constatons que la spéléologie minière a un certain effet sur les éboulements et que la méthode diminue considérablement, voire éviter, l’apparition d’éboulements sur le terrain. En outre, il réduit l’étendue des dégâts qui pourraient éventuellement souffrir et la gravité et la fréquence d’éboulements. Selon le modèle conceptuel, la zone sujette à des éboulements au cours de l’exploration par spéléologie est généralement la section de chaussée située à une certaine distance sur le terrain. Cette distance, qui est à peu près 10–54 m, est compatible avec les dommages d’éboulements constatés sur le site (plus souvent 10–50 m sur le terrain). Ce modèle d’éboulements surgit, car l’exploitation par spéléologie aboutit à une concentration de contrainte réduite, et de zones de f acture plus élargies, moins de charbon de fond étant conservé, et une plus large zone de fractures autour des ouvertures de la mine, surtout en avant du terrain. Cela rend la roche entourant les ouvertures de la mine moins susceptibles d’accumuler des niveaux élevés d’énergie élastique qui doivent se libérer et c’est pourquoi il est plus difficile à induire des éboulements. Par conséquent, il est recommandé que la méthode spéléologie de charbon supérieur devrait être la méthode préférée d’extraction lors de l’extraction de couches de charbon d’une certaine épaisseur.
