AB  - The climate justice movement seeks to provide relief to vulnerable communities that have been disproportionately affected by climate change impacts. Public nuisance litigation for climate change impacts is a new and growing field that could provide the legal and policy underpinnings to help secure a viable foundation for climate justice in the United States and internationally. By securing victories in the court system, these suits may succeed where the domestic environmental justice movement failed in seeking to merge environmental protection and human rights concerns into an actionable legal theory. This Article first examines the nature and scope of the climate change impacts that are affecting vulnerable populations throughout the world. It then traces the evolution of public nuisance claims for climate change impacts, discusses the Native Village of Kivalina v. Exxon Mobil Corp. case as a turning point in the evolution of these claims, and considers what obstacles remain on the path toward success for Kivalina and similar suits in the United States and abroad. The Kivalina case involves the right set of facts and legal theories to afford a remedy to victims who are disproportionately affected by climate change. Ultimately, the Kivalina litigation could help to institutionalize climate justice claims as part of the post-Kyoto Protocol framework by recognizing a private right to be free from climate change impacts that threaten the sustainability of vulnerable communities.

AB  - There is an increased interest in including green roofs in building legislation to enable green infrastructure and improve the built environments. Yet, trees on buildings in particular, have received little attention. This paper presents a parametric study on the effect of nine green roof configurations on outdoor and indoor temperatures and the associated cooling demand under three urban densities by coupling ENVI-met and EnergyPlus simulation software. This study is novel as it introduces the performance of green roof configurations that include canopy trees and compares their performance with typical green roofs that include only low canopy vegetation. Results show that 1) green roof performance has a greater impact on reducing indoor rather than outdoor temperatures; 2) green roofs with trees perform better compared with green roof configurations without trees, reducing the indoor temperature by up to 7.20 degrees C and air conditioning electric loads by 60%; 3) green roofs with trees excel in thermal performance compared with typical green roofs, even if the latter have a higher green coverage percentage. Therefore, the authors recommend using green roof performance for green building rating and legislation instead of using green coverage percentage. Furthermore, as green roof performance varies with urban density and building type, the authors suggest specifying the most appropriate green roof configuration for each neighbourhood in smart city models to maximise the benefits and address the city's needs.

AB  - Southeast Texas is home to some of the largest refineries in the United States. During Hurricane Harvey, emergency shutdowns took place. In this exploratory investigation, we examine how government air monitors performed in measuring air quality in Beaumont, Texas during and in the months following Hurricane Harvey. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) data from two active air monitors in Beaumont, Texas were analyzed during the year 2017-2018. Concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), ozone, benzene, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were investigated. The number of hours and days no data were reported by air monitors were also investigated. Yearly maximum values (MAX, all in parts per billion (ppb)) in 2017 for SO2, NO, and NOx (53.7, 113.4, 134, respectively) and their respective standard deviations (SD: 1.3, 3.4, and 14) were higher as compared to 2018 (MAX, all in ppb and (SD) = 40.9, (1.4); 103.9, (3.3); 123.8, (14), respectively). The data capture rate for these chemicals were between 88 and 97% in both years. During the months following Hurricane Harvey (August-December 2017) there was an increase in most maximum values. The yearly averages for H2S were 0.68 ppb (SD 1.02) in 2017 and 0.53 ppb (SD 1.07) in 2018. Missing days were observed for both the H2S and NOx air monitors, with the highest number observed in 2017 (213 missing days) for the air monitor measuring H2S. We identified that residents of Beaumont, Texas are exposed daily to low-level concentrations of air pollutants. H2S is released each day at a level high enough to be smelled. Data capture rates for air monitors are not always above 90%. Improved air quality data and disaster preparations are needed in Beaumont, Texas.

AB  - The science of resilience suggests that urban systems become resilient when they promote progressive transformative change to social and physical infrastructure. But resilience is challenged by global environmental risks and by social and economic trends that create inequality and exclusion. Here we argue that distortionary inequality and precarity undermine social processes that give access to public infrastructure and ecosystems thereby undermining urban resilience. We illustrate how inequality and precarity undermine resilience with reference to social exclusion and insecurity in growing urban settlements in the Asia-Pacific region. Inequality and exposure to environmental risks represent major challenges for governance that can be best overcome through inclusion and giving voice to marginalised populations.

AB  - Structural causes of vulnerability to hazards are well established in geographical research. But what facilitates individual adaptive behavior? How does the performance of government intervention affect such behavior? Drawing on political economy, environmental psychology, and climate justice perspectives, we explore how perceived fairness of responses to weather-related extreme events affects the public and private distribution of responsibility and action. We focus on flood risk and examine how perceptions of fairness of response by residents in flood-affected areas, along with their prior experience of flooding and perceptions of scope of government responsibility and capacity, affect willingness to take individual adaptive action. We use data from surveys of 356 households affected by a flood event in November 2009 in Cumbria, UK, and Galway, Ireland, to compare perceptions of fairness of responses and private intentions across two political jurisdictions. We find that aspects of fairness are related to willingness to take adaptive action but vary with context, experience, and knowledge of flooding. In Cumbria, where there is greater experience of flooding, willingness to act correlates with procedural justice, risk knowledge, and capacity. Capacity for flood management in Galway is firmly associated with state agencies, whereas in Cumbria it is perceived to result from responsibilities of public and private action. These findings highlight the central role of government action and its perceived fairness in structuring private responses to environmental risks and point to the crucial role of climate justice perspectives in navigating adaptation.

AB  - There is increasing understanding, globally, that climate change and increased pollution will have a profound and mostly harmful effect on human health. This review brings together international experts to describe both the direct (such as heat waves) and indirect (such as vector-borne disease incidence) health impacts of climate change. These impacts vary depending on vulnerability (i.e., existing diseases) and the international, economic, political, and environmental context. This unique review also expands on these issues to address a third category of potential longer-term impacts on global health: famine, population dislocation, and environmental justice and education. This scholarly resource explores these issues fully, linking them to global health in urban and rural settings in developed and developing countries. The review finishes with a practical discussion of action that health professionals around the world in our field can yet take.

AB  - The region of Campania in Southern Italy features high levels of socio-economic deprivation and low levels of environmental quality. A vast strand of the scientific literature has tried to verify whether poor environmental quality and widespread socio-economic deprivation might explain the high cancer mortality rates (CMRs) observed, especially in the municipalities - infamously labelled as the 'Land of Fires' - that were hit most severely by the crisis. While some studies managed to identify links between these two confounding factors and cancer mortality, the evidence is overall mixed. Interesting information may be drawn from the observation of municipal data: in spite of previous claims, some municipalities featuring high environmental quality and low socio-economic deprivation also display high CMRs, while other Campanian municipalities facing disastrous environmental and socio-economic conditions are characterised by low CMRs. These figures, in contrast to common sentiment and previous studies, need to be investigated thoroughly in order to assess the exact role of the confounding factors. In this work, we aim to identify the municipalities where confounding factors act as driving forces in the determination of high CMRs through an original multi-step analysis based on frequentist and Bayesian analysis. Pinpointing these municipalities could allow policymakers to design targeted and effective policy measures aimed at reducing cancer mortality.

AB  - Their ability to absorb substantial capital makes hydropower dams attractive projects for the "wall of money." Although global webs of dynamic financial flows enable megaspatial transformations with huge temporal impacts, their opacity and fragmentation obfuscate possibilities for democratic decision making and accountability. This paper explores the question whether the interest in renewables and the ability of large infrastructure to absorb capital has changed the role of large dams as instruments of political, financial, and territorial power. An analytical framework inspired by Lefebvre's concept of "production of space" is used to examine the structural and context-specific dimensions of current hydropower development. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to an alternative conception of the landscape in which the myopic focus on capital accumulation is replaced with social and environmental justice.

AB  - The retreat of urban populations as an adaptation strategy has the potential to protect people, businesses, and infrastructure from the severe impacts of climate change. However, it can also lead to the unjust dislocation of the urban poor whose contributions to climate change are negligible but whose exposure to climatic risk is high. These groups of people also have little say in the decision-making about whether to retreat, when and how, thus raising concerns about equity and justice. In this paper, I examine the policy and practice of managed retreat and its environmental justice dimensions in Manila (Philippines) and Lagos (Nigeria) from 2010 to 2018. Expert interviews, focus group discussions, and policy documents were collected and analyzed for both cities. Findings reveal a complex picture of contradictions. In Lagos, retreat was stated in climate change policy but in practice only the urban poor were forcibly removed from waterfront areas and in their place new urban development projects are being constructed. In Manila, retreat was not mentioned in policy but evidence indicates informal settlers and national government offices were the target of planned retreat. Unlike Lagos, the urban poor in Manila were offered a mortgaged pathway to homeownership outside the city. However, the lack of livelihood opportunities in relocation sites engendered a cycle of retreat and return. This study further discusses how climatic uncertainties, property values, government distrust, utopian imaginaries, and environmental injustices served as barriers to managed retreat in both cities. The paper concludes with a call for an environmentally and socially just approach to retreat. It argues that the rights of the urban poor to the city must be taken into consideration even under complex climatic and socio-ecological disruptions.

AB  - Some of the best-known social scientific theories of risks are those that have been elaborated by Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck. Although their arguments differ greatly, they agree in seeing the technologically induced risks of today's "Risk Society" as global-so pervasive that they transcend all socioeconomic as well as geopolitical and national boundaries. Most empirical work, however, provides greater support for a theoretical tradition exemplified by Short and Erikson. In this paper, we argue that many of the technological mega-risks described by Giddens and Beck as "transcending" social boundaries are better described as "Titanic risks," referring not so much to their colossal impact as to the fact that-as was the case for the majority of the victims on the Titanic-actual risks are related to victims' socioeconomic as well as sociogeographic locations. Previous research has shown this to be the case with high-risk technologies, such as nuclear energy and weaponry, and also with localized ones, such as toxic waste disposal. This article illustrates that the same is true even for the most genuinely "global" risks of all, namely those associated with global climate disruption.

In the first part, the paper presents a review of the literature on key concepts and perspectives related to participatory citizen science, introducing the concept of the "right to research". It highlights the mutual fertilization with participatory mapping methods to deal with disaster situations associated to climate change. In the second part, the paper describes and presents the results and conclusions of an action-research developed on the coastline between the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2017-2018. It involved affected communities as protagonists in mapping and managing risks of natural disasters caused by extreme climate events, by combining citizen science approaches and methods with Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) and social cartography. The article concludes by pointing out the contributions and limits of the "right to research" as a relevant Social Science approach to reframe citizen science from a democratic view.

AB  - The substantial health, social, and economic costs borne by rural, low-income, and minority communities because of their differential exposure to environmental hazards is being increasingly acknowledged. For decades, these groups have been the the victims of a variety of activities and policies that have placed them at a substantial risk to their health and quality of life. Recently, many of these policies have come under increasing criticism by an emerging environmental justice movement-a movement that promises to be one of the strongest forces for environmental reform to appear in recent years. It is argued that questions of justice and equity in environmental decision making are deserving of increased attention by the research community. A number of questions that can guide such a research agenda are identified.

AB  - The CalEnviroScreen created by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, Sacramento, USA, is a place-based dataset developed to measure environmental and social indicators that are theorized to have cumulative health impacts on populations. The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which the composite scores of the CalEnviroScreen tool are associated with pediatric asthma hospitalization. This was a retrospective analysis of California hospital discharge data from 2010 to 2012. Children who were hospitalized for asthma-related conditions, were aged 0-14 years, and resided in California were included in analysis. Rates of hospitalization for asthma-related conditions among children residing in California were calculated. Poisson multilevel modeling was used to account for individual- and neighborhood-level risk factors. Every unit increase in the CalEnviroScreen Score was associated with an increase of 1.6% above the mean rate of pediatric asthma hospitalizations (rate ratio (RR) = 1.016, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.014-1.018). Every unit increase in racial/ethnic segregation and diesel particulate matter was associated with an increase of 1.1% and 0.2% above the mean rate of pediatric asthma, respectively (RR = 1.011, 95% CI = 1.010-1.013; RR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.001-1.004). The CalEnviroScreen is a unique tool that combines socioecological factors and environmental indicators to identify vulnerable communities with major health disparities, including pediatric asthma hospital use. Future research should identify mediating factors that contribute to community-level health disparities.

AB  - The California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) Environmental Justice Action Plan calls for guidelines for evaluating "cumulative impacts." As a first step toward such guidelines, a screening methodology for assessing cumulative impacts in communities was developed. The method, presented here, is based on the working definition of cumulative impacts adopted by Cal/EPA [1]: "Cumulative impacts means exposures, public health or environmental effects from the combined emissions and discharges in a geographic area, including environmental pollution from all sources, whether single or multi-media, routinely, accidentally, or otherwise released. Impacts will take into account sensitive populations and socio-economic factors, where applicable and to the extent data are available." The screening methodology is built on this definition as well as current scientific understanding of environmental pollution and its adverse impacts on health, including the influence of both intrinsic, biological factors and non-intrinsic socioeconomic factors in mediating the effects of pollutant exposures. It addresses disparities in the distribution of pollution and health outcomes. The methodology provides a science-based tool to screen places for relative cumulative impacts, incorporating both the pollution burden on a community- including exposures to pollutants, their public health and environmental effects- and community characteristics, specifically sensitivity and socioeconomic factors. The screening methodology provides relative rankings to distinguish more highly impacted communities from less impacted ones. It may also help identify which factors are the greatest contributors to a community's cumulative impact. It is not designed to provide quantitative estimates of community-level health impacts. A pilot screening analysis is presented here to illustrate the application of this methodology. Once guidelines are adopted, the methodology can serve as a screening tool to help Cal/EPA programs prioritize their activities and target those communities with the greatest cumulative impacts.

AB  - Some U.S.-based park equity studies reveal that affluent and White neighborhoods have privileged access to greenspace. In such studies in the U.S. and elsewhere, park access indicators are typically examined in relation to measures of income, housing tenure, and broad race/ethnicity categories (e.g., Hispanic/Latino, Black, and White in the U.S.). The treatment of people as monolithic ethnic groups in park equity research is potentially misleading, particularly in global cities where ethnic populations are highly heterogeneous. In this study, we assess inequities in access to park space within the diverse Hispanic/Latino population of the Miami Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) based on national origin. We specified multivariable generalized estimating equations to examine social correlates of area-weighted park access at the census tract level. Our first model includes a variable for the proportion of the tract population of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, which we substitute in the second model with variables representing the proportions of the tract population from the most populous country-of-origin groups in the MSA applicable to the Hispanic/Latino population. Our first model indicates robust negative relationships for the proportion Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American variables with area-weighted park access, adjusting for median household income, renter-occupancy, and old and young population composition. Our second model indicates negative relationships based on Cuban and Venezuelan neighborhood composition, while the four other country-of-origin subgroup variables exhibit statistically non-significant associations with area-weighted park access. Study findings have implications for the analysis of ethnicity categories in park equity research and interventions to promote park equity, especially in global cities.

AB  - The Paris Agreement contains a separate article for loss and damage - an outcome that aligns with a central demand of many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) at COP21. By shifting to a justice framing of loss and damage, NGOs were able to expand their mobilization and, in turn, enhance their influence. While it is not claimed that NGO advocacy was sufficient to produce the outcome, pathways by which issue framing can support increased NGO influence via persuasion and coercion are illustrated. First, the justice frame garnered additional media attention and raised the stakes should states fail to include the issue in the Paris Agreement. Second, the climate justice frame helped forge alliances with vulnerable countries and within civil society that enhanced bargaining. The findings contribute to theory building in NGO politics, connecting framing shifts to important outcomes in the global governance of climate change.

AB  - The quantity of urban forests in cities is critical for biodiversity conservation and human health, and is known to be distributed unequally. Increasingly, the quality of urban forests are also being recognised as shaping the benefits they provide. Previous studies and reviews have demonstrated that the quality of urban green spaces is associated with patterns of inequality as measured by socio-economic status and race (in the U.S). This study extends this body of knowledge to urban forests by systematically reviewing the urban forest literature (that explicitly study the urban forest) exploring the relationship between urban forest quality and both socio-economic status and race. Two academic databases (SCOPUS and Web of Science) were systematically searched. A total of 2012 papers were screened and 21 articles were included in this study. Almost all studies (20/21) found evidence of inequality, with at least one significant association between measures of urban forest quality and socio-economic status or race. However, 6 studies found contrasting patterns, with lower socio-economic status areas having higher urban forest quality. There was variation in the type of 'urban forest' studied, and variation in the ways both urban forest quality and socio-economic status were measured, making inter-study comparisons difficult. Interestingly, the literature was geographically diverse, and future research could continue to focus on countries in Africa, South America and Asia with diverse needs for and uses of urban forests. In conclusion, this review finds evidence for inequity in the distribution of urban forest quality. Future research that more clearly describes the urban forests being studied and that explores sociocultural variation in perceived quality would allow better generalisation and understanding of forest quality patterns.

AB  - The average temperature in Alaska and the North American Arctic has risen at twice the rate of the global average due to climate change, causing changes to the natural environment that affect the physical, social, and emotional well-being of people and communities. Social workers must be prepared to respond. Using a non-probability, convenience sample, this study surveyed 159 social workers in Alaska to assess their attitudes and their perceptions of the effects of climate change on their clients and constituents. Results indicate that social workers in Alaska believe that climate change is happening, that human activities are responsible, and that it is a large threat to people in Alaska. Over 75% believe that climate change is dangerous for their clients now or will be dangerous in 10 years. Social workers report that in the past year their clients or constituents have experienced multiple climate change-related problems with community infrastructure, health, and mental health.

AB  - Rubber surfacing is often used in playgrounds due to its potential injury prevention benefits and as a way to recycle waste tires. Available research on chemicals in recycled rubber has focused on synthetic turf applications, but is limited for playground rubber surfacing. Potential lead contamination from vulcanizing agents used in rubber surfacing are a possible concern; however this has not been researched. We examined levels of lead in poured-in-place rubber and compared them to levels in soil, sand, and wood mulch materials from 28 randomly selected playgrounds in Boston, MA, USA using X-ray fluorescence. To evaluate the association between material type and lead concentrations, we conducted a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and built a linear regression model controlling for distance to major roadway, neighborhood-level status as an environmental justice area, peeling paint on the playground, and rubber condition. Average lead levels were 65.7 mu g/g for soil, 22.0 mu g/g for rubber, 8.5 mu g/g for sand, and 9.0 mu g/g for mulch. Our finding of lower concentrations of lead in sand and mulch compared to rubber and soil should be used to inform playground design to optimize children's health, alongside other chemical and safety considerations.

AB  - Samir Amin's final essay called for the creation of a new international organization of progressive social forces. Here I review evidence from twenty-first century transnational movements germane for understanding the likelihood of the emergence of such an international organization and the issues and sectors most likely to facilitate coalitional unity. More specifically, the ecological crises identified by Amin in the form of global warming and climate change have created an unprecedented global environmental threat capable of unifying diverse social strata across the planet. The climate justice movement has already established a global infrastructure and template to coordinate a new international organization for confronting neoliberal forms of globalization. Pre-existing movement organizing around environmental racism, climate justice in the global South, and recent intersectional mobilizations serve as promising models for building an enduring international organization that will represent subaltern groups and have a substantial impact on world politics.

AB  - The term 'built environment' garnered a lot of attention in the last few decades for making the link between community design and health impacts. It also highlighted how access to green spaces, which has been correlated with positive public health outcomes, is disproportionately unavailable to Latinx communities. With the renaissance of the term Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), it is fitting to examine the literature through a term that aims at identifying the etiology of this multi-faceted environmental justice issue. We conducted a review of the literature associated with NDD along with surrogate terms to understand the scope of its usage and applicability, as well as to examine NDD through an equity lens. We performed two searches, one focused on NDD and one on green spaces in Latinx communities to identify the research that has investigated green spaces through an equity perspective. We found that there is a dearth of primary research on the topic. This was best illustrated by the difficulty in finding articles on PubMed that explicitly mention NDD in Latinx communities. A strong body of research exists that indicates adequate access to greenspace is associated with many health benefits. However, future research efforts should focus on evaluating the health implications of NDD on Latinx communities so that this public health issue can be addressed head-on.

AB  - Several state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the United States are considering environmental issues in the early stages of the transportation planning process, recognizing that there are benefits to be gained from better decisions, reduced public controversy, and shortened times to project implementation. This paper examines the current practice of such consideration, with special emphasis on best case examples. The study was conducted through a literature review, a survey of state DOTs and MPOs, and the identification of best case examples. The findings indicate the emergence, both in the literature and in practice, of more formal recognition of the need to consider environmental factors earlier in the planning process. State DOTs and MPOs agree that air quality, land use, socio-economic, environmental justice, and community cohesion impacts are of greatest concern today, and will be so in 10 years. Different approaches for considering environmental factors in planning include scenario analysis, environmental analysis of plans, environmental performance measures, consideration of equity issues, new data and analysis tools, and innovative institutional partnerships.

AB  - The creation of the protected areas (PAs) of restricted use dominates conservation policies throughout the world and reflects the western idea of separation between pristine nature and human-modified habitats. However, this conservation strategy has caused the proliferation of environmental conflicts involving territorial rights of traditional peoples and local communities throughout the world. Our study aims to analyze the impacts of the creation of a system of PAs of restricted use on the livelihoods and well-being of traditional communities in the north of Minas Gerais State, in Brazil. We analyzed the conflicts emerging in the study region from the perspective of the environmental justice paradigm. We used the extended-case method, conducting fieldwork to observe and register the movements of social resistance of traditional communities, and interviews with key stakeholders. Between 1970-1990, the Jaiba irrigation project was implemented in the north of Minas Gerais and, to compensate for the huge environmental impact of the project, several PAs of restricted use were created, disregarding the traditional peoples that inhabited the region. As a consequence, these populations were expelled from their territories without compensation or resettlement, causing severe restrictions to their traditional livelihoods and well-being, including access to natural resources such as water, fisheries and timber, and nontimber products, jeopardizing their food security, cultural identity, and social integrity. They initiated the "Movement of the People Cornered by Parks," lately evolving to "Vazanteiros in Movement," incorporating elements of the environmental arena to politically dispute alternative conservation projects. Sustainable development policies that incorporate the " economy of repair," expressed as environmental compensation strategies, are intrinsically contradictory and inappropriate from the perspective of environmental justice. Inclusive conservation planning must account for historical, social, and cultural contexts of the affected region and prioritize the preservation of rights and well-being of local communities.

AB  - The circumstances under which different ecosystem service benefits can be realized differ. The benefits tend to be coproduced and to be enabled by multiple interacting social, ecological, and technological factors, which is particularly evident in cities. As many cities are undergoing rapid change, these factors need to be better understood and accounted for, especially for those most in need of benefits. We propose a framework of three systemic filters that affect the flow of ecosystem service benefits: the interactions among green, blue, and built infrastructures; the regulatory power and governance of institutions; and people's individual and shared perceptions and values. We argue that more fully connecting green and blue infrastructure to its urban systems context and highlighting dynamic interactions among the three filters are key to understanding how and why ecosystem services have variable distribution, continuing inequities in who benefits, and the long-term resilience of the flows of benefits.

We can imagine how to achieve two of the goals prosperity, justice, and sustainability, but only at the expense of the third. What are the implications of international trade in such a world? The chapter considers the standard view as well as arguments about unequal and unsustainable trade. Since international trade may amplify and blur the overexploitation of natural resources the consequences may be fatal in a world that is both unequal and full.

AB  - Supported by a large body of scholarship, it is increasingly orthodox practice for cities to deploy urban greening interventions to address diverse socioenvironmental challenges, from protecting urban ecosystems to enhancing built environments and climate resilience or improving health outcomes. In this article, we expand the theoretical boundaries used to challenge this growing orthodoxy by laying out a nuanced framework that advances critical urban environmental justice scholarship. Beginning from the now well-supported assumption that urban greening is a deeply political project often framed by technocratic principles and promotional claims that this project will result in more just and prosperous cities, we identify existing contributions and limits when examining urban green inequities through the traditional lenses of distributional, recognition, and procedural justice. We then advocate for and lay out a different analytical framework for analyzing justice in urban greening. We argue that new research must uncover how persistent domination and subordination prevent green interventions from becoming an emancipatory antisubordination, intersectional, and relational project that considers the needs, identities, and everyday lives of marginalized groups. Finally, we illustrate our framework's usefulness by applying it to the analysis of urban residents' (lack of) access to urban greening and by operationalizing it for two different planning and policy domains: (1) greening for well-being, care, and health and (2) greening for recreation and play. This final analysis serves to provide critical questions and strategies that can hopefully guide new urban green planning and practice approaches.

AB  - Scholars in urban political ecology, urban geography, and planning have suggested that urban greening interventions can create elite enclaves of environmental privilege and green gentrification, and exclude lower-income and minority residents from their benefits. Yet, much remains to be understood in regard to the magnitude, scope, and manifestations of green gentrification and the forms of contestation and resistance articulated against it. In this paper, we propose new questions, theoretical approaches, and research design approaches to examine the socio-spatial dynamics and ramifications of green gentrification and parse out why, how, where, and when green gentrification takes place.

AB  - The state of Massachusetts enacted the Toxic Use Reduction Act (TURA) in 1989. The law requires that users of toxic chemicals evaluate and plan for pollution prevention. Data indicate that shipment of toxic chemicals as product have been reduced by over 30 % and that releases of toxics have declined over 80% during the first ten years of reporting. Analysis of the data for several chemicals designated as "carcinogens" based on their potential negative environmental and human health effects was conducted. These chemicals include arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, and lead compounds. Communities were grouped as low, medium-low, medium-high, and high income levels as determined by the respective communities' median income from census data for the year 2000. The results indicate that usage is disproportionate throughout the state when grouped by income level. The need for chemical policies and procedures such as the TURA in growing urban centers will be discussed. Further, recommendations to ensure that there are not a disproportionate share of toxics usage, storage, and emissions in localized settings will be presented. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier BV

The study also proposes harmonious environmental passion as a moderator of the relationship between spiritual leadership and OCBE. The proposed relationships were tested using time-lagged survey data from 337 supervisor-employee dyads in 41 Chinese firms. We found that spiritual leadership is positively associated with OCBE, both directly and indirectly, via environmental justice orientation. Interestingly, the results revealed that the direct association of spiritual leadership with OCBE was contingent on harmonious environmental passion. Our findings offer important implications that can help managers make appropriate interventions to reduce organizations' carbon footprint.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to show that bringing together legal science and other sciences in integrated valuation of ecosystem services can contribute for environmental justice and ensure fair and acceptable answers to complex real life questions. Legal science provides the teleological framework necessary to prevent ethical deadlocks. To this end, different forms of environmental justice are addressed. Distributive justice, commutative justice, retributive justice, restorative justice and procedural justice are five types of environmental justice, the content of which is explained using illustrative examples of environmental "injustices". Next, these justice forms are applied to fourteen wicked legal questions, covering both public and private law, both international and national law, is presented. The questions demonstrate how Integrated Ecosystem Services valuation can be used to address societal challenges related to humanitarian protection, State responsibility, ecological damage, access to natural resources, use of economic instruments for environmental protection, effective environmental sanctioning, access to information, etc. This paper confirms the potential uses of integrated valuation of ecosystem services in the pursuit of social and environmental goals when legal science and other natural and social sciences are brought together to operationalize ecosystem services.

AB  - STS and social movement scholars have shown the importance of 'getting undone science done' to advance the goals of social movements fighting environmental health injustice. The production and mobilization of counter-expertise, meaning the reliance on expertise, broadly construed, to contest regulatory decisions based on scientific knowledge, must be further analyzed by differentiating among types of expertise and strategies to mobilize them. In social mobilization against the unrestricted use of pesticides in Argentina, the affected community in Ituzaingo Anexo developed three types of expertise. The community first drew upon its own local knowledge of cases of illness and, as lay people, produced the first epidemiological map of this area. Then, they enrolled scientists and NGOs as allies to jointly learn about pesticide contamination as an explanation for illness. The enlisted scientists produced new knowledge by conducting environmental and epidemiological studies. Finally, sympathetic public health authorities, legal experts, and a district attorney designed a successful legal strategy to stop fumigations in that area and enforce local regulations. The case confirms the importance of producing undone science, and shows that its effectiveness can be explained by intertwined strategies deployed by a triad of lay/local, scientific, and legal experts to overcome the expertise barrier.

AB  - The accelerated growth of cities in developing countries poses a challenge for urban planning such as guaranteeing the safety of all inhabitants from natural and anthropogenic threats. The objective of this study is to determine the urban areas and social sectors of three medium sized Mexican cities that are exposed to high risk activities. The results indicate that for the metropolitan area of San Luis Potosi, 57.6% of high risk activities are within the urban sprawl, while 100% are in the cities of Zacatecas and Fresnillo. In all three case studies, most of the activities studied are in areas with low and medium rates of marginalization. In San Luis Potosi, 4.1% are in areas with high and very high population density but none of the case studies showed a conglomeration of these types of risks in a determined area of the cities. A database of companies with high risk activities, regulated at a federal level, public became public in Mexico in 2014. This information is of great value at a local level to define the strategies of land use planning that guarantee access to environmental justice as well as effective prevention strategies and responses to chemical emergencies.

AB  - The consequences of agricultural pesticide exposure continue to be major environmental health problems in rural communities. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an important approach to redressing health disparities resulting from environmental causes. In this article we introduce a collection of articles that describe projects using CBPR to address the health disparities resulting from pesticide exposure in agricultural communities, particularly the communities of migrant and seasonal farmworkers. The articles in this collection are based on a workshop convened at the 1999 American Public Health Association meeting. The goals in presenting this collection are to provide those endeavoring to initiate CBPR projects needed information, guidelines, and procedures to improve the quality of the CBPR experience; to increase the scientific validity of CBPR projects; and to reduce the potential difficulties and stress of these collaborations. In this introduction we discuss the context in which these projects operate, summarizing background information about farmworkers in the United States, what is known about farmworker pesticide exposure, and the concept of community-based participatory research. Finally, the articles in this collection are summarized, and major themes common to successful CBPR projects are identified. These common features are taking the time to interact with the community, using multiple approaches to engage the different parts of the community, understanding different participants often have different goals, appreciating each group's strengths, valuing community knowledge, and being flexible and creative in conducting research. The final article in this collection describes the translational research program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) highlighting activities pertinent to the health of rural communities, giving an overview of NIEHS-supported projects addressing health concerns of Native Americans and rural African-American communities in addition to farmworkers, and discussing future plans for CBPR at NIEHS.

AB  - Scholars interested in understanding the unequal exposure to environmental harms by race and class have often relied on urban sociological theory. Specifically, the argument that the outmigration of middle-class Whites and African Americans from America's industrial areas, as well as the decline in manufacturing employment in these communities, concentrated minority poverty around industrial sites. These nested, community-level, processes have not yet been measured as such in the environmental inequality literature. This article addresses this limitation by using spatial measures of poverty segregation between and within racial groups. Multilevel models are presented that examine how the density of industrial facilities is related to the economic health of a host-tract, the broader economic context of the county, and the level of poverty segregation (both within and between racial/ethnic groups). Results demonstrate that there is a spatial separation of the economic benefits and environmental harms across the United States, a pattern that has remained consistent over time.

AB  - Since the early 2000s, there has been an 'extractive imperative' in Latin America that made intensified extraction the policy solution to all socioeconomic challenges. More recently, a similar consensus has emerged in a diversity of political, economic and geographical contexts - such as Turkey, India and the United States - that makes it possible to speak of a 'global extractive imperative'. The imperative is especially evident in settings also characterised by authoritarian neoliberalism and the burden of resistance against extractivism is suffered overwhelmingly by marginalised communities at extractive frontiers. Emerging efforts to declare a share of existing reserves of fossil fuels 'unburnable' would not only help make progress towards tackling the climate crisis, it would also broaden the societal bases of societal struggles against capitalism's extractive excesses.

AB  - The concepts of environmental justice and sustainability are not new, spanning across religious thoughts and philosophical commentaries. There are, however, warnings about the consequences of steering the economic and industrial developments at the expense of environmental health and wellbeing. Subsequently, calls for ending corporate dominance within the capitalist mode of operation are mounting worldwide. These views have largely been criticized by corporations as environmental idealism and adventurism while emphasizing their indubitable role in reducing the pace of climate change and its impacts. These thematic developments are gradually paving the way to a shift from environmental idealism towards environmental pragmatism.

AB  - Scholars often assume that social movements and civil society organizations can draw on deep wells of traditional resources, such as money and lawyers, to finance legal mobilization. However, resource mobilization is rarely so straightforward in developing countries such as Mexico. I show how under-resourced civil society organizations create and mobilize alternative resources which they share with marginalized communities, increasing those communities' access to environmental justice. This occurs in developed countries too, but where money is scarcer, alternative non-material resources are more important. The findings contribute to debates on social movement resource mobilization and on legal mobilization in defence of vulnerable communities facing development pressures from extractive and other industries. The article also provides a fine-grained analysis of how environmental movements act on the ground, focusing on Mexico as an important case of environmental mobilization in a context of poorly resourced and vulnerable communities.

AB  - The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) programme seeks to reshape the way we value, govern and interact with forests. Rather than managing forests according to interests in timber, conservation, land or livelihoods, REDD+ encourages forms of forest management that prioritise carbon. While international negotiations are shaping the rules of the programme, how it takes place on the ground will depend on its interpretation and implementation in different places. In this paper, we are interested in how the REDD+ Task Force (SatgasREDD+), an ad hoc body formed by presidential decree to design and implement REDD+ readiness activities in Indonesia, has attempted to mainstream the programme from 2010 to 2013. We develop a governmentality approach to focus on how the Task Force sought to introduce REDD+ carbon rationalities to forest politics. Based on extended ethnographic research, we identify three strategies: adopting and promoting the carbon discourses circulating among global REDD+ communities; making carbon visible and governable through mapping technologies; and implementing participatory technologies to encourage pro-REDD+ subjectivities. In some ways, the Task Force has been successful in building awareness about forest carbon among forest stakeholders in Indonesia. National civil society organisations, in particular, appear to be supportive of REDD+; however, they emphasise co-benefits' framed as Beyond Carbon', informed by social and environmental justice. For others, however, forests remain sources of timber and land, and new strategies are required if REDD+ is to have substantial impacts on forest governance in Indonesia. The Task Force's efforts reveal the difficult and contested processes through which global climate change programmes come to be embedded in national arenas.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to offer an update on the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV among women of childbearing age. We focus specifically on the use of dolutegravir (DTG) because of a recently identified potential safety issue related to neural tube defects in the fetuses of women who used DTG at the time of conception. Nurses and advanced practice registered nurses should engage in shared decision-making processes for reproductive life planning with women of childbearing age who are living with or are at risk for HIV. During these processes, exploration of the full range of ART regimens is essential. Consistent and reliable contraception is necessary with the use of DTG because it is not recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a major policy evaluation tool, for institutional processes, when they need to cope with fundamental risks, give voice to non-human agents, manage commons, and address environmental justice. The interplay of SEA with planning, unravels key issues and criticalities in both urban governance and environmental democracy. How can evaluation be developed to support the process? Structured evaluation methods applied in environmental assessment are maybe not sufficient to solve complex social conflicts. We point out some key reflections with the aim of opening up the discussion, by taking the case study of the environmental assessment of pollutant activities in the main industrial port cities of Southern Italy. They represent, at the moment, the most significant social criticality in our country, related to the interplay between environmental assessment and risk for labor. The paper focuses on the case study by mentioning the evolution of some thoughts about the red stripe that links sustainability, environmental democracy, and social evaluation, and illustrates the issues of these aspects in the case study, with the aim of underlining the difficulty of environmental assessment tools as a major support for planning processes, when social conflicts arise.

AB  - Social impact assessment (SIA) addresses the 'people aspect' of development-induced change by empowering communities with a voice in the environmental impact assessment process. Globally, poverty and inequality is growing. Countries with emerging economies are especially affected, and SIA conducted within this context necessitates mitigation of both the direct impacts of particular developments as well as the social legacies that entrench poverty and inequality. Social development is an approach that can be used to reduce poverty and inequality. This paper analyses the practice of SIA and its potential to contribute to social development outcomes in emerging economies. SIA, as practised in South Africa, was analysed from the theoretical framework of social development using an exploratory sequential mixed methods design. The findings indicate that weak implementation of mitigation, monitoring and management measures dilute the potential for SIA to achieve social development outcomes. Through minor evolution of SIA practice, the process can lay a firm foundation to facilitate social development outcomes, especially considering its potential contribution to poverty reduction through the social protection floor, skills development and job creation.

AB  - The scope of this article is to analyze the challenges involved in ensuring access to water for human consumption taking the international and national context into consideration. Based on the UN declaration that access to safe and clean drinking water is a fundamental human right, vulnerabilities are identified that can consist in restrictions to access to adequate supplies. The distribution of water and the population across the planet, pollution, inadequate policies and management lead to environmental injustice. The iniquity of access to water constitutes the contemporary water crisis. From the 1980s onwards, the transnational water market emerged for private control that occurs at three main levels: surface and underground water sources; bottled water; and public water supply services. The conflicts of the multiple uses of water resources, the market and environmental problems have contributed to rendering the health of the population and ecosystems vulnerable. Adequate public policies are essential to ensure the basic human right to access to safe and clean drinking water.

AB  - Since the 1970s, urban waterfronts have undergone profound functional transformations. While in many ways they have been proven successful in reviving prime urban areas, waterfront redevelopments have also been contested. This article reviews several aspects of the planning conflicts that have been pertinent to the redevelopment of waterfronts internationally: (1) land ownership, (2) heritage and culture, (3) social and environmental justice, and (4) environment and resilience. Based on a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art literature, we suggest that the growing concerns over social justice and environmental resilience during the course of waterfront redevelopments will continue to challenge cities in the future.

AB  - The consumption of more energy in Turkey is seen as a precondition for the economic and social development of the country in line with its comprehensive ideology of modernization and progress, and hence, a rather aggressive strategy in energy infrastructure investments is adopted since mid-2000s. Because of this aggressive strategy involving expropriation and enclosure of commons societal unrest against the electricity plants at local scale escalated even further, creating numerous local environmental justice conflicts all over the country. While electricity generation in Turkey is mostly carried out at the rural setting, electricity is consumed mostly in the urban setting, where both the household and industrial consumption levels are higher. A comparison of the regional distribution of electricity generation and consumption in Turkey shows that while the electricity generation capacity is concentrated in some cities-Izmir, Sakarya, Adana, Hatay, Zonguldak, Canakkale, Mugla, and Samsun to name a few-it is mostly consumed in the urbanised centres of the country, more particularly in Istanbul, Kocaeli, Bursa, Ankara, and Izmir (the industrialised cities, considered as the engine of growth in the country). Hence, it would not be wrong to say that some cities such as Canakkale and Zonguldak are designated as "ecological sacrifice zones" for the sake of national growth, illustrating well how Turkey prioritises economic growth (and thus industrialisation) over just ecological distribution. At this background, this paper focuses on the ecological distribution conflicts over electricity generation infrastructures and attempts to provide a mapping of the different electricity generation projects (in operation, under construction or planned) to better understand the urban-rural interplay over the electricity consumption and production. Hence, it attempts to shed light on the growing number of environmental conflicts for the last three decades, following the aggressive neo-liberal policies of modernisation and industrialisation.

AB  - The aspiration of liveable cities, underpinned by the New Urban Agenda, is gaining popularity as a mechanism to enhance population health and wellbeing. However, less attention has been given to understanding how urban liveability may provide an opportunity to redress health inequities. Using an environmental justice lens, this paper investigates whether urban liveability poses an opportunity or threat to reducing health inequities and outlines a future research agenda. Selected urban liveability attributes, being: education; employment; food, alcohol, and tobacco; green space; housing; transport; and walkability, were investigated to understand how they can serve to widen or narrow inequities. Some domains showed consistent evidence, others suggested context-specific associations that made it difficult to draw general conclusions, and some showed a reverse patterning with the social gradient, but with poorer outcomes. This suggests urban liveability attributes have equigenic potential, but operate within a complex system. We conclude more disadvantaged neighbourhoods and their residents likely have additional policy and design considerations for optimising outcomes, especially as changes to the contextual environment may impact neighbourhood composition through displacement and/or pulling up effects. Future research needs to continue to explore downstream associations using longitudinal and natural experiments, and also seek to gain a deeper understanding of the urban liveability system, including interactions, feedback loops, and nonlinear and linear responses. There is a need to monitor neighbourhood population changes over time to understand how liveability impacts the most vulnerable. Other areas worthy of further investigation include applying a life course approach and understanding liveability within the context of other adversities and contextual settings.

AB  - The current study examines whether social and economic factors affect the geographic distribution of safe drinking water act (SDWA) violations at the county-level, 2016-2018. Our research controls for a variety of factors in an effort to assess whether community ethnicity, poverty, and racial characteristics appear to be related to the geographic distribution of SDWA violations. The results indicated that populations that are exposed to unsafe drinking water are clustered in certain areas. There appears to be a "contaminated drinking water belt" in the Southwest and South regions, which are concentrated in California's Central Valley, the Texas colonias, and the rural South. Consistent with the spatial cluster results, the zero-inflated count regression model showed that the percentage of Hispanics was a significant predictor of SDWA violations. In addition, the results indicated that counties with SDWA violations and persistent poverty co-occur, suggesting that concentrated poverty matters, and has a negative impact on local drinking water quality.

AB  - There is a general consensus that Small Island Developing States are among the most vulnerable to experience climate injustices. Vulnerability studies of climate change effects on communities have often focused on differences between communities given these climate injustices. However, there is a need to also focus on vulnerability within communities, referred to here as comparative vulnerabilities. Climate justice therefore becomes even more important with more focused attention given to the nuances within groups that fall within the vulnerable category. This article examines comparative vulnerabilities for the fishing community in Jamaica. A survey of 241 fishers from Old Harbour Bay, the largest fishing village in Jamaica, was conducted to examine the level of vulnerability of different fishers to climate change. A vulnerability index was constructed for the community and then comparative vulnerabilities were determined based on socio-demographic characteristics. Overall for the sample 46.9% of respondents would be considered as experiencing a comparatively high level of vulnerability to climate change. Climate change vulnerability was influenced by a number of socio-demographic variables with unique profiles emerging for groups that can be ranked as low, moderate, and high vulnerability. The paper therefore argues that within vulnerable populations there are comparative vulnerabilities based on economic factors and social capital, which must be taken into consideration for adaptation strategies to be implemented. Given these comparative vulnerabilities a more targeted approach to coping and adaptation strategies can then be taken. This will assist in building resilience of these communities that must now adjust to a new normal with climate change effects currently occurring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The United Nations has signalled a 'code red', marking climate change as an existential threat for humanity. The world is rapidly warming, and the consequences of climate change include an increase and intensification in flooding, droughts, wildfires, and other traumatic exposures. Although countries in the Global South have contributed least to global warming, they are the most vulnerable owing to historical inequities. The concept of 'climate justice' recognises that historical racial discrimination, class disenfranchisement, political misrecognition, and other social injustices make surviving climate change and thriving within it more challenging. This narrative review considers the psychological consequences of the climate emergency through a climate justice lens. The article discusses the unequal exposures to psychological adversities, socio-historical barriers to adaptations and, finally, institutional betrayal that complicates the experience of psychological distress. The review concludes by pragmatically discussing how psychology could support climate justice ends.

AB  - Street trees are an important component of green infrastructure in cities, providing multiple ecosystem services (ES) and hence contributing to urban resilience, sustainability and livability. Still, access to these benefits may display an uneven distribution across the urban fabric, potentially leading to socio-environmental inequalities. Some studies have analyzed the distributional justice implications of street tree spatial patterns, but generally without quantifying the associated ES provision. This research estimated the amount of air purification, runoff mitigation and temperature regulation provided by circa 200,000 street trees in Barcelona, Spain, using the i-Tree Eco tool. Results were aggregated at neighborhood (n = 73) and census tract (n = 1068) levels to detect associations with the distribution of five demographic variables indicating social vulnerability, namely: income, residents from the Global South, residents with low educational attainment, elderly residents, and children. Associations were evaluated using bivariate, multivariate and cluster analyses, including a spatial autoregressive model. Unlike previous studies, we found no evidence of a significant and positive association between the distribution of low income or Global South residents and a lower amount of street tree benefits in Barcelona. Rather, higher ES provision by street trees was associated with certain types of vulnerable populations, especially elderly citizens. Our results also suggest that street trees can play an important redistributive role in relation to the local provision of regulating ES due to the generally uneven and patchy distribution of other urban green infrastructure components such as urban forests, parks or gardens in compact cities such as Barcelona. In the light of these findings, we contend that just green infrastructure planning should carefully consider the distributive implications associated with street tree benefits.

AB  - There is a clear need for improving justice and sustainability in the implementation of renewable energy projects. Assessing energy justice in contexts with high cultural and ecological diversity as well as high levels of marginalisation, and a post-colonial history (of domination and resistance to it), requires taking into account the local contextual understandings of justice. Current literature, however, has been mostly developed under the evidence and concepts of Global North contexts, which tend to build in universal ideas of justice, often inappropriate for policy application in the Global South. To contribute to closing this gap, the paper qualitatively analyses the implementation of a large-scale photovoltaic project in Yucatan, Mexico, examining how neighbouring indigenous communities and other key actors perceive, experience and react to procedural and socio-environmental justice issues in the project's implementation. Results show that commonly-used concepts such as consent, participation and inclusion -as currently applied in the siting of renewable infrastructure- are now mostly perceived as legitimation of projects that align with the developer and governmental priorities. Emphasising self-determination over and above the aforementioned concepts is seen as a priority among affected communities for achieving a more socially just energy transition.

AB  - School crime and violence continue to be important topics of criminological inquiry. Forms of violence that have received much attention from criminologists include school gun violence, assaults, and bullying. What appears missing from criminological studies are analyses of different forms of violent victimization imposed on school children related to environmental injustice, pollution, and exposure to toxins. In this article, we argue for the interpretation of these harms as violent victimizations. To facilitate this, we draw upon definitions of violent victimization developed in green criminology, conceptualizing exposure to environmental toxins as violent assault, and introduce the term green school violence (GSV). Next, we draw upon the medical, environmental, and public health literature to offer a series of examples of GSV in the United States, discuss numerous environmental hazards present in American schools, and describe their scope and severity. A conservative estimate of the frequency of GSV suggests that far more school children are victimized by GSV than forms of interpersonal acts of violence.

AB  - The social-class dimension of energy consumption has been rather neglected relative to other theoretical approaches to energy use, despite its potential deployment in energy policies. This paper aims at investigating energy policy-related inequalities across social classes with respect to three dimensions highlighted by environmental-justice theories: income distribution, procedures producing unequal distributional outcomes, and cultural and political recognition of vulnerable and marginalised social groups. These inequalities can be exacerbated or reduced by social diffusion processes, both vertical and horizontal. These processes include policy instruments intending to lower energy consumption in the residential sector. To empirically ground the analysis, two countries with contrasting patterns of income inequalities, Portugal and Belgium, are compared on the basis of qualitative data collected in 2009-2011. We discuss the relevance of integrating the social diffusion dimension in energy policies and propose several policy instruments to do so. One of our main contribution is to argue that both vertical and horizontal diffusion across social classes, if adequately translated into policy instruments, can boost the uptake of residential energy retrofits and other energy saving practices.

AB  - The relationship between food and cities has been recognized as an area of interest for urban planning only recently, thanks to measures adopted at various government levels, locally and internationally. Rethinking the processes of food production, distribution, sale, consumption and recycling in a sustainable and socially equitable way can contribute to making cities fairer, healthier and more resilient to climate change. Starting from these premises, our contribution explores, in particular, the hypothesis that rethinking the relationship between food and urban space can provide an opportunity to promote socio-spatial regeneration processes of public housing neighbourhoods, through projects and actions that involve their inhabitants. This hypothesis is argued starting from a project experience developed in Borgo San Sergio, a district of Trieste, Italy, which aims to consolidate and enhance practices of cultivation and distribution of food, but also of environmental education. The aim of the project is to create a short supply chain in which social agricultural enterprises are involved. The critical reflection stemming from the case study outlines some possible fields of intervention for an urban planning practice aimed at bringing the food system back to an urban and local scale-downscaling-with social and environmental justice goals consistent with the European Green Deal.

AB  - Social sciences have been very prolific in the last decades in publishing research that attempts to better understand the social acceptance of renewable energy technologies and associated infrastructures (RET) - such as high voltage power lines - and processes - such as communities' participation in related decision-making processes. This Perspective proposes that this might be a good point in time, roughly 30 years after social sciences begun looking at the social side of RET, to offer a (over)view on that research, if and how it has changed over time and where it leaves us currently or, in other words, which directions we should follow in the future. I first provide an overview of research on the social acceptance of RET, suggesting that it can be roughly organized around three waves - normative, criticism and critical -; for then identifying and discussing some avenues for future research.

AB  - The struggle to expel the Navy from Vieques has been one of the few issues that unified Puerto Ricans of all political perspectives. Most observers portrayed the protest as a struggle for human rights or cultural nationalism. This essay argues that, in addition, it can be seen as a struggle for environmental justice. While this was partly true during the struggle's first stage, which ended in May 2003, this is especially true in analyzing the second stage, for decontamination and development. Finally, adopting an environmental justice framework should not be seen as minimizing or localizing the significance of mobilization. Rather, contrary to some criticisms, environmental justice analyses can highlight injustices at the systemic level.

AB  - There is growing interest in the potential of grassroots innovations for the transition towards more just and sustainable societies. Nevertheless, there is lack of clear normative discussion regarding these processes. The paper strives to propose and test a framework that enables an analysis of how and in which sense specific grassroots innovation processes may be contributing to the construction of more just societies. To this end, we connect elements of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical transitions (frequently used in the analysis of grassroots innovations) with elements of the capability approach, which offers a multi-dimensional perspective to justice. The framework is used to address two purposively selected empirical cases in two key sectors in Spain: an energy cooperative and a food purchasing group. We draw on the information of 25 individual interviews with members of these two cases, on observation, and on secondary sources. Information was processed by means of a qualitative content analysis. We draw on predefined categories from the framework, which was refined during the analysis. The paper illustrates that grassroots innovations may be contributing to justice in several aspects: they expand capabilities in different dimensions, improve public reasoning processes, and create better structural conditions for human flourishing. Nevertheless, these processes are not free of tensions and contradictions.

AB  - There is a resurgent interest in, and debate about, inclusive environmentalism. Within this context, it has been alleged that Extinction Rebellion (XR) exclude Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and working-class people. To understand more about whether and how this occurs, and how it might be remedied, we interviewed 40 BAME and working-class people in England and Wales about their perceptions of, and opinions about, XR. We found that, while XR's tactics and messages have varied across time and place, their discourse and activities, overall, have tended to alienate BAME and working-class people. The interviewees were very concerned about climate change, and supported urgent government action, but they were not interested in being included in XR. To effectively build a social movement against climate change, we, therefore, recommend XR activists go "beyond inclusion" to the transformation of XR and environmentalism more broadly.

AB  - Scholars across the humanities and social sciences have long sought to theorize waste, and more particularly the relationship between humans - their history, society, culture, art and thought - and their discards. My contention, though, is that these theories, since Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger (1966) and Thompson's Rubbish Theory (1979), have been predominantly based in and on global North contexts and, concomitantly, have taken as their axiom the distance between our cultures, lives, experiences and our material rejects. By intersecting existing cultural theories of waste with two important emerging schools of thought - environmental justice and new materialism - I argue that the exclusion or side-lining of places, notably in the global South where countless people live on a day-to-day basis with, on, and off waste, leads to certain imbalances, biases and gaps. Most notably, the livingness and agency of material rejects is often overlooked in theories that oppose humans and other-than-human waste. By way of conclusion, I propose the notion of 'living waste' - a more literal and material take on Bauman's well-known concept 'wasted lives' - as a new point of departure for a reconceptualization of waste that might escape the prevailing dualisms and account simultaneously for 'full-belly' and 'empty-belly' contexts, human (wasted) lives and other-than-human waste materials, and understandings of lived experiences of waste.

AB  - Social justice education for social work practice is concerned with addressing issues of power and oppression as they impact intersections of identity, experience, and the social environment. However, little focus is directed toward the physical and natural environment despite overwhelming evidence that traditionally marginalized groups bear the burden of environmental problems. In this article, we discuss environmental disaster impacts on marginalized communities, presence of environmental justice in social work literature, and opportunities for integrating environmental justice into social work's mandated disciplinary competencies. We conclude with an example of a module implemented in a foundation Social Justice for Social Work Practice course using place-based education principles as an illustration of concrete strategies for incorporating environmental justice into social justice curricula.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic revealed and exacerbated existing social and economic health disparities, and actionable epidemiologic evidence is needed to identify potential vulnerability factors to help inform targeted responses. In this commentary, methodological challenges and opportunities regarding the links between air pollution and COVID-19 are discussed with a focus on 2 factors: 1) the role of differential exposure to air pollution across populations as an explanation for spatiotemporal variability of the epidemic spread and resultant mortality; and 2) the indirect impacts of interventions to control COVID-19 person-to-person spread treated as natural experiments on air pollution and population health. I first discuss the potential mechanisms between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 and the opportunity to clearly formulate causal questions of interest through the target trial framework. Then, I discuss challenges regarding the use of quasiexperimental designs that capitalize on the differential timing of COVID-19 policies including the selection of control groups and potential violations of the common shock assumption. Finally, I discuss environmental justice implications of this many-headed beast of a crisis.

AB  - The world's oceans and coasts are awash in a sea of politics. The marine environment is increasingly busy, changing, and a site of degradation, marginalization, injustice, contestation and conflict over declining resources and occupied spaces at local to global scales. Themes of political ecology, such as power and politics, narratives and knowledge, scale and history, environmental justice and equity, are thus salient issues to understand in ocean and coastal governance and management. This subject review examines research on these themes of political ecology in the ocean and coastal environment and reflects on how the insights gained might be applied to governance and management. Political ecology provides important insights into: the influence of power in ocean management and governance processes; the manner in which narratives, knowledge, and scale are used to legitimize and shape policies and management efforts; the effects of historical trajectories on present circumstances, options, and practices; and the nature of inequities and environmental injustices that can occur in the marine environment. Moreover, ocean and coastal researchers, practitioners, and decision makers ought to engage with the political processes and injustices occurring in the ocean. Moving from critical insights to constructive engagements will ensure that political ecology helps to plant seeds of hope in the Anthropocene ocean.

AB  - Substantial efforts and investments are being made to increase the scale and improve the effectiveness of marine conservation globally. Though it is mandated by international law and central to conservation policy, less attention has been given to how to operationalize social equity in and through the pursuit of marine conservation. In this article, we aim to bring greater attention to this topic through reviewing how social equity can be better integrated in marine conservation policy and practice. Advancing social equity in marine conservation requires directing attention to: recognition through acknowledgment and respect for diverse peoples and perspectives; fair distribution of impacts through maximizing benefits and minimizing burdens; procedures through fostering participation in decision-making and good governance; management through championing and supporting local involvement and leadership; the environment through ensuring the efficacy of conservation actions and adequacy of management to ensure benefits to nature and people; and the structural barriers to and institutional roots of inequity in conservation. We then discuss the role of various conservation organizations in advancing social equity in marine conservation and identify the capacities these organizations need to build. We urge the marine conservation community, including governments, non-governmental organizations and donors, to commit to the pursuit of socially equitable conservation.

AB  - The environmental determinants of public health and social equity present many challenges to a sustainable urbanism-climate change, water shortages and oil dependency to name a few. There are many pathways from urban environments to human health. Numerous links have been described but some underlying mechanisms behind these relationships are less understood. Combining theory and methods is a way of understanding and explaining how the underlying structures of urban environments relate to public health and social equity. This paper proposes a model for an ecological public health, which can be used to explore these relationships. Four principles of an ecological public health-conviviality, equity, sustainability and global responsibility-are used to derive theoretical concepts that can inform ecological public health thinking, which, among other things, provides a way of exploring the underlying mechanisms that link urban environments to public health and social equity. Theories of more-thanhuman agency inform ways of living together (conviviality) in urban areas. Political ecology links the equity concerns about environmental and social justice. Resilience thinking offers a better way of coming to grips with sustainability. Integrating ecological ethics into public health considers the global consequences of local urban living and thus attends to global responsibility. This way of looking at the relationships between urban environments, public health and social equity answers the call to craft an ecological public health for the twenty-first century by re-imagining public health in a way that acknowledges humans as part of the ecosystem, not separate from it, though not central to it.

AB  - The consequences of neoliberal colorblind policies concerning environmental justice in Michigan are explored using critical race theorist Alan Freeman's victim and perpetrator perspectives on legal decision-making. The victim perspective allows evidence of disparate impact to be proof of unequal protection under the law. The dominant perpetrator perspective requires proof of the intent to discriminate for a racial discrimination claim to be valid. Michigan's environmental legal history is examined through the lens of these two perspectives, tracing how Michigan as a state, with the aid of the federal government, has institutionalized a racialized caste system of 'worthiness' for environmental protection through strict adherence to the perpetrator perspective. Specific attention is paid to the water crisis in Flint and a Marathon Oil refinery in Detroit. The injustices occurring at these locations are less the result of racist individuals than the product of decades of neoliberal colorblind policymaking supported and upheld in our court rooms.

AB  - Social unrest is on the rise worldwide amid deepening inequalities, environmental degradation, and job crises worsened by increasing social-environmental conflicts. In Chile, a social revolt in 2019 resulted in a national referendum in 2020. An ample majority (78.3% vs. 21.7%) voted to draft a new constitution to replace the current constitution drawn up under dictatorship. The result led to the emergence and empowerment of several organizations demanding an "ecological constitution". In this context, we aim to analyze: (1) the main social-environmental conflicts in Chile and how they are related to the country's current constitution, and (2) the potential drafting of an ecological constitution that addresses these conflicts. Across different industries in Chile, we observed common problems that are intrinsically related to the current constitution. This relationship seems to be perceived by Chilean citizens since a survey carried out in May 2021 found 79% support for an ecological constitution. Moreover, 105 of the 155 delegates to the constitutional convention proposed three or more environmental principles to be included in the new constitution. A potential ecological constitution entails principles that would improve the current situation of social-environmental conflicts in Chile. Based on our analysis, we recommend the establishment of watershed-based "territorial rights" in the new Chilean constitution to improve sustainability and environmental justice.

AB  - That the roots of ecological crisis lie in the alienation of modern people from nature is a recurrent theme of environmentalist thought. The related principles of ecocentric identification and 'sense of place' are frequently advanced as providing a remedy for this problem, as well as a conceptual foundation for both Deep Ecology and environmental justice. This paper argues that James Cameron's Avatar can be understood as a dramatisation and implicit critique of these ideas. The film's imaginary Na'avi are an indigenous people whose claim to their land rests on ecocentric identification. 3D cinematography is employed to visualise the state of sensory immersion which catalyses the process of ecocentric identification, yet these techniques also produce a sense of aesthetic dislocation in the viewer. In this manner, Avatar brings to the fore a paradox that has always been implicit in narratives of ecocentric identification: in claiming to heal the split between subject and environment, they presuppose and inadvertently reproduce that split. Avatar thus highlights the need for an environmental politics that dispenses with the notion of alienation and traditional conceptions of place.

AB  - Technology is used in order to emancipate. Emancipation for social and environmental justice ought to shape the way technology is designed and used. The relationships across action research, action research spiral, and the General Systems Theory was investigated. The case study refers to environmental education activities as part of a participative management approach to water resources on the Hydrographic Basin of the Upper Maranho River (Brazil). By introducing action research spiral as a search of rationality in social practices, and describing the nature of lower and higher hierarchical level in General Systems Theory, the higher hierarchical level was associated with Habermasian emancipatory interest, whereas lower hierarchic levels were associated with the specific instrumental concern. To conclude, it is said that the articulation between action research spiral and General System Theory can be the means to strengthen the dialectical potential of the action research spiral in order to achieve both individual and collective empowerment.

AB  - The relationship often assumed by environmental justice researchers is that proximity to a hazardous waste site is a measure of exposure to harmful chemicals. Few researchers, however, explicitly address the methodological challenge of measuring the causal relationship between toxic chemical exposure and health problems. To better understand the methodological task of moving beyond the proximity-exposure assumption, the three most commonly used quantitative methodological approaches in environmental justice research are briefly outlined. Using geographic information system techniques, we operationalize toxic exposure as an interval-level variable and integrate this data with geocoded health and social survey information. We develop a methodological design that enables researchers to assess what factors cause mental and physical health problems for individuals living in contaminated areas. The results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicate that sociodemographic, perceived exposure, objective exposure,, and food consumption variables are significant predictors of physical health and psychological well-being. We also found a significant relationship between physical health and psychological well-being. The data used in this paper were collected in a low-income, African-American community in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This community is contiguous to a Superfund site (EPA) called the Wingate Road Municipal Incinerator and Landfill. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sea people are culturally differentiated by their way of life intertwined with sea fishing and their social and symbolic production. In northeastern Brazil, these people have been changing their living conditions. The Family Health Strategy (ESF) should strengthen links with different cultures to meet its basic principles. We aimed to reflect on the challenges of the ESF in the context of sea people. We conducted ethnographic research in the community of Redonda, Icapui, State of Ceara, using dense descriptions constructed through the narratives of small-scale fishers and their families. We analyzed from the theoretical approach of studies in traditional communities. The results are shown in five themes: 1) The family has an extended dimension in communities established with relatives; 2) Fishing life temporalities govern the common acts of the land-sea dyad; 3) The shifts between being "native" and "outsider" create border areas that dialogue with the rituals of belonging; 4) Sea territorialization and the knowledge of experience; 5) The ESF in the arenas of struggles for environmental justice. Here, the production of health is reaffirmed as the production of sea people's life.

AB  - Technology adoption is crucial for the development of low-income countries. This paper investigates how parametric insurance can contribute to improving access to finance, and hence to technology, for smallholder farmers. In a model with moral hazard, we show that bundling parametric insurance with loans may lower collateral requirements, thus promoting the financial inclusion of poor households. The case of agricultural input loans and weather-index insurance is studied in detail and related to bundled finance solutions recently piloted among smallholder farmers in Tanzania.

AB  - The recent judgment in Gongqose vs Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recognises that customary fishing rights can continue to be exercised, notwithstanding legislation purporting to prohibit fishing without a permit. This article explores the implications of that judgment for customary fishing rights in South Africa, and for customary law generally. It posits an analytical framework to assert customary rights in the face of legislation that could be read to alter or extinguish those rights. The starting point is whether customary fishing is a right under customary law, or a customary practice without legal status. Both are substantively protected under Gongqose, but the customary rights get additional procedural protections. The primary procedural guarantee - and the key innovation of Gongqose - is that customary law can only be altered by legislation if the legislature has considered the content of customary law. Even then, legislation must be read to avoid or limit any alteration or extinguishment of customary law. If interference is inevitable, there will ordinarily be a limitation of rights that the state must justify. Justifications sourced in conservation must be carefully scrutinised, and justified by scientific evidence, not assumptions. Environment-based justifications must also be evaluated through a lens that sees people as part of the environment, not separate from it, and that recognises the need for equitable access to resources. Finally, a court may develop customary law, although that approach risks distorting the character of customary law.

AB  - There is a long history of debate about the changing Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) environment, but with important disjunctures between research, international environmental agendas and institutions, and various different domestic policies at the national level. Within academe, a retreat from the Theory of Himalayan Environmental Degradation (THED) since the late 1980s has not been reflected to any degree in domestic policy agendas of India and China. Here, we make a comparative analysis of the "upstream downstream" debates (which claim that the resource use practices of upstream users have serious detrimental costs to those downstream) in two of the most powerful and populous countries of the HKH region: India and China. We find that the rejection of THED is, on the whole, contradicted but sometimes appropriated by different national players within important political arenas, and in this sense it becomes a discursive pawn in "games of the state." Parts of the retreat from THED are simply ignored, and others are actively resisted. Set against these discursive maneuvers within domestic politics, the academic "state of the game" has undergone profound changes, shifting away from technically derived and science-led imperatives of environmental management toward issues of plural environmental truths, environmental justice, and hybrid knowledge. However, national debates have taken their individual routes, shaped largely by national political events. Thus, the poststructuralist turn in the social sciences in the academy and in some policy arenas, too-the deconstruction of one grand environmental narrative after another (e.g., deforestation, the wood fuel crisis, overstocking), the faltering claims of positivist science to deliver truth, and growing attacks of uncertainty-all this has had a contingent, but usually peripheral, impact upon national academic, political, and policy agendas in China and India. Some conclusions about policy studies are drawn.

AB  - The UN Sustainable Development Goals address a number of criminological issues. This article accounts for why criminologists should contribute to this agenda in a way that might benefit the international development community. We acknowledge a heightened risk of crime in parts of the Global South but argue criminologists should cautiously embrace this agenda as a platform for achieving human and sustainable development outcomes. Supporting this agenda means assisting with the design, implementation and evaluation of projects that contribute to safe, just and sustainable societies. From a critical standpoint, it also means challenging harmful or inappropriate initiatives and resisting attempts to capitalize on this agenda for political gain. Both modes of engagement are informed by the values of 'caution', 'scepticism' and southern epistemologies. The article then proceeds to examine three areas where criminological research can make important contributions: building safe and just societies, eliminating gender-based violence and promoting environmental justice.

AB  - The article commences with a discussion of the Title VI issues that arise when a member of industry contemplates locating a facility in a community. Since the early 1990's there has been an increase in the claims that poor minority communities bear a disproportionate amount of the negative health and environmental risks (referred to as environmental racism) of the siting of hazardous facilities in their part of town. The authors discuss the effects on the population, the President's Executive Order 12898, "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice", the EPA's "Interim Guidance For Investigating Title VI Administrative Complaints Challenging Permits", the Chester case, and the EPA's administrative actions in the Louisiana Shintech case. They examine allegations that the EPA's application of its interim guidance may do real economic harm to the very low income, minority population that it is intended to benefit. They conclude by suggesting several ways for any industry to manage for the "environmental justice" risks of facility location by prior planning, educating all stakeholders, and evaluating the potential risks.

AB  - The performativity of economics programme, pioneered by actor-network theorist Michel Callon, has emerged as an important theoretical intervention at the intersections of science studies, economic sociology and the anthropology of valuation. Exploring the case of contested carbon market designs in global climate governance, however, this article argues that performativity analysts have so far failed to pay sufficient attention to the political dimensions of marketization. Adopting insights from recent materialist approaches to the politics of techno-science, the article addresses this imbalance by outlining three modalities of techno-economic citizenship, as these interfere with the shaping of specific carbon market designs. Drawing on web-based research tools and document analysis, each modality is illustrated via transnational environmental NGO practices of contestation, particularly in the global South. The performativity programme, it is concluded, stands to gain from conceptualizing politics as dynamic assemblages of collective actors, sites of contestation and technologies of witnessing. Re-framing performativity in this direction allows for a reintegration of economics into a wider political ecology of contested eco-sciences.

AB  - Shame campaigns aim to change industry practices by targeting the reputational value of individual firms. They occupy a contested political space from which they leverage existing inequalities in the market to redress political inequalities on the ground. Two such campaigns - the No Dirty Gold and Global Finance campaigns - are assessed based upon their ability to overcome the limitations of relying on markets for leverage and selectively targeting firms directly. While activists connect companies' right to profit with social and environmental responsibilities, they do not directly tackle over-consumption and have done little work to reduce economic inequality. However, campaigners work to rectify existing political inequalities through their efforts to promote transparency, supply educational information, and facilitate inclusive debate amongst stakeholders. While shame campaigns reflect many of the inherent contradictions of global civil society, activists manage to challenge unwanted industry activities by circumventing the state institutions that facilitate their imposition.

AB  - The comprehensive consideration of sex/gender in health research is essential to increase relevance and validity of research results. Contrary to other areas of health research, there is no systematic summary of the current state of research on the significance of sex/gender in environmental health. Within the interdisciplinary research network Sex/Gender-Environment-Health (GeUmGe-NET) the current state of integration of sex/gender aspects or, respectively, gender theoretical concepts into research was systematically assessed within selected topics of the research areas environmental toxicology, environmental medicine, environmental epidemiology and public health research on environment and health. Knowledge gaps and research needs were identified in all research areas. Furthermore, the potential for methodological advancements by using gender theoretical concepts was depicted. A dialogue between biomedical research, public health research, and gender studies was started with the research network GeUmGe-NET. This dialogue has to be continued particularly regarding a common testing of methodological innovations in data collection and data analysis. Insights of this interdisciplinary research are relevant for practice areas such as environmental health protection, health promotion, environmental justice, and environmental health monitoring.

AB  - Social psychologists have long demonstrated that people are stereotyped on the basis of race. Researchers have conducted extensive experimental studies on the negative stereotypes associated with Black Americans in particular. Across 4 studies, we demonstrate that the physical spaces associated with Black Americans are also subject to negative racial stereotypes. Such spaces, for example, are perceived as impoverished, crime-ridden, and dirty (Study 1). Moreover, these space-focused stereotypes can powerfully influence how connected people feel to a space (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3), how they evaluate that space (Studies 2a and 2b), and how they protect that space from harm (Study 3). Indeed, processes related to space-focused stereotypes may contribute to social problems across a range of domains-from racial disparities in wealth to the overexposure of Blacks to environmental pollution. Together, the present studies broaden the scope of traditional stereotyping research and highlight promising new directions.

AB  - There is a high-profile body of work asserting a link between anthropogenic climate change and increased rates of violence. There is also an expanding literature that is highly skeptical of this research. Critics point out that (1) this research has so far produced widely divergent findings, and that there is no consensus on a causal link between climate and the incidence of conflict. Critics also argue that much climate violence research (2) draws upon a long discredited environmental determinism, (3) rehashes colonial stereotypes of the global South, (4) naturalizes and depoliticizes inequalities within and between nations, and (5) potentially creates new rationales for militarism and intervention from more powerful states. In the following essay, I build on these critiques, arguing that orthodox climate conflict research also focuses unduly on the potential climate-related violence of the poor, overlooking the violence of the powerful. Drawing from a climate justice perspective, I advocate for more study on the structural violence of climate change. To make this case, I focus on the world's largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies.

AB  - The sanitation policy in Brazil has been experiencing a new cycle with the legal, regulatory and institutional and renewed investments. This trajectory has revealed tensions and contradictions inherent in a political-ideological context characterized by deep ties to the power structure and the capitalist social relations. Thus, this article aims at studying the recent policy of sanitation in Brazil. The study, based on qualitative and quantitative, involved collecting data on the Federal Government investment in the period from 2004 to 2009. The data revealed that investment has not dialogued with the profile of deficits services. The contexts fiscal, macroeconomic policy, investment of resources, access rules and eligibility criteria are factors that have influenced the results of Federal Government programs. The tradition techno-bureaucratic, patrimonialism, the weaknesses of the state apparatus, corruption and decline of social movements contestation the last decade influenced the advancement of a political project aimed at social and environmental justice. The task involves the universalization of a political effort of society, to treat sanitation as a social right and parcel of a policy with strong state action. From this perspective will need to review the relationship between state, capital and society in social policy and priority.

AB  - There is broad support worldwide for the concept of sustainable development and the integration of its three pillars: economic development, environmental protection and social development. Nevertheless, previous research shows substantial difficulties associated with fully incorporating and operationalising social sustainability features in various sectors. The present article aims to explore further the reasons why incorporation of social sustainability aspects appears to pose a challenge. The article has a twofold explorative aim. First, the aim is to identify opportunities/benefits or difficulties/detriments that emerge when actors try to incorporate social aspects into sustainability projects. Second, the article probes for explanations for the observed challenges. This is clone by referring to a case study examining how the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has attempted to incorporate social sustainability goals, principles and criteria. Using qualitative interviews, FSC-related documents, participant observation, as well as previous research, the article examines the successes and challenges associated with including social sustainability features in the standards and certification process. Observed achievements and difficulties are highlighted in relation to four general aspects: (1) improvement of substantive social sustainability goals; (2) local organisation, empowerment and employment; (3) communication; and (4) small-scale and community-based forestry. The article suggests and analyses eight reasons for these challenges, which relate to discursive, structural or organisational aspects. The findings presented here may also be useful in attempts to understand other similar integrative transnational and/or local sustainability projects.

AB  - The proposed Newtown Pike Extension in Lexington, Kentucky, has the potential to cause significant displacement of low-income residents. Following Executive Order 12898, federal agencies have been required to consider environmental justice impacts of their policies and activities. Highway planners in Lexington have crafted a mitigation strategy that includes a community land trust, which is intended to provide permanent protection for the low-income community to be affected by the highway extension. Although the community land trust may be an attractive option for maintaining housing affordability and community cohesion, the idea must overcome some significant hurdles if it is going to be useful as an environmental impact mitigation tool. One problem is selling the idea of communal land ownership to African American and low-income households. Part of the challenge is to design a method for sharing capital gains that gives an adequate return to home buyers while maintaining affordability. Another difficulty concerns renters who are eligible for only limited relocation subsidies that in many cases will not be enough to cover the cost of new rental housing.

AB  - The burdens of air pollution are not equally shared among all people. Air quality data, whether extracted from online databases or collected in the field, can be used to demonstrate the patterns of exposure to air pollution. When students explore data trends from recently collected data, their level of intellectual and emotional connection to an environmental justice issue is greater than if they simply read journal articles or case studies. This type of involvement increases awareness of the inequalities and can potentially lead to community action. This chapter outlines three example exercises that highlight the link between air pollution and environmental justice.

AB  - The effects of climate change, whether they be via slow- or rapid-onset events such as extreme events, are inflicting devastating losses and damage on communities around the world, with the most vulnerable affected the most. Although the negative impacts of climate change and the concept of loss and damage are included in international conventions, such as the United Nations Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, these stop short of providing clear compensation mechanisms. The science of loss and damage has evolved with the development of extreme event attribution science, which assesses the probability of an extreme event being influenced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, but loss and damage still suffers from the lack of a clear definition and measurability and is further complicated by debates on climate justice and shared but differentiated responsibilities. This primer presents an overview of loss and damage, discusses the complexities and knowledge gaps, and proposes next steps for an interdisciplinary research agenda.

AB  - Social equity has been a concept of interest for many years, gaining increased focus from energy and environmental communities. The equitable development, collection, and reporting of sociodemographic data (e.g., data related to socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity) are needed to help meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e., Affordable and Clean Energy; Reduce Inequalities; Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; and Partnerships for the Goals). Yet, there has not been a consolidation of relevant concepts and application framing in energy and environmental life cycle assessment and decision-making practices. Our study aims to help fill this gap by consolidating existing knowledge on relevant equity applications, providing examples of sociodemographic data needs, and presenting a path toward a more holistic equity administration. In this critique, we present a framework for integrating equity in energy and environmental research and practitioner settings, which we call systemic equity. Systemic equity requires the simultaneous and effective administration of resources (i.e., distributive equity), policies (i.e., procedural equity), and addressing the cultural needs of the systematically marginalized (i.e., recognitional equity). To help provide common language and shared understanding for when equity is ineffectively administered, we present ostensible equity (i.e., when resource and policy needs are met, but cultural needs are inadequately met), aspirational equity (i.e., when policy and cultural needs are met, but resources are inadequate), and exploitational equity (i.e., when resource and cultural needs are met, but policies are inadequate). We close by establishing an adaptive 10-step process for developing standard sociodemographic data practices. The systemic equity framework and 10-step process are translatable to other practitioner and research communities. Nonetheless, energy and environmental scientists, in collaboration with transdisciplinary stakeholders, should administer this framework and process urgently.

AB  - The capability approach is increasingly presented as a promising approach to address questions of justice in local climate adaptation. In an attempt to integrate environmental protections into the capability approach, Breena Holland developed the meta-capability Sustainable Ecological Capacity to establish substantive ecological limits. This article, however, empirically demonstrates that defining ecosystem thresholds in co-evolving systems is subject to conflict and continuous negotiation. Taking the Haringvliet dam in the Dutch South-West Delta as an illustrative case, this paper shows how people uphold different views about the Haringvliet's most desirable ecosystem state. Future shifts in the socio-ecological system, such as decreased fresh water availability and sea-level rise, are expected to uproot today's compromise about chloride levels in the Haringvliet. This suggests that anticipatory water management should not only address climate impacts, but also prepare for re-negotiations of established ecological thresholds. The associated politics of climate adaptation deals with questions about which functions to protect, at what costs and for whom. Hence, it is critical to integrate procedural justice and attention to political inequalities in capabilities-based adaptation justice frameworks.

This paper argues that integrating the inequality perspective into Environmental Economic Geography (EEG) and trying to disentangle the manifold interrelationships between economic, social, and environmental disadvantage could be worthwhile efforts. Based on three case studies - the debate on urban environmental justice in German cities, the spread of alternative food systems and food-sharing initiatives in Germany, and the socially selective migration in hazard prone areas in rural coastal Bangladesh - we demonstrate that aspects of social inequality indeed matter for EEG thinking.

AB  - The problem of global climate changes has raised fundamental questions of justice in world politics centered around the vast discrepancies between the causes and the effects of global warming and the uneven levels of consumption/enjoyment of fossil fuels. The overwhelming majority of approaches in environmental ethics have focused on either distributive justice or rights-based frameworks. Climate change justice, however, can be explored through an alternative framework, an approach based on the recognition theory of Axel Honneth that has not been systematically engaged with in this field. A critique of John Rawls' The Law of Peoples as an exemplar of distributive approaches reveals a number of limitations inherent in Rawlsian models of climate-change justice. Honneth's theory of recognition is an advance on distributive models toward a notion of climate justice in which the conditions necessary for the "functioning and flourishment" of human freedom includes climatic stability as a basic social condition. The ideal of mutual recognition provides a basis for environmental protections, including but not limited to the global atmosphere as a necessary condition for the realization of self-autonomy for all human kind.

AB  - The annual renovation rate of the existing housing stock must increase rapidly to reach climate neutrality by 2050. This transition will require major investments but will also need to be affordable for everyone. Affordability is especially relevant for vulnerable and low-income households, many of which live in social housing in the Netherlands. Previous studies show that such a transition faces justice issues but this paper argues that a more pluralistic justice approach is needed, which also studies the interrelations between the justice dimensions. A multidimensional perspective is used based on five interrelated justice dimensions: distribution, recognition, participation, capability, and responsibility. Empirical data were collected by interviewing members of tenant associations and employees from social housing associations in the Netherlands on their experiences with, and views on, justice aspects in the energy renovation process. The data analysis shows that the multidimensional justice perspective can be applied to implement a broader and more pluralistic perspective on justice principles. These insights can be a starting point for achieving a more just energy renovation process in social housing, especially for addressing the needs of vulnerable households. Moreover, the results point out that all five dimensions are important to take into account in all stages of the energy renovation process, that they are strongly interlinked, and should not be addressed separately. The developed recommendations can be used by policymakers, and tenant and social housing associations.

AB  - There is growing interest in the adoption of residential battery storage because of its ability to provide bill savings, capture excess solar energy, and provide resiliency value. The resiliency benefits have become increasingly salient in light of recent large-scale power outages. However, these benefits may not accrue to all communities. We explore the presence of disparities in residential battery adoption and the allocation of subsidies under California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) by measures of income, race and ethnicity, and a vulnerability index that captures environmental justice (EJ) concerns. We present evidence that battery adoption and subsidy allocations are concentrated in communities that have higher household income and lower EJ concerns. Regression analyses demonstrate that there are disparities in battery adoption rates by household income and race/ethnicity demographic variables, after controlling for important time-varying and regional factors. These findings persist despite the fact that the SGIP has specific funds targeting lower income households and communities, as well as funding targeting wildfire-and outage-vulnerable households. We demonstrate that these findings can be partially, but not fully, explained by SGIP funding eligibility criteria that correlate with communities that have higher income, lower EJ concerns, and a lower percentage of residents of color.

AB  - Social movements organised around health-related issues have been studied for almost as long as they have existed, yet social movement theory has not yet been applied to these movements. Health social movements (HSMs) are centrally organised around health, and address: (a) access to or provision of health care services; (b) health inequality and inequity based on race, ethnicity, gender, class and/or sexuality; and/or (c) disease, illness experience, disability and contested illness. HSMs can be subdivided into three categories: health access movements seek equitable access to health care and improved provision of health care services; constituency based health movements address health inequality and health inequity based on race, ethnicity, gender, class and/or sexuality differences; and embodied health movements (EHMs) address disease, disability or illness experience by challenging science on etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. These groups address disproportionate outcomes and oversight by the scientific community and/or weak science. This article focuses on embodied health movements, primarily in the US. These are unique in three ways: 1) they introduce the biological body to social movements, especially with regard to the embodied experience of people with the disease; 2) they typically include challenges to existing medical/ scientific knowledge and practice; and 3) they often involve activists collaborating with scientists and health professionals in pursuing treatment, prevention, research and expanded funding. This article employs various elements of social movement theory to offer an approach to understanding embodied health movements, and provides a capsule example of one such movement, the environmental breast cancer movement.

AB  - The 2013 and 2015 World Social Forums in Tunis, Tunisia hosted thematic climate spaces for the first time. This article examines the extent to which these spaces are constitutive of a form of transformative peacebuilding aiming to transform social relations and eliminate the structural violence of the world capitalist economy. Both the theoretical and practical activities of civil society at the climate spaces are shown to be transformative but only to the extent that they contest broad processes of trasformismo which transcend differences and obscure the lived realities of governance and resistance. In this sense, civil society groups and movements at the climate spaces are shown to engage with global capitalism to potentially produce new global understanding and action. This generates new understandings of civil society as constitutive of directly resistant modes of social relation that push for radically different visions of climate justice and governance.

AB  - Student initiatives for climate justice are driving forces in the climate change debate, but the psychological determinants of students' engagement for climate justice have hardly been investigated so far. For this study, we posited student engagement for climate justice to be a form of collective action and analyzed psychological determinants of collective action as well as subjective processes of change in these determinants. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted with four individuals who were engaged in different student initiatives. The results of a qualitative content analysis showed that student collective action for climate justice as reported by the respondents reinforced some of the psychological conditions of collective action established in the literature, such as collective and participatory self-efficacy expectations and feelings of fear and anger. We also found, however, that (first-time) participation in collective action cannot be fully explained by those known predictors. A sense of responsibility, awareness of problems, and extrinsic motives, such as social contact, were also conducive to participation, whereas politicized collective identities did not play a significant role. Finally, we discuss the results against the background of existing theoretical considerations and outline implications for further psychological study of collective action.

African Americans, however, have not been attracted to mainstream environmental groups. Grassroots environmental groups-with their emphasis on environmental justice-have attracted a larger following within African-American communities. The 1980s have seen the struggle for environmental equity take on civil rights meaning. Using preexisting social justice and grassroots organizations for leadership, black community residents have begun to challenge government and private industries that would turn their areas into the nation's dumping grounds for all types of health-threatening toxins.

AB  - Scientists, social scientists, risk communicators, and many others are often thrust into a crisis situation where they need to interact with a range of stakeholders, including governmental personnel (tribal, U.S. federal, state, local), local residents, and other publics, as well as other scientists and other risk communicators in situations where information is incomplete and evolving. This paper provides: (1) an overall framework for thinking about communication during crises, from acute to chronic, and local to widespread, (2) a template for the types of ecological information needed to address public and environmental concerns, and (3) examples to illustrate how this information will aid risk communicators. The main goal is providing an approach to the knowledge needed by communicators to address the challenges of protecting ecological resources during an environmental crisis, or for an on-going, chronic environmental issue. To understand the risk to these ecological resources, it is important to identify the type of event, whether it is acute or chronic (or some combination of these), what receptors are at risk, and what stressors are involved (natural, biological, chemical, radiological). For ecological resources, the key information a communicator needs for a crisis is whether any of the following are present: threatened or endangered species, species of special concern, species groups of concern (e.g., neotropical bird migrants, breeding frogs in vernal ponds, rare plant assemblages), unique or rare habitats, species of commercial and recreational interest, and species/habitats of especial interest for medicinal, cultural, or religious activities. Communication among stakeholders is complicated with respect to risk to ecological receptors because of differences in trust, credibility, empathy, perceptions, world view valuation of the resources, and in many cases, a history of misinformation, disinformation, or no information. Exposure of salmon spawning in the Columbia River to hexavalent chromium from the Hanford Site is used as an example of communication challenges with different stakeholders, including Native Americans with Tribal Treaty rights to the land.

AB  - The World and the U.S. are gearing up for increased production of nuclear energy, while still dealing with legacy wastes from the Cold War. The need to ensure the protection of human health and the environment is essential for the increased development of nuclear energy. This chapter addresses and reviews 1) major challenges faced by the Department of Energy in addressing legacy wastes, 2) the information needs for protection of human health the environment around existing and new nuclear facilities, 3) the full inclusion of Native Americans and stakeholders in decisions regarding nuclear facility safety. The major challenges facing legacy wastes include technological needs for cleanup, future land-uses of legacy waste sites, and long-term stewardship (including monitoring) for legacy sites. While much of the information needs for current and future nuclear facilities may be available, key indicators are essential to ensure both environmental protection and Native American and stakeholder involvement. Environmental information needs include identifying endangered and threatened species, species of special concern, populations and habitats of concern and uniqueness, and placing these within a local, regional, and national framework. Similarly, human health needs include identifying at risk populations, placing them within a context of environmental factors, and addressing environmental justice. Environmental justice information needs should be the third prong in the process, and encompasses demographics, consumptive and non-consumptive uses, medicinal, religious and cultural uses, maintenance and cosmetic uses, eco-cultural dependency webs, and eco-cultural attributes. While scientists often assess the views and perceptions of nearby residents, it may also be essential to involve them in an open and transparent collaboration. The interface of scientific data, perceptions as information, the social/demographic environment, and Native American and stakeholder collaboration is critical to ensuring continued safety and protection at nuclear facilities.

AB  - Sandy beaches along coasts and bays are prime real estate for houses and condominiums, marinas, recreation, and tourism for people living in urban and suburban areas within a hundred km of coasts. Human encroachment and disturbance can be a determinant of success of animals in human-impacted systems, particularly shorebirds. Understanding perceptions of people visiting critical habitats can aid in conservation of shorebirds and associated ecosystems, as well as improving the human experience. This paper examines valuation of ecological resources and ecocultural attributes of visitors to 9 beaches on the New Jersey shore of Delaware Bay during a shorebird migratory stopover period. Ecocultural attributes are those cultural activities or experiences that require an intact ecosystem to be optimal, including activities of recreational, aesthetic or spiritual importance. Using a Likert scale, interviewees (N=279) rated the importance of shorebirds and/or horseshoe crabs Limulus polyphemus, ambiance, existence, aesthetics, the beach itself, and recreational activities (photography, birding, and fishing) to the Bay and to their experience. Although shorebirds/crabs were rated as most important (mean rating well over 4.0 out of 5); ecocultural attributes (ambience, existence, aesthetics, the beach itself) were rated higher (rating well over 3) than recreation, hardcore or casual birding, photography (mean rating around 3) and fishing (rating less than 2). Although some ratings of these resources and attributes were positively correlated, many values for birds and/or crabs were not correlated with the ecocultural attributes. Women rated most resources and ecocultural attributes higher than did men, and older people rated them higher than younger interviewees. It was unexpected that the ecocultural attributes played so heavily in the attractiveness of the beach. The importance and implication of these findings are discussed for management and conservation of these beaches, including the importance of ecocultural resources within a context of local community involvement.

AB  - The United States faces a massive task to clean up legacy nuclear, chemical, and structural wastes remaining from the Cold War, and industrial and hazardous wastes, as well as the decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel removal of numerous commercial nuclear facilities nearing the end of useful life. Many sites are on or adjacent to open spaces or waterbodies of varying ecologic quality and utility. Assessing the risks to ecological resources is thus a challenging task that usually involves consideration of the direct risk to these receptors from the ongoing exposure to the contamination before remediation. Here we address impacts during and after remediation. Different remediation types and activities (digging and removal, containment/capping, decommissioning/demolition, pump and treat, in situ treatment), as well as transportation and ultimate disposition can have direct ecological effects including disruption, displacement and death to plants and animals on the remediation site and on surrounding areas. For each type of remediation, two aspects require consideration: the functional aspects of remediation (how many and what types of people, cars, trucks, hoses, heavy equipment, drilling rigs are on the remediation site), and initiating events that can interact with remediation causing harm to ecologic receptors. In this paper we 1) describe initiating events and functional remediation, 2) provide a conceptualization of interactions between them, and 3) examine the types of effects that result from natural and anthropogenic stressors due to the interactions between functional remediation and initiating events. Initiating events are low probability, high consequence events, including "natural" disasters (e.g. earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires) and anthropogenic (building collapses, structural failures) events, that start or cause a response in species or ecosystems. Functional remediation includes the elements of remediation that occur in combination under different remediation types. Interactions between the two may be overlooked when determining the factors to consider in developing bioindicators, assessment tools, and monitoring plans to protect human and ecological health. Each can exacerbate the ecological impacts of the other. We use the Hanford Site in Washington State as a case study, but the principles are broadly applicable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Stakeholder contributions to conservation projects often occur during the problem formulation stage, yet the role of stakeholders throughout the process is seldom considered. We examine the diversity of state and federal agencies, conservation organizations, other non-governmental organizations, environmental justice communities, consultants, industry, and the general public in the conservation of red knot (Calidris canutus rufa) and black skimmer (Rynchops niger) in New Jersey. We suggest that (1) governmental agencies provide the legal, regulatory, and management framework, but it is often the universities, conservation organizations, consultants, and the public that conduct the research and perform activities that lead to increased research and conservation efforts; (2) departments within agencies may have conflicting mandates, making it difficult to resolve differences in actions; (3) there is often conflict among and within state agencies and conservation organizations about roles and priorities; and (4) the role of the public is critical to ongoing research and conservation efforts. Identification of all the relevant stakeholders is necessary to recognizing competing claims, identifying the threats, deciding how to manage the threats, and enhancing population viability. Conflicts occur even within an agency when one department oversees science and protection of populations and another oversees and fosters an industry (aquaculture or fisheries, or permits for off-road vehicles). Conflicts also occur between resource agencies, industry, and conservation organizations. Recognizing the different stakeholders and their mandates, and encouraging participation in the process, leads to a better understanding of the threats, risks, and possible solutions when conflicts arise. Tracking stakeholder viewpoints and actions can lead to increased involvement and conflict resolution.

AB  - The United States and other countries have radiological and chemical legacy wastes remaining from World War II and the Cold War. Assessing risk to human health and the environment from contaminated sites requires inventorying wastes, and examining risks. We use five large U.S. Department of Energy sites to assess the kinds and temporal patterns of indicators used to evaluate ecological resources. Our objective was to determine if there is consistency in types of indicators monitored, whether there are temporal data sets, and how eco-cultural indicators are used. For our assessment, we examined the sites' Annual Environmental Reports that are meant to inform regulators, stakeholders, resource trustees and the public of their environmental performance in reducing risk and protecting humans and the environment. We present tables of ecological and eco-cultural indicators (and temporal trends) for each site, including contaminant levels in listed species, contaminant levels in consumed species, population levels of endangered/threatened species, biodiversity in communities, and information on invasive species. There is consistency in types of ecological and eco-cultural indicators selected among sites, but the specific indicators differ and are often site-specific. There are temporal patterns for species that serve an ecological and eco-cultural function, and that provide information on risk to eco-receptors and humans. There are fewer cultural indicators, and no temporal trends data for them. The data can be used to improve indicator use and monitoring across the DOE complex, and provide models for assessment of risk to ecological and eco-cultural resources at other contaminated sites. Being able to assess relative risk among sites provides managers, regulators, and the public with information to aid in prioritization of remediation tasks, as well as assessing whether remediation and restoration have reduced risks to ecological receptors and human consumers, and achieved the continued protection of ecological and eco-cultural resources on these sites. It also provides a model to prioritize funds and projects among preserves, national forests and wildlife refuges, and other protected lands. The first step is determining current indicators and commonalities among sites, which will allow managers, public policymakers, and the public to make science-based, adaptive management decisions.

AB  - The concept that all peoples should have their voices heard on matters that affect their well-being is at the core of environmental justice (EJ). The inability of some people of small towns, rural areas, minority, and low-income communities, to become involved in environmental decisions is sometimes due to a lack of information. We provide a template for the ecological information that is essential to examine environmental risks to EJ populations within average communities, using case studies from South Carolina (Savannah River, a DOE site with minority impacts), Washington (Hanford, a DOE site with Native American impacts), and New Jersey (nonpoint, urbanized community pollution). While the basic ecological and public health information needs for risk evaluations and assessments are well described, less attention has been focused on standardizing information about EJ communities or EJ populations within larger communities. We suggest that information needed about EJ communities and populations includes demographics, consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of their regional environment (for example, maintenance and cosmetic, medicinal/religious/cultural uses), eco-dependency webs, and eco-cultural attributes. A purely demographics approach might not even identify EJ populations or neighborhoods, much less their spatial relation to the impact source or to each other. Using information from three case studies, we illustrate that some information is readily available (e.g., consumption rates for standard items such as fish), but there is less information about medicinal, cultural, religious, eco-cultural dependency webs, and eco-cultural attributes, all of which depend in some way on intact, functioning, and healthy ecosystems.

AB  - The connection between human rights and climate change is most evident when examining carbon dioxide emissions that result from burning fossil fuels (e.g., sea level rise and displaced coastal cultures). However, the transport of fossil fuels also has human rights implications for human rights and climate change. This research focuses on the health and safety risks inflicted on those residents who are adjacent to the railways that ship fossil fuels along the US-Canada transportation corridors. Applying sociological and jurisprudential perspectives, we review the environmental/climate justice literature as it pertains to industrial transport corridors, documenting the forms of heightened risk imposed on those living along these transportation paths. Next, we develop an illustrative case study of Canada's worst rail catastrophe. In so doing, we provide evidence of a decades-long failure of US and Canadian regulators to prevent such disasters. We interpret that disaster through a human rights case law suggesting that States have an affirmative duty to protect their citizens from foreseeable disasters. Based on this analysis, we propose specific rail safety regulatory reforms. We argue that if the US and Canadian governments implement these regulations as required under human rights law, they can more effectively honor their obligations to their citizens who are paying a high human cost for the material benefits associated with increased energy production.

AB  - The deleterious consequences of environmentally associated diseases are expressed differentially by income, race, and geography. Scientists are just beginning to understand the consequences of environmental exposures under conditions of poverty, marginalization, and geographic isolation. In this context, we developed the TERRA (translational environmental research in rural areas) framework to explicate environmental health risks experienced by the rural poor. Central to the TERRA framework is the premise that risks exist within physical-spatial, economic-resources, and cultural-ideologic contexts. In the face of scientific and political uncertainty, a precautionary risk reduction approach has the greatest potential to protect health. Conceptual and technical advances will both be needed to achieve environmental justice.

AB  - Scholars have attributed park (non)use, especially ethno-racially differentiated (non)use, to various factors, including socio-cultural (e.g. poverty, cultural preferences, etc.) and socio-spatial determinants (e.g. travel distance, park features, etc.). But new geographic research is proposing alternative explanations for park (non)use, employing a 'cultural politics' theoretical lens. The cultural politics frame offers fresh insights into how practices of socio-ecological exclusion and attachment in parks may be undergirded by political struggles over the making and ordering of racialized identities. Challenging partial and essentialist explanations from leisure research, some cultural politics scholars have recently argued that ethnoracial formations, cultural histories of park-making (e.g, segregated park systems), and land-use systems (e.g. zoning and property taxes) can operate to circumscribe park access and use for some people of color. Using the cultural politics frame, this paper documents the ethno-racial and nativist barriers Latino focus group participants faced in accessing and using some Los Angeles parks. Participants reported feeling 'out of place', 'unwelcome' or excluded from these parks. They identified the predominantly White clientele of parks; the ethno-racial profile of park-adjacent neighborhoods; a lack of Spanish-language signs; fears of persecution; and direct experiences of discrimination as exclusionary factors. These findings have implications for future research and for park planning and management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has mainstreamed as an interdisciplinary framework in the urban sustainability and resilience agenda. While the uptake of ES in urban areas is deeply entangled with multiple values, trade-offs, institutions, management and planning approaches, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and systematic framework to address environmental justice (EJ) in urban ES assessments. This article presents a systematic literature review to examine what factors are critical for the effective inclusion of an EJ lens in urban ES appraisals. More specifically, we assessed how distributional, procedural and recognitional EJ dimensions have been addressed, and in relation to which types of urban ES. Our results reveal that EJ considerations are currently focused on the (un)equal distribution of ES and the associated green and blue infrastructure with regard to socioeconomic groups, with special attention to income and race/ethnicity as the main mechanisms of social stratification. There is also a predominant focus on regulating and cultural ES, analyzing their role on resilience and adaptive capacity on one hand, and recreational values, social cohesion and place-making on the other. In this review, we also evaluate the interconnected dimensions of justice and their constraints, and lay out pathways for new research into intersectional and restorative approaches to justice in ES assessments. Finally, we interrogate what the role of urban ES-based planning might be in making more inclusive and just cities and explore its implications for policy and practice.

AB  - The years-long negotiations on loss and damage (L&D) associated with climate change impacts reached a milestone with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, sanctioning the permanence of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) created in 2013. The WIM aims at advancing knowledge gathering, coordination and support to address L&D associated with extreme and slow onset events in vulnerable developing countries (Decision 2/CP.19). Despite being among the most controversial issues to be recently treated in climate change negotiation, L&D has attracted little attention in the field of international relations. This paper aims at addressing this gap by reconstructing the emergence and evolution of the negotiating positions on L&D of developing and developed countries. It employs a critical discourse analytical approach and builds on Fairclough's three-dimensional framework for critical discourse analysis, taking decision 2/CP.19 as the core communicative event. Consistently, the decision is analysed at three different levels: as a text (micro-scale); as a discursive practice (meso-scale); and as a social practice (macro-scale). The analysis makes use of a wide range of materials including previous decisions, High Level Segment statements and Parties submissions. It reconstructs Parties' conflicting views on the positioning of L&D vis-a-vis the adaptation space (L&D as a part of, or as beyond adaptation) and the scientific, ethical and legal arguments employed to support these standpoints. It highlights, in particular, the strategic importance which the compensation argument' had in determining developing countries' capacity to influence the UNFCCC process up to the inclusion of a specific article on L&D in the Paris Agreement. While calls for compensation might have lost momentum as a result of the Warsaw and Paris talks, the paper argues that their potential is far from exhausted. They in fact imply a more general request for climate justice which the UNFCCC has not yet addressed.

AB  - Socio-environmental conflicts are situations that exemplify human rights transgressions caused by extractive activities. These are present in developing countries where extractivism, imperialism, and colonialism paradigms prevail. In the context of Mexico, criminalization, violence, and the absence of rule of law promote these conflicts, frequently aggravated by involvement with private interests. In the last 20 years, the relationship between human rights in the mining sector and its impact on the environment has been a critical research subject. This paper aims to carry out a systematic review to analyze human rights transgressions related to the mining industry's impact in Mexico, and identify factors causing socio-environmental conflicts. The current study shows a systematic analysis based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. This method contributed to the collection of references that describe conflicts due to human rights transgressions and environmental damage in mining areas in Mexico. Human rights transgressions caused by mining in a Mexican context demonstrate the inability of the state to stop the increase in socio-environmental conflicts and its lack of concern towards preventing damage to the environment.

AB  - The planned expansion of the human presence on our moon demands that we reconsider our relationships with our planet's partner. Threats to the moon such as those engendered by mining encourage the preservation of various precious areas of our moon's surface through the emplacement of international multiuse land reserves. These reserves, arising from tested environmental science strategies as well as values drawn from the ethnographic field, allow concurrent pursuits of industry, science, environmental preservation, respect for human cultural landscapes, as well as future recreation. By protecting the near side patterns in the moon, the Hertzsprung and Von Ka = rma = n Craters on the far side, and polar regions at Malapert, Peary, and Florey, we leave room for industry while also avoiding pointless losses of the moon's own majesty or damage to ourselves in our interactions with the moon. In creating these reserves in line with the Outer Space Treaty, we move closer to the desirable environmental justice outcome in which each human theoretically has a say in the fate of our moon, which is the cultural heritage of every one of us.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The transport of natural gas through transmission and distribution networks spans 2.4 million miles of underground and above ground pipelines in the USA. This Perspective uses a critical energy justice framework to analyze Appalachian's everyday lived experiences at the frontline of energy distribution network development. The practice of installing pipelines, as well as the sheer magnitude of the pipeline system, has transformed small rural communities into industrial sites. This Perspective also adds to the emerging concept of energy justice by bringing to the forefront Appalachian residents' voices in relation to burgeoning pipeline constructions, which are often missing from the debate on energy independence. Energy justice is based on the principle that people should not only have safe and affordable energy, but they should be protected from disproportionate negative impacts associated with generating and transmitting energy as well. Our findings are that those who reside near pipelines express fear of explosions, leaks, and negative health outcomes and are disproportionately impacted. In addition, they are concerned about regulation, state responsibility, and threats of eminent domain. We highlight how these communities are socially affected, and how residents' daily lives are altered in inequitable ways by the construction of energy distribution networks.

In this paper, we investigate the use of hierarchical Bayesian methods for combining disparate sources of environmental data featuring complex correlations over both space and time. After a brief review of the Bayesian approach and its specific application to disease mapping problems, we illustrate two case studies. The first of these investigates the effect of a certain nuclear fuel reprocessing facility in Ohio on the lung cancer rates in the counties that surround it, while the second concerns the relation between air quality (especially in terms of ambient ozone levels) and pediatric emergency room visits due to asthma in the Atlanta metro area. We close by summarizing the method's implications for environmental justice, as well as future methodological and applied work.

AB  - The recent explosion of legal scholarship focused on the role social norms play in governing collective behavior has largely omitted intensive exploration of one important issue: whether social norms can resolve "large-number, small-payoff" problems of collective action. The resolution of these problems requires heterogeneous groups of individuals with no real connection to one another to change their behavior for little or no economic gain. Many environmental problems are illustrative: energy overuse, littering, and air pollution. In this Article Professor Carlson examines empirical evidence about a particular large-number, small-payoff collective action problem, solid waste reduction through recycling, to determine whether and how social norms work to induce behavioral change necessary to resolve the problem. Professor Carlson concludes that despite the optimism among some scholars about social norm management as a regulatory tool, our national experiment with recycling suggests that norm creation or management is by itself not likely to be terribly effective in resolving a large-number, small-payoff collective action problem if the desired behavioral change is relatively inconvenient or requires significant effort. Governments are likely to have more success in solving such problems through reducing the amount of effort required or ky using financial incentives to induce the behavioral change rather than by engaging in efforts to strengthen social norms. Professor Carlson also concludes that norm management can have some payoff where a collective action problem requires relatively high-effort behavioral change if governments or other norm managers can succeed in converting some low or moderate believers in the norm to true believers. The Article shows that norm management efforts that involve face-to-face communication or individual feedback can have some success in inducing behavioral change. The Article should help governments and other agents of social change who need to rely on the altruism of many individuals in order to resolve a social problem by providing an understanding of the relationship between effort, norms, and financial incentives. The Article also provides evidence in the ongoing scholarly debate about what motivates compliance with social norms.

AB  - The article traces the recent 'discovery' of the importance of walking in urban green spaces to health to its historical roots, and situates it within its discursive and political-economic context. It shows, using the UK as a case example, how the nineteenth century urban parks movements had public health as one of its key objectives, linked to a hegemonic middle class project of promoting order and 'rational recreation' to the working classes. It then shows that as health problems and understandings changed, along with broader political-economic shifts, park aims shifted from enhancing 'health' to promoting 'fitness'. With the growth of modern notions of citizenship, decline of infectious disease, and the rise of the biomedical model in the welfare state era, parks ceased to be seen as means to health and were transformed into municipal services. After the oil crises of the 1970s and the rise of Thatcherism, they went into decline, though from the 1990s there were political efforts to revive them as part of a wider set of sustainable urban policies, and growing preoccupations with the health costs of a sedentary and obese society. In this context, the article provides a critical commentary on the science and policy of individualist discourses of 'green walking' and health. It argues for a broad 'ecological health promotion' approach, using economic crisis as an opportunity to move forward in ways consistent with environmental justice and an emancipatory 'capabilities' approach to public health.

AB  - The waste-to-energy industry, as part of the waste management industry, has been in the forefront of the environmental equity issue for the past few years. Environmental equity is an important issue to all sectors of the waste management industry because those in the industry are constantly challenged to defend their facility locations and face the possibility of restrictions on where new facilities can be located. This paper examines the history of the issue, reviews the major studies that both opponents and proponents cite, and takes a look at how the waste-to-energy industry fares with regard to it(1).

AB  - The critical environmental justice (CEJ) framework contends that inequalities are sustained through intersecting social categories, multi-scalarity, the perceived expendability of marginalized populations, and state-vested power. While this approach offers new pathways for environmental justice research, it overlooks the role of firms, suggesting a departure from long-standing political-economic theories, such as the treadmill of production (ToP), which elevate the importance of producers. In focusing on firms, we ask: how do firms operationalize diverse social forces to produce environmental injustice? What organizational logics sustain these inequalities? To understand the firm-level dynamics shaping treadmill acceleration and environmental injustice, we utilize two concepts-social embeddedness and managerial authority-from economic sociology research on firms. The former refers to the social and non-economic factors that guide economic decision-making, whereas the latter refers to the power that reinforces worksite hierarchies. This theoretical paper argues that social embeddedness and managerial authority interact within firms to produce an organizational logic that sustains environmental injustice and ecological disorganization. We draw from historical and contemporary evidence on sugarcane plantations in Latin America and the Caribbean, with cases ranging from the colonial period to the present day. By bringing economic sociological concepts to bear on the CEJ and ToP frameworks, we advance debates on how firm-level dynamics shape environmental inequalities.

AB  - Scholars have shown that technical standards play an important role in building global transportation and communication infrastructures, but the environmental standardization efforts associated with infrastructures have received far less attention. Combining scholarship from transportation geography, political ecology, and science and technology studies, we show how global connection is made, maintained, and contested through environmental management practices pegged to infrastructure standards. The Panama Canal expansion, completed in 2016, is a revealing illustration. The expansion has established the New Panamax shipping standard: the maximum allowable dimensions for vessels passing through the canal's massive new locks. The standard has become a benchmark for port modernization and channel deepening projects along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States and beyond. Because the maximum underwater depth, or draft, of ships transiting the new locks is much deeper than before (50 rather than 39.5 feet), geographically dispersed governments, firms, and port authorities have scrambled to reach that standard in hopes of attracting New Panamax ships and associated revenue streams. As this case shows, global transportation depends on the expensive, ecologically destabilizing, and often-contested practices of dredging and disposing of large volumes of sediment and organic matter. By showing how shipping networks and situated politics converge around infrastructure standards, we foreground the uneven environmental burdens and benefits of transportation.

AB  - The Brazilian government wrapped up 2021 with a masquerade at COP26 (26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties): hiding PRODES (the annual Amazon deforestation report). After three years of denying and dismantling the public apparatus to fight Amazon deforestation, this is emblematic of how transparency and social participation have been neglected. Transparency of PRODES has been crucial to all initiatives against deforestation. Notwithstanding, the Brazilian government has not only worked to discredit PRODES, but limited access to other environmental data and decreed a 'gag law'. Responses to requests of public data are largely unsatisfactory and information on deforestation permits (key to understanding the extent of legal and illegal deforestation) is either missing or incomplete. Social participation has been strongly limited after one-fifth of 22 national boards monitoring the public administration was extinct and almost half restructured. As an outcome, the Amazon Fund, the most important source of financial support against deforestation, was frozen. These systemic problems compromise the political struggle to combat Amazon deforestation and worsen the living conditions of those peoples protecting forests. Increasing transparency of environmental data through robust and reliable mechanisms, and ensuring social participation in the decision-making processes are crucial to halt deforestation and support Brazil's role as an international player.

AB  - The concept of Positive Energy Districts (PEDs), introduced in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, is one of the fundamental approaches for a successful, clean and sustainable urbanization by 2025. According to the European Commission, a PED is a set of buildings where the community controls the energy flows and aims at a net positive energy balance over a year by utilizing renewable energy sources. There are a plethora of concepts similar to PEDs, such as Positive Energy Community, Net Zero Energy Neighborhood, Plus Energy Districts, that create a need to establish a structure that can facilitate the definition, development, and precise identification of PEDs. Thus, this paper aims to fill this research gap by comparing these and other related concepts through a critical literature review based on three pillars composing the triangle of sustainability: economic, social and environmental. By doing this, the paper aims to determine the connections between these similar concepts, homogenize the use of terms and avoid the issue of repetitions, which can help draw lessons learnt from other energy-savings concepts. This study shows how PEDs and Nearly Zero Energy Communities have similar bases, aims and omissions. They diverge in a few key concepts, which can become learning points for PEDs. This article is categorized under: Climate and Environment > Net Zero Planning and Decarbonization Policy and Economics > Energy Transitions Human and Social Dimensions > Energy and Climate Justice

AB  - Social movements are arising in unexpected places, producing effects not normally associated with our traditional understandings of either politics or movements. No longer, and perhaps never, solely the highly visible, modernist expressions of resistance to the state, movements are not only enacting politics through protest and cultural contestation, but are generating diverse knowledges. From heated debates over the meaning of Italy's alter-globalization movement; to careful direct-action strategizing in Chicago's cooperative bookstores; to conferences on Native American environmental justice issues, contemporary movements ore important sites of knowledge creation, reformulation and diffusion. We call these "knowledge-practices." Building on interdisciplinary approaches to the study of social movements, we argue that when we recognize movements as processes through which knowledge is generated, modified and mobilized, we gain important insights into the politics of contemporary movements. This recognition also has important methodological implications. It requires that we shift the mode of engagement in our research, blurring established social scientific boundaries and promoting a more relational-symmetrical approach.

AB  - The cement industry is one of the most energy intensive in the world, contributing significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. The use of refuse-derived fuels (RDF) in cement kilns is increasingly portrayed as a sustainable solution to reduce emissions while dealing with different types of waste. Nevertheless, the use of RDF in cement plants is contested by communities around the world, who are facing immediate environmental impacts. In this article, we examine the burgeoning movement against waste incineration in cement kilns legitimized as energy recovery. We start by revisiting the environmental justice literature, which laid the groundwork for the contemporary anti-RDF movement. Then, in order to highlight the energy dimension of RDF we focus on two energy-related concepts: energy justice and energy democracy. Through the case study of Can Sant Joan (Catalonia), we assess the suitability and usefulness of these concepts with the local movement against waste incineration. Our analysis suggests that the movement against RDF use can be further energized and strengthened by expanding into the realm of energy democracy. Both the anti-RDF and the energy democracy movement share a focus on the local scale, have similar typology of stakeholders involved, and favor a strong bottom-up approach while paying attention to unequal power relations. We also observe that these movements can mutually benefit from being better integrated with one another. Finally, we propose that a potential alliance between the Plataforma Antiincineracio de Montcada i Reixac (PAMiR) and the Xarxa per la Sobirania Energetica (Xse) in Catalonia, can mobilize fruitful internal tensions toward a more inclusive and democratic future.

AB  - Significant life experiences (SLE) research has been criticized for a disproportionate focus on privileged groups and positive experiences. In this paper, I use textual analysis to examine the SLEs within the Environmental Justice (EJ) literature. Theoretically, I blend feminist theory, the sociology of disaster, and research on EJ motives for activism to advance the notion of social/environmental positionality and marginality, characterized by toxic social/environmental relationships. Findings reveal that EJ activists describe the experience of EJ as three SLEs: the recognition of their social/environmental marginality, the embodied knowledge produced from their experiences, and the empowerment that comes from working with others in a community for EJ. These findings are compared to more traditional SLE's and I conclude with a discussion about the importance of positionality and negative experiences for SLE research.

AB  - The restriction site-associated DNA (RADseq) family of protocols involves digesting DNA and sequencing the region flanking the cut site, thus providing a cost and time-efficient way for obtaining thousands of genomic markers. However, when working with non-model taxa with few genomic resources, optimization of RADseq wet-lab and bioinformatic tools may be challenging, often resulting in allele dropout-that is when a given RADseq locus is not sequenced in one or more individuals resulting in missing data. Additionally, as datasets include divergent taxa, rates of dropout will increase since restriction sites may be lost due to mutation. Mitigating the impacts of allele dropout is crucial, as missing data may lead to incorrect inferences in population genetics and phylogenetics. Here, we demonstrate a simple pipeline for the optimization of RADseq datasets which involves partitioning datasets into subgroups, namely by reducing and analysing the dataset at a population or species level. By running the software Stacks at a subgroup level, we were able to reliably identify and remove individuals with high levels of missing data (bad apples) likely stemming from artefacts in library preparation, DNA quality or sequencing artefacts. Removal of the bad apples generally led to an increase in loci and decrease in missing data in the final datasets. The biological interpretability of the data, as measured by the number of retrieved loci and missing data, was considerably increased.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to prefigure the future of urban sustainability governance by implementing crowdsourcing-based solutions for governance processes. We explore the convergence between recent research in urban sustainability governance and crowdsourcing. This is done by reviewing the literature in order to acquire important evidence to support the inductive process of theory building, and to highlight the upcoming trends in participatory research and policy-making that exploit ICI' and Web 2.0 social software. Our analysis indicates that a transformative relationship between data and people creates new forms of distant search for solutions and decision making. We argue that interest in crowdsourcing has expanded from computing researches to social and environmental applications. This new practical dimension unlocks the futures of integration of crowdsourcing into best practices in the governance of sustainability in an urban context. Building on evidence that implementing crowdsourcing into the forthcoming governance of urban sustainability is increasingly recognised as a common priority, the paper suggests policy makers to devote more resources to ensure openness, transparency, interoperability and adaptability of crowdsourcing platforms.

AB  - Small island developing states (SIDS) are characterised by their small size, remoteness and their dispersal in vulnerable regions globally. In Mauritius, rapid economic growth and expansion of suburban and coastal settlements in flood risk zones have exacerbated challenges from increased vulnerability of local communities to frequent flooding and inadequate resilience. While most studies are devoted to coastal flooding due to sea level rise, inland flooding aggravated by human settlements on exposed areas and by human-environment interaction is rarely considered. Generally, studies have focused on immediate flood impacts rather than on post-event recovery factors that reduce resilience and lead to the inability to recover through successive events. This includes living through onslaught of secondary hazards post-event. This study (2008-2014) focuses on the recovery and resilience of a flood-prone community living in a suburban area of Port-Louis, the capital of Mauritius. A mixed method of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used to examine the recovery and resilience of the community at household level. Results from quantitative analysis showed significant associations at p <= 0.05 between variables relating to recovery and those of income level, literacy level, and household size with children, and/or elderly persons. Qualitative results from focus group interviews indicated that social inequity and environmental injustice hindered recovery among low-income households. However, some resilience was present through community capital, with solidarity in times of adversity amongst some community sub-groups. Outcomes from a participatory exercise showed that experiential knowledge of how to cope with floods was crucial in resilience-building strategies of households and communities.

AB  - Study objective: This paper addresses the environmental justice implications of children's health by exploring racial/ethnic disparities in potential exposure to air pollution, based on both school and home locations of children and three different types of pollution sources, in Orange County, Florida, USA. Methods: Using geocoded school and residence locations of 151 709 children enrolled in the public school system, distribution functions of proximity to the nearest source are generated for each type of air pollution source in order to compare the exposure potential of white, Hispanic, and black children. Discrete buffer distances are utilised to provide quantitative comparisons for statistical testing. Main results: At any given distance from each type of pollution source, the cumulative proportion of Hispanic or black children significantly exceeds the corresponding proportion of white children, for both school and home locations. Regardless of race, however, a larger proportion of children are potentially exposed to air pollution at home than at school. Conclusions: This study addresses the growing need to consider both daytime and nighttime activity patterns in the assessment of children's exposure to environmental hazards and related health risks. The results indicate a consistent pattern of racial inequity in the spatial distribution of all types of air pollution sources examined, with black children facing the highest relative levels of potential exposure at both school and home locations.

AB  - The production of climate change knowledge is mired in issues of equity and justice. Decision-making and governance are often deeply biased towards dominant scientific/market-driven frameworks, excluding plural place-based perspectives. The characterization of the Himalayas as 'exceptionally precarious' to climate change builds on the enduring legacy of the Theory of Himalayan Environmental Degradation. This ignores how climatic transformations, both material and discursive, remain embedded within historic relationships of power. Recent critical scholarship has challenged such dominant, elite technomanagerial narratives. Our paper engages with such critiques to democratize Climate knowledge production pertaining to the Himalayas. Through a synthesis of scholarship in post/anti/decolonial studies, political ecology and environmental justice we reveal the power-knowledge hierarchies undergirding climate change in the Himalayas, and draw lessons from the agency of marginalized communities. We argue for a socially just and scientifically plural framework that highlight issues of geopolitical insecurity, narratives of the Anthropocene and the place based experiences of socio-ecological change.

AB  - Stormwater control measures (SCMs) (i.e., green infrastructure) are advantageous methods of stormwater management. However, studies suggest that urban greening may be associated with gentrification, displacing racially/ethnically minoritized groups due to increased housing costs and loss of feelings of belonging. We studied displacement of racially/ethnically minoritized groups after SCM installation in Washington, DC. We compared the change in percentage of persons in racial/ethnic groups at the Census block group level with varying levels of SCM installation (i.e., area-weighted SCM count at 300 m buffer). We stratified findings by SCM type, pre-installation income, and SCM size. DC installed a higher density of SCMs in areas with a higher percentage of Black and/or Hispanic/Latino residents. Nonetheless, findings suggest SCM installation is associated with displacement of Black residents. The percentage of residents who are Black decreased by 2.2% [95% Confidence Interval: 1.7, 2.7] and 4.1% [95% Confidence Interval: 3.4, 4.8] after low and high levels of SCM installation, respectively. In turn, the change in percentage of residents who are White increased with increasing levels of SCM installation. Compared to ecological studies on SCMs, studies about social impacts are scarce. This research intends to help optimize SCM installations so more residents can enjoy their health, economic, and ecological benefits.</p>

AB  - The current concern for climate change and social equity in the US, highlighted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, has increased public attention on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. One of the primary challenges the country faces is the issue of infrastructure, which has a profound impact on environmental and social conditions. Private entities have an opportunity to address ESG factors and improve climate resiliency, environmental justice, and economic opportunity through public-private partnerships (PPPs) that are focused on America's aging infrastructure. It is also an opportune time to initiate infrastructure projects as they align with the Biden Administration's aggressive climate change and economic stimulus plans. This study utilized publicly available information, including sustainability reports, news sources, and research papers, to explore examples of PPPs and current ESG trends, with a focus on environmental criteria, and demonstrated how private investment in infrastructure can produce mutually beneficial results for the private entity and society.

AB  - The sustainability of energy policy performance is determined by a combination of environmental, economic and equity impacts on society. To date, analysis of the equity impacts of energy policy have been largely overlooked in favour of environmental and economic impacts. As equity is an important issue within sustainability and energy justice considerations, this paper sets out to provide a framework and methodology which allows an assessment of both policy effectiveness in terms of an environmental and economic evaluation, followed up by an assessment of resultant quantitative equity impacts on society, in order to engender a holistic policy sustainability evaluation. Following an investigation of prominent energy policy equity issues and Australian peoples preferences towards equity, multiple scenarios are evaluated for effectiveness within the Australian National Electricity Market. The results of this evaluation provide an evidence base for the development of an alternative energy scenario which addresses the identified equity issues whilst meeting policy goals. The equity evaluation demonstrates the comparative equity resultant from each scenario and identifies the apportioning of burden according to income level. The proposed evaluation processes allow the policy maker to develop policies sensitive to both effectiveness and equity, and can be applied in energy justice conscious jurisdictions.

AB  - The elemental composition of wine provides important information about origin, authenticity, and sensory considerations. Although various wine regions and varieties of still wines have been extensively studied, limited research has evaluated the metal profiles of sparkling wines, which can be produced via the bottle-fermented tra-ditional method (TM) or the tank-fermented Charmat method (CM) in both ros?? and non-ros?? styles. In this study, 73 commercial sparkling wines from Canada???s Niagara Peninsula were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma -optical emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to quantify 28 metal ions (silver [Ag], aluminum [Al], arsenic [As], boron [B], barium [Ba], beryllium [Be], calcium [Ca], cadmium [Cd], cobalt [Co], chromium [Cr], copper [Cu], iron [Fe], potassium [K], magnesium [Mg], manganese [Mn], molybdenum [Mo], sodium [Na], nickel [Ni], lead [Pb], antimony [Sb], selenium [Se], tin [Sn], strontium [Sr], titanium [Ti], thallium [Tl], uranium [U], vanadium [V], zinc [Zn]). All metal levels were below internationally regulated maximum limits. Higher mean levels of Cr, Ni, and Sr (0.021 ?? 0.008 mg/L, 0.018 ?? 0.004 mg/L, and 0.32 ?? 0.07 mg/L, respectively) and lower mean levels of B (3.0 ?? 0.6 mg/L) were identified in CM compared with TM wines. Cr and Ni are of particular interest because of their association with stainless steel contact during CM production. In addition, the results identified higher mean levels of K (613 ?? 153 mg/L) and lower mean levels of Cu (0.034 ?? 0.036 mg/L) in ros?? wines compared with non-ros?? style wines. These results represent the first investigation of metal content in Canadian sparkling wines and identify important elemental differences related to production technique that can inform future authenticity assessments.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services is influencing how environmental stakeholders pursue dual conservation and community development goals. While rapidly growing in popularity, the ecosystem services approach has been criticized for adopting a homogenous approach to communities and failing to consider social diversity and associated power structures influencing access to benefits. In this paper, we adopt an environmental justice lens to analyse access to ecosystem services in a case study of community forestry in Nepal. Using mixed methods, our disaggregated analysis shows that access to ecosystem services is differentiated by social characteristics such as caste, income and gender with uneven distributive outcomes and participation. High-income groups were able to disproportionately access the benefits despite the social equity provisions built into policy and institutional structures. Our study shows that some of the protections oriented at assisting disadvantaged groups were experienced as onerous and should be amended if they are to have beneficial outcomes. In highlighting entrenched inequities, we argue that the ecosystem services approach needs to make environmental justice more central to avoid further marginalising the marginalized, and have far and just outcomes. The current emphasis on aggregated analysis may contribute little to practically implementing programs that will contribute to sustainable socio-ecological wellbeing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The concern for inequality, growth and development is undoubtedly crucial in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, most studies either rely on the nation-state estimates of carbon emissions to propose a uniform nation-wide growth (or degrowth) strategy, or they tailor the method to assess the inequality of one country at a time, making a cross-country cross-income comparison difficult. To fill this analytical gap, we synthesize the existing methods of emission calculations and calculate the level of carbon emissions associated with given income deciles of household consumption in five countries, namely China, Germany, India, the UK and USA. We find that the within-country inequality varies among countries, with the ratio between the top and bottom income deciles ranging from three to nine at the household level. We also find that the carbon emissions of the top income group in urban China is almost comparable to that of their peer group in the US, UK and Germany. Based on these results, we discuss the use of the remaining global carbon budget in the context of development and inequality.

AB  - The recent emergence of the Fairtrade certification of gold in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa promises a radical new direction for the environmental governance of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). In doing so, it aims to tackle the longstanding environment and development challenges of the sector which mainstream policy has failed to alleviate. The move towards more responsible ASM practices is premised on the strategic deployment of a Fair Trade discourse that argues for its operators to be recognized not as criminals, but as valued and formalized parts of their broader economies. It is argued in this paper that this development intervention should be read within a social and environmental justice framework, one which directly answers the call from political geography for 'compelling accounts' of positive representations of the sector. Through a discourse analysis of 10 years of media reports, interviews and recorded life histories of key ASM and Fair Trade stakeholders in Tanzania, it shows how three strands of justice (conceptualized in terms of fairer distribution, procedure and recognition) are articulated by the Fair Trade gold movement and critically assesses the polities behind such a deliberate strategy. In particular, it argues that recognition is a key part of justice that has been underplayed by erstwhile analyses of Fair Trade. Through a case study of Tanzania, it is concluded that although significant progress has been made in terms of arguing for greater recognition for ASM operators, there remains a need to better link discourse with practice in establishing greater distributional justice.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide further clarity to the technical and policy difficulties associated with mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by identifying and distilling the core tensions which propagate and animate them. We argue that these complexities exist across four critical dimensions: the epistemological, the ethical, the political, and the practical. Adequately confronting the challenge of agricultural emissions will require improved transparency in emissions measurement, increased science communication, enhanced public participatory mechanisms, and the integration of ethical deliberation in scientific and policy discussions.

AB  - The potential benefits and harms of genetically modified food constitute a topic that inspires debate. Controversies over GM food reflect an interrelationship between social, political, and corporate forces. Among the societal agents disseminating information on GM food, NGOs' discourses play a crucial role in constructing perspectives and building agendas. The present study explored NGOs' discourses to determine how GM food is represented in Taiwanese society. We analyzed the three major NGOs in this field: Homemakers United Foundation, Homemakers Union Consumers Co-op, and NoGMO-Lunch. By collecting their pamphlets, books, publications, and website posts related to GM food from 1998 through mid-2017, a total of 482 articles underwent qualitative inductive analysis. The results showed that in addition to addressing uncertainties about health risks, claims that GM foods harm society on a worldwide scale are related to sustainability, ethics, and politics. The analyzed NGOs have attempted to promote consciousness of environmental sustainability among farmers and the general public by emphasizing that planting GM food could destroy the ecological balance and be detrimental to environmental justice. Consumption ethics has also been emphasized by encouraging people to refuse to buy or eat GM food. More crucially, in terms of political concerns, the analyzed NGOs have framed the development and implications of GM food as results of collusion within the `government-scientist-enterprise complex.' Furthermore, war metaphors have been used to describe how by importing GM food, the government had retreated from the defensive line of guarding public health. Discourse is a strategic resource by which NGOs can empower farmers and the public and contend with governments and enterprises. By using specific phrasing and metaphors and introducing scientific terminology, NGOs can act as meaning architects and knowledge brokers to potentially increase their influence over how topics are defined and reach the level of legitimacy required to further participate in the policymaking arena.

AB  - The profession of social work is committed to social justice issues, and part of this mission includes the environment. Specifically, the Council on Social Work Education supports equality in environmental justice, ecological unity among species, and using ecological resources in a responsible way. However, a dearth exists in the literature with regard to social work students' concern about the environment and what predicts their support. This study sought to redress this gap. Social work students (N = 724) from programs throughout the country were surveyed about their environmental beliefs and behaviors. An ordinary least squares regression indicated that holding more liberal political beliefs, identifying as a nonreligious individual, placing greater personal importance on environmental issues, participating in environmentally conscious behaviors, espousing greater confidence in scientists' understanding of climate change, and being older were associated with greater environmental concern, and these variables explained 51.5% of the variance. Greater inclusion of environmental justice and avenues for advocacy that create social change should be part of the social work curricula if practitioners who are ready for this area of practice across the micro-macro continuum are to be developed.

AB  - There is now wide recognition that grassroots community organizing is a uniquely necessary approach for contending with the persistent and escalating socioeconomic inequities that manifest as disparities across many societal domains, including housing, safety, education, and mental and physical health. The articles in this special issue report findings from studies designed to increase understanding of community organizing processes and produce actionable knowledge that can enhance these and other similar efforts to create more equitable and just cities and regions. These studies examine a variety of community organizing campaigns, initiatives, and networks in North America, as well as one in Bulgaria, and one in South Africa. These groups are building social power and demanding economic, racial, educational, and environmental justice. In this introductory article, we highlight some of the themes that emerge from this set of studies and make recommendations for future roles that research can play in advancing collective understanding and the practical objectives of grassroots organizing initiatives.

AB  - The Anthropocene raises two interrelated problems for the Australian environment movement. The first concerns the movement's normative and political relationship to non-human nature: climate change in particular is forcing an urgent reconsideration of how nature is to be understood and managed. The second problem concerns the implications of full recognition of the rights of First Peoples for environmental justice. These issues may lead to crises of identity, legitimacy, and effectiveness for the Australian movement. The normative bases upon which Australian environmentalists may draw in order to protect nature' in the Anthropocene are discussed. Setting aside the simple emancipatory ambition of preservationist environmentalism and the Australian movement's earlier Romantic protectionism, a new pragmatic, pluralistic environmental politics - based on precaution, the avoidance of pain and suffering, and protection of the most vulnerable - is suggested.

AB  - The concept of a 'just transition' positions justice concerns of workers, front-line communities, and other marginalized groups at the center of sustainability efforts. However, related scholarship has largely neglected conflicts that arise between sustainability and justice goals. A framework is developed to identify three main tensions that planners and activists may encounter in efforts to advance a just transition. First, the 'sustainability-inclusivity' tension involves conflicts between rapid and bold policy action in time-sensitive contexts and inclusive governance processes. Second, the 'sustainability-recognition' tension involves conflicts between sustainability performance and recognition of diverse value systems and rights. Third, the 'sustainability-equity' tension involves conflicts between achieving sustainability performance and equitable distribution of benefits and burdens. Identifying and intentionally responding to such tensions is crucial to advance a just transition in the context of growing domestic and international inequality, the erosion of worker rights, and a warming climate.

AB  - Suppose the present generation leaves future ones with a world depleted of all the natural resources required for many valuable human pursuits. Has the present generation acted unjustly? According to contemporary theories of liberal egalitarian intragenerational and intergenerational justice, the answer, it appears, is no. The explanation for this verdict lies in the liberal commitment to remaining neutral between different ways of life: many value-laden environmental sites and species are not an all-purpose means to any reasonable human end and so their existence is not directly relevant in an assessment of whether justice obtains. Against this view, I argue that a commitment to neutrality and its underlying justification - the idea that individuals should be equipped to live lives of their own design - in fact supports the opposite conclusion. If justice requires that citizens can pursue whatever way of life they do or might value, then it will also demand the continued existence of the natural resources necessary for those pursuits.

AB  - The World Commission on Environment and Development adopted and legitimated the idea of sustainable development in its report Our Common Future. Without substantiation, WCED claimed that economic growth and environmental protection were compatible. The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro adopted the idea, without further testing, as its intellectual core. Since 1992, the United Nations, the United States, and many other nations have created agencies to track progress toward sustainable development. In favor of the idea are individuals, including, it appears, most economists, who advocate centralization, internationalization, and rapid economic development. The opposition consists principally of people from academic disciplines, especially ecologists and humanists. This group does not communicate effectively, but if it did, it might agree that: economic development and environmental protection are not compatible; insistence by economists that all natural resources be given a dollar value is useless, if not harmful; biodiversity has intrinsic value; sustainable development weakens local autonomy; and social welfare is a key component of environmental health. To strengthen the defense of ecosystems, ecologists, humanists, and others should apply their knowledge to practical environmental problems. By making their knowledge accessible in local political arenas, they will concurrently shore up the ability of local units to protect their environments and speak with force in larger political arenas. All proponents of environmental health must become advocates of environmental justice.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review data from two Superfund sites and describe the latitude of interpretation of "environmental risk" by residents living in the area, governmental agencies, and the media. The first community was located within a 5-mi perimeter of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) outside Denver, Colorado. The second community was located on the south side of Tucson, Arizona, adjacent to the Tucson International Airport area (TIAA) Superfund site. Critical theory was the perspective used in this analysis and proposal of public health actions to attain social justice. Differences between the two populations' experiences with risk and contamination coincided with divergent levels of trust in government. RFETS residents demanded monitoring, whereas the minority residents at TIAA were ambivalent about their trust in government cleanup activities. Unraveling the purpose of "facts" and the social force of "truth" can direct nurses to address environmental justice issues. By policing governmental and business activities in halting or cleaning up environmental contamination, nurses may become mouthpieces for the concerns underlying the fragile surface of "virtual trust" in contaminated communities. Cutting through competing rhetoric to police environmental safety, the core function of assurance becomes what nurses do , not what they say.

AB  - The abrupt climate change thesis suggests that climate passes through threshold transitions, after which change is sudden, runaway and un-stoppable. This concurs with recent themes in complexity studies. Data from ice cores indicates that major shifts in global climate regimes have occurred in as little as a decade, and that for most of the span of human existence the climate has oscillated much more violently than it has over the last 10,000 years. This evidence presents enormous challenges for international climate change negotiation and regulation, which has thus far focused on gradual change. It is argued that existing social theoretic engagements with physical agency are insufficiently geared towards dissonant or disastrous physical events. Wagering on the past and future importance of abrupt climate change, the article explores a way of engaging with catastrophic climatic change that stresses the inherent volatility and unpredictability of earth process, and the no-less-inherent vulnerability of the human body. Drawing on Bataille and Derrida, it proposes a way of nestling the issue of environmental justice within a broader sense of immeasurable indebtedness to those humans who endured previous episodes of abrupt climate change, and considers the idea of experimentation and generosity without reserve.

AB  - The relationship between urbanization and the natural environment has never been the focus of an environmental sociological study. This article is an initial attempt to address that gap. First, in the introduction, the author discusses how early traditional urban sociologists and human ecologists variably expressed the human exemptionalism paradigm when examining urbanization. Then, in the body of the article, the author provides an overview of the struggle in environmental sociology to find connections between urbanization and the natural environment. The main focus is on how environmental sociologists have theorized the environmental impact of urbanization, although other relevant topics (e.g., environmental justice in the city) are briefly addressed. Through the course of the article, several principles are developed to help guide a future environmental sociology of urbanization. In the conclusion, the author cites research done by other social and natural scientists to further elaborate on these principles.

AB  - The combined sea port of Los Angeles and Long Beach in California constitutes the second busiest port in the United States by shipping volume. Communities near the ports face environmental justice concerns from a variety of sources including roadway and port related activities. This study examines the transport and diffusion of PM2.5 and NOX in port communities using the high-resolution plume model AERMOD, incorporating surface and aloft observed meteorology and local topography. Pollution impacts of roadway related emissions, direct port activity of cargo handling equipment and commercial shipping vessels are modeled for representative cold and hot months in 2005. Predictions from roadway emissions are compared with the same episode modeled with CALINE4 line dispersion model. Results show high spatial variability as well as increased transport during cold months. In addition, research also shows that while the port activity significantly impacts in-port air pollution, the effects of port activity is limited to within 2-6 km of the ports. Port adjacent communities are most sensitive to roadway related emissions. AERMOD PM2.5 and NOX predictions show a peak correlation coefficient of 43% and 50% compared with observations, respectively. (c) Author(s) 2011.

AB  - The preservation of biodiversity, city-dwellers' quality of life and equality are major issues in promoting sustainable cities. We chose to work at the built-up and much-valued heart of an agglomeration: Paris. We attempt to verify whether public semi-natural spaces with spontaneous vegetation and green frames provide ecosystem services to city-dwellers in an equitable way, and what is the role played by urban landscapes in this relation. Based upon existing datasets, a spatial and statistical analysis of relationships between public semi-natural spaces, urban landscapes and socioeconomic profiles of households was carried out. We compare their spatial patterns, which vary considerably. Mean income per vegetal and landscape cluster and correlations between income, ecological parameters and building density show complex and non-linear relationships. According to Multiple Correspondence Analysis, clusters of public semi-natural spaces. floristic richness and ecological diversity are associated with specific household socioeconomic profiles and landscape design. In the western built-up Haussmann districts inhabited by well-off households, public semi natural spaces provide low ecosystem services. Conversely, in the eastern and peripheral quarters where lower-income households live, public semi-natural spaces provide higher ecosystem services. It is not only well-off households which benefit from being close to urban parks and waterways. Blue and green frames cross districts inhabited by different household profiles. The implications of such results on inequalities between city-dwellers depends whether the presence of public semi-natural spaces actually improves their quality of life. These results are highly significant at a time when urban planners are putting the city's Biodiversity Plan in place. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Theories of epidemiologic transition analyze the shift in causes of mortality due to changes in risk factors over time, and through processes of urbanization and development by comparing risk factors between countries or over time. These theories do not account for health inequities such as those resulting from environmental injustice, in which minority and lower income residents are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards or have less access to environmental goods. Neighborhoods with histories of environmental injustice are also at risk for gentrification as they undergo environmental improvements and new greening projects. We aimed to understand how environmental injustice, urban renewal and green gentrification could inform the understanding of epidemiologic risk transitions. We examined 7 case neighborhoods in cities in the United States and Western Europe which were representative in terms of city region and type, which 1) had experienced a history of environmental injustice and 2) exhibited evidence of recent processes of urban renewal and/or gentrification. In each city, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 172) with city representatives, activists, nonprofits, developers and residents. Respondents reported health implications of traditional (heavy pollutants, poor social conditions), transitional (decontamination, new amenities), new (gentrification, access to amenities), and emerging (displacement, climate-related risks, re-emergence of traditional exposures) exposures. Respondents reported renewed, complexified and overlapping exposures leading to poor mental and physical health and to new patterns of health inequity. Our findings point to the need for theories of environmental and epidemiologic risk transitions to incorporate analysis of trends 1) on a city-scale, acknowledging that segregation and patterns of environmental injustice have created unequal conditions within cities and 2) over a shorter and more recent time period, taking into account worsening patterns of social inequity in cities.

AB  - Spending time outdoors in natural environments is associated with an array of benefits to individuals' health and wellbeing, as well as being implicated in the development of connections to the natural world, attachment to place, and environmental stewardship behaviours. Disparities between population subgroups in relation to frequency of nature contact may, however, shape the extent to which natural environments deliver benefits to marginalised population subgroups. In this paper we examine disparities in contact with nature amongst the adult population of Scotland, UK using cross-sectional data from the Scottish Household Survey (N = 19,441). The analysis proceeds to explore whether the observed 'gender gap' between men and women in nature contact persists across the intersections of population subgroups and geographies. The findings point to inequalities in contact with nature which should be considered in public policy agendas to promote use of natural environments across urban and rural areas. The findings also highlight the value of adopting intersectional perspectives in the consideration of environmental justice issues surrounding access to natural environments.

AB  - Several key studies have found that a small minority of producers, polluting at levels far exceeding group averages, generate the majority of overall exposure to industrial toxics. Frequently, such patterns go unnoticed and are understudied outside of the academic community. To our knowledge, no research to date has systematically described the scope and extent of extreme variations in industrially based exposure estimates and sought to link inequities in harm produced to inequities in exposure. In an analysis of all permitted industrial facilities across the United States, we show that there exists a class of hyper-polluters-the worst-of-the-worst-that disproportionately expose communities of color and low income populations to chemical releases. This study hopes to move beyond a traditional environmental justice research frame, bringing new computational methods and perspectives aimed at the empirical study of societal power dynamics. Our findings suggest the possibility that substantial environmental gains may be made through selective environmental enforcement, rather than sweeping initiatives.

AB  - The distributive environmental justice literature has expanded beyond examining only race- and class-based injustices, but no studies have focused on religion's influence on disparate environmental risks. We address that gap using data from the decennial U.S. Census, American Community Survey, and Environmental Protection Agency for 2010 census tracts to examine a proxy measure of Mormon prevalence, racial and ethnic composition, and socioeconomic status as predictors of seven indicators of outdoor air pollution in metropolitan Salt Lake City, Utah. Results from multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses show that greater Mormon prevalence and white composition each independently predict lower levels of air pollution; moreover, Mormon prevalence and whiteness are the strongest predictors in the models. Results also demonstrate that greater proportions of Hispanic, black, and Pacific Islander residents predict higher levels of air pollution, suggesting that systemic white privilege oppresses those groups such that they experience air pollution disparities. Mormons are socially privileged in Salt Lake City, and findings indicate that their collective power serves to protect them from air pollution. Exploratory GEE interaction analyses reveal that disparities in exposure to particulate matter based on higher Hispanic composition are attenuated under conditions of high Mormon prevalence. Findings indicate that white privilege or racial oppression and Mormon privilege operate distinctively and, to a lesser degree, interactively as determinants of distributive environmental injustices in Salt Lake City. Although affiliation with a contextually dominant religion (Mormonism) among residents in Salt Lake City shapes neighborhood patterns of environmental inequality, future studies should examine the role of religion in both producing and ameliorating environmental injustice.

AB  - The United Nations' invocation of 'human security' a generation ago promised a world increasingly governed by a 'people-centred' security agenda. In this paper we focus on arguably the most vital global security challenge faced throughout the planet today: climate resilience. We outline how advancing smart climate action and securing climate resilience can be aided by securitization practices that recall the earlier emphases of the United Nations' human security concept. The paper draws upon evidence from the Caribbean as a territory defined dominantly as part of the Global South, yet offering vital knowledge of productive climate security governance that can be instructive to the Global North. The impacts of global warming are particularly evident for the people of small island developing states such as those located in the Caribbean. By analysing the case of Cuba as a country increasingly resilient to extreme weather events, and by interrogating the genealogy of the broader Caribbean's hurricane culture, we show how an effective human security vision for climate justice and resilience can be achieved by recognizing and integrating the valuable forms of locally attuned knowledge that continue to emerge and coalesce in vulnerable geographies.

AB  - Social science-environmental health (SS-EH) research takes many structural forms and contributes to a wide variety of topical areas. In this article we discuss the general nature of SS-EH contributions and offer a new typology of SS-EH practice that situates this type of research in a larger transdisciplinary sensibility: (1) environmental health science influenced by social science; (2) social science studies of environmental health; and (3) social science-environmental health collaborations. We describe examples from our own and others' work and we discuss the central role that research centers, training programs, and conferences play in furthering SS-EH research. We argue that the third form of SS-EH research, SS-EH collaborations, offers the greatest potential for improving public and environmental health, though such collaborations come with important challenges and demand constant reflexivity on the part of researchers.

AB  - The development of major infrastructure projects, such as power stations, waste facilities or transport networks, commonly raises concerns of how to ensure environmental justice within policy and planning. Environmental justice has been divergently theorised, though procedural/participative, distributive and recognition-related elements are commonly cited. With growing inter-disciplinarity between normative ethics and the geographic social sciences, there is a renewed interest in the scalar aspects of environmental justice (particularly in relation to infrastructure projects)-how the framing of environmental decisions at multiple and conflicting scales results in disparities between locally affected communities, and regional and national decision-making authorities. In analysing this problem, the paper has three principal aims. The first is to outline the problem of scalar environmental justice. The second is to explore a practical case of scalar environmental justice, by examining the decision-making processes surrounding radioactive waste management in the UK. The third is to outline a new concept of "scalar parity" derived from the radioactive waste policy process, whereby local communities and regional and national political stakeholders are charged with balancing their competing interests through the "fulcrum" of a partnership organisation, to fairly resolve environmental justice disputes. This scalar parity model is used as an exemplar of good practice in environmental justice resolution that could be applied to other major infrastructure projects.

AB  - Shale gas has become an energy policy priority in the United Kingdom in light of profitable extraction activities in the United States. Since 2012 the Coalition Government has created key economic drivers to encourage shale exploration, whilst growing activism in affected site communities has stirred significant media and academic commentary. This study examines the growing national debate as a matter of discourse, adopting an argumentative discourse analytic approach to assess data collected from stakeholder interviews (n=21) and key policy actor statements quoted in broadsheet newspapers. We explore three dominant "storylines" emerging in relation to shale gas policy: (1) "cleanliness and dirt" concerns the relative framing of the environmental benefits and harms of shale gas; (2) "energy transitions - pathways and diversions" concerns geographic metaphors of transitions to carbon intensive and low-carbon energy systems; and (3) "geographies of environmental justice" concerns divisions of economic benefit distribution, environmental impact and procedural fairness. We find that central government policy rhetoric emphasises economic development, regulatory oversight and distribution of benefits to site communities, whilst minimising discussion of the implications of shale gas for anthropogenic climate change. The role of these discourses in influencing shale gas policy is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several recent papers have sought to apply inequality measures from economics, such as the Atkinson Index (AI) for inequality of income distributions, to compare the risk inequality of different mortality risk distributions in an effort to help promote efficiency and environmental justice in pollution-reducing interventions. Closer analysis suggests that such applications are neither logically coherent nor necessarily ethically desirable. Risk inequality comparisons should be based on axioms that apply to probabilistic risks, and should consider the multidimensional and time-varying nature of individual and community risks in order to increase efficiency and justice over time and generations. In light of the limitations of the AI applied to mortality risk distributions, it has not been demonstrated to have ethical or practical value in helping policymakers to identify air pollution management interventions that reduce (or minimize) risk and risk inequity.

AB  - Societies once could choose between changing direction or dealing with climatic disaster; now it is necessary to do both at once. The best-laid plans for mitigation would be hard enough to fulfill in a stable climate, but they will be vastly harder in the climate chaos ahead. If simultaneous mitigation and adaptation are still achievable, such a difficult balance cannot also take on the burden of supporting unrestrained economic growth. The failing efforts so far have been dominated by a search for synergistic ways to mitigate, adapt, and grow economies at the same time, while wishing away the predictable trade-offs between these goals. Wealthy polluting countries have enforced this optimistic spirit in international climate debates, in part to counter the language of loss and damage, which they have seen as a direct challenge. Key to their effort has been a reframing of adaptation that flips the focus from the vulnerability of exposed populations to their resilience. However, the reality of implementing plans for resilience is running into problems, and those populations are instead taking up the banner of climate justice. Debt- and disaster-plagued Puerto Rico illustrates the failure of both adaptation and mitigation through growth and the promise of climate justice as a means to articulate other forms of balance.

In particular, these articles focus on the community engagement cores (CECs) that work with affected communities as part the Superfund Research Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The purpose of this closing article is to highlight important themes evident across the eight articles in the special issue. When considered together, the findings reveal important lessons learned about community engagement and environmental communication, but also reveal that much more remains to be known. Recommendations are made for how these teams can continue to practice, reflect on, and research community engagement in ways that build toward a better understanding and implementation of best practices.

AB  - The Aamjiwnaang First Nations community is located in Canada's 'Chemical Valley' situated in southwest Ontario near Sarnia. Mercury pollution in the region has been known since the 1940s but little is known about levels in the environment and area residents. The current study, using ecological and human exposure assessment methods, was conducted at the community's request to help fill these gaps. First, Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory and the U.S. Toxics Release Inventory were queried to investigate mercury releases from area facilities. In 2010, 700 pounds of mercury were emitted into the air, 25 pounds were released into water bodies, and 93 thousand pounds were disposed of on-site via underground injections or into landfills, and together these show continued releases into the region. Second, mercury levels were measured in stream sediment and nearby soil from sites at Aamjiwnaang (n = 4) and off Reserve (n = 19) in Canada and the U.S. during three seasons that spanned 2010-2011. Total mercury in sediment across all sites and sampling seasons ranged from 5.0 to 398.7 mu g/kg, and in soils ranged from 1.2 to 696.2 mu g/kg. Sediment and soil mercury levels at Aamjiwnaang were higher than the reference community, and Aamjiwnaang's Talfourd Creek site had the highest mercury levels. Third, a biomonitoring study was performed with 43 mother-child pairs. Hair (mean +/- SD of all participants: 0.18 +/- 0.16 mu g/g) and blood (1.6 +/- 2.0 mu g/L) mercury levels did not differ between participants studied on-and off-Reserve, likely because of limited seafood intake (<1 serving/week). Urine mercury levels (0.5 +/- 0.8 mu g/L) were significantly higher (1.5-2.5 times) in mother-child pairs living on-Reserve versus those living off-Reserve. In general, the study links evidence of mercury sources, environmental fate, and human exposures, and in doing so it shows that mercury levels in ecological and human samples are similar to values found in other areas, though there are some trends and evidence of contamination at Aamjiwnaang that warrant attention.

AB  - Since the collapse of communism, countries in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced significant socio-economic changes that have affected the urban landscape and the spatial organization of cities. These pro -cesses have also generated significant changes in the availability of urban green spaces for local residents, resulting in new forms of inequalities. In the light of recent debate on socio-spatial segregation, the concept of environmental justice has gained increasing attention. Using three Hungarian post-socialist cities as case studies, this paper explores the relationship between different types of residential areas in terms of the age, education, and income level of people, and the availability of urban green spaces. To do this, we introduce a demand-supply composite index that contains featured indicators of urban green space availability. The results show that in terms of UGS availability, major disparities exist both among different socio-economic groups and different types of neighbourhoods in the investigated cities. Although legacies of the past are still important, the emerging disparities of green space availability can be linked to new forms of segregation including highly segregated neighbourhoods of urban poor and the new upmarket housing developments of the affluent. Our results also suggest that regardless of local governments' recebt efforts to provide residents with equal access to urban green spaces, environmental justice remains a concern for urban planning in post-socialist cities.

AB  - The rise of urban populations has rendered cities in both developed and developing countries vulnerable to poor health and diseases that are associated with urban living conditions and environments. Therefore, there is a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or mitigates health outcomes, and as such the solution for improving health outcomes in urban settings can be found in addressing socio-environmental factors that shape urban environments. Land tenure security is a social environmental factor of health that has been understudied by urban geographers despite its obvious role in shaping urban environments, housing conditions, and health. We interpret literature and infer possible pathways through which land tenure security connects to health and propose a land tenure security and health nexus conceptual framework for modeling and investigating the extent of this connection. Based on a narrative review of literature, this inter-disciplinary paper shows that land tenure security can influence health outcomes via four pathways-infrastructure access, environmental justice, psycho-ontological security, and social cohesion. Going forward, a subsequent investigation can focus on developing an index of land tenure security health insults, based on which an empirical investigation of the relationship between land tenure security and health disease is possible.

AB  - The "Plantationocene" has gained traction in the environmental humanities as a way of conceptualizing the current era otherwise nominated as the Anthropocene, Capitalocene, or the Chthulucene. For Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing, and their interlocutors, the concept suggests that our current ecological crisis is rooted in logics of environmental modernization, homogeneity, and control, which were developed on historical plantations. This paper argues that, while there is indeed a need to analyze the ways in which the plantation past shapes the present, current discussions of the Plantationocene have several crucial limitations. Here, we focus on two: first, the current multispecies framing conceptualizes the plantation largely as a system of human control over nature, obscuring the centrality of racial politics; and second, the emerging Plantationocene discussion has yet to meaningfully engage with the wide variety of existing critiques of the plantation mode of development. Thus, we draw on a deep well of Black geographic and ecological work that provides a powerful challenge to the ongoing colonial-racial legacies of the plantation, prompting consideration of white supremacy, capitalist development, and (mis)characterizations of what it means to be human. These approaches not only reveal a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the role of the plantation in current global crises but also highlight ongoing struggles and the possibilities of ecological justice in the future.

AB  - The study of water as a K-12 science idea often divorces its properties from its deeply politicized history as a resource that has been limited, compromised, and intentionally withheld from nondominant communities. Although a robust body of scholarship has aptly critiqued decontextualized and depoliticized pedagogies and called for critical science-learning environments designed through the lens of equity, historicity, and power, more insight is needed into how children develop in relation to these design imperatives and within sociopolitical contexts where environmental issues pose a direct threat. We report select findings from a 2-year ethnographic project that investigated Black student agency in a school with a place-based design. Specifically, we hone in on the themes of water and water justice, which inspired the development of a socio-scientific unit enacted in two 4th-/5th-grade classrooms. This unit coincided with the initial spike in public awareness around the still unresolved water crisis in Flint, MI. For this article, we situate the "Flint" module as an illustrative case of justice-centered science pedagogy and analyze Black students' disciplinary, affective, and sociopolitical understandings. We found that children's meaning-making shifted from individualized accounts to critical, systemic explanations of environmental justice issues. The saliency of children's affective understandings throughout the unit was also captured. We expound on these findings and conclude with a discussion of implications, particularly as it relates to the ethics and politics of developing critical scientific capacity in young children to confront lived environmental human rights issues.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it presents a pluralistic framework for justice that combines an expanded interpretation of distributive justice with concerns for recognition, participation, capability, and responsibility. It argues that the latter has not attracted the scholarly attention that it deserves in the environmental justice debate. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how this multidimensional framework can be applied in practice to inform practical judgments about particular environmental justice claims by using an example of traffic-related air pollution in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom.

AB  - Since late 2018, a global wave of mobilization under the banners of Fridays For Future (FFF) and Extinction Rebellion (XR) has injected new energy into global climate politics. FFF and XR took the world by storm, but have now been forced into (partial) latency as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. We believe this moment presents an opportunity for reflection. In particular, FFF and XR have been depicted as 'new' forms of climate activism. However, we argue that the extent to which these campaigns represent 'new' forms of climate activism is really a matter for closer investigation. In this Profile, we therefore reflect on the distinctiveness of the 'new climate activism' as compared to previous climate campaigns. Reviewing previous studies and our own research, we find that there are both elements of change and continuity in who participates and how, and that the main change appears to be the use of a more politically 'neutral' framing of climate change that is directed more strongly at state than non-state actors.

AB  - The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change confirmed that the controversial reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation scheme, known as REDD+, will play a central role in the post-2020 climate regime. This review essay considers a recent Handbook dedicated to exploring the relationship between REDD+ and different areas of international law, which comprehensively brings together expertise on many diverse areas of international legal practice, including trade and investment, contractual and fiduciary risk as well as human rights considerations. While this valuable collection will surely become an indispensable 'toolbox' for practitioners and academics working on questions pertaining to REDD+, this review highlights some of the more complex methodological and political questions REDD+ raises and their implications for how REDD+ is characterized and its effects understood. It foregrounds the critiques by grassroots indigenous and climate justice activists, some of whom have argued that REDD+ represents a form of 'green grabbing' or 'CO(2)onialism'. Additionally, it suggests that further investigation is needed into how REDD+ establishes, stabilizes and consolidates new forms of power relations and modes of authority as well greater consideration of the distributional consequences of carbon markets and their allocations of differentiated privileges, obligations and responsibilities.

AB  - The present article analyses a unique database of 220 dam-related environmental conflicts, retrieved from the Global Atlas on Environmental Justice (EJAtlas), and based on knowledge co-production between academics and activists. Despite well-known controversial, social, and environmental impacts of dams, efforts to increase renewable energy generation have reinstated the interest into hydropower development globally. People affected by dams have largely denounced such 'unsustainabilities' through collective non-violent actions. Nevertheless, we found that repression, criminalization, violent targeting of activists and assassinations are recurrent features of conflictive dams. Violent repression is particularly high when indigenous people are involved. Indirect forms of violence are also analysed through socio-economic, environmental, and health impacts. We argue that increasing repression of the opposition against unwanted energy infrastructures does not only serve to curb specific protest actions, but also aims to delegitimize and undermine differing understanding of sustainability, epistemologies, and world views. This analysis cautions that allegedly sustainable renewables such as hydropower often replicates patterns of violence within a frame of an 'extractivism of renewables'. We finally suggest that co-production of knowledge between scientists, activists, and communities should be largely encouraged to investigate sensitive and contentious topics in sustainability studies.

AB  - The recent phenomenon of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) is associated with what has been described as a global agrarian transition. New forms of land exploitation and concentration have led to profound socioenvironmental transformations of rural production systems in Latin America, South-East Asia and Sub Saharan Africa. Scholars have pointed out that the expansion of transnational land investments is often associated with detrimental social outcomes, has negative environmental impacts and can represent a potential impediment to the achievement of many SDGs. In this paper, our primary concern is on the mounting evidence that LSLAs preferentially target the commons, in the process altering long-standing customary resource governance systems. While it has been shown that in many instances of commons grabbing associated with LSLAs, different types of social conflict emerge, it is less clear what forms of social mobilization and organized collective re-actions are taking place to defend the commons and contest such processes of dispossession and enclosure. The main aim of this contribution is to fill this gap by synthesizing and describing the different typologies of social mobilization and collective re-actions that emerge as a result of commons grabbing associated with the transnational expansion of the agribusiness frontier. In order to do this our research synthesizes information from the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas) shedding light on some of the key characteristics associated with the different forms and dynamics of social mobilization that are organized in reaction to agribusiness-related commons grabbing.

AB  - There is emerging evidence that links exposure to toxic environmental agents and adverse reproductive and developmental health outcomes. Toxic exposures related to reproductive and developmental health primarily have been associated with infertility and miscarriage, obstetric outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight, neurodevelopmental delay such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and adult and childhood cancer. Although there is substantial overlap in the type of exposure and the associated health outcomes, for the purposes of this document, exposures can be generally grouped into the following categories: toxic chemicals, air pollution, and climate change-related exposures. Obstetric care clinicians do not need to be experts in environmental health science to provide useful information to patients and refer patients to appropriate specialists, if needed, when a hazardous exposure is identified. It is important for obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care clinicians to become knowledgeable about toxic environmental exposures that are endemic to their specific geographic areas, such as local water safety advisories (eg, lead-contaminated water), local air quality levels, and patients' proximity to power plants and fracking sites. Although exposure to toxic environmental agents is widespread across populations, many environmental factors that are harmful to reproductive health disproportionately affect underserved populations and are subsumed in issues of environmental justice. Clinical encounters offer an opportunity to screen and counsel patients in during the prepregnancy and prenatal periods-particularly individuals most disproportionately affected-about opportunities to reduce toxic environmental health exposures. This Committee Opinion is revised to integrate more recent literature regarding reducing prepregnancy and prenatal toxic environmental exposures.

AB  - There is a growing global trend towards achieving net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases from port operations as consumers and governments become increasingly aware of the impacts of global climate change and ongoing environmental justice issues. However, the existing literature on the topic of zero-emissions ports is broad-based and focuses mainly on technology feasibility. Specifically, it provides insufficient guidance on how ports can best transition to zero emissions. To address this research gap, this review article examines the ongoing zero emissions planning documents and demonstration projects at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and presents the key lessons learned from those efforts to accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions cargo handling equipment in California. Increasingly, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are emerging as leaders with a sustainable circular strategy by implementing zero-emissions cargo handling equipment projects at a higher rate than any other ports in California, making these two ports an ideal case study to evaluate their endeavors to transition their operations to zero emissions. The findings of this review study suggest that transitioning to zero emissions cargo handling equipment across all California ports by 2035 is best achievable with: 1) a stronger collaboration between all key stakeholders, 2) the development of statewide regulations, 3) accelerated technology commercialization through increased demonstration projects and infrastructure standardization, 4) improved funding processes, 5) enhanced workforce training, and 6) increased resiliency planning. Although this evaluation and recommendations are largely California-specific, this article can be useful to policy-and decision makers around the world for transitioning to sustainable, net-zero emissions ports.

AB  - The capacity for the concept of climate debt to inform the response to climate change has been underappreciated. International Natural Debt (IND) is a measure of accountability for climate change that straightforwardly and transparently attributes radiative forcing from extant emissions of the two most significant climate active pollutants (CAPs) - carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane-to individual entities such as countries or sectors. Here, we demonstrate how the IND metric readily operationalizes climate debt for a diversity of purposes. We characterize the vast range spanned by the global distribution of IND in total and per capita terms. Then, in a manner akin to carbon intensity, we consider the "efficiency" with which countries have accumulated IND in their pursuit of expanding economic output and diminishing ill-health, revealing priorities and pathways for countries to more effectively convert their future climate debt into income and/or health gains. Next, we forecast the IND consequences from countries achieving the ambitious goal of decreasing their CAP emissions to 80% of 1990 levels by 2050, exposing how the composition of IND, determined by the magnitude and timing of historical emissions, constrains each country's capacity to reduce its climate debt. Lastly, we assess the IND implications from a hypothesized rapid displacement of coal by natural gas for power generation in the United States, identifying the combination of conditions under which such a substitution tilts positive or negative in terms of IND. These applications of IND reveal how the metric can both assess climate debt in comparison to other key metrics and investigate mitigation goals and strategies through scenario exercises. Ultimately, we seek to open an intellectual terrain for climate debt analyses and invite more participatory and inclusive discussions about the consequent political and economic implications of such a multiple CAP and accountability-based perspective.

AB  - The temporary decrease of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in many parts of the world due to the COVID-19 lockdown spurred discussions on urban air pollution and health. However there has been little focus on sub-Saharan Africa, as few African cities have air quality monitors and if they do, these data are often not publicly available. Spatial differentials of changes in PM2.5 concentrations as a result of COVID also remain largely unstudied. To address this gap, we use a serendipitous mobile air quality monitoring deployment of eight Sensirion SPS 30 sensors on motorbikes in the city of Nairobi starting on 16 March 2020, before a COVID-19 curfew was imposed on 25 March and continuing until 5 May 2020. We developed a random-forest model to estimate PM2.5 surfaces for the entire city of Nairobi before and during the COVID-19 curfew. The highest PM2.5 concentrations during both periods were observed in the poor neighborhoods of Kariobangi, Mathare, Umoja, and Dandora, located to the east of the city center. Changes in PM2.5 were heterogeneous over space. PM2.5 concentrations increased during the curfew in rapidly urbanizing, the lower-middle-class neighborhoods of Kahawa, Kasarani, and Ruaraka, likely because residents switched from LPG to biomass fuels due to loss of income. Our results indicate that COVID-19 and policies to address it may have exacerbated existing air pollution inequalities in the city of Nairobi. The quantitative results are preliminary, due to sampling limitations and measurement uncertainties, as the available data came exclusively from low-cost sensors. This research serves to highlight that spatial data that is essential for understanding structural inequalities reflected in uneven air pollution burdens and differential impacts of events like the COVID pandemic. With the help of carefully deployed low-cost sensors with improved spatial sampling and at least one reference-quality monitor for calibration, we can collect data that is critical for developing targeted interventions that address environmental injustice in the African context.

AB  - The amount of post-consumer textile waste (PCTW) generated annually in the United States has increased nearly ten-fold since the 1960s to exceed more than 34 billion pounds annually. Of the waste generated, 66% is sent to landfills, 19% is combusted with energy recovery, and only 15% is recycled. When left to decompose in landfills, PCTW decomposes, producing harmful leachates and greenhouse gases including methane. In this study, we used publicly available data from 67 counties in the state of Florida from 2014 to 2019 to assess how PCTW generation and recycling behaviors differ by area-level demographic, socioeconomic, and retail characteristics. We also used publicly available data on landfills to determine whether these same factors were associated with having more landfills per capita in a county. This study provides preliminary evidence that people living in areas with higher incomes, that are more racially segregated, and that have more clothing stores generate significantly more textile waste than people in other areas. In contrast, there were more landfills per capita in areas with lower incomes and fewer landfills per capita in areas that were more racially segregated. Textile recycling occurred at relatively uniform rates across counties. Taken together, these findings support the understanding that textile waste represents an issue of environmental injustice; wealthier communities contribute more PCTW to landfills, which are more commonly located in communities with lower socioeconomic status. Multipronged solutions are needed to produce relevant behavior change, including efforts and policies that seek to reduce textile consumption and increase textile recycling at the individual and societal level.

AB  - Road sediment is a pervasive environmental medium that acts as both source and sink for a variety of natural and anthropogenic particles and often is enriched in heavy metals. Road sediment is generally understudied in the United States (U.S.) relative to other environmental media and compared to countries such as China and the United Kingdom (U.K.). However, the U.S. is an ideal target for these studies due to the diverse climates and wealth of geochemical, socioeconomic, demographic, and health data. This review outlines the existing U.S. road sediment literature while also providing key international perspectives and context. Furthermore, the most comprehensive table of U.S. road sediment studies to date is presented, which includes elemental concentrations, sample size, size fraction, collection and analytical methods, as well as digestion procedure. Overall, there were observed differences in studies by sampling time period for elemental concentrations, but not necessarily by climate in the U.S. Other key concepts addressed in this road sediment review include the processes controlling its distribution, the variety of nomenclature used, anthropogenic enrichment of heavy metals, electron microscopy, health risk assessments, remediation, and future directions of road sediment investigations. Going forward, it is recommended that studies with a higher geographic diversity are performed that consider smaller cities and rural areas. Furthermore, environmental justice must be a focus as community science studies of road sediment can elucidate pollution issues impacting areas of high need. Finally, this review calls for consistency in sampling, data reporting, and nomenclature to effectively expand work on understudied elements, particles, and background sediments.

AB  - The Paris Agreement was largely viewed as a resounding success by those who took part in its negotiation. This paper examines whether these claims hold up to closer scrutiny. More specifically, the paper will assess whether the Paris Agreement protects the human right to health. Considering that the widely celebrated 1.5 degrees C target aims to protect present and future generations from the effects of climate change, which include substantial threats to human health, this is an especially pertinent area of study for climate justice theorists. Despite the threats climate change poses to human health, the subject of health has been somewhat neglected among climate justice scholars and policy makers alike. This paper illustrates that a focus on health can reveal much about the inadequacies of the Paris Agreement and multilateral climate change governance more widely. Unfolding in two parts, the paper first focuses on human health, explaining how this is threated by climate change and why a human rights based climate justice approach can highlight the importance of these threats and define what is morally required of policy makers. Part two of the paper turns to the assessment of the Paris Agreement, focusing on whether the policy makers who negotiated the Agreement have met these requirements. By briefly examining what has been promised in the Convention and what has been achieved under the Kyoto Protocol to date, the paper is able to assess whether the Paris Agreement represents a significant departure from the so far inadequate response to the climate change problem. It will be illustrated that although there has been a small step forward, the Paris Agreement cannot be said to represent a just response which protects the right to health of present and future generations.

AB  - The Trump administration's antienvironmental policies and its proclivity to dismiss evidence-based claims creates challenges for environmental politics in a warming world. This article offers the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) as a case study of one way to respond to this political moment. EDGI was started by a small group of Science and Technology Studies and environmental justice researchers and activists in the United States and Canada immediately after the November 2016 elections. Since then, EDGI has engaged in four primary activities: archiving Web pages and online scientific data from federal environmental agencies; monitoring changes to these agencies' Web sites; interviewing career staff at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration as a means of tracking changes within those agencies; and analyzing shifts in environmental policy. Through these projects and practices, EDGI members developed the concept of environmental data justice. Environmental data justice is deeply informed by feminist approaches to the politics of knowledge, especially in relation to critical data and archival studies. In this article we establish the theoretical basis for environmental data justice and demonstrate how EDGI enacts this framework in practice.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably changed people's lifestyles and demands for urban green space and public open space. The National Landscape Garden Cities in China (NLGCC) policy is one of the key development models in China aimed at building sustainable cities and society. In this paper, the development of the study's selection criteria and the significance and benefits of the NLGCC policy are first summarised. 391 cities were chosen from the NLGCC list to analyse the spatial distribution and construction of driving factors. The results show that the NLGCC's selection criteria have shifted from a focus on quantity to overall habitat quality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, city resilience has been examined more closely. The NLGCC policies have boosted to address ecological and environmental crises and enhanced urban disaster preparedness. The spatial distribution analysis shows that the NLGCC is spatially unevenly distributed and has a clustering trend. A total of 54.96% of the NLGCC is concentrated in China's eastern and central regions. The natural environment and socioeconomics are two main categories of driving factors. This study provides significant value to the understanding of the spatial pattern of the NLGCC offers a reference for decision-making about the construction of urban environments worldwide.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the potential of source water protection to address chronic challenges with small systems and rural drinking water provision. Such a planning and management approach to increasing safe drinking water access, however, will likely require leveraging multi-stakeholder collaborative governance venues to this effect. This paper investigates the prospects of doing so using the case of California's groundwater reform process known as the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act or SGMA. Interviews with drinking water stakeholders from small low-income communities in the San Joaquin Valley show how existing power and resource disparities limit the prospects of integrating rural drinking water priorities into regional planning. Long-term, more fundamental changes will be needed to meaningfully transform water management in this direction. Short-term state intervention is needed to protect equity and public good goals, raising potential contradictions between devolved water management and improved drinking water access that need to be addressed.

AB  - The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) requires facilities with 10 or more full-time employees that process > 25,000 pounds in aggregate or use > 10,000 pounds of any one TRI chemical to report releases annually. However, little is known about releases from non-TRI-reporting facilities, nor has attention been given to the very localized equity impacts associated with air toxics releases. Using geographic information systems and industrial source complex dispersion modeling, we developed methods for characterizing air releases from TRI-reporting as well as non-TRI-reporting facilities at four levels of geographic resolution. We characterized the spatial distribution and concentration of air releases from one representative industry in Durham County, North Carolina (USA). Inclusive modeling of all facilities rather than modeling of TRI sites alone significantly alters the magnitude and spatial distribution of modeled air concentrations. Modeling exposure receptors at more refined levels of geographic resolution reveals localized, neighborhood-level exposure hot spots that are not apparent at coarser geographic scales. Multivariate analysis indicates that inclusive facility modeling at fine levels of geographic resolution reveals exposure disparities by income and race. These new methods significantly enhance the ability to model air toxics, perform equity analysis, and clarify conflicts in the literature regarding environmental justice findings. This work has substantial implications for how to structure TRI reporting requirements, as well as methods and types of analysis that will successfully elucidate the spatial distribution of exposure potentials across geographic, income, and racial lines.

AB  - There is overwhelming consensus about the science of climate change. Climate politics, however, remains volatile, driven by perceptions of injustice, which motivate policy resistance and undermine policy legitimacy. We identify three types of injustice. The first pertains to the uneven exposure to climate change impacts across countries and communities within a country. Socially, politically, and economically disadvantaged communities that have contributed the least to the climate crisis tend to be affected the most. To address climate change and its impacts, countries and subnational units have enacted a range of policies. But even carefully designed mitigation and adaptation policies distribute costs (the second justice dimension) and benefits (the third justice dimension) unevenly across sectors and communities, often reproducing existing inequalities. Climate justice requires paying careful attention to who bears the costs and who gets the benefits of both climate inaction and action.

AB  - The residents of Kathmandu Valley in Nepal face increasing water shortages that worsen during the dry season. Against this situation, the Melamchi Water Supply megaproject, supported by several foreign investors, was launched in 2000 to quench Kathmanduties' thirst by bringing water from Melamchi River through a 26 km-long tunnel. After more than 10 years, progress has been very modest. Besides the political instability of the country, opposition from certain sectors of society in both the urban and rural settings has created continuous disruptions of the works. We draw on Urban Political Ecology and Environmental Justice frameworks to analyze two distinct, although interconnected, social struggles battling against the project. The first one, anchored in the urban sphere, took advantage of the entry of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoists, and succeeded in bringing down Asian Development Bank's (ADB) lending condition of handing over the water supply management to a private sector operator. The second one concerns the ongoing struggle of the rural residents affected by the inter-basin transfer. Local people in the rural areas mainly advocated conservation of their source of livelihood and political recognition. In the last part, we discuss how the use of local water sources and community-based alternatives may emerge as an alternative to hegemonic models of nature-society relations and contribute to overcome such conflicts and reduce negative impacts on the environment and social injustices.

Alongside the difficulties of upholding human rights, social justice and active citizenship, are those of affirming environmental justice and care for planet earth in and through social work practice and addressing climate change and other disasters. I call for social workers to take action that addresses these issues as a strong, united profession that works alongside dispossessed and marginalised people who do not get their share of global resources, despite their limited ecological footprint. I suggest a new paradigm for practice rooted in environmental justice that enhances the well-being of people, the flora, fauna and the ecosystem that sustains and supports us all - green social work, for practitioners supporting life in one interdependent world.

AB  - The corona pandemic is a medical catastrophe that is intricately intertwined with an epochal economic-ecological double or "pincer-grip" crisis - thus goes the central thesis of this contribution. COVID-19 is defined as an "external shock" followed by a deep recession. Leaving aside the natural process of viral mutation, the pandemic, recession and pincer-grip crisis can be understood as distinct repulsions of an hyperglobalization that is gradually undermining its own conditions of existence. Meanwhile, the recent rupture cannot be adequately grasped without taking into account the financial crash of 2007 to 2009, the political interregnum of the post-crisis years and the tendency towards bonapartistic democracy. By itself, the corona crisis will not lead to a "build back better"; the emergency state is hardly capable of such a setting of the course. Instead, there is a rising danger that fierce conflicts over distribution, increasing inequality and desolidarization will make a turn to sustainability even harder.

AB  - The Westlawn Partnership for a Healthier Environment (WPHE) is a longstanding group of community stakeholders that was formed over a decade ago to identify, prioritize, and address environmental health (EH) concerns in a low-income, predominantly African American, urban neighborhood, which faces a disproportionate burden of EH risks, particularly asthma. Launched by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of Nursing, which established a nurse-managed health center within the community 30 years ago, WPHE utilized the Protocol of Assessing Community Excellence in Environment Health methodology to develop, implement, and sustain the partnership. WPHE implemented programs for Healthy Homes, Healthy Day Cares, and bicycling, and made system and infrastructure changes within the community to address the top identified EH concerns: indoor and outdoor air pollution, mold exposure, access to safe and healthy food, and pesticide exposure. WPHE's efforts have resulted in significant local, state, and national policy impacts to promote environmental justice. This brief report shares how the partnership was formed, its priorities, major activities and accomplishments, and insights into sustaining a community-based EH partnership, including recommendations for the key role that public health nurses can play to promote environmental justice.

AB  - The benefit allocation of fair and justice is an inevitable guarantee for the long-term operation of the joint prevention and control of air pollution (JPCAP). The ignorance of interest demands of various governance subjects in the existing benefit allocation mechanism results in the widespread "free rider " behavior in the joint control and unsatisfactory effects of JPCAP. Given this, it is imperative to build a reasonable benefit allocation model. The innovation of this paper is proposing a benefit allocation model of JPCAP to achieve the symmetry between control costs and benefits based on environmental justice. The control objectives and total benefits of JPCAP are calculated through the adjustment of optimal removal rates. The interest demands of various control subjects and benefit compensation scheme are clarified by adopting an improved Shapley method, which comprehensively considers factors affecting environmental justice. An empirical analysis is conducted on SO2 governance in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and its surrounding areas. The results show that the benefit allocation model based on environmental justice can not only accurately evaluate the benefits of joint control, but also effectively achieve the symmetry between control costs and benefits. This study provides a scientific and reasonable theoretical basis for the benefit allocation of SO2 control and can be extended to the researches and practices of other air pollutants control.

AB  - The practices of the joint prevention and control of air pollution (JPCAP) present two disadvantages: the low enthusiasm of governance subjects and an unsatisfactory governance effect. Revealing the existing problems and exploring their causes has been a key issue for promoting JPCAP. Given this, we especially establish a two-stage dynamic game model for air pollution control to explore the advantages and dilemmas of JPCAP by analyzing changes in environmental tax rate and social welfare. The results show that the unfair distribution of social welfare among cities is a key reason for the unsatisfactory effect of JPCAP. Therefore, we improve JPCAP by considering both production-oriented and consumption-oriented pollutions based on environmental justice. In the improved JPCAP mode, the social welfare of each city is higher than that of non-joint control of air pollution (NJCAP), in which the increased degree is positively related to the city's negotiation ability. In addition, the consumption tax rate is negatively correlated with the negotiation ability of the central city and the trade transfer coefficient. This study not only provides a theoretical and methodological reference for formulating effective planning and compensation scheme for JPCAP but also can be extended to the practice and theoretical analysis of other cross-regional public issues.

AB  - The corporate control of energy production and the reach of fossil capital into civil and political society can be understood as a regime of obstruction that is preventing necessary action on climate change and blocking a just energy transition. In addition to overt forms of economic power and influence, hegemonic power is central to the fossil fuel industry's regime of obstruction. Based on 29 interviews and an analysis of third-party teaching resources, this article shows how teaching practices and resources work to centre, legitimize, and entrench a set of beliefs relating to climate change, energy, and environmentalism that align with the interests of fossil fuel industry actors in Saskatchewan, Canada. We argue that these pedagogical practices promote student subjectivities consistent with neoliberal environmentalism centred on individual actions designed to insulate fossil fuel industries from criticism and dissuade young people from questioning or understanding the role of corporate power in the climate crisis. Furthermore, this petro-pedagogy intends to restrict the imagination of possible climate solutions to individual acts of conservation that fail to challenge the structural growth of fossil fuel consumption. This paper advances these teaching practices and resources as a 'pedagogical arm' of the regime of obstruction.

AB  - Several theories have been proposed to explain societal environmental injustices. Studies based on standard statistical methods and empirical data are often limited in testing some of these theories. This is especially true when some potential reasons (eg, racism) for unjust environmental outcomes are invidious, and even individual-level methods (eg, surveys) are unlikely to be effective in detecting them. We use agent-based modeling to explore the circumstances under which racially defined environmental injustice occurs in a society. We test three competing theories of an environmental disamenity's location decision: cost factors alone, benign intention for the majority population, or malign intention for the minority population, along with three scenarios of residential similarity preferences. The simulation demonstrates that a purely neoclassical world-one in which firms and residents care only about costs-does not lead to environmental injustice. Nor does a similar world in which disamenity-producing firms seek to locate away from majority residents. Instead, two conditions led to societal environmental injustice: when disamenity-producing firms aim to locate near minorities or when residents prefer to live near other residents like themselves. In our model, a race-conscious society rather than just a collection of race-conscious firms produced significant levels of environmental injustice.

AB  - Several theories compete to explain observed race- and ethnicity-based environmental injustice in society. This paper focuses on analyzing the extent to which firms' siting decisions based on community privilege can explain this outcome. A unique feature of this analysis is that we include analysis of both unwanted land uses (disamenity firms) and desired land uses (amenity firms). The environmental justice analysis of amenities other than green spaces is rare, but amenities are crucial components of urban areas to which environmental justice studies must attend. We use an agent-based model to explore community outcomes when environmental disamenities choose locations based on low community privilege, and compare this with scenarios in which disamenities only seek to minimize the cost of land. We also assess differences in environmental justice outcomes when amenities choose locations in areas with high community privilege. While disamenities' focus on locating in areas with low community privilege indeed affects environmental equity, the effect of amenity location is also important, and there are powerful interaction effects. The importance of privilege-based location is found in these simulations regardless of which social groupmajority or minorityis assumed to be the privileged group. This study suggests a limitation of EJ policies and models that focus on the politics of disamenity siting without considering the politics of amenity siting.

AB  - The resurgence of bed bugs poses an urgent situation since infestations are rampant globally, nationally, and locally. In Ohio, bed bugs have become a virtual epidemic in many towns and cities, especially in central and southwestern regions of the state. These blood-feeding insects cause an array of adverse health effects in humans. Furthermore, bed bugs disproportionately occur in urban areas, and housing and the built environment are now recognized as dominant influences on health. Bed bugs' potential role in disease transmission remains unqualified to date, and research on this issue is urgently needed. The escalating global bed bug resurgence leaves the divided public health community in a precarious social justice position if the lack of response to bed bug infestations disproportionately impacts underserved populations. Bed bugs are an urgent public health and environmental justice concern, and the authors recommend that public health agencies respond with authority of agency.

AB  - The study, designed as a pilot, aimed to explore lay perceptions of air quality from participants who were selected to represent three different social categories: age; health status; and geographical location. We compared responses from younger with older participants who held memories of about air quality prior to the Clean Air Act (1956)(1). We also explored possible differences in perception due to health status by including some participants who identified themselves as having asthma. Finally, we compared possible differences in perception between two economically and geographically distinct areas of Greater Nottingham in England. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 22 participants recruited through schools, church groups and residential homes. Our findings suggest that no air (apart from the seaside) is perceived as automatically safe and therefore healthy. We found that perceptions of 'good' air seem to vary with age and health whereas experiences of air quality are associated with socio-economic status. Perceptions of air are shown to be suffused with historical significance, as well as embodying projections embedded from within the local environment and material context.

AB  - Since the early 1990s, North Carolina has been the fastest growing swine-producing state in the country and the leading innovator in vertically integrated industrially structured hog farming. Although the growth and concentration of swine production has been associated with a host of negative social and environmental impacts on the state's air, land, and waterways, environmental justice and farm loss concerns have played a particularly key role in the evolution of the controversy in North Carolina. Using multivariate analysis of statewide census and agricultural data, we identified the county-level sociodemographic characteristics associated with farm loss between 1982 and 1997. We found that recent patterns of farm loss were more pronounced in Black communities, regardless of income, and low-income communities, regardless of race. Furthermore, counties that had greater hog industry growth in the early 1980s and had large hog populations by 1992 have suffered greater farm loss since the early 1980s than counties where the hog industry growth did not intensify until more recently. The implications of these findings with reference to an expanded environmental justice framework regarding the discriminatory impacts of swine facilities on minority and low-income rural communities are discussed.

AB  - Stigma is often encountered by recipients who receive food donations from charities, while the consumption of wasted food, also traditionally considered to be a stigmatized practice, has recently become part of a popular food rescue movement that seeks to reduce environmental impacts. These two stigmas-charitable donation and the consumption of waste-are brought together at the Open Table, a community group in Melbourne, Australia, that serves community meals cooked from surplus food. This paper examines how Open Table de-stigmatizes food donations through food waste discourse to enable greater social inclusion. I draw on the experiences of donors, cooks, volunteers and eaters gathered from diverse Open Table sites. Taking a 'follow-the-thing' approach, I analyze how food 'waste' becomes re-valued by embracing goals of environmental justice enacted through local processes of care and conviviality. Relying on networks of volunteers and not-for-profit agencies, Open Table provides a simple, effective and adaptable model for possible replication for overcoming drawbacks of traditional charity practices. Critically though, as hunger in society continues to grow, this approach is increasingly threatened by the need to 'single out' disadvantaged recipients to justify continued supply. This paper contributes to food poverty, waste, and Alternative Food Network literature in two important ways: first, by analyzing the outcomes of community food redistribution approaches with regards to stigma and inclusion; and secondly, by arguing that such holistic approaches need to be acknowledged, valued and supported to shift current discourses and practice.

AB  - Scholars studying the neoliberalisation of nature (and political ecologists more broadly) have been notably concerned with justice, but have underspecified their own conceptions of justice and have failed to seriously question or investigate what kind (or kinds) of justice is actually being pursued in the context of neoliberalism. In this paper, I argue that a more robust treatment of justice is required, building on recent calls for a more reflexive approach to normativity in critical human geography. I make this argument by drawing on a study examining how justice has been mobilised in Australia's neoliberal water reforms, and particularly through a series of semistructured interviews with water policymakers and industry professionals. I show that the justice being pursued through these reforms is multivalent, but coalesces around an allocative framework I call the 'basic needs plus market' framework. This framework ultimately finds its moral compass in a utilitarian conception of distributive justice, and this utilitarianism both facilitates neoliberalisation and tempers its expression. Understanding neoliberalisation as a means to broader normative ends, I suggest, has considerable potential for both explaining the contradictions and contestations scholars have argued are intrinsic to 'actually existing neoliberalism' and opening up opportunities for productive critique and engagement.

AB  - The United States' National Environmental Policy Act is a knowledge production process required by federal government agencies to assist in their evaluation of the environmental (and social) impacts of proposed federal agency actions prior to their implementation. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which manages immigrant detention in the United States, is included among these federal agencies. Using Texas as a case study, we explore how the National Environmental Policy Act process, as it relates to immigrant detention, systematically produces ignorance while also producing knowledge. We identify four forms of absence: absence of process in Department of Homeland Security's use of Categorical Exclusions and programmatic Environmental Assessments, absence of actors in the exclusion of people who are detained as an "affected" social group, absence of alternatives in how "meaningful alternatives" are identified in Environmental Assessments, and absence of discourse with the public in the Environmental Assessment process. In addition, we consider how these absences reflect and perpetuate existing social and environmental inequalities.

AB  - Spatialized racial injustices drive morbidity and mortality inequalities. While many factors contribute to environmental injustices, Pb is particularly insidious, and is associated with cardio-vascular, kidney, and immune dysfunctions and is a leading cause of premature death worldwide. Here, we present a revised analysis from the New Orleans dataset of soil lead (SPb) and children's blood Pb (BPb), which was systematically assembled for 2000-2005 and 2011-2016. We show the spatial-temporal inequities in SPb, children's BPb, racial composition, and household income in New Orleans. Comparing medians for the inner city with outlying areas, soil Pb is 7.5 or 9.3 times greater, children's blood Pb is similar to 2 times higher, and household income is lower. Between 2000-2005 and 2011-2016, a BPb decline occurred. Long-standing environmental and socioeconomic Pb exposure injustices have positioned Black populations at extreme risk of adverse health consequences. Given the overlapping health outcomes of Pb exposure with co-morbidities for conditions such as COVID-19, we suggest that further investigation be conducted on Pb exposure and pandemic-related mortality rates, particularly among Black populations. Mapping and remediating invisible environmental Pb provides a path forward for preventing future populations from developing a myriad of Pb-related health issues.

AB  - The debate surrounding the use of hydraulic fracturing (also known as "fracking" or "HF") to extract natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shale deposits is often characterized as a tension between economic development and environmental risks. However, frequently missing from this dichotomy is the fact that the concerns of many who oppose HF use extend beyond the purely "environmental," and include concerns about issues such as "the natural resource curse" and losing autonomy. These concerns ring of "environmental justice" rather than "environmentalism." Environmental justice espouses the belief that no group should bear disproportionate environmental consequences resulting from industrial activity, and that people affected by industrial activity should be meaningfully involved in implementation. Although some federal and state policies acknowledge principles of environmental justice, it has yet to be meaningfully incorporated into any legal framework in the United States. This Article argues that a nuanced characterization of the HF controversy should include a more robust discussion of both environmental justice and discourse in order to account for the inordinate burden residents of Appalachia have historically borne in fossil fuel production. Part I examines relevant regional economic and social dynamics, including the natural resource curse, Appalachia's unique vulnerabilities, efforts to portray opponents of shale gas development as "anti-science," and the environmental justice movement's relationship to extractive industries. Part II reviews the use of modern HF technology and applicable legal frameworks in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York. Part III argues that across Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, environmental justice issues have arisen from shale gas development, including problems stemming from information asymmetries, power asymmetries, and limited access to justice. In Part IV, the Article argues that the "anti-science" portrayal of shale gas opponents is unjustified, and that such "discourse-framing" obfuscates the actual costs and limitations on benefits of HF use, and thus, becomes an environmental justice issue itself. Part IV also argues that environmental justice concerns shaped public sentiment in New York, and that the resulting "moral outrage" added to New York's policy decision to ban HF altogether. In Part V, the Article suggests that ideas which transcend the study of "moral outrage," risk assessment, and environmental justice advocacy may offer a way forward.

AB  - The transition to a low-carbon society will have winners and losers as the costs and benefits of decarbonization fall unevenly on different communities. This potential collateral damage has prompted calls for a "just transition" to a green economy. While the term, "just transition," is increasingly prevalent in the public discourse, it remains under-discussed and poorly defined in legal literature, preventing it from helping catalyze fair decarbonization. This Article seeks to define the term, test its validity, and articulate its relationship with law so the idea can meet its potential. The Article is the first to disambiguate and assess two main rhetorical usages of "just transition." I argue that legal scholars should recognize it as a term of art that evolved in the labor movement, first known as a "superfund for workers." In the climate change context, I therefore define a just transition as the principle of easing the burden decarbonization poses to those who depend on high-carbon industries. This definition provides clarity and can help law engage with fields that already recognize just transitions as a labor concept. I argue further that the labor-driven just transition concept is both justified and essential in light of today's deep political polarization and "jobs-versus-environment" tensions. First, it can incorporate much-needed economic equity considerations into environmental decisionmaking. Second, it can inform a modernized alternative to the environmental law apparatus, which must evolve to transcend disciplines. Third, it offers an avenue for climate reform through coalition-building between labor and environmental interests. I offer guidance for effectuating the principle by synthesizing instances of its embodiment in law in the Trade Act of 1974 (assisting manufacturing communities), the President's Northwest Forest Plan (assisting timber communities), the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (assisting tobacco farmers), and the POWER Initiative (assisting coal communities), among other examples.

AB  - Sustainable development is an integrated blend of energetic, economic, social, environmental, and governmental actors, making it one of the most challenging and subjective aims of the United Nations. A sustainability project that does not consider any of these parameters can generate resistance among different actors of society. In this work, we have demonstrated that the traditional definition of sustainability encompassing economic development, environmental protection, and social justice does not adequately cover large-scale renewable energy projects. We have presented an illuminating case study of solar development in the Yucatan state of Mexico to show that the traditional three-legged stool of sustainable development fails to accommodate local power relations and their role in energy decision-making. This point is made through a substantive and illuminating ethnography of a solar project in the community of San Jose Tipceh, which involves the importance of energy democracy and understanding power relations in any assessment of sustainable development. These power relations are an important component of sustainable development, and all megaprojects, especially renewable energy projects, require special attention in the governance processes. Through an analysis of an example of implementation of a mega solar project, we argue that the methodology through which the power is exercised is an exercise of great importance because it leads us to a scientific discussion that structures an international reflection on sustainability. The case study consists of mixed methods, including several techniques to deepen the analysis of sociocultural aspects, and tries to present the limits and show the weakness of the sustainability perspective in such megaprojects. It is concluded that environmental justice as a basic element of the new era of renewable energies is limited and can generate social injustices. In the same way, this work shows how power is exercised in the implementation of energy projects and in the absence of equitable comprehensive governance that does not consider the local sociocultural contexts of the communities, resulting in the generation of new powers and permanent conflicts. At the end of this work, a framework to empower local sociocultural contexts for an equitable energy transition is recommended.

AB  - Study objectives: The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires that chemical facilities in the US with specified quantities of certain toxic or flammable chemicals file a five year history of accidents. This study considers the relation between the reported accidents and surrounding community characteristics. Design: This study is a retrospective analysis of the association between the demographics of counties in which facilities are located and the risk of accidental chemical release and resulting injuries at those facilities. The " location risk'' ( the risk that a facility having large volumes of hazardous chemicals is located in a community) and " operations risk'' ( the risk of an accident itself) are investigated. Setting: 1994 - 2000 accident history data from 15 083 US industrial facilities using one or more of 140 flammable or toxic substances above a threshold level. Demographic makeup of 2333 counties surrounding these facilities was determined from the 1990 US census. Main results: Larger and more chemical intensive facilities tend to be located in counties with larger African- American populations and in counties with both higher median incomes and high levels of income inequality. Even after adjusting for location risk there is greater risk of accidents for facilities in heavily African- American counties ( OR of accident = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.4). Conclusions: Further research and policy interventions are required to reduce the probability of locating facilities in an inequitable fashion, as well as health surveillance, and regulatory monitoring and enforcement activities to ensure that hazardous facilities in minority communities prepare and prevent accidental chemical releases to the same standards as elsewhere.

AB  - Several researchers hold that the cohousing movement supports sustainability, but it remains economically restrictive. This condition challenges cohousing's status as sustainable, considering that its financially exclusive nature fails to meaningfully address sustainability's social dimension. Yet, it is doubtful that the cohousing movement set out to create this outcome. When we examine the historical conditions that pertain to multifamily housing, we discover a long-standing pattern of discrimination. For today's cohousing communities, we see that they are dealing with the residual effects of such prejudicial practices. Most of the unfair treatment comes from zoning and lending, but we also see that cohousing has internal challenges that complicate matters. Through employing an environmental justice framework, however, we can parse kinds of responsibility. If planners, financiers, and cohousing communities can remove these barriers, then cohousing can bolster efforts in urban sustainability.

AB  - The problem of how to ensure the accessibility of green areas is a significant issue for urban planners and leaders. Every segment of society should have access to green areas. The 2015 United Nations General Assembly Resolution indicated the necessity of ensuring that children, older adults, and disabled people have equal access to green areas. The Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard (ANGSt) was implemented in England in response to the United Nations 2015 Resolution. ANGSt states that housing developments needed to have a green space within 300 m in order to be identified as having adequate access to green space. Almost at the same time, Turkey has also identified increasing access to urban green spaces as a priority, which can be seen most directly in the 2014 Turkish Regulation on Spatial Planning. This document states that housing zones need to have a green space within 500 m to ensure that urban residents have sufficient access to green space. However, no specific suggestions or procedures have been provided on how to measure the accessibility of a city's green areas. To fill this gap, this study developed a method for measuring the accessibility of green areas according to the standards outlined in the 2014 Turkish Regulation on Spatial Planning as well as the standards described in England's ANGSt regulations. The accessibility of green areas in Nevs & cedil;ehir, Turkey was assessed using this method to demonstrate its utility. The method of Comber et al. (2008) and the grid method used in the GEOSTAT procedure were adapted for this study to assess the accessibility of green areas in Nevs & cedil;ehir, Turkey. In order to conduct this study, ArcGIS was used and analyses were performed grid method. As a result, this study identified housing zones that do not have access to a green space, both according to Turkish standards as well as English standards. Furthermore, this study also identified many green spaces that are not within an accessible distance from residential areas, indicating that a significant proportion of Nevs & cedil;ehir's green spaces are being under-utilized. This study reveals that thus far, the planning approaches used in Nevs & cedil;ehir have not taken access to green spaces into consideration, particularly along the city's borders. The center of the city has much more access to green areas, but it has the inverse problem of having green spaces that lack nearby residential areas, so they are not adequately utilized. This situation most likely arose due to reliance on the grid meter per capita standard for assessing green space rather than basing planning decisions on accessibility standards. Thus, this study provides important insights into Nevs & cedil;ehir's current land use distribution that can be used to shape the future of urban planning in Nevs & cedil;ehir, while also providing a method for assessing land use distribution that can be used in a wide range of contexts to evaluate access to green spaces.

AB  - The violence and trauma of climate change have arrived. The Caribbean region is the unfortunate recipient of the impacts of climate change and, much like its inheritance of plantation slavery and colonialism, it is left with the infrastructural, social, and cultural pillage of imperial and neocolonial imposition. This article considers whether and how the humanities and digital humanities, in particular, can produce the ideal intersection between planetary responsibility, community accountability, and sustainable living. In this article, I discuss Create Caribbean Research Institute's digital humanities praxis through the example of the environmental sustainability project, Carisealand. Through the exploration and discussion of theories, tools, methodologies, and praxis of digital humanities applied to the project, I position Caribbean Afrofuturism in the context of contemporary Caribbean digital environments and the lived experience of Caribbean people in the aftermath of climate change. I apply discourses of Afrofuturism to imagine an alternate Caribbean future represented in the redesign, digital imagination, and representation of selected Caribbean communities. By offering models for rethinking, visualizing, and rebuilding physical spaces, I hope to raise questions and offer insights about the power of digital humanities for social and environmental justice in the contemporary and future Caribbean. The goal is to also offer the model as a template for developing other mapping projects that can propose an alternate future for the Global South.

AB  - The development of Renewable Energies (RE) must be stepped up in the coming years if we are to successfully realise the ambitious energy transition challenge set by many governments across the globe. However, the energy transition is far from obvious, especially with regard to the social acceptability of RE. In this context, we used a Discrete Choice Experiment combined with a Geographical Information System to assess the willingness of in-dividuals to switch to a more virtuous energy mix based on three energy sources (wind, photovoltaic and biogas). Our results show a dominant generational effect, indicating that young people are more likely to accept renewable energy in their neighborhoods. Furthermore, residents in areas with renewable energy with negative externalities (wind turbines and anaerobic digestion units) tend to have a lower Willingness to Pay than residents in other areas, which is what we call the principle of territorial distributive justice. There is no reason to believe that the difficulties in finding new locations for RE installations could fade away. Therefore, an increased effort of public policies to plan the location of future RE facilities in a more equitable way and always a better explanation and co-construction of new RE projects are needed.

AB  - The potential of green facades (GFs) to enhance environmental justice (EJ) has not been quantified so far. EJ in Berlin, Germany is assessed by the core indicators (1) noise pollution, (2) air pollution, (3) bioclimatic stress, (4) provision of green space and (5) social status. Most of the inner city is rated "poorly" in one or multiple indicators. Based on literature and spatial data, status quo and target values are determined for indicators (1)-(4) for an exemplary, highly burdened quarter in Berlin. It is assessed if and how much GFs could potentially improve current EJ levels. The improvements due to GFs to reach target values are assessed in % for day/night and indoor/outdoor settings. It can be shown that installing GFs would improve statuses of the four indicators to different extents, with the biggest enhancement found regarding indicator (3) for indoors at daytime: 52%. Determining factors for the EJ improvement potential of GFs need to be further assessed. This feasible method for increasing the amount of urban green can be helpful for improving life in highly burdened quarters. Therefore, from the point of view of EJ, large-scale implementation of GFs in urban areas is recommended.

AB  - The prevailing public perception of Lunik IX, a Roma district in the Slovak city of Kosice, is that it represents the story of an originally urban green space, one of the best for healthy living given its fresh air and proximity to the forest, that was destroyed by 'naive' decision-makers and 'irresponsible' Roma. This article, based on a combination of qualitative sociological and historical research, questions this narrative and deems it a myth. The district's proximity to a landfill and the consequent environmental effects of this played a decisive role in its ghettoisation, yet these factors have never been systematically analysed and discussed. Although Lunik IX was not officially and originally designed as a ghetto, it became one as a result of structural, social, and environmental factors. Utilising the conceptual and theoretical framework of environmental justice, the article focuses on the spatial distribution of the adverse environmental effects in relation to social and ethnic factors. The case of Lunik IX, with its roots in the period of a centrally planned economy, provides a unique opportunity to make a comparative study of the social processes from a historical perspective. It allows us to analyse the mechanism of decision-making in an avowedly non-capitalist society, where in reality we see many similarities in how income inequality between richer and poorer neighbourhoods, together with ethnic/racial factors, has shaped the city.

AB  - The United Nations General Assembly agreed and approved in September 2015 the document 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development', which contains a set of measures aiming to balance economic progress and protection of the environment, whilst at the same time remain aware of the need to address the many disparities still seen between industrialised and developing countries. The Agenda document consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which among many other tasks, intend to eradicate poverty and create better health conditions in both developed and developing countries. But despite the need for and the relevance of the SDGs, it is unclear how they may help to address present and future sustainability challenges. Based on the need to shed some light on such a relationship, this paper describes each of the SDGs, and offers an analysis of the extent to which their implementation may offer support to ongoing attempts to handle some of the pressing problems seen in pursuing sustainable development. Three case studies are presented to show in practice how best the SDGs can be handled. The paper concludes that the process of implementing the SDGs offers unrivalled opportunities to advance equal opportunity and foster economic empowerment, helping countries to promote the cause of sustainable development in their territories, hence benefiting their populations.

AB  - The U.S. is experiencing unprecedented movement away from coal and, to a lesser degree, oil. Burdened low-income communities and people of color could experience health benefits from reductions in air and water pollution, yet these same groups could suffer harm if transitions lack broad public input or if policies prioritize elite or corporate interests. This paper highlights how U.S. energy transitions build from, and contribute to, environmental injustices. Energy justice requires not only ending disproportionate harm, it also entails involvement in the design of solutions and fair distribution of benefits, such as green jobs and clean air. To what extent does the confluence of state, civic, and market processes assure just transitions to clean, low-carbon energy production involving equitable distribution of costs, benefits, and decision-making power? To explore this question we assess trends with (1) fossil fuel divestment; (2) carbon taxes and social cost of carbon measurements; (3) cap-and-trade; (4) renewable energy; and (5) energy efficiency. Current research demonstrates opportunities and pitfalls in each area with mixed or partial energy justice consequences, leading to our call for greater attention to the specifics of distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice in research, policy, and action. Illustrative energy transition case studies suggest the feasibility and benefit of empowering approaches, but also indicate there can be conflict between green and just, as evident though stark inequities in clean energy initiatives. To identify positive pathways forward, we compile priorities for an energy justice research agenda based on interactive and participatory practices aligning advocacy, activism, and academics.

AB  - Spatial differences in urban environmental conditions contribute to health inequalities within cities. The purpose of the paper is to map environmental inequalities relevant for health in the City of Dortmund, Germany, in order to identify needs for planning interventions. We develop suitable indicators for mapping socioeconomically-driven environmental inequalities at the neighborhood level based on published scientific evidence and inputs from local stakeholders. Relationships between socioeconomic and environmental indicators at the level of 170 neighborhoods were analyzed continuously with Spearman rank correlation coefficients and categorically applying chi-squared tests. Reclassified socioeconomic and environmental indicators were then mapped at the neighborhood level in order to determine multiple environmental burdens and hotspots of environmental inequalities related to health. Results show that the majority of environmental indicators correlate significantly, leading to multiple environmental burdens in specific neighborhoods. Some of these neighborhoods also have significantly larger proportions of inhabitants of a lower socioeconomic position indicating hotspots of environmental inequalities. Suitable planning interventions mainly comprise transport planning and green space management. In the conclusions, we discuss how the analysis can be used to improve state of the art planning instruments, such as clean air action planning or noise reduction planning towards the consideration of the vulnerability of the population.

AB  - The value of most ecosystem services invariably slips through national accounts. Even when these values are estimated, they are allocated without any particular spatial referencing. Little is known about the spatial and distributional effects arising from changes in ecosystem service provision. This paper estimates spatial equity in ecosystem services provision using a dedicated data disaggregation algorithm that allocates 'synthetic' socioeconomic attributes to households and with accurate geo-referencing. A GIS-based automated procedure is operationalized for three different ecosystems in Israel. A nonlinear function relates household location to each ecosystem: beaches, urban parks and national parks. Benefit measures are derived by modeling household consumer surplus as a function of socio-economic attributes and distance from the ecosystem. These aggregate measures are spatially disaggregated to households. Results show that restraining access to beaches causes a greater reduction in welfare than restraining access to a park. Progressively, high income households lose relatively more in welfare terms than in low income households from such action. This outcome is reversed when distributional outcomes are measured in terms of housing price classes. Policy implications of these findings relate to implications for housing policies that attempt to use new development to generate social heterogeneity in locations proximate to ecosystem services.

AB  - Scores of foundations are supporting efforts to improve the environmental conditions that affect health outcomes. Environmental health philanthropy has grown from a few foundations in 1999 to more than 100 today, and to annual investments of at least $70 million. This dynamic area of philanthropy is assisting disaster-stricken communities in the Gulf Coast, supporting a national movement to reform chemicals policy, defending clean air and water standards, and underwriting environmental justice work in low-income communities and communities of color. We argue that these investments are yielding sizable returns, but more funding opportunities exist to deepen understanding of hazards, clean up communities, reform policies, and embed environmental health in new economic development.

AB  - Since the early 1900s, more than 1700 dams have been removed from rivers in the United States. Native American Tribes have played a key role in many significant removals, bringing cultural, economic, and legal resources to bear on the process. Their involvement contrasts with the displacement and marginalisation that have historically characterised the relationship between Native Americans and the dams built by settler - colonial governments on their rivers. Our research investigates Tribal involvement in dam removals, with examples from the Ottaway, Penobscot, and Elwha rivers. We ask the following: what roles have Tribes played in successful removals? How do dam removals affect and reflect shifting relations between Tribal governments and non-Tribal actors? Our research finds that Tribal involvement provides opportunities for inserting underacknowledged values and resource claims into dam removal efforts, and that it facilitates new collaborations and alliances. We also find evidence of Tribal involvement affecting the nature and practice of river restoration through dam removal. We conclude that the involvement of Tribes in dam removal contributes to important shifts in environmental politics in the US, and that it also creates opportunities for restorative environmental justice for Native Americans and their rivers.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that sustainable actions to preserve biodiversity are critical to preventing new microorganisms from harming human health. In this sense, education and encouraging young people's interest in local biodiversity are crucial to promoting its preservation and sustainability. This research studied the biodiversity interests of 14-15-year-old students in Sao Paulo State, focusing on the links between biodiversity and human health. The criterion of maximum variation was used to constitute a heterogeneous sample of students. Students answered a four-point Likert questionnaire. The items in this questionnaire were divided into categories related to the interest of young people in biodiversity, and these were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (Wilcoxon test). Categories of biodiversity linked to "health or human utility" were of higher interest to young people than those with no links to human benefits, such as "diversity of organisms". These findings, along with the literature, showed that young people are interested in biodiversity issues associated with human health. Therefore, teaching biodiversity should reflect on new possibilities for making a more sustainable environment and promoting social and environmental justice, fundamental aspects of promoting and guaranteeing human health.

AB  - There are multiple transboundary groundwater bodies shared between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that are currently managed jointly through the EU Water Framework Directive. In 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and consequently, there are uncertainties regarding the future status of groundwater management between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in regards to future UK environmental policy. This paper explores the post 'Brexit' transboundary groundwater implications, if a transboundary groundwater agreement is required between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and, should it transpire, what form should it take.

AB  - Study region: Malawi. Study focus: The adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 in 2016 has triggered countries across the globe to assess and improve management and use of water resources. Monitoring of these resources is becoming increasingly important, and the management of transboundary water resources, in particular groundwater aquifers, required to meet SDG target 6.5.2, is lagging behind. It is vital to assess and manage these resources in a sustainable manner within an integrated water resource management approach. Transboundary aquifer assessments have largely focused on the regional scale which is not sufficient for countries to manage their transboundary aquifers effectively. This paper focuses on results of a national transboundary aquifer unit assessment in Malawi as a case study to support the countries plans for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6.5.2. New hydrological insights for the region: We have identified 38 new transboundary aquifer units shared between Malawi and its neighbours. These results can form the basis for future transboundary aquifer management between Malawi and its neighbouring countries. We also highlight the current limitations of transboundary aquifer assessments and management that should be addressed to achieve SDG 6.5.2. These include institutional mechanisms, limited cross-border data sharing, limited groundwater monitoring, and a need to revisit the wording of the transboundary-focused SDG target and its indicators.

AB  - Study region: Malawi. Study focus: Integrated water resource management (IWRM) of transboundary aquifers (TBA's) is becoming increasingly important. Without adequate and accurate scientific knowledge of their extent and characteristics, uninformed policy creation could lead to unsustainable management of these vital resources. This is particularly important within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) where up to 85% of domestic water is supplied by groundwater. In this paper, Malawi is used as a case study to critically evaluate the current transboundary aquifer assessment frameworks within the region and their value in promoting IWRM. A series of illustrative conceptual models of TBA interactions pertinent to the Malawian national border are presented and we consider how TBA assessments may be integrated to national IWRM and strategic policy development. New hydrological insights for the region: Current TBA assessments of Malawi and the wider SADC neglect multiple aspects needed for a national scale management plan. This includes full border TBA system identification alongside, given the geology of the region, consideration of the discontinuous nature of basement complex aquifers and localised alluvial deposits that both result in smaller scale aquifer units. Conceptualising such local scale complexity and encouraging countries to develop a strategy that systematically examines TBA systems along their national border at relevant scales will allow for more focused conjunctive policy creation and sustainable management of TBA's.

AB  - Shale gas development (SGD) via horizontal drilling and fracking is touted for economic benefits and spurned for health and environmental impacts. Despite SGD's socioecological salience, few peer-reviewed, empirical studies document the distribution of positive and negative effects. The City of Denton, Texas has similar to 280 active gas wells and over a decade of SGD. Here we use an environmental justice framework to analyze the distribution of SGD's costs and benefits within Denton. Using data on mineral property values from 2002 to 2013 and gas well locations, we ask: who owns Denton's mineral rights (i.e. the greatest financial beneficiaries) and how does this ownership pattern relate to who lives near gas wells (i.e. those who shoulder the nuisances and health impacts)? Our results show that Denton's mineral wealth is widely distributed around the U.S., residents own 1% of the total value extracted, and the city government is a large financial beneficiary. In addition to distributional inequities, our analysis demonstrates that split estate doctrine, legal deference to mineral owners, and SGD's uniqueness in urban centers create disparities in municipal SGD decision-making processes. The environmental justice issues associated with fracking in Denton also provide one possible explanation for residents' November 2014 vote to ban hydraulic fracturing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainability has at its core the three strands of environment, economy, and social equity. Environmental justice, as it has progressed and evolved since the early 1980s, has come to be envisioned as encompassing these same components. A community that is low-income, minority-majority population, and houses a greater proportion of a city's environmental hazards (and/or less of amenities like parks as well), can be seen as a community faced with challenges of building equity across environmental, social, and economic lines. Using an environmental justice framework I examine how effective policies and practices are, or have been in producing 'sustainable development' or a 'sustainable community'. I assess the City of Indianapolis' efforts to transform a historically disadvantaged environmental justice community into a 'sustainable community' and examine environmental justice within the city as a means by which to evaluate 'sustainable development'. Additionally, Geo-technologies (i.e., GIS) were used to provide a visualization of the potential environmental risks (and amenities) within the city's neighborhoods. The risk of a redevelopment approach rooted in economic conceptions of sustainability as opposed to social and environmental conceptions will likely produce a narrowly 'sustainable', but broadly gentrified community.

AB  - Since the climate change context is increasingly the focus of decision-makers, indices capable of helping them in the transition to a low-carbon economy are considered necessary. Therefore, the objective of this work is to propose an index of climate justice that includes factors of human development and climate action. The index was developed using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique and, in this study, assessed the climate justice of 198 nations. After the calculation, statistical analysis was used to compare the climate justice of the aforementioned countries, grouped by level of development and geographical location. The results obtained were: a) there is currently no nation that fully guarantees climate justice to its population; b) there is a difference in the performance of climate justice between the Annex I, Non-Annex I and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) groups; c) nations located in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Eastern Europe are similar in terms of climate justice index performance. The main contribution of this paper is in the fact that the proposed index can help policy-makers and national governments to define climate and development policies, creating a synergy between such policies.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to serve a political-cultural perspective on the environmental movement in Israel through an examination of the organizations' impact on the shaping of geographic space, the political system, and the general culture. The practical expression of political cultures is examined through an analysis of prominent organizations' activism as manifested in seven representative environmental campaigns waged over the last four decades. The study is qualitative in nature, and as such is based on in-depth interviews with numerous actors from the environmental arena - institutions, NGOs, the business sector, and academia. The originality of the study is to deeper the cultural aspects of the phenomenon. Some of the findings regarding the effectiveness of the environmental campaigns are showing that there is significant gap between the political system and the civil society in Israel, relating the environmental issue as a whole: while the first still see it as a marginal sector, the Israeli public and local leadership has made a change in the attitude toward environmental issues. This cultural gap is due to the difference in cultural values, between the local and national level.

Accused by many of predatory practices, payday lenders can be viewed as financial hazards in already economically distressed communities. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and associated statistical analyses, this paper examines the social ecology of payday lending along the Front Range communities of Colorado. Comparison of means and logistic regression results reveal how communities' composition by class, occupation, race/ethnicity, nativity, age, and military affiliation affect their likelihood of hosting payday lending.

AB  - The reaction of communities to the development of energy facilities is based on the environmental impact of the investment, but it also reflects the ex-ante propensity of residents to engage in collective actions. In this work we have examined the requests of authorization of Italian power producers for new thermal plants with the purpose of testing the efficiency of market-based siting policies. The classical location factors, e.g., infrastructure availability, have been confirmed to play a role, and there is a weak evidence that authorization demands have targeted communities that suffer less environmental damage. However our findings have also revealed that power producers are likely to avoid potentially suitable sites if they host a highly activistic community. The paper also discusses some modifications concerning siting policies that could improve the alignment between community responses and the environmental costs of new energy facilities.

AB  - The United Kingdom has a well-developed system of local air quality management established to combat air quality problems at a local level. In England air quality management areas tend to cover areas of greater social deprivation, and action plans developed to address poor air quality provide an opportunity to take account of environmental justice. However, this is not explicitly required by Government guidance and evidence to date suggests that the opportunity has not been realised. Many measures in current air quality action plans are not specific to air quality. This holds out the potential for greater integration of air quality measures with other local strategies, most notably local transport plans, which take greater account of environmental justice issues. Although not primarily intended to improve air quality or address environmental inequality, the London Congestion Charge provides evidence of the potential of this type of measure.

AB  - The United Nations (UN) launched 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in 2015 to be achieved by 2030 for a sustainable future for all. These SDG provide a blueprint for a global plan of action, global peace and social-economic and environmental justice. Coal mining activities disturb the basic ecosystem and biodiversity of the land. The mining industry, being a temporary user of land, provides ample opportunities to reclaim mine degraded areas to help achieve the 17 SDG of the UN. Our current study aims to broaden understanding, explore and establish links between biochar-based coal mine restoration and the SDG, and, whenever possible, identify knowledge gaps and research needs. The SDG linked biochar-based mine restoration can be broadly divided into mitigation and enhancement roles, which can be further classified into direct, moderate and indirect activities. It has been observed that climate action (SDG 13), life on land (SDG 15) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) were benefited by biochar-based restoration. Biochar application improves the physico-chemical, biological and nutritional properties of the impoverished mine spoil and promotes plant growth. Biochar application reduces the bulk density by 3%-31%, increases the porosity by 14%-64%, pH 1.4-2.5 times and aggregates stability by 3%-226% along with improvements of plant nutrient (NPK). The study showed tremendous opportunities for using biochar-based coal mine restoration to help achieve each of the SDG.

If we adopted the same tough, environmental regulations as our West Coast Counterparts West Louisville would surely bloom instead of slowly die. The unfairness between black and white neighbourhoods is stark and vivid. As the great urbanist, Jane Jacobs, once said: "everyone hungers for a first class neighbourhood for both pride and dignity. nobody wants a second class neighborhood." First class neighbourhoods are safe, healthy, sustainable, and prosperous. It is a human right; a Worldwide right.

AB  - The article examines the environmental impact assessment of hydropower dams as an opportunity for applying indigenous laws. Although indigenous laws of affected communities exist and have guided the management of land and natural resources for millennia, they have not yet occupied a significant place in state-led decision making. Consequently, decisions to approve dams, based on state laws and officials' discretionary power, affect indigenous peoples in distinct and profound ways. The analysis is based on the comparison between two decision-making processes-Site C (Canada) and Belo Monte (Brazil) dams. The methodology includes the application of principles from the environmental justice literature, the analysis of interviews, case law and legislation. The article concludes that environmental justice for indigenous peoples in environmental decision making of projects with significant impacts, such as large dams, requires recognizing and making institutional spaces for implementing indigenous laws.

AB  - The primary objective of this study is to examine if minorities, the poor, and non-homeowners have a higher potential for exposure than the general population to large-quantity hazardous waste generation in Bexar County, Texas. Results indicate that this is indeed the case: people living near the generators are more often Black non-Hispanic or Hispanic, and more likely to live below the poverty level and not own their own home. Although previous studies conducted in the United States have used states, counties, zip codes, or census tracts as the unit of spatial analysis, we use dasymetric mapping to create population maps at a resolution of 30 m. This allows for the reconfiguration of the areal aggregations chosen for the analysis while preserving its findings. It also reduces, if not eliminates, the effects of the Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) on the results.

AB  - Small, low-income communities in the United States disproportionately lack access to safe drinking water (i.e. water that meets regulated quality standards). At a community level, the literature has broadly claimed that a major barrier to safe drinking water access is low technical, managerial, and financial (TMF) capacity. At a broader structural level, the environmental justice literature has shown that historical neglect of low-income communities of color has resulted in numerous water systems without the financial and political resources to meet water quality standards. This study investigates the contemporary processes by which distributive injustices persist in California's Central Valley. The study uses key informant interviews with a range of stakeholders, including employees at the state, county and community, non-profit organizations, and engineers, to understand why sustainable water quality solutions for small low-income communities remain such a challenge. The interviews are structured around a decision chain, which builds out the specific steps needed to go from a maximum contaminant level violation to remediation. The resulting decision chain makes visible the multiple steps at multiple stages with multiple actors that are needed to arrive at a solution to substandard water quality. It shows the numerous nodes at which progress can be stalled, and thus functions as a behind-the-scenes look at the (re)production of persistent inequalities. The complexity of the process shows why having the TMF capacity needed to get to a safe water system is not a reasonable expectation for most small community water systems. Inequalities are continually being produced and cemented, often by the very steps aimed towards remediation, thus making persistent disparities in safe drinking water access a de facto state-sanctioned process that compounds a discriminatory historical legacy.

AB  - The climate crisis has detrimental impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people. Psychological effects include feelings of fear, overwhelm, worry, distress, hopelessness and anger; PTSD; depression; anxiety; phobias; panic disorder; sleep disturbances; attachment disorders; learning difficulties; substance abuse; shock and trauma symptoms; adjustment problems; behavioural problems; and, suicidal thinking. First Nations' children and young people are particularly at risk due to loss of place, identity, culture, land and customs informed by kinship relationships with the Earth; while sustainable land use practices and connection to Country and community can enhance climate resilience. In Western Australia (WA), some young people engage in climate activism - including striking from school - to demand government action to address the causes of climate change, including colonisation and capitalism. Climate activism can promote resilience, particularly when children and young people can emotionally engage in the climate crisis; when mental health is systemically supported; when climate communication is transparent and comprehensive; and, when activism is informed by the knowledges and wisdoms of First Nations peoples and grounded on Country. This article is co-authored by WA young people, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal academics, activists and practitioners engaged in youth, mental health and climate justice spaces. We argue for structural change to address the causes of the climate crisis, alongside enhanced evidence and approaches to appropriately support the mental health of children and young people. Furthermore, we support the call of Aboriginal peoples to ensure culturally appropriate, place-based responses based in caring for Country.

AB  - The paper introduces the concept of energy periphery to interrogate place-based perspectives on the co-production of uneven geographical development, energy vulnerabilities and low carbon transitions. Energy periphery is defined as places that are systematically disadvantaged through the whole energy system due to their inferior position within the asymmetrical spatial distribution of economic, political and symbolic resources and capabilities. Within an energy periphery, energy-related factors are combined with other place-based conditions to subject their communities to a compound and circular effect of precarious energy experiences. The notion of energy periphery is underpinned by insights from the spatial justice, core-periphery and energy justice theories. Using the case of Wales, the paper demonstrates the multi-dimensional and multi-scalar character of energy peripheralisation, including political underrepresentation, the absence of economic agglomeration advantages, and dependence on off-grid fuels, energy inefficient homes and other `backward' technologies and practices. Social and spatial contingencies of energy vulnerability factors are outlined. Contrary to common discourses, energy transition further disadvantages energy peripheries and reproduces a fragmented socio-spatial landscape. The study overall demonstrates the importance of considering energo-socio-spatial relationships to better understand uneven energy transitions and social change more generally. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The surge of private land concessions in Sub-Saharan Africa carries the potential to push local populations to marginal areas, aggravating their climate vulnerability. This paper analyses the effects of resettlement on the vulnerability of relocated rural communities in Mozambique, from the perspective of environmental justice. The research seeks to understand how land concessions interfere with autonomous processes of adaptation that are not recognised within land distribution policies. The findings draw on a qualitative field research in two locations, in the provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, where levels of poverty have persisted despite national trends of economic growth. The paper highlights how climate events inflluence perceptions of fairness amongst resettled populations, and how resettlements constrain their adaptative capabilities. The findings raise concern that misrecognition of adaptation practices can exacerbate the vulnerability of households to environmental change and to food insecurity, thereby hindering the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG13 (Climate Action). The author argues for the centrality of recognition within environmental justice, while contributing recommendations to ensure that land deals fulfil principles of distributional and procedural justice, which take into consideration the compound pressures of land use changes and climate vulnerability.

Factor analysis supported two dimensions of perceived benefits from dog parks (i.e., dog benefits and people benefits), which were used as composite variables in analyses. In addition to individual-level data gathered from the sample, this study used distance-related variables (e.g., street network approach to distance, buffer rings) computed from a Geographic Information System and socioeconomic neighborhood-level variables (e.g., percentage White in the neighborhood, home ownership) obtained from census tract data. Group differences, based upon park use, are explored with respect to both dog and people benefits. Logistic regression is used to predict dog owners' likelihood of using a fenced dog park.

AB  - The time of gender-blind climate change policies and projects has passed. However, while research is increasingly moving away from understanding the relationship between gender and climate change in a linear, technocratic, and instrumental way, gender and climate change policy-makers and project practitioners are having difficulties operationalizing this progress. In the meantime, as climate change effects are increasingly felt worldwide, and because the policy context after the Paris Agreement (2015) is bringing new challenges for gender and equity concerns, (re-)politicizing the climate justice debate in a policy and project-relevant way is more crucial than ever. My aim in this article is to contribute to this endeavor by exploring how a feminist political ecology framework applied to a specific case study in Nicaragua one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world can generate new policy and project-relevant lessons and insights from the ground that can in turn strengthen the conceptual debate on gender and climate change adaptation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in 2013 and 2014, as well as eight years of professional experience as a development worker in Nicaragua, I discuss the workings of power in the feminist political ecology of climate change adaptation; in so doing I raise new questions that will, I hope, lead policy-makers and project practitioners to explore how adaptation processes could open up the conceptual possibility for emancipation, transformation, and new ways of living life in common.

AB  - There is now growing support for the United Nations to explicitly recognise the human right to a healthy environment, and to strengthen the fight for environmental justice. One key consideration is to explore how accessible environmental justice is for citizens in low- and middle-income countries, who are adversely affected by pollution problems. This article will evaluate citizen access to environmental justice through the state via a case study of Peru. To do so, the article utilises the political ecology of voice (PEV) theoretical framework. PEV can be defined as the study of several economic, political, social, and geographical factors over a specific temporal period, and their impact upon the use of voice by different stakeholders. The research was centred on two communities affected by oil pollution events within Peru's Loreto Region. It will show that Loreto's rural population are subjected to "shadow environmental citizenship," in which they have only peripheral access to environmental justice through the state, which also does not adequately recognise or support their right to seek redress. This in turn, forces people to seek access and recognition of environmental justice through more unorthodox or radical forms of action, or via the support of non-state actors.

AB  - The scientific literature distinguishes between primary or natural and secondary or human-induced salinization. Assessing this distinction is of vital importance to assign liabilities and responsibilities in pollution cases and for designing the best policy and management actions. In this context, actors interested in downplaying the role of certain drivers of human-induced salinization can attempt to neglect its importance by referring to natural salinization, in a similar fashion to other pollution and health-related cases, fromtobacco smoke to climate change. Potash mining, which has experienced continued growth during the last decades and is a significant contributor to salinization, is prone to originate such controversies because natural salinization from the saline geological catch can be mixed with salinization produced by mining waste such as brines and mine tailings, thus obscuring the distinction between causes. By reviewing the long-standing social and environmental conflict caused by potash mining in a region of Mediterranean climate-the Llobregat river basin-in this article, we highlight the importance of the impacts of salinization on human health and provide a critical social science perspective on salinization processes.

AB  - Sustainability has become a powerful discourse, guiding the efforts of various stakeholders to find strategies for dealing with current and future social-ecological crises. To overcome the latter, we argue that sustainability discourse needs to be based on a critical-emancipatory conceptualization. Therefore, we engage two such approaches-environmental justice approaches informed by a plural understanding of justice and feminist political economy ones focusing on care-and their analytical potential for productive critique of normative assumptions in the dominant sustainability discourse. Both of these approaches highlight aspects of sustainability that are particularly relevant today. First, although sustainable development was conceptualized from the outset based upon a twofold notion of justice (intra- and intergenerational), the integration of justice in the dominant sustainability discourse and praxis often manifests merely as a normative aspiration. Meanwhile, the environmental justice and care approaches offer conceptualizations of justice that can act as a powerful lever and as transformation-strategy. Second, the dominant sustainability discourse largely remains within a neoliberal economic framework that continues to promote economic growth as the means to reach prosperity while neglecting the bases of every economy: care work and nature. Its focus lies solely on paid work and the market economy. By integrating (a) social and ecological 'reproductivity' (unpaid care and subsistence work as well as nature) and (b) democratic processes for just distribution of environmental burdens and benefits, as well as participatory equity in relevant decision making, feminist political economy and environmental justice approaches offer substantial strategies towards building humane, just and caring societies.

AB  - The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature. When understood descriptively, it usefully supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and equality by advocating 'standing with' or aiding fellow community members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake, when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks, personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles. Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity, or indeed, any use of the term that posits an 'other' against which solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely, structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity needs to show how it is connected to justice. It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts, but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely. They advance the following definition: 'Solidarity is an enacted commitment to carry "costs" (financial, social, emotional, or otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature, it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states. Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a 'civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of that European model in their understanding (though their conception is supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity). Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing 'costs' with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term 'costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity, one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked by assistance for others who are perceived as 'different' from oneself, rather than as being 'similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect, inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of what is perceived as 'similar' and what counts as 'a relevant respect,' remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such as these and also explicate what counts as 'similar in a relevant respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental reciprocity or 'tit for tat' reciprocity. In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity. This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine. But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle. Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use. This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged. Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside these groups' borders. Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational relationships take a networked form and involve relations to 'outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is explicitly understood as 'weak solidarity,' namely, 'the willingness to take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the requirement 'to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic of 'strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and 'caring for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated with the motto of the three musketeers: 'One for all and all for one,' but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as involving a clear awareness of a 'we' or 'us'. Although some sense of a 'we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see. In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as 'similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing 'we' in the context of collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an instance of what I have elsewhere called 'common activities,' the norms go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed 'equal positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency, no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them. In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents requires a set of conditions, both material and social. Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals' fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely, but also can be said to constitute 'the other side of justice' (in Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals. The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further, the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics. Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it. These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but may also include networking to help alleviate suffering. As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged, we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals) undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then, we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The 'we' in the case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination, oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the 'we' should remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states. Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups, if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice. That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor. Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.) More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the existing housing stock. According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people as a result of structural processes in which many people participate. These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure, Young argues, turns our attention to 'how the institutions of a society work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which people stand give rise to what she calls a 'forward looking' sense of political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather, some have substantial control over the processes to which others are subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if the solidarity actions are to be effective. For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the impacts of the structural features of political economy and the injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor. In such cases, effective action must not only support workers individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that simply 'incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice, these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development and for participating in processes of collective self-determination. This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g., among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global, justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated within these movements themselves. I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective about these effects of the structural context in which they function, and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and various political and economic transformations are also needed. But solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system). Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice. There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice, rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the 'power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society, which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law. Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities. Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required. Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act. They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in various locales across the United States, including rural areas and those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been important for understanding and addressing the social and economic factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters, e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes. Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African Americans made up 80% of the people in flooded low-lying communities, sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than 1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where there were radically insufficient medical supplies available. In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75% of Haiti's healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian authorities, and over 90% of the aid money went to international actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid, too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017. This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti, we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts, but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S. government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects, establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would be necessary for the social transformative changes required. Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017. Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty. Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself, we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org, among many others. In the international context, mention should also be made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the 'White Helmets' operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case, since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis, Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the use of these databases. For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed, one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek, as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data. Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they would decide against contributing their own information, despite assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the very existence and continuation of these structural background conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice, if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these databases and they argue that only 'broad consent' is needed for the use of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal health data for use in medical databases. This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and their openness to corporate use of the included health information in the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social, technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks. This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use the qualification 'quasi' here to indicate that the input in question may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for formal rights of participation on governance boards by some representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of 'personalized medicine' or 'precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson. The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender, race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted. Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input. This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies, a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice.

AB  - The possibility of commercially exploiting plant, animal and human genetic resources unlocked by biotechnology has given rise to a wide range of cultural, environmental, ethical and economic conflicts. While supporters describe this activity as bioprospecting, critics refer to it as biopiracy. According to this latter view, international legal agreements and treaties have disregarded opposition and legalized the possibility of appropriating genetic resources and their derivative products through the use of patents. The legal framework that permits the appropriation of natural genetic products in Colombia also criminalizes aspects of traditional ways of life and enables a legally approved but socially harmful land-grabbing process. The article describes these processes and impact in terms of the inversion of justice and the erosion of environmental sustainability.

AB  - The concept of the circular economy has gained increasing prominence in academic, practitioner and policy circles and is linked to greening economies and sustainable development. However, the idea is more often celebrated than critically interrogated. Analysis shows the concept circulates as an idea and ideal, exemplified by industrial symbiosis and extended product life. Yet, its actual enactment is limited and fragile. Instead, circular economies are achieved mostly through global recycling networks which are the primary means by which wastes are recovered as resources. European policies eschew these circuits. Resource recovery through global recycling networks is regarded as a dirty and illegal trade. In its place, EU circular economies attempt to transform wastes into resources within the boundaries of the EU. Through an analysis of two case studies of resource recovery in the United Kingdom, we highlight the challenges that confront making circular economies within the EU, showing that these are borne of a conjuncture of politically created markets, material properties and morally defined materials circuits. We show resource recovery in the EU to be framed by moral economies, driven by discourses of ecological modernization, environmental justice and resource (in)security, the last of which connects to China's resource-intensive development.

AB  - South African cities have focused on sustainability as a policy and strategic objective. Nonetheless, realising the transformative potential of fostering sustainable transition pathways is challenging. Our entry point for understanding this impasse is that the ability of cities to transform lies in the opaque spaces between policy rhetoric and implementation. We unpack these policy disjunctures in two ways. Firstly, we posit that the potential of the City to ensure that policy based on progressive and transformative principles is implemented in ways that foster the intended action is tied up with its ability to perform as a learning institution. The transformative role of learning is in turn dependent on accessing the situated tacit knowledge that informs decision-making and action. Secondly, we propose that researching the capacity of the City to learn requires alternative spaces for research and deliberation. To illustrate these arguments, we draw on a knowledge co-production urban experiment in Cape Town to improve the efficacy and analysis of both policy development and implementation. Tacit knowledge surfaced practices that are found to hamper learning within the City. Engaging with identified barriers to learning and change provides alternate entry points for identifying feasible points of leverage to address sustainability disjunctures.

AB  - The development of fracking in the UK is at a crucial stage, with the industry seemingly on the brink of entering an operational phase. Despite this major development, analyses of its ethical dimensions have been limited. Concepts of environmental justice have been applied to the case of fracking to evaluate the ethicality of its development in the UK. However, these have tended to focus on a narrow range of environmental justice considerations. I argue that an expanded environmental justice frame can supplement existing contributions and provide a unified frame through which the ethicality of fracking in the UK can be further examined and evaluated. The paper applies an expanded environmental justice frame, which encompasses themes of distribution, procedure, recognition and capabilities. Considerations of justice as distribution highlight the unjust distribution of basic rights and the insufficiency of compensating benefits for the communities set to host fracking. An application of procedural justice questions whether community consent, even if present, would make fracking permissible when it is perceived as a solution to economic deprivation. I then argue that fracking in the UK constitutes an injustice as misrecognition, given its devaluation of communities through a neoliberal value system. An application of justice as capabilities frame outlines the risk of fracking being inconsistent with meeting basic needs for the functioning of individuals and communities, particularly in rural areas. Finally, climate and intergenerational justice are drawn upon to highlight the ability of the frame to incorporate these further justice considerations.

AB  - The problem of environmental health hazards around schools is serious but it has been neglected by researchers and analysts. This is concerning because children are highly susceptible to the effects of chemical hazards. Some ecological studies have demonstrated that higher school-level pollution is associated with lower aggregate school-level standardized test scores likely, related to increased respiratory illnesses and/or impaired cognitive development. However, an important question remains unexamined: How do school-level exposures impact individual children's academic performance? To address this, we obtained socio-demographic and grades data from the parents of 1888 fourth and fifth grade children in the El Paso (Texas, USA) Independent School District in 2012. El Paso is located on the US-side of the Mexican border and has a majority Mexican-origin population. School-based hazardous air pollution (HAP) exposure was calculated using census block-level US Environmental Protection Agency National Air Toxics Assessment risk estimates for respiratory and diesel particulate matter (PM). School level demographics were obtained from the school district. Multi-level models adjusting for individual level covariates (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, English proficiency, and economic deprivation) and school level covariates (e.g., percent of students economically disadvantaged and student-teacher ratio) showed that higher school-level HAPs were associated with lower individual-level grade point averages. An interquartile range increase in school-level HAP exposure was associated with an adjusted 0.11-0.40 point decrease in individual students' grade point averages (GPAs), depending on HAP type and emission source. Respiratory risk from HAPs had a larger effect on GPA than did diesel PM risk. Non-road mobile and total respiratory risk had the largest effects on children's GPA of all HAP variables studied and only mother's level of education had a larger effect than those two variables on children's GPA. The five school-level demographic indicators were only weakly associated with GPA. The study findings indicate the need for regulations on school siting and adjacent land uses to protect children's environmental health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies have demonstrated disparate exposures to carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) in neighborhoods with high densities of Black and Hispanic residents in the US. Asians are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the US, yet they have been underemphasized in previous studies of environmental health and injustice. This cross-sectional study investigated possible disparities in residential exposure to carcinogenic HAPs among Asian Americans, including Asian American subgroups in the US (including all 50 states and the District of Columbia, n = 71,208 US census tracts) using National Air Toxics Assessment and US Census data. In an unadjusted analysis, Chinese and Korean Americans experience the highest mean cancer risks from HAPs, followed by Blacks. The aggregated Asian category ranks just below Blacks and above Hispanics, in terms of carcinogenic HAP risk. Multivariate models adjusting for socioeconomic status, population density, urban location, and geographic clustering show that an increase in proportion of Asian residents in census tracts is associated with significantly greater cancer risk from HAPs. Neighborhoods with higher proportions (as opposed to lower proportions) of Chinese, Korean, and South Asian residents have significantly greater cancer risk burdens relative to Whites. Tracts with higher concentrations of Asians speaking a non-English language and Asians that are US-born have significantly greater cancer risk burdens. Asian Americans experience substantial residential exposure to carcinogenic HAPs in US census tracts and in the US more generally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Anthropocene refers to a geological epoch dominated by humans. Within this epoch atmospheric, geological, hydrological, biospheric and other earth systemic processes change due to human activity and can no longer only be ascribed to nature. The far-reaching effects of human activity lead to vulnerability of the earth system. One of the consequences of human activity that has a profound impact in the Anthropocene and that acts as a catalyst of vulnerability, is waste. In fact, Hecht (2018:111) has described the Anthropocene as the "apotheosis of waste ". Within the context of the Anthropocene this article explores Martha Fineman's vulnerability theory and Louis Kotze 's related and extended framework of earth systemic vulnerability. Both Fineman and Kotze argue for a destabilisation of traditional legal subjectivity Their point of departure is not the Western, liberal autonomous subject, but rather the universal vulnerable subject that demands a responsive state. A responsive state should produce sources of resilience to counteract universal vulnerability. Kotze 's theoretical extension of Fineman universal vulnerability to earth system vulnerability is in step with the nonhuman turn, a movement associated with the late twentieth century, and set on the decentering of humans. Instead, the movement accentuates the agency of nonhumans. By extending the universal vulnerable subject to be more inclusive and encompass the nonhuman subject as well, the vulnerability of other elements of the earth system can also be highlighted. Fineman's response to traditional notions of subjectivity emerged as a critique of formal equality. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the notion of the universal vulnerable subject is relevant in the South African context. The latter is characterised by a human rights approach advocating substantive equality. Although the South African approach to human rights therefore differs from the American one, Kotze highlights other shortcomings of human rights in the Anthropocene. They create space for vulnerability theory to enhance approaches to complex problems associated with the epoch. The concept of the universal vulnerable subject can, for instance, be utilised to question the anthropocentric approach to subjectivity. After establishing that vulnerability theory and earth system vulnerability can contribute to the South African socio-legal discourse on the Anthropocene, the authors explore earth systemic vulnerability of vulnerable subjects in the context of landfills. These vulnerabilities, cautions Kohn (2014:27), are not innate to the vulnerable subject but are produced by relationships between the subjects and their environments. Building on this proviso, the article demonstrates that earth systemic vulnerability is caused by relationships between vulnerable human and nonhuman subjects and the landfill environment on both micro- and macroecological levels. It traces personal, relational and institutional vulnerabilities of both nonhuman and human entities. The article traces nonhuman and human vulnerabilities related to microecological bacterial relationships in the context of waste decomposition in landfills, personal and relational vulnerabilities caused by relationships between waste pickers, other stakeholders and their environment, and eventually global relationships that expose personal, relational and institutional vulnerability of macroecologies. By introducing a broad and expansive universal vulnerable subject inclusive of nonhuman entities, the authors endeavour to contribute to the legal theoretical foundation of waste management by advocating a progressive approach to waste theory. This analysis is analogous to similar work done within the context of climate change. Within the Anthropocene there is room for theoretical work using a wider lens that not only concentrates on the local context, but rather highlights the vulnerability of micro- and macroecologies. Due to scope considerations two other aspects of the vulnerability analysis will be considered in a forthcoming article, in which we will consider how vulnerable subjects use sources of resilience to counter earth system vulnerability and investigate the role of the responsive state in the creation of sources of resilience.

AB  - Theorists have argued that environmental justice requires more than just the fair distribution of environmental benefits and harms. It also requires participation in environmental decisions of those affected by them, and equal recognition of their cultural identities, dimensions most clearly articulated in relation to indigenous struggles, where past devaluation of place-based cultural identities is seen as a source of injustice. An alternative concept of environmental justice is proposed that draws on accounts of how attachment (and place attachment specifically) is constitutive for both self-efficacy and collective agency in the face of an intrinsically uncertain future. Drawing on the work of Peter Marris and using a case study of UK gas pipeline infrastructure, it is shown how disruption to attachments also disrupts lived strategies for dealing with an uncertain future. The source of injustice involved in such disruption should be viewed as the colonisation of attachment'.

AB  - Social and environmental justice across generations is a fundamental attribute of sustainable development. In this article, which is also a call for papers for a future theme in Public Money & Management (PMM), we develop our case for further research on how governments and public service organizations seek to address sustainable development in their decision-making processes. We believe that accounting for social and environmental aspects is an underdeveloped area of research and practice that is worthy of further critical enquiry. We therefore call on researchers and practitioners to submit their research to a themed issue of PMM on managing and accounting for sustainable development in public services.

AB  - The crucial role of the informal economy in urban environmental management is yet to be acknowledged in policy-making. This paper explores the sustainability discourses that shape urban environmental policies, and how they relate to different conceptualisations of the informal economy. Focusing on Mexico City, this paper analyses the discourses of policy-makers and their reflection in the city's waste management plan. Results show reformist and radical discourses of sustainability are correlated with preferences as to the integration or exclusion of the informal economy in environmental policy. In addressing Mexico City's environmental challenges, policy-makers have embraced a reformist sustainability discourse that focuses on technological fixes to environmental degradation and promotes a techno-managerial mode of governing. This discourse is correlated with a view of the informal economy as a barrier to the sustainability transition, which leads to the exclusion of informal workers from the policy arena and renders invisible their working conditions and their contribution to urban life. The paper concludes that the reformist sustainability discourse obscures and reproduces environmental injustices - repoliticization of the sustainability discourses shaping urban environmental policies is necessary to achieve sustainability transitions that are also socially just.

AB  - The aim of this article is to see how awareness of sustainable development and environmental justice can be increased and operationalized in planning through the use of scenarios. On scrutinizing four long-term urban development strategies for Stockholm, we found that they all intend to depict a sustainable urban development, but the resultant images are very different. This article underlines the importance of combining environmental justice with an understanding of environmental threats and risks. We see that the carrying capacity of nature is limited, but we also see the need to share resources justly and make sure that environmental degradation does not systematically strike certain groups only. The conceptual elements are applied to four scenarios for a future Stockholm, zooming in to some extent on a suburban shopping node just outside the city. The point of focusing on it is that such shopping areas are sometimes seen as symbols of non-sustainable city development, but, since they are already in place, their function in the future city needs to be discussed.

AB  - The rapid process of urbanization aggravates the imbalance between the supply and demand of urban public services. Urban parks are among the most important urban public services, and their use efficiency has been an important index for urban planning. Therefore, it is essential to estimate well their service area and influencing factors. Traditional survey data used to analyze the characteristics of urban park services are limited by small samples and high cost. Owing to thriving information communication technologies, vast amounts of human activity data have become available that enable understanding of human travel behavior. In this study, we analyzed a park service area, which is defined as the zone of influence of individual parks, in Beijing, and the factors that influence the service area. First, the service area was estimated using 1-SDE based on mobile phone signaling data. A multiple linear regression model was then used to analyze the influence of factors on the park service area. The results show that (1) external factors including population density, the number of commercial facilities, and traffic convenience have significant influences on the park service area; (2) employment places positively influence the park service area on the weekday; and (3) other factors such as park design and park reputation had inconsistent effects on the park service area, in either sign or significance, regarding the weekday and the weekend. The findings of this study will be of practical value when designing parks or undertaking city planning in the future.

AB  - The difficulties in negotiating a post-2012 regime of binding targets and timetables and the decisions of the US, Canada, and Russia on the Kyoto Protocol regime have led to pessimism about the future of the climate regime. Negotiation issues for different coalitions and actors are placed in a wider historical context by examining the key challenge facing the evolving long-term climate change negotiation process: the principled basis for the allocation of resources, responsibilities, rights, and risks between actors. Four theoretical approaches (problem structuring; negotiation theory; collective action and social practice models; legal theory) are applied to the climate regime. A principled approach is only a distributive approach from a narrow short-term perspective. It becomes an integrative approach from a longer-term perspective when it increases the pie, enhances the win-win opportunities and creates space for sustainable solutions to emerge. It is especially integrative when undertaken within the context of global rule of law, which is able to create predictable rules that apply to future global problems with different country interests. Will this happen? Climate justice movements and climate litigation have begun; statesmanship is still needed.

AB  - The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework has been used by environmental agencies and others to assess environmental challenges and policy responses. However, in doing so, social justice or equity issues tend to come as an afterthought, while there is evidence that environmental challenges and policy responses are not equity (including gender-) neutral. Hence, this paper addresses the question: why should, and how can, equity issues and environmental justice be incorporated into the DPSIR framework? It presents a structure for including equity within DPSIR and applies it. It reviews the literature to bring together data that demonstrates that there is a clear equity perspective along the entire DPSIR analysis. It concludes that although individual environmental policies may succeed to achieve their specific goal in the short term; if they ignore the equity aspects, the policy strategies as a whole are likely to be environmentally unjust, and lead to exclusive and unsustainable development, which, in turn, could further exacerbate environmental challenges. This highlights the need for an integrated approach in efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable development.

AB  - There has been an unprecedented inclusion of Indigenous peoples in environmental governance instruments like free, prior, and informed consent; reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) projects; climate adaptation initiatives; and environmental impact assessment. We draw on theories of participatory governance to show how locally implemented processes have been shaped by their interactions with invited, closed, and indigenous-led spaces at multiple scales. Empirically, our article is based on field research in Latin America, semistructured interviews, and a systematic literature review. We find four main barriers that have (re-)produced environmental injustices in environmental governance: first, a lack of influence over the institutional design of governance instruments; second, the exclusion of Indigenous peoples in the domestication of global instruments; third, policy incoherencies constraining the scope for decision-making; and fourth, weak cross-scale linkages between Indigenous-led spaces. This article helps to elucidate constraints of participatory spaces and identify leeway for transformation toward environmental justice.

AB  - Soil fumigants have been critical to the California strawberry industry's success, but they are also highly toxic to farmworkers and nearby residents. This article traces recent regulatory debates over restrictions on their use which were cast as a contest of lives and livelihoods: activists emphasized the danger of the chemicals while industry emphasized their necessity. Activists' claims were typical of environmental justice battles that focus on disproportionate toxic exposure to marginalized populations, but I problematize that they downplayed industry concern with farmworker jobs. Drawing on Marx, Foucault and recent literature on surplus populations and disposability, I suggest that the analytical separation of lives and livelihoods is complicit in the making of disposable workers such as California farmworkers. Strategically, upholding the separation was a missed opportunity to leverage the strawberry industry's new-found concern with farmworker employment and push for measures that protect current and future farmworker health.

AB  - The emergent field of environmental epigenetics, which studies health effects of xenobiotic' chemicals, fundamentally challenges standard models of the biochemical pathways that shape bodies and human health. This article explores the implications of these discoveries for geographic knowledge in the nature-society and spatial traditions of human health, both of which have tended to black-box the material, biochemical body and treat the environment as an inert setting. Discoveries in epigenetics suggest that the environment is a biochemically active inducer of phenotypical development. In addition, understandings of the delayed temporality and intergenerational effects of epigenetic mechanisms challenge methodologies that privilege space.

AB  - Scholars have increasingly recognized the ways in which climate change threatens the human rights of people around the world, with a disproportionate burden on the rights of already vulnerable persons. At particular risk to these populations is the right to health, as well as to interconnected human rights. Yet, scholars have generally not provided a thorough assessment of precisely how human rights law can catalyze a response to climate change to effectively avert health harms. This article suggests that human rights law is better suited to guide procedural responses to climate change and its health harms than it is to guide substantive decision-making. This article describes the ways in which climate change implicates the right to health and then analyzes human rights law's response. While acknowledging the intrinsic value of human rights in prompting climate change action, the article focuses its analysis on human rights' instrumental value in this arena.

AB  - Spatial variance in returns from natural resources, driven by resource dynamics and regulations, can have strong consequences for equitable delivery of value to individuals and communities. Yet resource management models implicitly weight returns equally across space, even when space is explicitly included in model dynamics and policy. Here we translate financial portfolio theory from the temporal to spatial realm and use it to quantify the inherent tradeoff between resource returns and social equity, defined as a more uniform distribution of resource value across space. We illustrate this approach with a marine case study of the Channel Islands, California, USA. Depending on the spatial distribution of resources, increasing spatial equity requires nonlinear reductions in resource returns. Realistic management options, such as effort-based fisheries regulations or marine protected areas, increase or reduce this tradeoff, respectively. We also quantify two critical advantages of portfolio approaches to management: they improve outcomes by avoiding false expectations and increase either resource return or social equity while maintaining the other.

This paper offers a critical reflection on current tendencies within South African human geography towards parochialism, empiricism and disconnection from the international academy. Pointing to these developments as being rooted within the local geographical tradition, a call is made for greater critical self-reflection in order to re-engage international debates and advance local transformation. The tendency to bemoan the dominance of Anglo-American journals and academics, as well as contextual systematic constraints, is noted and established scholars gently chastised for failing to move beyond complaints towards measures that offer a way forward in these debates.

AB  - Sustainability, safety and smartness are three key elements of a modern transportation system. This study illustrates various policy directions and initiatives of Singapore to address how its transportation system is progressing in light of these three components. Sustainability targets economical efficiency, environmental justice and social equity by including policies for integrating land use and transport planning, ensuring adequate transport supply measures, managing travel demand efficiently, and incorporating environment-friendly strategies. Safety initiatives of its transportation system aim to minimize injuries and incidents of all users including motorists, public transport commuters, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Smartness incorporates qualities like real time sensing, fast processing and decision making, and automated action-taking into its control, monitoring, information management and revenue collection systems. Various policy implications and technology applications along these three directions reveal that smart technologies facilitate implementation of policies promoting sustainability and safety. The Singapore experience could serve as a good reference for other cities in promoting a transportation system that is sustainable, safe and smart. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The United States' deeply racialized history currently operates below the surface of contemporary apolitical narratives on vulnerability mitigation and adaptation to sea-level rise. As communities, regulatory agencies, and policy-makers plan for rising seas, it is important to recognize the landscapes of race and deep histories of racism that have shaped the socio-ecological formations of coastal regions. If this history goes unrecognized, what we label colorblind adaptation planning is likely to perpetuate what Rob Nixon calls the "slow violence" of environmental racism, characterized by policies that benefit some populations while abandoning others. By colorblind adaptation planning, we refer to vulnerability mitigation and adaptation planning projects that altogether overlook racial inequality or worse dismiss its systemic causes and explain away racial inequality by attributing racial disparities to non-racial causes. We contend that responses to sea-level rise must be attuned to racial difference and structures of racial inequality. In this article, we combine the theory of racial formation with the geographical study of environmental justice and point to the ways racial formations are also environmental. We examine vulnerability to sea-level rise through the process of racial coastal formation on Sapelo Island, Georgia, specifically analyzing its deep history, the uneven racial development of land ownership and employment, and barriers to African American participation and inclusion in adaptation planning. Racial coastal formation's potential makes way for radical transformation in climate change science not only in coastal areas, but other spaces as situated territorial racial formations.

AB  - Scholarship at the intersection of social movement and organizational theories has illuminated intra-organizational factors that shape agencies' efforts to implement policies social movements have fought for, emphasizing the roles of agency leaders' ideological commitments to movement policy, organizational capacity, and sanctions to ensure compliance. I argue that social movement policy implementation is also shaped by bureaucrats' tacit understandings of key movement concepts, albeit conditioned by how able they feel to implement those interpretations in light of political contexts. I make this argument through the case of government agency environmental justice (EJ) grant programs, analyzing program documents, funding patterns, and confidential interviews with agency representatives to explain why most EJ grant programs deviate from longstanding EJ movement priorities while one program coheres with them. I show that these outcomes stem from the fact that many staff-even while avowing support for EJ policy-hold tacit understandings of key movement concepts that differ from those of advocates. Social movement policy implementation can align with movement principles when institutional logics consistent with the movement are held, promoted, and defended by agency representatives who feel that their institutional environment permits them to implement those ideas.

AB  - The Canada-U.S. State of the Strait Conference is a biennial forum with a 22-year history of assessing ecosystem status and providing advice to improve research, monitoring, and management of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie. The 2019 conference focused on assessing ecosystem health based on 61 indicators. Although there has been considerable improvement in the Detroit River since the 1960s, much additional cleanup is needed to restore ecosystem health. Western Lake Erie is now at risk of crossing several potential tipping points caused by the interactions of a variety of drivers and their stresses. This assessment identified eight environmental and natural resource challenges: climate change; population growth/transportation expansion/land use changes; chemicals of concern; human health/environmental justice; aquatic invasive species; habitat loss/degradation; nonpoint source pollution; and eutrophication/harmful algal blooms. Specific recommendations for addressing each challenge were also made. Climate change is the most pressing environmental challenge of our time and considered a ``threat multiplier" whereby warmer, wetter, and more extreme climatic conditions amplify other threats such as poor air quality effects on vulnerable residents, species changes, and nonpoint source runoff and combined sewer overflow events that contribute to eutrophication and can manifest as harmful algal blooms. Our assessment found that investments in monitoring and evaluation are insufficient and that the region's intellectual and environmental capital is not being leveraged sufficiently to address current challenges. Continued investment in this transnational network is essential to support ecosystembased management. (C) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Selection of a suitable general circulation model (GCM) ensemble is crucial for effective water resource management and reliable climate studies in developing countries with constraint in human and computational resources. A careful selection of a GCM subset by excluding those with limited similarity to the observed climate from the existing pool of GCMs developed by different modeling centers at various resolutions can ease the task and minimize uncertainties. In this study, a feature selection method known as symmetrical uncertainty (SU) was employed to assess the performance of 26 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCM outputs under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. The selection was made according to their capability to simulate observed daily precipitation (prcp), maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax and Tmin) over the historical period 1980-2005 in the Niger Delta region, which is highly vulnerable to extreme climate events. The ensemble of the four top-ranked GCMs, namely ACCESS1.3, MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHM, and NorESM1-M, were selected for the spatio-temporal projection of prcp, Tmax, and Tmin over the study area. Results from the chosen ensemble predicted an increase in the mean annual prcp between the range of 0.26% to 3.57% under RCP4.5, and 0.7% to 4.94% under RCP 8.5 by the end of the century when compared to the base period. The study also revealed an increase in Tmax in the range of 0 to 0.4 degrees C under RCP4.5 and 1.25-1.79 degrees C under RCP8.5 during the periods 2070-2099. Tmin also revealed a significant increase of 0 to 0.52 degrees C under RCP4.5 and between 1.38-2.02 degrees C under RCP8.5, which shows that extreme events might threaten the Niger Delta due to climate change. Water resource managers in the region can use these findings for effective water resource planning, management, and adaptation measures.

AB  - The application of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) programs on communal lands raises questions about how PES interacts with collective resource management institutions. We explore how an Ecuadorian payment program is associated with the development of rules to manage shared grazing lands. In addition, we assess the communal characteristics that make it more likely that a participant community will change their land-use rules. Our analysis draws from an almost complete census of participant communities in the Ecuadorian highlands (n = 44), a survey of non-participant communities (n = 23) and a household questionnaire (n = 420). We find that the majority of participant communities have strengthened their land-use rules since program participation. Communities that craft new rules and apply their rules are more likely to be organized and have internal monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. Poorer communities are also more likely to have made a rule change in response to participation; wealthier communities are more likely to maintain existent land-use institutions. We find no association between rule change and level of payment. Our results highlight the need to dis-aggregate the role of payments and contract commitment and to further analyze how community characteristics may influence the effectiveness and equity of PES in communal contexts.

AB  - The Philadelphia Water Department has committed to taking a green infrastructure (GI) approach to reduce stormwater runoff and prevent combined sewer overflow events. Promoting GI as a stormwater management technique in a city necessitates development of a more distributed urban environmental management system, through which the city's water department needs to coordinate with a wide range of public and private stakeholders, shifting power from the utility to these other stakeholders. We argue that distributed urban environmental management can lead to more inclusive outcomes but only if there is an intentionality about how funds are distributed, which communities are prioritized, how partners are chosen and cultivated, and which types of projects are implemented in which neighborhoods. We suggest the development of an equity index to help identify communities that would most benefit from GI investment as critical for equitable GI planning. Using Philadelphia as a test case, we develop a Green Infrastructure Equity Index, designed with the indirect benefits of green infrastructure in mind, to determine which communities could benefit the most from investment in GI based on their "equity void ranking". We argue that developing a GI Equity Index provides a much more nuanced analysis of communities that takes into account the built environment as well as the underlying social and economic conditions. The GI Equity Index also allows for a shift in the way we define equity. In doing so, it (1) changes the conversation about equity in GI planning using careful data analysis that takes into account both socio-economic and built environment variables; (2) provides a visual tool that communities can use to understand underlying conditions and the existing placement of GI; and (3) serves as a framework that can be tailored to allow communities to weight their priorities, putting more power in their hands.

AB  - The 'just transition' is a concept receiving more attention in the literature to-date. This critical review discusses this and how there are overlaps with literature on energy, environmental and climate justice. Within the separate energy, environment and climate change scholar communities, there is too much distortion of what the 'transition' means and what 'justice' means, and they all should be understood within the just transition concept. To increase public understanding and public acceptance of a just transition, these research communities need to unite rather than continue alone.

AB  - Scholars have long investigated factors contributing to enactment of environmentally responsible behaviors (ERBs), largely among white populations. Although research has debunked the myth that black people express less environmental concern, few studies examine what influences their pro-environmental behavior. We focus on how the cognitively oriented cultural frames of environmentalism and environmental justice combine with overlooked emotions to shape ERBs reported by a nationally representative sample of 988 black residents in the United States. Results indicate that the environmentalism frame, indicated by environmental identity but not attitudes, enhances all the behaviors examined: general conservation, cost-saving conservation, recycling, and advocacy. Effects of environmental justice, however, are more limited. Passion for environmental protection likewise positively affects all pro-environmental actions, and moral outrage over the condition of the environment exerts strong positive effects on conservation and advocacy. In highlighting the role of emotions in conjunction with cultural frames on ERBs, new avenues for research emerge.

AB  - The value of critically examining the way that research is done can provide a way to better understand a spectrum of people's experiences. Examining assumptions about data as well as how they are collected and analyzed to study issues related to leisure as well as physical activity requires individuals to recognize that insight about diversity can be gained in many ways. The purpose of this essay is to provide perspectives about including and moving beyond diversity (e.g., gender, race, disability status, sexual identity) as only an independent variable. The potential for these perspectives is just research that contributes to social and environmental justice related to leisure and physical activity. Existing research approaches are relevant but options are open for other possibilities when examining issues related to variables associated with diversity. These options add to the complexity of the research conducted when just research is undertaken.

AB  - Slow Food is a global, grassroots movement aimed at enhancing and sustaining local food cultures and traditions worldwide. Since its establishment in the 1980s as a local protest movement in Italy, Slow Food evolved into a global movement composed through countless local 'grassroots' activities intersecting with more 'top-down' umbrella orchestration and framing. This paper explores the many faces of this one-in-many movement by focusing on the circulation and variation of Slow Food ideas and practices across the world. The core argument is that these ideas and practices effectively capture and steer the manifold affective moments emerging from local and network activities. The affective-effective conversions are traced here by applying a semiotic-network approach to a large corpus of Slow Food websites. Thus adopting a novel approach and methodology of tracing the geographical development of a social movement, the paper reveals both grassroots and global patterns of change and diffusion, and zooms in on specific nodes, connections and practices that play a key role in the movement's development. In doing so, we develop a research strategy that is better able to make sense of complex and non-linear processes of geographical diffusion-innovation.

AB  - The electric grid is evolving rapidly in response to climate change. As renewables are incorporated, more interconnection of the grid is expected. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from fossil-fuel generation causes adverse health impacts, including thousands of premature deaths each year in the United States. It is well understood that PM2.5 exposure can occur at great distances from pollutant sources, but insufficient work has been done to understand the role of grid interconnection and trade in causing pollution-related mortality. Regions with clean generation can import electricity from regions with highly polluting generation sources, allowing them to benefit from the electricity consumption while people in other regions suffer the associated health damages. We use flow tracing and consumption-based accounting to characterize the health damages from exposure to PM2.5 from electricity imports. We find that 8% of our estimated premature deaths from electricity consumption in the United States are due to electricity imports. There is large geographic heterogeneity, with the most impacts occurring in the Midwest. While the West Coast has much cleaner generation and lower impacts overall, in many West Coast Balancing Areas, more than 50% of the estimated premature mortality associated with electricity consumption is caused by electricity imports, with some groups experiencing larger impacts than others.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic generated a number of changes in the functioning of urban areas all over the world and had a visible impact on the use of green infrastructure, including city parks. The study discusses and compares operation and use of two such parks located in Wellington, New Zealand and Warsaw, Poland by adopting "pandemic urban ethnography", an approach that includes autoethnography, interviews with users, non-participant observation, and analysis of social media content. As indicated by the findings of the study, the importance of less rigidly designed, multifunctional spaces that give their users freedom of "tactical" adjustments, significantly grows during times of lockdown and "social distancing". During such a crisis, the management and everyday use of urban parks are highly related to urban policies. The article provides insight into how those policies impact the functional values of green infrastructure confronting it with user-generated adaptations and the landscape design itself. The global health emergency showed how access to green areas becomes a crucial determinant on environmental justice while proving the significance of "tactical pandemic urbanism" as both a design and management method.

AB  - The themes of immigration and mobility have not been adequately examined by environmental justice (EJ) scholars. This study addresses that gap by clarifying factors shaping Hispanic people's residential decision-making and their associated exposures to cancer risks from Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) in Greater Houston, Texas. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 Hispanic householders Who had previously completed a structured survey, which was representative of Greater Houston's population. Our research design enabled data collection from immigrant and United States (US)-born Hispanics living at high and low risk to HAPs. By using a comparative qualitative analysis approach to examine divergent experiences of Hispanic subgroups, we advance from the monolithic treatment of the US Hispanic population reflected in the extant EJ literature. Our findings reveal that key determinants of high HAP risks included economic constraint on residential locational options for both US-born and immigrant Hispanics, and attraction to sociocultural benefits in co-ethnic enclaves among immigrants in particular. In contrast, protective factors differed entirely between US-born and immigrant Hispanics. For US-born participants, the experience of upward-and-outward sociospatial mobility - coupled with detachment from the Hispanic community - generated lower HAP risks, while the experience of living in social isolation within a less-than-ideal rental unit was protective for immigrants. The pernicious, multiscalar nature of environmental injustice experienced by Greater Houston's Hispanic immigrants is encapsulated by the fact that their pursuit of affordable and comfortable residential settings at the household level contributes to the reproduction of their collectively disproportionate HAP exposures.

AB  - The environmental justice (EJ) literature can benefit from comparative analysis that helps to identify conditions for more and less successful outcomes. A data set of 50 EJ cases in the U.S. was developed with high and low remediation as the outcome. Causal conditions were selected on theoretical grounds, and included five mobilizing strategies (local and state government coalitions, federal government attention, civil disobedience, litigation, and national NGO support) and three general conditions (absence of industry counter-mobilization, presence of water pollution, and proposed or new siting). Qualitative comparative analysis and other analyses indicated that all causal conditions were found in the high-remediation cases but that some conditions (water pollution and local-state coalitions) were more consistently associated with the high-remediation outcome. The analysis points to the value of systematic studies of the factors that affect local EJ outcomes and to the need for better case study collections.

AB  - The Ramsar Convention is unquestionably the backbone of modern wetland management theory and practice. In the last four decades, it has mainstreamed wetlands in the environmental discourse and fostered the development of a comprehensive institutional framework for wetland governance. However, many of the wetlands that occur in human-dominated landscapes remain acutely threatened. The problem is most alarming in urban areas, especially in the fast expanding cities of the developing world, where unprecedented wetland destruction is leading to recurring environmental disasters. This triggers the question: are these failures in wetland governance purely induced by factors exogenous to Ramsar-based institutions or are they manifestations of conceptual drawbacks within Ramsar conceptual framework. Here, we investigate the success and failures of the application of the Ramsar framework's policy directives and management guidelines for urban wetlands using two rapidly expanding cities in South Asia as case studies - Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Kolkata (India). We conclude that despite its remarkable achievements over the past four decades, the Ramsar framework has several conceptual drawbacks that weaken its effectiveness in complex urban contexts. An inadequate recognition of the complex dynamics of urban social-ecological systems, an inadequate recognition of the political complexity of the policy processes, and a lack of an environmental justice perspective are the main shortcomings contributing to failures in urban wetlands governance. While we acknowledge that some solutions are contingent upon national and transnational level socio-political processes and reforms, we offer a set of technical and strategic modifications to the Ramsar framework that can significantly improve its effectiveness in urban wetlands governance.

AB  - There has been a notable increase in the use of geographic information systems (GIs) in studies of environmental (injustice in the last two decades. Whilst the potential of such techniques is increasingly being recognised, there remain some key research challenges facing researchers interested in wider notions of environmental justice (EJ). One avenue of research concerns the estimation of population denominator and the influence of the estimation model on the conclusions emanating from such studies. Whilst the potential of so-called dasymetric mapping techniques have been explored in other substantive areas such as crime and health geography, their use in El applications remains under-explored. This paper represents a preliminary attempt to redress this gap in the literature through a comparison of the deprivation profiles of residents living in the vicinity of landfill sites in Wales using both 'traditional' and innovative methods of population estimation that provide a more realistic representation of actual population distribution. The results as we demonstrate suggest that more emphasis needs to be placed on the methods by which population is estimated if the results of GIS-based environmental justice studies are to be more widely applied.

AB  - The SchoolStrike4Climate protests have renewed interest in youth political participation, but there has been little scholarly explanation for how young people came to be involved in such actions. While most studies focus on the motivations of participants, this paper considers the role of youth-led organisations in fostering political interest and action for climate justice among young people. Through a case study of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition (AYCC), we argue that over 15 years this youth-led organisation has played a key role by building an enduring organisational base and using multiple strategies to foster understanding and commitment among young people in Australia towards issues of sustainability and action on climate change. Key to the AYCC approach is a climate justice narrative in which young people are legitimate political actors responding to the climate crisis. This narrative manifests in the organisational structure, youthful hybrid repertoires of action and peer-based, educative initiatives. From our analysis, we propose the concept of 'educative movement-building' to describe the unique way young people are making organisations and generating broad support for climate justice in Australia with implications for studies of environmental activism and democracy more broadly.

AB  - Scientists have increasingly called for the recognition that Earth has entered a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene. Researchers believe anthropogenic climate change and ecological degradation will have the greatest impacts on communities that are socially and economically marginalized. This article will explore the role of counselors in the Anthropocene as environmental justice advocates through the application of the Multicultural and Social Justice Counseling Competencies (Ratts et al., 2015). La comunidad cientifica ha insistido cada vez mas en el reconocimiento de que la Tierra ha entrado en una nueva era geologica denominada Antropoceno. Los investigadores creen que el cambio climatico antropogenico y la degradacion ecologica tendran un impacto maximo en las comunidades que se encuentran social y economicamente marginadas. Este articulo explora el papel de los consejeros en el Antropoceno como defensores de la justicia medioambiental a traves de la aplicacion de las Competencias en Consejeria Multicultural y de Justicia Social (Ratts et al., 2015).

AB  - The practical application of environmental justice in natural resource management depends upon moving beyond generic principles to situated understanding. This understanding in turn requires knowledge of both historical and geographical contexts, including how decision-making frameworks develop and the nature of the biophysical environment itself. This paper examines these requirements based on case material from the Hunter Valley, New South Wales. In the Hunter Valley, the colonial history of river management was one of the creation, and subsequent inclusion and exclusion, of particular 'stakes' from the decision-making process, resulting in a narrowly defined 'community of justice' that became institutionalised at the catchment scale. However, even within this restricted community, distributive injustices occurred due to a failure of policy to engage with environmental variability at both spatial and temporal scales. This combination of procedural injustice and environmental variability also resulted in ecological injustice - that is a disconnected or even antagonistic human-nature relationship that restricted the opportunity to redress the severe degradation of riverine ecosystems that had occurred since European settlement. In the light of these examples, broader challenges in the application of environmental justice to river management are explored in terms of ecological complexity and contested perceptions of environmental health. Based on this material, a historically and geographically situated, ecologically informed vision of environmental justice is proposed as an essential part of sustainable river management.

AB  - Since autumn 2018, Fridays for Future, the youth movement for climate justice, has been formed, which not only receives intense media attention but also exerts political influence. From the perspective of educational science, a range of questions arise in connection with this movement but so far they have hardly been addressed in the academic debate. The article aims to propose a thematic approach to Fridays for Future from the perspective of three different strands of research and, above all, to raise research questions. 1) How can the learning of the young participants in social-ecological movements be described? 2) What is the relationship between Fridays for Future and the implementation of sustainability or, respectively, Education for Sustainable Development in the educational system? 3) To what extent can Fridays for Future be described as a new generation conflict? The article discusses these three questions on the basis of the current state of research and proposes further research questions. In this way, we want to order, question, systematize, tie in with previous debates, and give impulses for further work.

AB  - The problem of fairly distributing the global mitigation effort is particularly important for the 1.5 A degrees C temperature limitation objective, due to its rapidly depleting global carbon budget. Here, we present methodology and results of the first study examining national mitigation pledges presented at the 2015 Paris climate summit, relative to equity benchmarks and 1.5 A degrees C-compliant global mitigation. Uniquely, pertinent ethical choices were made via deliberative processes of civil society organizations, resulting in an agreed range of effort-sharing parameters. Based on this, we quantified each country's range of fair shares of 1.5 A degrees C-compliant mitigation, using the Climate Equity Reference Project's allocation framework. Contrasting this with national 2025/2030 mitigation pledges reveals a large global mitigation gap, within which wealthier countries' mitigation pledges fall far short, while poorer countries' pledges, collectively, meet their fair share. We also present results for individual countries (e.g. China exceeding; India meeting; EU, USA, Japan, and Brazil falling short). We outline ethical considerations and choices arising when deliberating fair effort sharing and discuss the importance of separating this choice making from the scholarly work of quantitative "equity modelling" itself. Second, we elaborate our approach for quantifying countries' fair shares of a global mitigation effort, the Climate Equity Reference Framework. Third, we present and discuss the results of this analysis with emphasis on the role of mitigation support. In concluding, we identify twofold obligations for all countries in a justice-centred implementation of 1.5 A degrees C-compliant mitigation: (1) unsupported domestic reductions and (2) engagement in deep international mitigation cooperation, through provision of international financial and other support, or through undertaking additional supported mitigation activities. Consequently, an equitable pathway to 1.5 A degrees C can only be imagined with such large-scale international cooperation and support; otherwise, 1.5 A degrees C-compliant mitigation will remain out of reach, impose undue suffering on the world's poorest, or both.

AB  - The treadmill of production has identified and examined an inherent dynamic that results in the inexorable expansion of capitalism. Although it is argued that a number of benefits accompany this econoinic expansion, the treadmill of production literature has focused on the environmental costs. The treadmill of production embraces the legacy of C Wright Mills with a focus on the entangled relationships between two aspects of Mills's "power elite "politics and economics. Building on Mills's inclusion of militarisin as one of the three pillars of the power elite, it is argued that there exists a treadmill of destruction that maintains a distinct logic relating to geopolitics and arms races that cannot be reduced to capitalism. The 20th century has witnessed unprecedented growth in the research, testing, storage, and employment of both conventional weaponry and weapons of moss destruction. Infocusing on this development, the distinctive role the state plays in creating a treadmill of destruction is stressed.

AB  - The 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the new global development goals guiding the work of mainstream development actors until 2030. The shift to "sustainable development" marks a response to climate change and constitutes a rebranding of international development as global development, prominently by the UN, World Bank, and IMF. In this paper, I draw from recent fieldwork in Bolivia to question what is being globalised. In response to calls for northern geographers to better attend to new forms of coloniality and knowledge production, I take seriously indigenous agendas for development, land, and sovereignty to critique Agenda 2030 with decolonial territorial agendas and theories of environmental justice. I argue that the implementation of Agenda 2030 has reconfigured the borderlands between international development and indigenous territorial agendas. In a drastic reworking of the "boomerang effect," development infrastructure is being disconnected from anti-extractive indigenous territorial politics, as the modes of engagement between states, the private sector, and NGOs are reconfigured by the unifying agenda of sustainable development - weakening both indigenous struggles for territorial sovereignty and the environmental remit of the SDGs. An environmental justice perspective locates the case of the Territorio Indigena y Parque Nacional Isiboro (TIPNIS) Secure case within a bigger struggle between local claims to land and global extractive capital, foregrounding that decolonial agendas for territory are entangled with contemporary extractive capitalism. In seeking consensus between states, the private sector, and civil society, the SDGs minimise the sites of conflict that instruct "sustainable development," revealing both a critical weakness of the SDGs and a pathway towards their greater effectiveness.

AB  - Structural inequalities provide an important context for understanding and responding to the impact of high traffic densities on disadvantaged neighborhoods. Emerging atmospheric science and epidemiological research indicates hazardous vehicle-related pollutants (e.g., diesel exhaust) are highly concentrated near major roadways, and the prevalence of respiratory ailments and mortality are heightened in these high-traffic corridors. This article builds on recent findings that low-income and minority children in California disproportionately reside in high-traffic areas by demonstrating how the urban structure provides a critical framework for evaluating the causes, characteristics, and magnitude of traffic, particularly for disadvantaged neighborhoods. We find minority and high-poverty neighborhoods bear over two times the level of traffic density compared to the rest of the Southern California region, which may associate them with a higher risk of exposure to vehicle-related pollutants. Furthermore, these areas have older and more multifamily housing, which is associated with higher rates of indoor exposure to outdoor pollutants, including intrusion of motor vehicle exhaust. We discuss the implications of these patterns on future planning and policy strategies for mitigating the serious health consequences of exposure to vehicle-related air pollutants.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted our daily lives worldwide. For instance, pandemic-prevention policies restrict people's mobility, which causes problems in accessing urban greenspaces. Indeed, unequal access to urban greenspace has been accentuated during the most stringent lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. Amid such challenging circumstances, there has been a growing attention placed on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11.7, which has brought opportunities for urgent action. In this paper, we applied the Gini coefficient to our analysis of unequal access to urban greenspaces across all urban planning areas in six special municipalities in Taiwan. Moreover, we also conducted comparative analyses between the Gini coefficient and other socio-economic factors. The results show that approximately 63.98% of the urban planning area suffers from unequal access to greenspaces. In addition, urban greenspace provision and household income show significant positive correlations with the Gini coefficient, which reflects Taiwan's environmental injustice. Furthermore, these findings can help city planners and decision-makers evaluate levels of equality in each urban planning area and decide which priority areas should be improved. Finally, this study can also be used as a reference for decision-makers to realise SDG 11.7 in the post-pandemic era.

AB  - The transition from single-media, single-location, and single point-in-time analysis to a Cumulative approach represents a profound challenge - and opportunity - for policy makers, planners, advocates and researchers. These challenges and opportunities are, in part, methodological (e.g., data availability of pollution sources, uncertainty of chemical reactions among multiple pollutants, evaluating combined health effects of multiple environmental stressors). However, the social complexity of this issue has been acknowledged, but not systematically documented and analyzed. As a result, there is a significant gap between the development of cumulative impacts analysis and a limited ability to reap their benefit in resolving environmental justice conflicts. Framing cumulative impacts as a "wicked problem" can help highlight some of the challenges in implementing such approaches and can point the way towards applying these approaches to improving collaboration between policy makers, planners, and advocates. We present two case studies of cumulative impacts analysis in California using socio-spatial mapping and public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS). These cases will illustrate the challenges and opportunities for combining quantitative and socio-spatial science with PPGIS as strategies to address the wicked nature of assessing and acting to address cumulative environmental impacts. The Case studies will emphasize the value of an adaptive, participatory, and transdisciplinary approach as an effective response to the wicked qualities of cumulative impacts themselves. These cases can help planners, policy makers, and community advocates to apply a cumulative impacts approach to their own wicked problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sustainability of rural development depends on the distribution of the social and environmental resources needed to maintain and improve the vitality of rural areas. Here we examine the complexity of measuring patterns of distribution using examples of socioeconomic data on rural poverty and affluence as well as data on environmental quality and species richness. We demonstrate how changes in the base spatial units used for analysis have different effects on different measures of inequality. The effects of such changes in spatial resolution also depend on the underlying processes that generate the data. The results of our investigations into the effects of scale on the assessment of inequality suggest that, where data come from both the social and natural science sources, the most appropriate level for analysis is that of the finest common resolution. This may result in redundancy of effort for some types of data but any such disadvantage is offset by the benefits of identifying inequalities that are masked at coarser resolutions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inequalities that are expected to widen if no action is taken to support the most marginalized populations. One such inequality is the distribution of urban green spaces (UGS), which are essential to pandemic recovery. Cities that aim to be inclusive and resilient should assess whether access to their UGS is equitably distributed among the population and identify the areas where these spaces are most needed. This study therefore examines the equity of access to UGS in Mexico City at the neighborhood level using network analysis. First, access to UGS was identified at a threshold of 300 m, regardless of UGS size. Second, access was differentiated by the functional level of the UGS, which primarily depends on their size, with larger UGS having more extensive catchment areas. The results of this study suggest a deficit of access to small green spaces in most of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, with the neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty showing an even lower average of UGS access. The results further highlight which neighborhoods in Mexico City should receive priority attention and funding for UGS to mitigate the disproportionate effects of public health crises. This is critical for future city planning and may be used as a roadmap for identifying priority neighborhoods in other cities with similar segregation patterns.

AB  - The South Carolina Aquarium's Resilience Initiative for Coastal Education (R.I.C.E.) is a scalable model for community resilience outreach and action that facilitates engagement across socioeconomic strata and aids the collaborative development of coordinated coastal resilience strategies along the South Atlantic Bight. Projected biosphere climate perturbations pose a significant threat to human health and safety, commerce, culture, and stability of ecosystem services on a local level, particularly in the South Carolina Low country. At notable risk are socially vulnerable communities, the cultural heritage of the Gullah Geechee people, and the reproductive success of threatened loggerhead sea turtles reliant on South Carolina's Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge for nesting purposes. The R.I.C.E. endeavor's solution-oriented collaborative approach leverages innovative technologies and novel methods to engage citizens, inclusive of environmental justice principles, in locally-appropriate resilience-building actions. Advanced technological tools, including the SeaRise Beta web application with integrated citizen science functionality, generate community literacy on the topic of sea level rise and efficiently convert knowledge to action to help communities actualize on-the-ground mitigation strategies in partnership with municipal leaders, policy makers, conservation agencies, and businesses. The initial success of the R.I.C.E. model bolsters its ability to serve as a national prototype for effective education and engagement of diverse communities on the topic of coastal resilience.

AB  - The so called "land grabbing" has gained increased attention since the outburst of the global financial and food crisis triggering a new trend of acquiring land for outsourcing production of food, feed and agrofuels. India as one of the newly emerging economies is investing heavily in farmland as it faces enormous challenges to sustain its rising population and growing energy demands. This paper analyses Indian land acquisitions in Ethiopia, looking into India's motivations to acquire farmland and what incentives does Ethiopia have to lease out land to large investors. The paper draws on trade data between India and Ethiopia, expert interviews, studies and reports on the use and productivity of grabbed land. In view of the land grabbing and food security debate, the paper critically evaluates whether acquiring farmland in Ethiopia can indeed contribute to food and energy security in India.

AB  - Sweden has been praised for its sustainability efforts and decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. When nations and urban districts publicize their low GHG emissions, these emissions are often based on a production perspective including only emissions occurring within their geographical boundary. If instead a consumption perspective is applied then all emissions attributable to the inhabitants consumption patterns, no matter where they occur, are included, e.g. from imported goods and air travel. This provides new outlooks on sustainability, from this perspective Swedish emissions have increased rather than decreased in the last decades. Swedish researchers and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency propose that the production perspective should be complemented with a consumption perspective to describe more fairly who is responsible for what emissions. The purpose of this paper is to examine how a consumption perspective on GHG emissions has gained ground in Sweden, specifically in the new Strategic Climate Program of the City of Gothenburg, discussing what municipal strategies and environmental discourses this perspective enhances. Applying actor network theory, we found three common features of importance for Sweden, and the City of Gothenburg, supporting the consumption perspective to gain ground. One is the existence of long-term environmental goals that facilitate this perspective. The other features are the existence of civil servants as drivers and the use of calculations from legitimate "fact builders." We conclude that a consumption perspective strengthens the environmental justice discourse (as it claims to be a more just way of calculating global and local environmental effects) while possibly also increasing an individualized environmental discourse (as many municipal strategies aim to inform and influence the public to make lifestyle changes on their own). We argue that a consumption perspective is necessary in order to fully address environmental problems and to highlight issues of justice and responsibility. At the same time, this kind of eco-governmentality might lead to individualized self-governed climate subjects with outlooks that are too limited to foster change of dominant everyday practices.

AB  - The relationships between peace and futures education and our urban landscapes are potentially very rich. They invite wide-ranging discussion on issues such as the futures of urban design, public transport, environmental justice, and active citizenship and nonviolent movements of social change. Developing a peace, environmental and futures education perspective, involves a number of pedagogic shifts. The authors decided to take a group of postgraduate students from a wide range of countries and various disciplinary backgrounds on an urban walk in Sydney. This diverse group of students was enrolled in a cross-disciplinary course called Peace and the Environment. As one of several current curriculum offerings, this course is taught through the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney, Australia. As a learning activity, the urban walk component was designed to facilitate reflection on what might constitute peaceful environments, including alternative readings of the Australian landscape. With such experiential learning activities, the evidence suggests that students are more likely to be open to alternative readings or mappings of their everyday environments, as well as to hospitable rather than hostile, imagined future landscapes.

AB  - The diversity of the different takes on the ethical concepts of equity and environmental justice in the environmental literature requires that a unifying framework, to properly map their theoretical and conceptual loci in environmental ethics, is defined. Specifically, the concepts of equity and environmental justice have often been conflated into one even though they rest on different philosophical foundations and have different denotations, connotations and implications. The inconsistent use of these constructs is perverse in both scholarly discussions and global environmental policy formulation and detracts from conceptual clarity and their analytical usefulness. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to provide a mapping of the different takes to the moral aspects of global environmental decisions. Attempt is made to clarify the conceptual and philosophical denotations of environmental justice and equity from the point of view of philosophy, law and moral ethics. Our analysis leads to the construing of environmental justice as a broad overarching concept encompassing all justice issues in environmental decision-making, including both procedural and distributive justice, which is what is usually meant by equity. The resulting framework allows us to grasp the competing, conflicting and incomplete approaches to environmental justice as captured in the North-South conceptions of the construct more effectively. It is our hope that our conclusions would be valuable to researchers of global environmental change and politics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TY  - CHAP
AB  - The chapter is about the conflict between preserving biodiversity and fulfilling the basic human needs of local communities residing within and near protected areas. The chapter argues that local human communities should be allowed to exploit resources within and near protected areas even if that exploitation by human local communities is harmful to biodiversity. A claim is made that all types of biodiversity are not of equal value and do not matter at the same level; there are differences in functions; some species or ecosystems matter more than others. As a defense for this view appeal is made to biological concepts such as trophic levels, keystone species, hotspot areas, and the species redundancy, which all hierarchize biodiversity in different degrees of importance. The chapter also claims that the most convincing argument in defense of biodiversity conservation is to appeal to instrumental values. Biodiversity matters more to humans for the services it provides to human well-being than for any other reasons. In this sense, the argument runs that there might be ethical reasons why harmful human activities by local communities should be allowed. Several strands of arguments, including the biological species redundancy, the ethical notion of the sacredness of human life (right to life), the distributive justice (jus soli, rights of the first occupants and environmental justice) are used in the support the main claim of the chapter that regardless of circumstances, human local communities should be allowed to use natural resources. The chapter finally discusses the possible reconciliation between human basic needs and biodiversity, arguing that partial (at least) reconciliations are possible inmost cases through possible hierarchizing harms, accounting for scales, and identifying trade-offs by agreeing with local communities, in a participative process, on what can be extracted by local communities.

AB  - The South Central Farm (SCF) in Los Angeles was a 14-acre urban farm in one of the highest concentrations of impoverished residents in the county. It was destroyed in July 2006. This article analyzes its epic as a landscape of resistance to discriminatory legal and planning practices. It then presents its creation and maintenance as an issue of environmental justice, and argues that there was a substantive rationale on the basis of environmental justice and planning ethics that should have provided sufficient grounds for the city to prevent its dismantling. Based on qualitative case study methodology, the study contributes to the formulation of creation and preservation rationales for community gardens and other "commons" threatened by eventual dismantlement in capitalist societies.

AB  - The 'climate justice' lens is increasingly being used in framing discussions and debates on global climate finance. A variant of such justice - distributive justice - emphasises recipient countries' vulnerability to be an important consideration in funding allocation. The extent to which this principle is pursued in practice has been of widespread and ongoing concerns. Empirical evidence in this regard however remains inadequate and methodologically weak. This research examined the effect of recipients' climate vulnerability on the allocation of climate funds by controlling for other commonly-identified determinants. A dynamic panel regression method based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) was used on a longitudinal dataset, containing approved funds for more than 100,000 projects covering three areas of climate action (mitigation, adaptation, and overlap) in 133 countries over two decades (2000-2018). Findings indicated a non-significant effect of recipients' vulnerability on mitigation funding, but significant positive effects on adaptation and overlap fundings. 'Most vulnerable' countries were likely to receive higher amounts of these two types of funding than the 'least vulnerable' countries. All these provided evidence of distributive justice. However, the relationship between vulnerability and funding was parabolic, suggesting 'moderately vulnerable' countries likely to receive more funding than the 'most vulnerable' countries. Whilst, for mitigation funding, this observation was not a reason for concern, for adaptation and overlap fundings this was not in complete harmony with distributive justice. Paradoxically, countries with better investment readiness were likely to receive more adaptation and overlap funds. In discordance with distributive justice, countries within the Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia regions, despite their higher climatic vulnerabilities, were likely to receive significantly less adaptation and overlap fundings. Effects of vulnerability were persistent, and past funding had significant effects on current funding. These, coupled with the impact of readiness, suggested a probable Low Funding Trap for the world's most vulnerable countries. The overarching conclusion is that, although positive changes have occurred since the 2015 Paris Agreement, considerable challenges to distributive justice remain. Significant data and methodological challenges encountered in the research and their implications are also discussed.

AB  - The different ways in which its territorial jurisdictions have chosen to apply the European Union's (EU's) Directive on strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to their public sector policies, plans and programmes (PPPs) suggest that the United Kingdom (UK) continues to be uncertain about the theoretical rationale for this technique. In order to evaluate the analytical significance of these alternative interpretations, their methodological foundations need to be examined. Baseline-led approaches to SEA which are intended to operationalise sustainability can be shown to place unrealistic expectations on instrumental rationality. Objectives-led policy appraisal makes SEA contingent on whatever particular social construction of sustainable development holds sway. These expert-driven approaches contrast with a reflexive interpretation of environmental governance, in which SEA helps to expose the conflictual nature of public actions claiming to deliver sustainability, and offers stakeholders increased opportunities to challenge these. The approach adopted in Scotland, in which SEA forms part of an agenda for environmental justice, is evaluated in the light of this critique. The Scottish Executive's eclectic legislation, which covers all its public sector PPPs, may offer a way of mediating between these competing interpretations of SEA. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The partial regulatory takings movement seeks to compensate private landowners when regulations diminish their land values. This movement has grown in recent years, particularly at the state level. Scholars have focused thus far on the cost of compensation and its effect on the regulations that governments enact or enforce. In addition to exploring those concerns, this Note argues that partial regulatory takings regimes threaten to constrain residents' ability to influence their communities' growth and character. The greatest impact could fall on low-income communities, many of which contain disproportionate levels of undesirable land uses and lack adequate financial resources to influence land use planning in the absence of regulatory solutions or alternative venues. To address these problems, state and local governments should implement what I call a "regulatory balances" regime, strengthening participatory planning venues and funding the resulting measures.

AB  - The UN climate conference COP26 in November 2021 concluded with the agreement of the Glasgow Climate Pact. This article examines the key elements of the pact and their significance. Explaining the structure of the 2015 Paris Agreement, it shows why the requirement for countries to return with stronger emissions reduction commitments in 2022 was in practice the most the conference could have achieved to 'keep alive' the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Developing countries won an increase in finance for adaptation to climate change, but their demand for developed countries to recognise 'climate justice' and compensate them for the loss and damage that climate change is causing was rebuffed. Noting the various sectoral commitments made at COP26 in areas such as deforestation and finance, the article argues that the underlying question posed by the conference is whether capitalism can be greened. An answer is suggested.

AB  - The substantive concerns and theoretical insights of sociologies of family, intimate and personal life ought to place this body of work in closer dialogue with environmental sociology over the 'big issue' of climate change. However, its research active practitioners typically have a narrower repertoire of engagement with global issues and those who are outside the topic area often miss the value of its contributions. This article discusses common ground between this specialist area and sociologies of environmental issues in unpacking processes of social change through empirically grounded theoretical work. This includes the renewed theoretical emphasis on relationality, empirically based critique of the 'individualisation thesis', uses of 'practice' to transcend 'micro'-'macro' and 'social'-'natural' divisions, and interest in I/we boundary shifts. More fully recognising the potential of this overlapping territory may help leverage more effective sociological responses to the global challenge of climate change.

AB  - The continuation and exacerbation of many environmental failures illustrate that environmental and climate justice's influence on decision-making is not being systematically effective, giving rise to a renewed emphasis on finding new, more focused, justice models. This includes the energy justice concept, which has received ready and growing success. Yet for energy justice, a key question keeps arising: what does it add that environmental and climate justice cannot? To answer this question this perspective outlines the origins, successes and failures of the environmental and climate justice concepts, with a view to both distinguishing the energy justice field, and providing cautionary tales for it. It then outlines three points of departure, which it argues increases the opportunity of success for the energy justice concept: (1) "bounding out", (2) non-anti-establishment pasts and (3) methodological strength. This paper exists to stimulate debate.

AB  - Since 2006, as part of the transition to low-carbon technologies, UK energy policy has moved towards incentivising new nuclear power production. As a result, the UK has developed a (now delayed) strategy to deliver around 16 GW of new nuclear power by 2030. This policy context provides an opportunity to reflect not only on the material infrastructure needed to meet transition targets, but also on who is responsible for the energy justice implications of these decisions. Using data collected from 26 semi-structured interviews with NGO and policy representatives, this paper presents a case study of energy justice concerns surrounding the Hinkley Point Nuclear Complex in Somerset, focusing particularly on the highly controversial Hinkley Point C developments. The results emphasise the importance of considering not only instances of energy justice or injustice, but of attributing responsibility for them, a concept that has been largely overlooked in the energy justice literature. NGOs, government and business allocate responsibility differently in nuclear energy decision making. We find that perceptions of responsibility are highly dependent upon the level of transparency in decision-making. This article is part of a Virtual Special Issue entitled 'Exploring the Energy Justice Nexus'.

AB  - The significant contribution of road-transport to air pollution within the urban arena is widely acknowledged, and traditionally explored in relation to health outcomes across a temporal scale. However, the structure of the urban environment is also of importance in dictating the existence of extremely variable traffic pollutant levels, which often tend to be linked with social disparities. Nevertheless 'Environmental Justice' studies have rarely tackled the adverse health implications of exposures from mobile sources (Chakraborty, 2009), or have applied statistical techniques that are appropriate for such spatial data (Gilbert and Chalcraborty, 2011). This article addresses these gaps by spatially examining the distribution of respiratory hospitalisation incidents of children aged 0-15 years in relation to social circumstances and residential exposures of annual PK road-transport emissions within Leicester during 2000-09. Continuing upon the theme of 'Environmental Justice', the research explores the intra-urban spatial distribution of those who produce and residentially experience the majority of road-transport emissions. The findings indicate significant global relationships to exist between children's hospitalisation rates and social-economic-status, ethnic minorities, and PM10 road-transport emissions within Leicester. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) identified important localised variations within the dataset, specifically relating to a double-burden of residentially experienced road-transport emissions and deprivation effecting inner city children's respiratory health. Furthermore, affluent intra-urban communities tended to contribute the highest levels of emission from private transport, while residentially experiencing relatively low exposure of transport emissions, This would suggest that environmental injustices prevail across the model British multicultural city of Leicester.

AB  - Spatial modelling techniques incorporating the social and physical structures of urban environments, previously establish a 'triple jeopardy' of social, respiratory health and environmental inequalities as operating within the multicultural UK City of Leicester (Jephcote & Chen, 2012). Expanding upon our initial findings, we aim to explore whether spatial relationships exist between relatively minor and severe respiratory conditions, and if so, then to what extent sodo-environmental mechanisms play in the decline of children's respiratory health. Pearson's Correlation tests identified a high global level of correlation between children's acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI, LRTI), with Local Moran's I spatial autocorrelation tests identifying elevated hospitalisation rates across inner-city locales (p < 0.05). Optimally weighted Geographically Weighted Regression models exploring the spatial distribution of children's URTI and LRTI respiratory hospitalisation incidents, expressed the extent to which individual socio-environmental mechanisms impeded health. Bivariate correlation statistics identified significant spatial trends between modelled URTI and LRTI admissions, with deprivation and TPM10 emissions detrimentally influencing respiratory health across inner-city communities (p < 0.05). In contrast, lifestyle choices such as those seen by Indian residents, appeared to mitigate the onset of such conditions. Our findings suggest that exposure to detrimental socio-environmental factors may initiate URTI episodes, with prolonging recovery times likely occurring from sustained exposures. If a sufficient level of recovery is not reached in time for the cold season, then the child may become host to a viral infection exacerbating previous respiratory complaints. The findings of this investigation appear to confirm the existence of a link between certain socio-environmental influences and cases of 'Catarrhal Child Syndrome'. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The authors address two research questions: (1) Are populations with lower socioeconomic status, compared with people of higher socioeconomic status, more likely to be exposed to higher levels of particulate air pollution in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada? (2) How sensitive is the association between levels of particulate air pollution and socioeconomic status to specification of exposure estimates or statistical models? Total suspended particulate (TSP) data from the twenty-three monitoring stations in Hamilton (1985-94) were interpolated with a universal kriging procedure to develop an estimate of likely pollution values across the city based on annual geometric means and extreme events. Comparing the highest with the lowest exposure zones, the interpolated surfaces showed more than a twofold increase in TSP concentrations and more than a twentyfold difference in the probability of exposure to extreme events. Exposure estimates were related to socioeconomic and demographic data from census tract areas by using ordinary least squares and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models. Control for spatial autocorrelation in the SAR models allowed for tests of how robust specific socioeconomic variables were for predicting pollution exposure. Dwelling values were significantly and negatively associated with pollution exposure, a result robust to the method of statistical analysis. Low income and unemployment were also significant predictors of exposure, although results varied depending on the method of analysis. Relatively minor changes in the statistical models altered the significant variables. This result emphasizes the value of geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial statistical techniques in modelling exposure. The result also shows the importance of taking spatial autocorrelation into account in future justice-health studies.

AB  - Scientists and policymakers have shown growing interest in the health effects of chronic air pollution exposure. In this study, we use geostatistical techniques in combination with small-area data to address a central research question: "Does chronic exposure to particulate air pollution significantly associate with mortality when the effects of other social, demographic, and lifestyle confounders are taken into account?" Our analysis relies on age-standardized mortality ratios for census tracts (CTs) of Hamilton (average population of 3419 persons), social and demographic data from the 1991 Census of Canada, smoking variables extracted from secondary surveys, and total suspended particulate (TSP) data from 23 monitoring stations operated by the Ministry of the Environment. Air pollution data are interpolated with a geostatistical procedure known as "kriging". This method translates fixed-site pollution monitoring observations into a continuous surface, which was overlaid onto the population-weighted centroids of the CTs. Our results show substantively large and statistically significant health effects for women and men. Evaluated over the inter-quartile range of the data, we found the relative risk of premature mortality for TSP exposure to be 1.19 (95% CI: 1.13-1.26) for women and 1.30 (95% CI: 1.24-1.37) for men. We also tested associations with cardio-respiratory and cancer mortality. We found positive, significant associations between particulate exposure and these causes of death in most models. Inclusion of socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle reduced but did not eliminate the health effects of exposure to particulate air pollution. Overall our results suggest that intra-urban variations in particulate air pollution significantly associate with premature, all-cause, cardio-respiratory, and cancer mortality in small areas of Hamilton.

AB  - Texas is changing dramatically; minority cohorts are expected to grow and become more than 65% of the Texas population before 2035. When considering issues of environmental justice, transportation professionals in Texas must seek to identify how these demographic changes will affect the transportation system. Gaining an understanding of this problem requires that the prevalent travel behavior and attitudes of minority populations be considered. The research presented in this paper investigates the prevailing travel behavior of the three largest minority cohorts in Texas: U.S.-born Hispanics, Hispanic immigrants, and African Americans. Considering environmental justice, this paper focuses on a study performed to identify the travel behaviors of the minority cohorts of Texas. The researchers used the National Household Travel Survey Add-On for Texas, because it allowed them to examine respondents by race-ethnicity and immigrant status. On the basis of the study's results, it was found that U.S.-born Hispanics emulate Caucasian travel behavior most closely; however, U.S.-born Hispanics have higher nonwork-trip generation rates. Moreover, multivariate analysis indicated that Hispanic immigrants drive less than U.S.-born Hispanics, even after accounting for sociodemographics. The study also revealed that African Americans, Hispanic immigrants, and single adults with children produce most transit trips in urban Texas. This study further indicated that Hispanic immigrants-given their high household sizes, low income, and low vehicle availability-may be incurring mobility problems. The findings in this study indicate that Texas may be facing a transportation-cultural change because of the different travel characteristics of rapidly growing minority cohorts.

AB  - There is extensive empirical literature on the association between exposure to nature and health. In this narrative review, we discuss the strength of evidence from recent (i.e., the last decade) experimental and observational studies on nature exposure and health, highlighting research on children and youth where possible. We found evidence for associations between nature exposure and improved cognitive function, brain activity, blood pressure, mental health, physical activity, and sleep. Results from experimental studies provide evidence of protective effects of exposure to natural environments on mental health outcomes and cognitive function. Cross-sectional observational studies provide evidence of positive associations between nature exposure and increased levels of physical activity and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and longitudinal observational studies are beginning to assess long-term effects of nature exposure on depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and chronic disease. Limitations of current knowledge include inconsistent measures of exposure to nature, the impacts of the type and quality of green space, and health effects of duration and frequency of exposure. Future directions include incorporation of more rigorous study designs, investigation of the underlying mechanisms of the association between green space and health, advancement of exposure assessment, and evaluation of sensitive periods in the early life-course.

AB  - Since the mid-2000s, a growing number of governments, international bodies and experts, and courts have increasingly recognized the importance of a rights-based approach to climate decision-making. By focusing on the impacts of climate change on the rights of individuals, communities, and peoples, a human rights lens emphasizes the human dimensions of climate change, recognizes how forms of systemic discrimination engender and exacerbate vulnerability, and focuses attention on the implications of social and environmental justice for climate governance. Moreover, states and private actors' human rights obligations and responsibilities have specific implications in relation to climate change. State and non-state actors are not only obliged to take effective mitigation and adaptation measures that respect, protect, and fulfil human rights, but they must also ensure that these measures do not in of themselves infringe human rights. Finally, rights-based approaches emphasize the importance of public participation, access to information, and access to justice in the development, implementation, and review of climate decisions. Despite its promise, the transformative potential of rights-based approaches for addressing climate change and delivering climate justice remains unrealized.

AB  - Since 2017, Chile has reported significant progress in inclusive sustainable development to the UN, and framed such achievement as a result of its neoliberal policy agenda. On the ground, however, environment defenders have often felt excluded from public policymaking. Through an empirical assessment of interviews with activists, this article finds varying perceptions of inclusion in environmental governance depending on activists' level of institutionalisation and attitude towards neoliberalism. After revealing exclusionary patterns affecting grassroots focused on environmental justice, the article evaluates the prospects of the SDGs to foster more inclusive environmental governance in the context of Chile's recent constitutional developments.

AB  - The Adani mine controversy is a significant new space of contestation in conflicts over coal mining and climate change in Australia. Proposed as one of the largest new coal mines in the world, the Adani (or "Carmichael") mine has become a flashpoint between two broad coalitions-the pro-mine coalition, consisting of governments, elements of the media, and mining interests, and the anti-mine coalition, consisting of community groups, environmental non-government organisations, activists, Indigenous communities, and farmers. Based on thematic analysis of news media articles and interviews with environmental actors in the Adani mine controversy, this article demonstrates how each coalition employs discursive scale frames and counter-scale frames to represent and contest the controversy. We find that the pro-mine coalition remains situated within a topographical spatiality, with a backwards oriented temporality, that obscures emergent topologies from their view. In contrast, while retaining capacity for operating within traditional scalar topographies, the anti-mine coalition is more adept at negotiating topologies that increasingly define our social worlds. It is oriented towards a deep future horizon in which the Adani mine controversy represents an opportunity to reshape existing social and political orders. The sorts of scalar tactics documented here are likely at work in other resource extraction controversies, highlighting the need to attend to how scale may be being used to obscure irrationalities and injustices in extraction projects, and the potential for counter-scale frames to help destabilise fossil fuel regimes.

AB  - The characteristics of urban green space have context-dependent associations with socioeconomic status (SES). Latin American cities provide a unique but understudied context to assess the green space-SES associations. We measured the quantity and quality of green space as greenness from satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and we modeled the relationship between greenness and SES in 371 major Latin American cities between 2000 and 2010. We found that SES was negatively associated with average greenness at city and sub-city scales, which could be explained by urbanization generally improving SES while reducing the provision of green space. About 82% of the cities and 64% of the sub-cities experienced greening or increases in greenness over time. Although with lower average greenness, cities with higher SES had greater greening; however, it was the opposite for sub-cities. We suggest that greening is more likely to take place in peripheral sub-cities where SES tends to be lower. The findings challenge the belief that places with higher SES have better access to environmental resources and amenities; instead, this relationship is context dependent.

AB  - The concept of Stranded Assets has been used for nearly 50 years across many sectors, most recently it has been a focus of investment portfolios in light of the possible impacts of climate change. However, to date there has been no in-depth determination of the impact of Stranded Assets for rural water supply, despite international development targets from Rio, through Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The limiting factor for carrying out such an assessment is the requirement of a full and detailed asset register recording all rural water supplies in a country. The Scottish Government Climate Justice Fund Water Futures Programme, in collaboration with the Government of Malawi, is undertaking a comprehensive asset audit across Malawi, and this paper introduces the concept of Stranded Assets for the rural water supply sector using Malawi as an exemplar. Here, we demonstrate how significant change in the implementation strategy for SDGs compared to the MDGs is needed to reduce the potential for Stranded Assets and meet its ultimate aim.

AB  - The Detroit River is an international water body that has several fish consumption advisories for contaminants that affect human health and economic revenue for the USA and Canada. Despite the importance of these advisories, little progress has been made in developing effective management strategies or coordinating monitoring, research, and policy efforts between the 2 nations. We engaged 44 stakeholder organizations to increase community capacity on these issues for the Detroit River. We assessed capacity with key informant interviews and a network survey. Our analysis identified weak ties in information sharing and collaboration between countries. We used this information to improve stakeholder capacity, which included forming working groups that focused on system analysis, identification of priority issues, and definitions of organizational roles. Outcomes included outreach materials addressing environmental-justice issues and risk-analysis models of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) body burdens in fish. Our assessment of workshop participants with a longitudinal survey indicated that we increased network capacity and issue awareness in our stakeholders by providing new ways for them to work together. The engagement of stakeholders also improved research outcomes. By identifying stakeholder concerns related to scientific questions about consumption advisories early in the process, researchers were able to direct their efforts to generating translational research that better addressed stakeholder needs.

AB  - Sustainable urban storm-water management is a key policy of the European Union. Increasing populations, densification and global climate change cause major challenges for the management of urban run-off waters. Small urban aquatic ecosystems (ponds, brooks, wetlands) are important, because they support human health and well-being through water regulation, mitigating urban run-off waters and providing recreational benefits. Ecosystem functions, which arise from interactions between biotic and abiotic processes and which benefit society, are called ecosystem services. The ecosystem service concept can be useful in estimating the impacts of land-use and resource management on ecosystem functions, and to support decision-making. However, many researchers claim that measuring or valuing ecosystem services in land-use planning may fail to recognize intangible or non-monetary values. We studied a local environmental conflict related to a storm-water management plan in Helsinki, Finland. By using integrated value mapping of ecosystem services, we assigned socio-cultural values of local blue-green infrastructure, and evaluated how these values could be taken into account at the early stage in green area planning. Stakeholders (locals, managers and politicians) expressed a total of 47 perceived values related to the urban brook and the public park. We divided these values into four types: (1) use and experience, (2) existence, (3) symbolic, and (4) bequest and moral. We show great differences between the meanings and values of locals, managers and politicians. Managers expressed negative values towards the park, while locals more commonly expressed symbolic values. Exhaustive value mapping could help to identify mutual values and understand disagreements between stakeholders. We introduced a model for a transdisciplinary adaptive planning by using integrated value mapping within ecosystem service concept. Often local protests towards development projects or the management of green areas are seen in a negative light by considering them as NIMBY. Instead of dismissing plurality of meanings and values that emerge from strong place identity, we call for the sustainable management of place-attached values as part of a techno-economic planning strategy of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Scholars of environmental injustice have pushed to see beyond the spatial distribution of environmental harms in studies of unwanted land uses. Building upon this work, this article examines how the complex geographies of environmental injustice play out in a coalition to prevent the construction of a coal-fired power plant in Surry County, Virginia. While spatially dispersed coalitions of negatively affected actors can strengthen efforts to prevent the construction of an unwanted land use, they can also perpetuate the environmental injustices surrounding it. To make this argument, particular attention is paid to the diverse reasons and ways differentially situated actors oppose an unwanted land use. It is demonstrated how the disparate concerns and differential tactics deployed by actors in coalitions against unwanted land uses are often embedded in and potentially contribute to longer histories of social injustice.

AB  - The theoretical approach utilized in this study is based on the pieces of information scattered throughout Antonio Gramsci's work and the extrapolation made out of his notion of hegemony. From a Gramscian perspective, social movements are creative reactions to contracting hegemony. To the extent that it provides room for the existence of collective actions, hegemony is expansive; yet, because it is not total, the condition for the existence of counter-hegemonies that call to question its "essentials" also exists. The case of grassroots environmental justice organizations in the United States (GEJOs) that deal with first-order quality of life issues falls within the province of the latter dynamics. GEJOs deal with an issue limited in scope, viz., environmental crisis; however, their movement participants have contested the multiple dimensions of existing hegemony. These organizations, as total counter-hegemonies, have challenged the political, economic, intellectual, and cultural orders of the American society. The interest in distributive justice, participatory democracy, public-oriented scientific endeavor, and a well-ordered cultural realm based on a universal good sense are the fundamental elements of an alternative hegemony manifest or latent in the discursive formations and practices of GEJOs. The study is based on document analysis and interpretation of the literature on GEJOs in the United States.

AB  - Scientific studies and resident testimony suggest that urban residents in low-income and minority communities have been subject to an unequal burden of environmental pollution and inequitable environmental enforcement practices. A key component of the equitable development and implementation of environmental policies is the participation of citizens and community-based organizations in the policy process. Such participation rests upon equitable access to agency-generated environmental information and effective use of that information by citizens. This article focuses on the adoption of Internet technologies by environmental agencies as a mechanism for disseminating information and the implications for low-income and minority residents in urban communities. A framework is developed to guide a programmatic response to overcome these implications. The results from several community-based projects are described and analyzed for their capacity-building effectiveness. Analysis of the projects indicates improvement in community capacity for information access and use, which bolstered community participation in the environmental decision-making process.

AB  - Several scholars have criticized the predominant post-political representations of our current era, particularly with regard to climate change. However, what happens when a movement explicitly aims at repoliticizing the present in an attempt to open a space for change? Combining scholar activism with theoretical insights from post-foundational political theorists, such as Jacques Ranciere, Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau, this paper studies the paradoxical nature of the attempt to repoliticize climate change by Climate Justice Action (CJA), a grassroots movement that was set up before the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009. Comparing different repoliticization strategies, the paper shows how CJA exhibits core features of a Rancierian political act, which makes visible what was previously invisible by starting from the postulate of equality. However, lacking an elaborate perspective on alternatives, both Ranciere and CJA appear to be stuck in the present. Drawing on Mouffe and Laclau's discourse theory, the paper subsequently analyzes the nodal points of CJA's discourse that could function as inscription points for alternatives. Yet, these points appear to primarily intensify a we/them distinction. The result is a paradox: to create a space for imagining alternative futures, one must first fight post-political representations of the present. However, when politicization becomes an end in itself, the outreach of the movement, and therefore its capacity to repoliticize and stimulate the imagination of alternative futures, is constrained.

AB  - The unequal spatial distribution of ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2), an air pollutant related to traffic, leads to higher exposure for minority and low socioeconomic status communities. We exploit the unprecedented drop in urban activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and use high-resolution, remotely sensed NO2 observations to investigate disparities in NO2 levels across different demographic subgroups in the United States. We show that, prior to the pandemic, satellite-observed NO2 levels in the least White census tracts of the United States were nearly triple the NO2 levels in the most White tracts. During the pandemic, the largest lockdown-related NO2 reductions occurred in urban neighborhoods that have 2.0 times more non-White residents and 2.1 times more Hispanic residents than neighborhoods with the smallest reductions. NO2 reductions were likely driven by the greater density of highways and interstates in these racially and ethnically diverse areas. Although the largest reductions occurred in marginalized areas, the effect of lockdowns on racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic NO2 disparities was mixed and, for many cities, nonsignificant. For example, the least White tracts still experienced similar to 1.5 times higher NO2 levels during the lockdowns than the most White tracts experienced prior to the pandemic. Future policies aimed at eliminating pollution disparities will need to look beyond reducing emissions from only passenger traffic and also consider other collocated sources of emissions such as heavy-duty vehicles.

AB  - The scrutiny of environmental cleanups within the United States has been a growing area of interest for social scientists. Scholars have used case studies and modeling to analyze struggles for environmental justice and the economics of stigma associated with Superfund sites. This research has primarily analyzed community perspectives on remediation and removal, such as local strategies for participating in cleanup decisions. There has been less work on analyzing organizational perspectives on the social and institutional dynamics at play during cleanups. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing insights gained through interviewing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staff who do cleanup work in brownfields, Superfund, and emergency response. This ethnographic research excavates the sedimented layers of social histories of contaminated sites: local and regional contexts, institutional power and authority, and stakeholder relationships and networks. It interrogates how these sedimented social histories affect cleanup decisions, including the temporal and spatial boundaries of sites themselves. We find that the making of relationships is as important to cleanup strategies and outcomes as the scientific and technical aspects of cleanup are. This finding highlights the importance of tools and resources to excavate these social histories during environmental remediation, removal, and decontamination work.

AB  - Substantial research documents higher pollution levels in minority neighborhoods, but little research evaluates how residents perceive their own communities' pollution risks. According to "neighborhood stigma" theory, survey respondents share a cultural bias that minorities cause social dysfunction, leading to over-reports of dysfunction in minority communities. This study investigates perceptions of residential outdoor air quality by linking objective data on built and social environments with multiple measures of pollution and a representative survey of Chicago residents. Consistent with the scholarly narrative, results show that air quality is rated worse where minorities and poverty are concentrated, even after extensive adjustment for objective pollution and built environment measures. Perceptions of air pollution may thus be driven by neighborhood socioeconomic position far more than by respondents' ability to perceive pollution. The finding that 63.5 % of the sample reported excellent or good air quality helps to explain current challenging in promoting environmental action.

The question of where these footprints fall is arbitrated by larger questions of geopolitical power and vulnerability, which means that human engagement with outer space is also a question of environmental justice. On Earth, environmental (in)justice unfolds on multiple scales: local and stratospheric emissions from space launches, the placement of outer space related infrastructure in so-called peripheral places, and the role of power in determining whether the use of such infrastructure aids socio-environmentally constructive or destructive practices. Beyond Earth, the environmental geopolitics are likewise multiscalar, manifesting in contemporary pollution issues such as orbital debris and conservation debates such as planetary protection protocols. The environmental geopolitics of Earth and outer space are inextricably linked by the spatial politics of privilege and the imposition of sacrifice - among people, places, and institutions. This paper explores the concept of outer space environments through classical, critical, environmental, and feminist geopolitical theories.

AB  - The world is in a scramble for energy, with governments looking at every possible source to fulfill their energy needs. Concerns about environmental justice, biodiversity, and the protection of our natural resources are at risk of being shunted aside. And while energy sources such as biomass are being marketed as lower-carbon alternatives, they must be looked at extra closely to make sure that the cure is not worse than the disease - especially in communities of color.

AB  - The year 2015 was meant to be a seminal year in global geopolitics due to the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This transition was significant because the MDGs, even though they raised global consciousness around the need to combat poverty, remained indicator-based, and thus, they did not adequately address socio-economic inequalities and power imbalances in global affairs. For this reason, much of the discussion surrounding the definition of the SDGs and the post-2015 global development agenda contextualized sustainable development within the framework of transformation', specifically prioritizing concepts such as equity, security, justice, and rights. While these debates correctly discussed power imbalances and relational obstacles to human development they remained abstract because they focused only on the international level. In this regard, discussions did not adequately examine mechanisms that facilitate or block the emergence of sustainable development as a political priority, nor did they address specific policy proposals to link environmental justice to human development strategies. Thus, this special issue introduction argues that human and environmental security should be framed in terms of transnational discussions rather than being limited to international debates. The special issue undertakes an examination of the interactions between human and environmental security, border studies, and comparative regional integration; and interactions between competing globalizations. The articles in the special issue address the relationships between international norms, transnational human and environmental security issues, and the regionalization of governance.

AB  - The use of bio-indicators is an emerging, cost-effective alternative approach to identifying air pollution and assessing the need for additional air monitoring. This community science project explores the use of moss samples as bio-indicators of the distribution of metal air particulates in two residential neighborhoods of the industrial Duwamish Val-ley located in Seattle, WA (USA). We applied geographically weighted regression to data from 61 youth-collected sam-ples to assess the location-specific area-level spatial predictors of the concentrations of 25 elements with focus on five heavy metals of concern due to health and environmental considerations. Spatial predictors included traffic volume, industrial land uses, major roadways, the airport, dirt roads, the Duwamish River, impervious surfaces, tree canopy cover, and sociodemographics. Traffic volume surrounding sample locations was the most consistent positive predictor of increasing heavy metal concentration. Greater distance from the heavy-industry corridor surrounding the Duwamish River predicted lower concentrations of all metals, with statistically significant associations for chromium and lead in some areas. As the distance from dirt roads increased, the concentration of arsenic and chromium de-creased significantly. Percent tree canopy within 200 m of sample locations was a significant protective factor for cad-mium concentrations. In addition, percent people of color was significantly positively associated with increasing lead, chromium and nickel concentrations. Our findings underscore the potential influence of heavy industry and mobile sources on heavy metal concentrations, the buffering potential of trees in local environments, and persistent opportu-nity to improve environmental justice.

AB  - Stefan Bengtsson's commentary about policy hegemony discusses the alternative discourses of socialism, nationalism, and globalism. However, Stefan does not adequately demonstrate how these discourses can overcome the Dominant Western Worldview (DWW), which is imbued with anthropocentrism. It will be argued here that most policy choices promoting sustainability, and education for it, are made within a predetermined system in which the already limiting notion of environmental protection is highly contingent on human welfare. What would really contest the dominant assumptions of Vietnamese policy and, more specifically, education for sustainable development (ESD) is an alternative discourse that challenges the DWW. That alternative discourse embraces philosophical ecocentrism and practices of ecological justice between all species, and deep ecology theory - all perspectives fundamentally committed to environmental protection.

AB  - The accessibility and attractiveness of urban green spaces (UGS) for individuals experiencing homelessness might be considered an example of the provision of environmental amenities for the most disadvantaged communities in the environmental justice discourse. We studied whether these people feel that they are condemned to spend time within UGS and what their personal narratives and perceptions of UGS were. The analysis was based on the triangulation of methods used in our case study city, Lodz, in Poland. First, we compiled a map of where people who live on the streets were recorded, based on data from the City Office of Lodz. Second, we conducted semi-structured and detailed interviews with streetworkers in order to obtain information regarding the use of public spaces (UGS in particular) by people who are homeless. Finally, we carried out interviews with (homeless) individuals whose activities took place within green surroundings. Our study showed that UGS are important to people experiencing homelessness, not only from the point of view of necessity or a lack of any other choice but - more importantly - from the perspective of individual preference and the fulfilment of personal needs. In this sense, our findings broaden the understanding of the accessibility and attractiveness of UGS to one of the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups.

AB  - Studies that estimate the influence of characteristics of place on health often use geocoded addresses to identify location of study subjects. This study uses housing built before 1990 selected for the 1995-2001 National Health Interview Survey (N = 252,421) to develop a standard against which geocodes obtained from an address-coding program are compared. The results show that geocoding is generally accurate and is more successful in urban areas. Blockgroups with missing codes are more rural and somewhat poorer than blockgroups with correct codes. The effect of incorrect codes on statistical analyses depends on the proportion rural in a study population. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sea-level rise (SLR) is a threat to coastal areas and there is growing interest in how social values, risk perception and fairness can inform adaptation. This study applies these three concepts to an urban community at risk of SLR in Botany Bay, Australia. The study engaged diverse groups of residents via an online survey. Cluster analysis identified four interpretive communities: two groups value work-life balance, are concerned about SLR and would likely engage in collective adaptation. The third group value everything about Botany Bay and are active in organisations that could prove to be an important outreach. The fourth group were older men, disengaged from both SLR and policy but could respond to individual consultation and targeted communication. Thus, multifarious approaches can engage diverse communities in fair decision-making and transform community-facilitated adaptation.

AB  - Sustainable development aims to address economic, social, and environmental imperatives; yet, in practice, it often embodies a neoliberal market logic that reinforces inequalities. Thus, as the social work profession grapples with its role in advancing environmental sustainability, practice models must explicitly attend to social and economic justice. For example, environmental gentrification refers to situations in which the cleanup of contaminated land or the installation of environmental amenities intentionally or unintentionally catalyzes increased housing costs, thereby contributing to the displacement of vulnerable residents. With the goal of contributing to practice knowledge, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles (1997-2017) to learn how community groups have responded to the threat of environmental gentrification. We found that community organizations employ a range of strategies, including blocking development, negotiating for protections, planning alternatives, and allying with gentrifiers. We conclude by exploring ethical implications and practice principles to help social workers engage in truly sustainable development. Key Practitioner Message: center dot The term environmental gentrification describes situations where improvements to environmental quality increase real estate prices, contributing to the displacement of vulnerable residents; center dot An environmental justice framework attending to procedural, distributional, and recognition-based claims provides a model for social work practice; center dot Opportunities exist for social workers to take an intersectional rather than siloed approach to integrate economic, social, and environmental concerns.

AB  - The drilling phase of oil and natural gas development is a growing area of environmental justice (EJ) research, particularly in the United States. Its emergence complements the longstanding EJ scholarship on later phases of the oil and gas commodity chain, such as pipeline transport, refining, and consumption. The growing scholarly attention to the EJ implications of drilling has been prompted by the surge in development of unconventional oil and gas resources in recent decades. More specifically, the oil and gas industrys adoption of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (a.k.a., "fracking" or "fracing") as methods for extracting oil and gas from a wider range of geologic formations has simultaneously heightened oil and gas production, brought extractive activities closer to more people, intensified them, and made well pad siting more flexible. Here, we provide a critical review of the novel EJ research questions that are being prompted by these on-the-ground changes in extractive techniques and patterns, propose an interdisciplinary conceptual framework for guiding EJ inquiry in this context, discuss key methodological considerations, and propose a research agenda to motivate future inquiry.

AB  - The controversial use of quantitative risk assessment by federal environmental agencies has spawned considerable debate among environmentalists, industry, and politicians. One unresolved issue is the environmental justice implications of risk assessment-that is, whether the use of quantitative risk assessment causes greater environmental impacts on people of color and low-income communities than on other population groups. In this article, Professor Robert R. Kuehn argues that quantitative risk assessment, as currently employed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, does violence to the concept of environmental justice because risk assessment disproportionately places the burden of pollution and environmental hazards on racial minorities and low-income groups. This is so, Professor Kuehn posits, because of methodological flaws in the assessment process. Moreover, risk assessment unduly restricts certain groups fi om participating in the process in arty meaningful way, thus calling into question the fairness of risk assessment. Professor Kuehn attempts to resolve this conflict between risk assessment and environmental justice by suggesting that several reforms be made to both the process and use of risk assessment.

AB  - The concept of environmental injustice raises difficult questions about on how best to measure and address environmental inequities across space, and environmental justice politics are permeated by considerable debate over the nature and spatial extent of both problem and possible solutions. This paper theorizes the politics of environmental justice as a politics of scale in order to explore how environmental justice activists respond to the scalar ambiguity inherent in the political concept of environmental justice. With a case study of a controversy over a proposed polyvinylchloride production facility in rural Convent, Louisiana, I develop the concept of scale frames and counter-scale frames as strategic discursive representations of a social grievance that do the work of naming, blaming, and claiming, with meaningful reference to particular geographic scales. The significance of scale is expressed alternatively within these frames as an analytical spatial category, as scales of regulation, as territorial framework(s) for cultural legitimacy, and as a means of inclusion, exclusion and legitimation.

AB  - The United States environmental justice movement has grown in the last 20 years from tactical cooperation between civil rights and environmental activists on hazardous waste issues into a broad-based movement for social change. As dozens of organizations invest resources in an environmental justice agenda, it is important to examine how such organizations portray their stance toward the goals of the larger movement in order to better understand tensions within the movement between social justice and environmental protection, diversity and commonality, and localized and broader movement agendas. This paper explores what contemporary environmental justice imagery tells us about this social movement through a critical discourse analysis of environmental justice organizations' logos. The conceptual approach used here links a tradition of critical discourse analysis of textual materials with elements of a critical visual methodology. The paper examines how the social grievance of environmental injustice is constructed in relation to the social and natural world, and considers what these images tell us about the identities, relationships and modes of authority that constitute the contemporary environmental justice movement.

AB  - The serious problems stemming from climate change require an active response it. This study focuses on the role of value factors in action on climate change. Individuals' values systematically influence the fundamental orientation of their attitudes and behaviors. Therefore, this study analyzes whether six values, namely: ideology, environmental justice, religiosity, personal norms, scientific optimism, and environmentalism, influence action on climate change directly or indirectly, and compares their effects with perception factors' impact. The results indicate that religiosity decreased action on climate change, whereas personal norms, science and technology (S&T) optimism, and environmentalism increased such action. Among the perception factors, perceived risks and benefits, trust, and knowledge increased action on climate change. Furthermore, perception factors explained action on climate change more than value factors did. Moreover, value factors (i.e., S&T optimism and environmentalism) moderated the impacts of perceived risks, perceived benefits, and negative emotions on action against climate change.

AB  - There is a rising demand to use nature and natural processes to address a different range of urban issues, especially when looking at the risk of pluvial flood associated with climate changes and urbanization processes. Among the set of Nature-Based Solutions used in urban planning, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) represent promising solutions to reduce the negative effects of urban water run-offs and to increase urban Ecosystem Services. However, SUDS can impact differently in the urban fabric and generate positive effects only on particular portions of cities. Planning of SUDS should try to consider not only the number of potential beneficiaries but also where beneficiaries are located in the city, as water sensitive approaches to urban planning must deal with distributive, procedural and contextual dimensions of equity. In this paper, we simulate different spatially explicit planning scenarios of SUDS for densely populated catchments in Sicily. Particularly, we evaluate the relation between the quantitative performance of SUDS in terms of reduction of hazard/risk of pluvial flooding and the number and location of beneficiaries -intended here as residents of different social groups. Results suggest that scenarios of SUDS generate benefits that are not equally distributed within the city.

AB  - The Paris Agreement is built on a tension between the common goal of limiting warming to 1.5 A degrees C and the differentiation that follows from the principle of equity. Scientific expertise is commonly seen as providing important means to overcome this tension, for example in the Agreement's "global stocktake", which is said to be undertaken "in the light of equity and the best available science". This raises the question of how scholarly communities best can contribute to deliberations on equitable differentiation in the effort required to meet common temperature goals. To discuss this question, the paper looks to the literature within Science and Technology Studies on the role of science in policymaking, where disagreement exists over the merits of "heating up" controversies through politicization, versus "cooling down" issues by seeking consensus. It assesses two cases in which scientific expertise has engaged with questions of equitable effort-sharing in international climate politics: The "Bali Box" of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, and the "Civil Society Equity Review" undertaken prior to COP21 in Paris. Based on a comparison of the two cases, it is argued that scientific contributions should not shy away from highlighting conflicts in values and interests, and that "heating up" discussions about climate justice may be a valuable contribution to overcoming the tensions of the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Studies on community energy have generated many useful insights concerning its potentials and challenges in facilitating energy transitions. However, this line of inquiry tends to overlook the crucial significance of site-specific contexts, concerns, and needs beyond the energy system and often generalizes these under a "civil society" umbrella. To study community energy on its own terms, this paper proposes a more grounded approach based on the relational place-making framework. It draws upon the case of the Taihsi Green Energy and Health Community Initiative in Taiwan to investigate how the emergence, development, and framing of this initiative are entangled with geo-historically produced concerns about the village's socio-economic marginalization and suffering from petrochemical pollution. The findings suggest that community energy in this context was a proactive continuation of place-based activism for environmental justice; its value to this damaged community lied in its potential to create self-reliant socio-material relations alternative to those relied on the patronage of petrochemical interests. However, this justice-oriented aspiration tended to be discounted in national-level energy transitions agenda, revealing a tension between citizen-oriented and community-based energy projects. The paper argues that a relational place-based analysis is crucial in recognizing the grounded meanings and values of a community energy initiative, which can address the decontextualizing tendency in many community energy studies to better help policymakers and advocates enhance energy justice in disadvantaged communities.

AB  - The principle of environmental equity constitutes a challenge to local autonomy and democratic practice. Community protest is sometimes hailed as an expression of local autonomy, sometimes derided as NIMBYism. To disentangle these issues we must reexamine environmental justice in light of the distinction between distributional and procedural justice. A search for just procedures for distributing environmental burdens represents an unnecessarily truncated view Procedural equity entails democratic participation not only with regard to distribution but in prior decisions affecting production of costs and benefits. Two brief case studies illustrate the possibility of reconciling environmental equity with local autonomy. Geographers concerned with environmental inequity might turn from mapping the distribution of burdens to mapping power relations between local communities and the structures producing those burdens.

AB  - Six million children live in poverty in America's inner cities. These children are at high risk of exposure to pesticides that are used extensively in urban schools, homes, and day-care centers for control of roaches, rats, and other vermin. The organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos and certain pyrethroids are the registered pesticides most heavily applied in cities. illegal street pesticides are also in use, including tres pasitos (a carbamate), tiza china, and methyl parathion. In New York State in 1997, the heaviest use of pesticides in all counties statewide was in the urban boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Children are highly vulnerable to pesticides. Because of their play close to the ground, their hand-to-mouth behavior, and their unique dietary patterns, children absorb more pesticides from their environment than adults. The long persistence of semivolatile pesticides such as chlorpyrifos on rugs, furniture, stuffed toys, and other absorbent surfaces within closed apartments further enhances urban children's exposures. Compounding these risks of heavy exposures are children's decreased ability to detoxify and excrete pesticides and the rapid growth, development, and differentiation of their vital organ systems. These developmental immaturities create early windows of great vulnerability. Recent experimental data suggest, for example, that chlorpyrifos may be a developmental neurotoxicant and that exposure in utero may cause biochemical and functional aberrations in fetal neurons as well as deficits in the number of neurons. Certain pyrethroids exert hormonal activity that may alter early neurologic and reproductive development. Assays currently used for assessment of the toxicity of pesticides are insensitive and cannot accurately predict effects to children exposed in utero or in early postnatal life. Protection of American children, and particularly of inner-city children, against the developmental hazards of pesticides requires a comprehensive strategy that monitors patterns of pesticide use on a continuing basis, assesses children's actual exposures to pesticides, uses state-of-the-art developmental toxicity testing, and establishes societal targets for reduction of pesticide use. Key words: children's environmental health, chlorpyrifos, environmental justice, neurodevelopmental impairment, organophosphates, pesticides, pyrethroids.

AB  - The scientific community recognizes that urban green areas play an important role in supporting human wellbeing. Green spaces are used differently by citizens accordingly to their age, gender, education, or lifestyle. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic period in 2020, public green areas were closed due to the limitations imposed by social distancing in Italy and people were forced to stay at home. The aim of this research was to investigate the importance of public green areas in the life of the population in relation to the limits imposed during the first lockdown in Italy. A participatory approach was used, and an online questionnaire focused on people's perceptions about the public attendance in green areas and their main uses pre-, during, and post-COVID-19 emergency period was administrated randomly to the adult population. The questions focused on the habit, frequency, and duration of park visits and about the individual perceptions and feelings about the green areas close (maximum 200 m distance) to their residences. A total of 3286 responses were obtained and analyzed at national and regional levels (Piemonte). In order to have a general national overview, a basic descriptive statistic was applied using all answers, elaborated in the form of percentages. At the regional level, questions were selected and compared to determine if answers were in related. Statistical analyses with chi-square tests and correspondence analyses were performed. The results indicated that the social distancing period for COVID-19 containment in Italy influenced perceptions about urban green areas. The importance of having outdoor green spaces was highlighted and an increase in interest about urban green areas was observed. Future planning strategies will have to consider the need of designing urban green areas for having more livable cities.

AB  - There have been calls for an overhaul of regulatory and governance frameworks to incorporate the implications of the water-energy-food nexus. We map one small component of the regulatory space of the nexus and highlight its immense complexity. We draw on insights from the economics and sociolegal literatures to show that a decentralised approach to regulation based upon procedural justice can enable the trade-offs of the nexus to be considered and addressed. We use a nexus case study of micro hydro-electricity generation in Dartmoor National Park in England to show that when we take into account interactions between state and non-state regulation, the economic concepts of interdependencies and transaction costs, and a recognition that regulation of the nexus is a process involving decisions of procedural justice, some existing regulatory frameworks are already well-equipped to deal with the implications of nexus analysis.

AB  - The search for sustainability, particularly in an urban context, is in full swing. Based on a review of mainstream environmental management and the critical environmental justice perspective, this analysis proposes that concepts of space, territory, and livelihood which are operating at the interface of the social and physical world, offer possibilities to understand urban and rural metabolisms in a global context. The second part of the paper focuses on the main obstacles to achieve sustainability, arguing that the underlying causes for conflicts between urban and non-urban traditional territorial livelihood metabolisms are not being adequately addressed. The challenges of implementing sustainability often involve dealing with dynamic contradictory processes with unpredictable outcomes. Therefore, sustainability should not be seen as a certain state of the society, but as a kind of structuring structure characterized by the necessity of permanent rearrangement. Finally, to make this finding more applicable, we present seven parameters to evaluate socio-spatial relationships as a dialectical cognitive framework for planning towards more sustainability and environmental justice. The application of these parameters has been tested on the "sustainable" pulp industry in Bahia - Brazil, which is often regarded as sustainable due to certification by the Forest Stewardship Council.

AB  - Socioeconomic inequalities in residential duration may be a reflection of uneven opportunities to develop place attachment thanks to green space availability. This article evaluates the impact of urban green space availability on residential duration, and shows that this impact varies among socioeconomic groups. We used an econometric model to study relationships between geolocalized residential quality survey data and the objective measure of spatial availability of urban green spaces in Lodz, Poland. The results indicate that the length of residential duration of the wealthier residents is not affected by the availability of nearby green space, while the length of residential duration of the less socioeconomically privileged residents is affected negatively by the availability of nearby green space. The above-mentioned findings may be a signal of unequal opportunities to develop a relationship with the residents' place of living thanks to the availability of green spaces. Interestingly, inequalities related to residential duration, and their linkages with the strength of place attachment are less explored in the literature, compared to uneven access to other environmental benefits. This study supplements the traditional perspective of environmental justice with the context of residential duration and place attachment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Socioeconomic disparities in urban green space (UGS) availability and environmental injustice may occur not only at the scale of whole cities, selected districts/neighbourhoods, but also at lower spatial scales, such as urban blocks or even individual buildings. The latter - microscale UGS disparities - reflect differences in UGS availability among inhabitants who belong to different socioeconomic status groups and inhabit different buildings or parts of buildings. This article evaluates whether disparities in UGS availability and environmental injustice may occur in microscale in cities characterized by low socioeconomic segregation in general, such as those located in Central and Eastern Europe. For this purpose, we identified microscale socioeconomic disparities in UGS availability in the central zone of Lodz (Poland) using the localized modelling technique. Then, using a spatial microsimulation experiment, we demonstrated that an increase of segregation in Lodz's central zone would increase disparities in UGS availability and the occurrence of environmental injustice there. We demonstrated that the way the patterns of segregation interplay with microscale disparities can be further linked with temporal evolution of housing stock and local housing policy. Our findings may be useful for urban planners to stimulate the spatio-social diversity of inhabitants by focusing on microscale UGS disparities.

AB  - The concept of Environmental Justice (EJ) refers to social inequities in the distribution of environmental risks. This paper presents the first European spatio-temporal EJ analysis, focusing on the location of 107 waste incinerators in France since the 1960s to assess potential biases in siting decisions. It uses a spatial econometric analysis that accounts for vulnerable populations at the time unwanted land uses were sited. We find that, after controlling for a town's socio-economic characteristics and the opportunity costs represented by the demand of its neighbours, each additional 1% of a town's population that is foreign-born increased the odds that the town received an incinerator by 29%. Disproportionate siting near concentrations of immigrants thus generates environmental injustice in France.

AB  - Stream restoration is deeply shaped by social influences. A substantial body of literature has demonstrated the ways in which social dynamics shape myriad aspects of restoration practice. After illustrating these findings via brief reviews of existing research on public participation and environmental justice, I turn to the less commonly addressed influence of social dynamics on the practice and content of river science. I first review the approach and some of the key findings of Science and Technology Studies, a body of research that takes the practice of science as its empirical object of study. I then use the Rosgen Wars, a conflict that has strongly influenced the development of stream restoration science and practice in the United States, as a case study for examining the impacts of social dynamics on the practice of river scientists, the redistribution of scientific authority, and on fluvial landscapes more broadly. Given that is impossible to avoid social influences, I argue that it is crucial that we examine them, and that we choose research and implementation practices that reflect our ecological, scientific, and political commitments rather than passively accepting the existing commitments embedded in our work.

AB  - Studies in the U.S. have found that white men are less concerned about pollution than are women or people of other ethnicity. These studies have not assessed respondents' proximity to localized sources of pollution. Our objective was to assess lay perceptions of risk from air pollution in an ethnically diverse sample in which proximity to a major perceptible source of pollution is known. Cross sectional interview study of combined area probability and convenience sample of individuals 40 and older in the Boston area, selected according to proximity to high traffic controlled access highways. Of 697 respondents 46 % were white, 37 % Asian (mostly Chinese), 6.3 % African-American, 6.3 % Latino, and 7.6 % other ethnicity. While white respondents, and particularly white men, were less concerned about air pollution than others, this effect disappeared when controlling for distance from the highway. White men were slightly less supportive than others of government policy to control pollution. The "white male" effect may in part be accounted for by the greater likelihood of minority respondents to live near perceptible localized sources of pollution.

AB  - The assorted and multidimensional concerns that give rise to the issue of environmental justice have proved to be intellectually daunting and highly resistant to positive change, Low-income, people of color, and tribal communities confronting environmental stressors are beset by stressors in both the physical and social environments. For this reason, while the bifurcation of the public health and environmental fields taking place over the past several decades has yielded generally negative impacts in areas of public health, environment, and planning, the consequences for low-income and disadvantaged communities have been especially grievous. This commentary builds on the recent Institute of Medicine workshop titled "Rebuilding the Unity of Health and the Environment: A New Vision of Environmental Health for the 21st Century." The workshop organizers posited that only by thinking about environmental health on multiple levels will it be possible to merge various strategies to protect both the environment and health. In this commentary we examine how such a new vision of uniting public health and the environment can contribute to attaining environmental justice for all populations.

AB  - The San Pedro Bay Ports (SPBP) complex of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California is one of the largest container port complexes in the world. This complex contributes significantly to both regional and national economies in California and the United States, respectively. However, the ongoing growth and economic benefits of the SPBP are threatened by negative externalities associated with port operations, particularly increasing congestion and air pollution. The objective of this paper is to explore a new approach to estimating vehicle emission impacts of freight corridor operations related to the port area, particularly those associated with heavy-duty diesel trucks. The paper combines a microscopic traffic simulation model to capture detailed vehicle trajectories (speeds and accelerations) and congestion effects, with an emission model and a spatial dispersion model to facilitate the estimation of the health and environmental justice impacts of freight corridor operations. Focus is on the I-710 freeway in the Alameda Corridor from the SPBP area up to downtown Los Angeles, California, some 20 mi north. Several scenarios were evaluated in addition to the 2005 base scenario: replacement of the current fleet of port heavy-duty diesel trucks with zero-emission vehicles, elimination of port heavy-duty diesel truck trips that would correspond to shifting more containers to other modes such as rail, and implementation of a truck-restricted lane, preventing trucks from using the leftmost lanes. The results show that fleet replacement with cleaner trucks yields the most emission reductions both quantitatively and spatially.

AB  - Since there are various stakeholders related to water in Blue-Green Infrastructure that perform various ecological functions in a given city, there is a need for a plan to manage their interests and conflicts. Previous studies have verified the spatial preferences of many local residents using techniques, such as the public participation geographic information system, but have failed to show how stakeholders vary in regard to their dependence on water and their different spatial preferences. Therefore, this study intended to discuss the direction of collaborative planning by analyzing the Blue-Green Infrastructure of Siheung Hojobul wetland using spatial Q methodology, finding various stakeholders, and identifying the areas they prefer. The analysis results showed that local residents and environmental NGOs want to conserve middle and upper streams, but ecotourism guides and officials want to develop them for ecotourism, demonstrating a great difference in perspectives. However, they all agreed to develop a lower stream for ecotourism. Although this study has limitations as a single case study, the spatial Q methodology used in this study is significant in demonstrating that the use of the Blue-Green Infrastructure planning method for resident participation can reduce conflicts and encourage cooperation among competing parties.

AB  - Socio-economically underprivileged urban communities might suffer from restricted access to urban forests. Environmental injustice research on urban greenery in Asian cities is lacking. Public housing estates in Hong Kong, accommodating low-income households and over half of the 7.45 million population, were investigated for injustice in tree provision. Two clustering schemes used socio-economic and ecological characteristics to classify 93 estates. Factor analysis of 14 socio-economic variables identified four factors related to deprivation, namely ageing population, overcrowding, working poor with high academic qualifications, and marginalised language minorities. Principal component analysis of six ecological indices returned two components related to tree density and diversity. Estates with ageing population and more language minorities had the least urban tree provision indicated by low tree density. However, estates beset by overcrowding and working poor with high academic qualifications had the highest tree diversity indicated by the highest species evenness. Estates with the lowest language minorities had the densest but the least diverse tree stands. An alternative clustering scheme delineating ecological clusters substantiated the observed urban-tree patterns with respect to socio-economic characteristics. Estates with higher tree density and diversity had higher population density indicating overcrowding. Estates with lower tree density and diversity had more ageing population language minorities. The results highlighted the need to modify tree provision in response to changing estate demographics. From the research findings, five strategies were developed to adjust the amount and composition of the estate tree stocks to achieve greater social inclusion.

AB  - The United States has the highest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Previous studies reported that urban residents are more vulnerable to the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than rural residents. However, the pathways through which urban environments affect COVID-19 spread and mortality are unclear. We collected daily data on the number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from Mar. 01 to Nov. 16, 2020 for all 91 counties in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the United States. We calculated the COVID-19 incidence %, daily reproduction number, and mortality %, then estimated the associations with urban environment indicators using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were generally highest in areas with high population density, and this pattern was evident in the early period of epidemic. Among the area-level demographic variables, the percentage of Black or Hispanic residents showed the strongest positive association with COVID-19 outcomes. Higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes was also associated with higher percentage of overcrowded households, uninsured people, and income inequality. The percent elderly, sex ratio (the ratio of males to females), and greenness were negatively associated with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. The results of this study could indicate where resources are most needed. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Studies of ascription often focus on the relationship between inherited characteristics such as gender, race, or social class and educational inequalities that limit life chances. This project proposes that reduced educational outcomes, and hence ascription, can also emerge from physical/spatial inequalities, specifically, the place where a child attends school. The place where one lives is often not a matter of choice; rather, it is determined by other ascriptive forces such as race and social class-hence making environmental ascription not only a physical dimension of inequality in the direct sense but also another dimension of socially constructed inequality in the indirect sense. The prevalence of toxins near schools and the potential correlation with limited life chances and racial and class characteristics remains an understudied topic in the environmental inequality literature. To explore these connections, the authors mapped the locations of the top 100 polluters of developmental and neurotoxins in the United States and then determined the number of schools within a 2-mile radius, as well as the racial and socioeconomic composition of the areas surrounding each site. Overall, it was found that a significant proportion of the top industrial polluters were located in close proximity to multiple schools and that these schools were more likely to be located in neighborhoods with a disproportionate number of poor, minority residents. Because this exploratory study reveals a pattern of exposure to developmental neurotoxins in precisely those places where educational outcomes are already compromised, it suggests the need for further research specifying the relationship between environmental inequalities and school performance.

AB  - Suburban-style housing is becoming increasingly common in cities throughout the developing world. In this article, we describe processes that influence the formation of new suburban landscapes in these cities, and we consider the implications of these developments for questions of social and environmental equity. We show how suburban landscape construction may foster inequities in both exposure to environmental hazards and in access to environmental amenities.

AB  - Spatial injustices, especially the disproportionate exposure of disadvantaged communities to environmental risks, stem from an inability to appreciate the lived experience of risk and, instead, a reliance on technical frameworks for regulating it. We review Noddings' ideas about the caring attitude, in particular, that of caring for and, to some degree, caring about, and apply this to the issue of knowing about the experience of vulnerability and crafting effective and affective responses to it. We apply this lens to the case study of Southeast Los Angeles, where a profusion of small sources of air toxics creates zones of inordinate risk, and ask: How should the state and community have responded in a more caring way? How could the teachers and schoolchildren, themselves, have been empowered to speak for themselves? We draw lessons from it that speak to how we can begin reforming the regulatory state.

AB  - The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been released. In it, several sections address climate change, mitigation, and adaptation in cities, with discussions of the crucial role of planning and governance in the same. This article offers a reflection on the urban elements of AR6, pointing to the prevalence of ideological elements in it, typologizing form over critical assessments of real conditions in developing cities. As much as AR6 emphasizes the carbon footprint of society, it ignores the social footprint of carbon and the potentially massive adjustments mitigation and adaptation will require of developing nations and their urban populations.

AB  - So long as transaction costs are low, the creation of a tradeable permit to emit carbon should allow bargaining for emission rights among buyers and sellers, resulting in an efficient allocation of carbon emission rights. However, the trading of carbon credits may have socially unjust consequences. In this article, we explore some hitherto unrecognized disequities. One of these may be the creation of toxic hotspots as the trade of carbon may bring with it a transfer of air toxics, as well. We illustrate the argument by examining emissions from refineries participating in California's cap-and-trade program. These considerations are a concern for the larger question of carbon mitigation as the global community strives to identify feasible, yet just, approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Contrary to the idea of alienable rights, the transfer of carbon affects people and place in ways not internalized by these market instruments.

AB  - There is a pressing need to more deeply understand how incompatible land-use patterns intersect with place attachment and experiences of environmental injustice. While environmental policy is strongly influenced by the classic, probabilistic model of environmental risk, the present research instead aims to develop notions of environmental impact that more closely reflect the lived experience of community residents. This entails employing a phenomenological stance toward the analysis of environmental impacts, as well as research methods that seek to uncover the narratives and cognitive representations that residents actually employ In our exploration of these issues in the town of Val Verde, California, we discover how a nearby landfill encroaches on the everyday lives of the residents in ways that go beyond the classic model of risk. For example, rather than employing a positivist measure of environmental hazard, residents experience the landfill viscerally and emotionally in terms of its impacts on their everyday lives. Broadly stated, analysis is not simply to be associated with thought, but also with lived experience. We conclude the article by reflecting on the implications of this type of research for policy analysis.

AB  - Suburban metropolitan areas across the United States have become racially diverse. We examine this novel spatial demography in relation to pollution levels across census tracts within the greater Houston area for the year 2015. We integrate a multigroup measure of racial diversity (the Entropy Index) with information on pollution levels from the Toxics Release Inventory. Maps of these two variables show that racial diversity tends to be higher in the Houston suburbs where pollution levels tend to be lower. Indeed, across five different spatial regression models, we find that tract-level racial diversity is negatively correlated with pollution levels, controlling for a host of other factors, including population size and land area. We outline this finding as a human ecology approach to urban environmental inequality; specifically, we speculate that recent demographic shifts, like the "back-to-the-city" movement, are modifying the dynamics of environmental inequality in cities.

AB  - South Africa's adopted neoliberalism framework since democracy has spearheaded industrial development such as mining and has contributed to eroding civil society formations for environmental justice. Although civil society has acted against mining developments, such actions can be uncoordinated due to neoliberal development influences. Neoliberalism can work to reconfigure the geographies of environmental justice struggles contributing to a fragmented 'micro-politics'. This paper presents viewpoints from key stakeholders to examine civil society opposition to a mining proposal in rural Fuleni, KwaZulu-Natal to secure environmental justice and the campaign strategies used. The paper highlights that for environmental justice struggles against mining to be successful and effective against domination, requires communities linking up struggles and beyond isolated campaigns, sharing experiences and designing common narratives for strategies to combat mining and the broader neoliberal ideology producing unjust outcomes. This also requires that campaigners include the local youth in discussions on and alternatives to mining or run the risk of destabilising mining struggles.

AB  - The concerns of political ecology since its beginnings as a field have been predominantly set in rural areas with limited focus on urban industrial risks. Further, debates on the global South (often from Anglo-American perspectives) have not fully appreciated the divergent and differentiated perceptions of urban risks and, therefore, everyday forms of resistance within civil society. Instead, work has mainly focused on civil society power relations against the state and industry that are driven by coherent populist political agendas. Against this setting, this paper's contribution aims to better contextualize other third world localities in political ecology through a case study of urban industrial risks in the upper/middle income (as opposed to rural, low/lower middle income) country, South Africa. In doing so, the paper sheds light on the derelict aspect of civil society contestation, especially along class and ethnic lines, over urban landfill infrastructure as a livelihood resource or a health hazard. The paper draws upon frameworks of self-reflexivity and reflexive localism as complementary to the mainstream political ecology to illuminate differentiated civil society reflexiveness and therefore, aims to advance the discussion of other political ecologies. The case study of the largest formal landfill site in Africa, the Bisasar landfill situated in Durban, highlights differences underlying power relations and constraints within civil society (in leadership, social networking, resources and mistrust) that have implications for mainstream political ecology notions of civil society coherence.

AB  - South Africa presents a unique case for mining development and impacts on sustainability because the lines between the mining industry and the state are unclear and due to the increasing inequality between citizens. This questions the potential for citizens to hold mining industries (and government) accountable for environmental abuse. This paper examines the ability of civil society actors to take action against (coal) mining development by way of social capital collective actions in the natural tourist destination in Dullstroom. Semistructured interviews were conducted with various social actors and are reported in this paper. The paper highlights that local responses to engage in social capital against mining development for local sustainability are best understood in relation to the socio-economic and political positioning of individuals and ethnic groups. Overall, class and race differences, a tough farming environment, and perceptions and priorities of mining versus tourism jobs undermined capacity for social capital to act against mining risks. There is a need for social capital bridging and linking ties to protect the environment for tourism growth and long-term human-environment sustainability.

AB  - The article aims at showing the relevance of understanding the transformations of class composition for strengthening the connection between degrowth and environmental justice (EJ). In particular, I suggest the heterodox line of Autonomist Marxism as enabling factor of such connection. From an ecological perspective, the changing components of the working-class can be grasped by assessing the historical development of the value nature nexus, and specifically of labour's role within it. In fact, capitalism does not have but rather is an ecological regime. Value creation occurs not upon nature, but through it - that is, within socio-natural relations emerging from the articulation of capital, power and the environment. My basic argument is that in contemporary capitalism conditions of existence and reproduction of society have become key drivers for surplus value production most notably in carbon trading. Hence, EJ resistances are instances of class struggle and degrowth theoretical elaboration would benefit from incorporating such class-character. In this unprecedented situation, the task of the critique of political economy is not only that of unmasking ruling class' attempts to naturalize capitalism. It also requires resisting to elites' endeavours to directly capitalize nature.

AB  - The article assesses the material footprints of households living on a minimum amount of social benefits in Finland and discusses the consequences in terms of ecological and social sustainability. The data were collected using interviews and a questionnaire on the consumption patterns of 18 single households. The results are compared to a study on households with varying income levels, to average consumption patterns and to decent minimum reference budgets. The low-income households have lower material footprints than average and most of the material footprints are below the socially sustainable level of consumption, which is based on decent minimum reference budgets. However, the amount of resources used by most of the households studied here is still at least double that required for ecological sustainability. The simultaneous existence of both deprivation and overconsumption requires measures from both politicians and companies to make consumption sustainable. For example, both adequate housing and economic mobility need to be addressed. Measures to improve the social sustainability of low-income households should target reducing the material footprints of more affluent households. Furthermore, the concept of what constitutes a decent life should be understood more universally than on the basis of standards of material consumption.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in accounting for inequality in health risks and benefits within regulatory impact analyses, both given more general interest in the distributions of benefits and growing concerns about inequity (defined as those inequalities deemed unjust or unfair) and environmental injustice (in this context, those health risk inequalities that are correlated with race/ethnicity and certain other sociodemographic factors). Although there has been growing literature on this topic, there has been limited progress in practice, and the lack of quantification limits consideration of inequality in the policy process. Controversy remains regarding the best approaches to formally incorporate inequality, when these approaches should be used, and even whether it makes sense to quantify inequality in this context. The objective of this article is to review the literature on approaches for incorporating estimates of, and concerns for, inequality into regulatory impact analyses, especially those where environmental justice considerations are relevant, and consider the interpretation of these approaches and the implications for decision making. Using the case example of the Transportation and Climate Initiative, a collaboration among Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector, multiple strategies are described that could be used to shed light on health risk inequality and inequity, consider them in pending policy decisions, and evaluate their implications for the policy or instrument choice. Given appropriate contextualization and acknowledgment of the multidimensionality of equity, quantitative inequality indicators can provide meaningful insight about both inequality and inequity in health risks.

AB  - Since beginning operations in Central Appalachia, coal producers have economically exploited residents and exposed them to severe health risks associated with pollution. Despite causing these problems, the industry enjoys vigorous popular support. Drawing on nine months of immersive ethnography in "Shale County," this article examines why many Appalachians endorse the coal industry despite its negative externalities. I find that Appalachia's subordinate relationship to the rest of the nation plays a profound role in conditioning the region's pro-industry, anti-environmental views. Many Appalachians feel like the federal government neglects them, and like urban America, devalues them. Drawing upon Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony, I show how the coal industry capitalizes upon these feelings by promoting coal heritage-a carefully curated cultural construction that emphasizes selective aspects of Appalachian history while erasing those that challenge its domination. Coal heritage, I show, conveys environmentalism as an attack on Appalachians' right to economic opportunity, their role in the national division of labor, and their moral worth. It frames industry representatives, on the other hand, as guardians of regional interests and values.

AB  - Some states are defining environmental justice areas geographically on the basis of demographic criteria alone. This is problematic as it does not consider distributive concentrations of environmental toxins. Although environmental justice is much more than avoiding concentrations of increased environmental risk, the identification of such areas could provide states with a roadmap for addressing concentrations and for the facilitation of appropriate community-targeted programs in response. This research proposes an applied quantitative approach for the geographic designation of areas determined to be at greater relative risk of exposure to environmental toxins as part of states' broader environmental justice goals and policies. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Screening Environmental Impact Tool (RSEI) and spatial analyses, the proposed method defines geographic areas reflecting calculated risk values pertaining to exposed populations and toxic releases. The method is applied to four counties of New York, and the results are juxtaposed with current state-declared environmental justice areas, which are defined on demography alone. This approach permits geospatial mapping and exploratory spatial data analysis. The method potentially can be used by states to effectively address concentrations of toxic releases as part of their environmental justice programs and policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Spatial equity of parks is a major concern in environmental justice studies. While many measurements have been used to evaluate access to parks, few studies have considered the impact of travel behavior on park accessibility. This study aims to establish a travel behavior-based Gaussian two-step floating catchment area (TB-G2SFCA) method to assess spatial equity of parks in the Nanjing region, and Local Moran's I index is applied to identify spatial agglomeration patterns in assessing equity. The results demonstrate that (1) the traditional single-mode model maybe cannot provide accurate approach to evaluating park accessibility while the TB-G2SFCA method can provide a more realistic park accessibility evaluation; (2) the inhabitants of most communities distributed south of the Yangtze River can obtain better park services than the northern areas; (3) the spatial disparities of equity in park accessibility are severe in three suburban districts, relatively minor in four central districts, and insignificant in two central districts. These findings may assist urban planners and policy makers to frame more reasonable policy and planning to improve spatial equity to parks in urban areas.

AB  - The absence of a clear definition of environmental justice areas has been cited as one of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's major deficiencies in managing federal environmental justice programs. Several states have explicitly defined potential environmental justice areas and integrated targeted efforts into the policy-making process. At the block-group level, this study evaluates the effects of New York State's environmental justice policy, which defines communities of concern in terms of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as well as mandates supplemental regulatory enforcement activities for these neighborhoods, on the agency's policy implementation practices under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The empirical findings suggest that there is inconclusive evidence regarding race/ethnicity- and class-based environmental inequity. Also, the state's policy intervention is not universally effective. Moreover, task environments of a given community are a consistent determinant of the agency's regulatory compliance monitoring and assurance activities. This study then derives broader implications regarding the adoption of a policy instrument that defines and screens potential environmental justice communities.

AB  - The theory of social construction and policy design is insightful for exploring the circumstances in which the allocation of policy benefits and burdens is attributed to the feed-forward effect of degenerative policy that institutionalizes bias and reinforces the prevailing categorization and embedded social meaning regarding target populations. However, this theoretical framework has not been broadly adopted to analyze the environment-related phenomena. With a nationwide, block-group-level sample, this study examines the extent to which degenerative policies pertaining to immigrants influence state agencies' environmental regulatory outputs for predominantly Latino communities. Results show that in the states with moderately to most restrictive immigrant policy and high levels of Latino representation in legislatures, the rigorousness of government agencies' compliance monitoring activities decreases for Latino neighborhoods of environmental justice concern, as states' policy stance toward immigrants becomes more unfavorable. More Latino elected officials do not bolster policy implementation efforts for the vulnerable communities or offset the backlash effect of immigrant policy.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to discuss the democratic implications of climate change and whether or not it is possible to harmonize basic democratic values with the challenges raised by global warming. Highlighting three central democratic mechanisms it is argued that even if participation and deliberation are crucial for addressing the challenge of climate change this must be done within a system of democratic representation. To become both efficient and democratic, climate governance has to include different spheres and levels of authority. As there is no blueprint for a new institutional order of this kind we have to build upon and better utilize the patchwork of multi-level governance at hand. The growing number of trans-national networks, including a great variety of coalitions between actors from formal as well as informal institutions, has a great potential as an arena for deliberation of the challenge of climate change.

AB  - The California Community Environmental Health Screening Tool (CalEnviroScreen) advances research and policy pertaining to environmental health vulnerability. However, CalEnviroScreen departs from its historical foundations and comparable screening tools by no longer considering racial status as an indicator of environmental health vulnerability and predictor of cumulative pollution burden. This study used conceptual frameworks and analytical techniques from environmental health and inequality literature to address the limitations of CalEnviroScreen, especially its inattention to race-based environmental health vulnerabilities. It developed an adjusted measure of cumulative pollution burden from the CalEnviroScreen 2.0 data that facilitates multivariate analyses of the effect of neighborhood racial composition on cumulative pollution burden, net of other indicators of population vulnerability, traffic density, industrial zoning, and local and regional clustering of pollution burden. Principal component analyses produced three new measures of population vulnerability, including Latina /o cumulative disadvantage that represents the spatial concentration of Latinas/os, economic disadvantage, limited English-speaking ability, and health vulnerability. Spatial error regression analyses demonstrated that concentrations of Latinas/os, followed by Latina /o cumulative disadvantage, are the strongest demographic determinants of adjusted cumulative pollution burden. Findings have implications for research and policy pertaining to cumulative impacts and race-based environmental health vulnerabilities within and beyond California.

AB  - The research on quantitative intersectional environmental inequality outcomes examines how the spatial concentration of individuals occupying multiply marginalized social identities is associated with unequal exposure to environmental hazards. One recent exemplar study analyzed racialized and intercategorical environmental inequality outcomes in cancer-causing air pollution exposures for Whites, Blacks, Latinxs, and Asian/Pacific Islanders (APIs) at the census tract level in the continental United States. That study found thatnet of region, urban-industrial context, and other intercategorical variablesa variable representing elevated concentrations of economically deprived and foreign-born Latinxs, Latina single-mother families, and primarily Spanish-speaking households was the most consistent intercategorical predictor of tract exposure to spatial clusters of carcinogenic air pollution in 2005. The present study reproduces that nationwide analysis while being the first to include disadvantaged Indigenous peoples in the examination of intercategorical environmental inequality outcomes in the continental United States and for the ten U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regions. Logistic regression analyses indicate that the spatial concentration of disadvantaged Indigenous peoples was not a significant nationwide predictor of tract exposure to the carcinogenic air pollution clusters. However, the regional analyses revealed eight new patterns of intercategorical environmental inequality outcomes across the U.S. EPA regions, and the spatial concentration of disadvantaged Indigenous peoples was a significant positive predictor of tract exposure to carcinogenic air pollution clusters in the Mid-Atlantic region. These findings have implications for future environmental justice research, policy, and activism.

AB  - The bioeconomy has been portrayed as a transformational change to replace fossil-based fuels and other goods such as plastics. It is to substitute those goods while promoting zero-waste circular economies, creating jobs, and valorizing biodiversity - an agenda that meets conservation, climate and socioeconomic goals. Yet, where and from whom such bioresources are to come are questions that often receive insufficient scrutiny. Starting from an understanding that equity and sustainability essentially depend on how and on whose terms bio-based production takes place, this article explores the social dimensions of bioeconomy promotion through a "just transition" lens. Using the experiences of Brazil, India and Indonesia as case studies, it examines their dominant biobased production systems in terms of distributional, procedural, retributive, and restorative justice. The analysis shows that, while such a bio-based transition has been a boon for agribusiness, the bioeconomy has so far helped promote broadly unjust production systems - where benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed, procedural governance over landscapes and resource use tends to be exclusionary, and there is little accountability or redress for past and present damages inflicted upon traditional communities and local populations. This pattern highly contrasts with the bioeconomy's lip service to socioeconomic betterment and rural livelihood support. Instead, this examination shows bio-based sectors are expanding on many injustices while creating new ones. The conclusion is that, alongside fossil fuel substitution, a just bioeconomy transition also requires sustainable farming and land use - as two transitions in one. Therefore, asking where bio-based goods are produced, how, and by whom is essential.

AB  - Several authors have already addressed the issues of environmental justice and spatial distribution of destination sites; however, few have combined the two to explore possible geographic inequities in tourism development. The purpose of this study was to examine whether benefits from tourism development were equally distributed across geographic regions and socio-demographic groups in Taiwan. The results indicated that there is spatial inequality in the distribution of number of tourists with regards to average household income with a concentration of tourism numbers on peripheral areas with lower incomes; however, no spatial inequality was observed with respect to size of population and average personal traveling expenses. The findings also indicated that the data were geographically clustered and that consequently spatial regression was a preferable method in comparison with traditional OLS regression. Based on these findings destination managers and tourism planners are recommended to consider the impacts of tourism on local communities as tourism is predominant in peripheral areas in need of revitalization.

Its failure suggests carbon offsets are irreparably broken. National penalties for non-additionality, intended to shift regulatory incentives, fail to solve the principal/agent problems addressed. Modifying standards for emission cap measurements in order to solve additionality problems in land use change and forestry (LUCF) overlooks technical obstacles and political consequences.

AB  - Sustainability programs and their assessments have often been criticized for failing to support social justice. Eco-city development has also raised similar concerns. This research was conducted in order to address such problems. Specifically, this paper develops a new sustainability index that emphasizes environmental justice for the purpose of better classifying and assessing eco-cities. The proposed index measures equity among places as a result of eco-city development. Specifically, this index indicates instances in which a certain location achieves sustainability through means detrimental to another location. Thus, the index, comprised of environmental, economic, and social indicators of sustainability, may also be used to foster justice among diverse locations (urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, and neighboring cities) by highlighting the genuine motives behind eco-city development. One preliminary finding from the application of this classification is that oftentimes, eco-city development is not completed in the environmental, economic, or social interests of the people. Official eco-cities tend to serve government officials' interest in upper mobility. Developer eco-cities tend to be commercial expansions or developments focused on growth, profit, and model demonstration. Both official and developer eco-cities degrade the environment. They are also likely to develop urban centers at the environmental expense of other places. The economic growth of official and developer eco-cities is accompanied by worsening income inequality and social injustice. As a result, these types of eco-cities fail the sustainability performance assessment. Conversely, eco-cities founded by the citizens or by donors tend to focus on social and economic equity. This study was completed using qualitative research methods, including field work in 29 eco-cities throughout China and various countries. This field work was conducted from 2006 to 2014. Data was collected through interviews with 87 government officials, as well as environmental experts, grassroots environmentalists, residents, and real estate developers. The findings reveal that the majority of Chinese eco-cities have been overlooked in global eco-city literature. The research also calls for effective sustainability management in order to avoid the development of eco-cities that negatively impact the environmental and social interests of surrounding areas.

AB  - The Chinese government adopted more specific and stringent environmental impact assessment (EIA) guidelines in 2011, soon after the widespread ethnic protests against coal mining in Inner Mongolia. However, our research suggests that the root of the ethnic tension is a sustainability problem, in addition to environmental issues. In particular, the Mongolians do not feel they have benefited from the mining of their resources. Existing environmental assessment tools are inadequate to address sustainability, which is concerned with environmental protection, social justice and economic equity. Thus, it is necessary to develop a sustainability impact assessment (SIA) to fill in the gap. SIA would be in theory and practice a better tool than EIA for assessing sustainability impact. However, China's political system presents a major challenge to promoting social and economic equity. Another practical challenge for SIA is corruption which has been also responsible for the failing of EIA in assessing environmental impacts of coal mining in Inner Mongolia. Under the current political system, China should adopt the SIA while continuing its fight against corruption.

AB  - The paper examines the rise of environmental justice issues in Australia, evident in two toxic disputes; the first, in a Perth outer suburb in Western Australia where residents faced both a hazardous waste dump and the nation's biggest chemical fire; and the second, in the Sydney suburb of Botany where residents were confronted with the destruction of what is thought to be, the world's largest stockpile of hazardous hexachlorobenzene (HCB) waste. The paper reviews the range of factors that impacted the local communities' fight for environmental justice. It explores the limitations of risk assessment and risk-based policies, as well as the problematic role of the expert and the communication of risk. The informational inequity and resource disparities so evident in toxic disputes are highlighted. The case studies confirmed the inequitable distribution of chemical risk as a failure to secure environmental justice for all Australians.

This article examines how shareholder activists use the resolution process to advocate for issues related to social justice and corporate activities. After briefly reviewing the justice and shareholder activism literatures, the authors report the results of a study of 1,719 shareholder resolutions filed during the 1999-2005 period by members and affiliates of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of approximately 275 religious organizations and other partners that seeks to use their investments to achieve social change. Among the findings is that the majority of justice-related resolutions dealt with employment and economic development issues. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for corporate managers, shareholder activists, and management researchers.

AB  - The complex socio-economic conditions underlying (temporary) vacant urban landscapes have produced a wide range of spatial outcomes. Solutions to address these diverse spatio-temporal conditions inherently call for a range of design approaches. This paper, through literature and project review, introduces a conceptual design framework consisting of four criteria integral for developing sustainable solutions for repurposing vacant urban lands: (1) environmental justice and ecological democracy; (2) ecosystem services and urban biodiversity; (3) aesthetic experiences, and; (4) programming. By examining five case studies, I reveal a number of different and innovative ways in which these criteria can be integrated and deployed to transform urban vacant lands. Here, vacancy becomes a laboratory for testing and implementing new social-ecological systems across a range of spatial and temporal scales. This requires experimentation in the development of alternative planning and design strategies, including new public participation models, policy frameworks and funding mechanisms.

AB  - Sacramento, California's capital city has not, until recently, had the kind of cohesive and effective environmental justice (EJ) movement as seen in several other regions around the state or country. However, in the past 15 years, a variety of new forms of EJ organising are producing a vibrant if uneven movement. This article examines how and why this transformation has occurred and what challenges the movement has faced and which persist. I propose that the rise of the EJ movement in Sacramento can be traced to an explicit articulation of an EJ master frame, the development of an increasingly dense network of EJ-oriented organisations, the mobilisation of a grassroots base of residents, and several state-led EJ policy initiatives that have created openings for community mobilisation. The article begins by presenting a theoretical framework to understand the formation and development of social movements. This is followed by an overview of local environmental injustices and a series of focused case studies of key EJ struggles in the region. Finally, it closes with a discussion of the dynamic rise of the Sacramento EJ movement and further questions to track its continued development.

AB  - South Africa has historically enjoyed an ability to generate energy cheaply through the use of abundant coal reserves, which has been a key component in the promotion of economic growth. This paper assesses whether it is possible to reconcile economic goals and environmental protection within the nuclear energy sector, whilst meeting the needs of society. Simultaneous economic growth and environmental protection through the use of more efficient technologies have been achieved in the industrialised North, where the policy approach of ecological modernisation (EM) has been followed. Hajer's 'argumentative approach' of understanding how certain policy positions prevail and others are discounted is used as a frame for analysing South Africa's nuclear energy policy to establish the extent to which the policy has the potential to follow an EM approach. The analysis reveals that a policy shift towards nuclear energy shows very little evidence of EM, in spite of nuclear energy scientists' view that the potential exists for the simultaneous goals of growth and environmental efficiency to be realised through advances in environmentally efficient nuclear technology. Interviews with civil society groups emphasised that for an EM-based nuclear energy policy to be successful in meeting a variety of needs, an approach that combines EM with environmental justice will be more appropriate. These findings have important implications for theorising EM in contexts outside of the industrial North.

AB  - Solar power has long incited feminist imaginings of socio-environmental justice and a commoning of energy, despite its associations with military technology and precarious labour. This article addresses the question of responsible collaboration with a form of power that remains indifferent to human pursuits. It does so through a situated inquiry into a solar energy initiative in the Czech Republic considered as a technoecological phenomenon. Feminist technoecology is developed in terms of a double process of associations and dissociations - or technoecological dis/articulation - through which a collective and its milieu and ethos are constituted. It thereby attends to the immanent tensions and exclusions in the economic, political and ecological work of solar panels in particular encounters, including relations with the land and racialised labour, that differentially produce an ethos of interest and indifference. In this light, the non-participation of local Roma in the solar installation does not signal the absence of a relation but makes responsiveness, and responsibility, towards the indifference they constitute, possible. In a mode of speculative re-articulation, immanent frictions and potentialities are reworked to expand an ethos of caring and communing that incorporates extinguishment, non-participation and indifference.

Such responses, together with stereotypes and prejudice, define classism. The article focuses on classism in the United States. Classism is examined in the context of theoretical propositions about the moral exclusion of stigmatized others and is illustrated by cognitive distancing, institutional distancing (in education, housing, health care, legal assistance, politics, and public policy), and interpersonal distancing. The adoption of the Resolution on Poverty and Socioeconomic Status by the American Psychological Association Council of Representatives in August 2000 is cited as an important step in the direction of eliminating the invisibility of low-income persons in psychological research and theory.

AB  - There is currently no standard method for analyzing claims of environmental inequity. Neither is there a database of statistics on the extent of relationship between regional indicators of environmental quality, likely sources of pollution, and the demographic characteristics of affected populations. The resolution of environmental disputes is often hampered by inadequate communication between stakeholder groups about their perceptions and prioritization of the issues in dispute and by differential access to information about the issues by each stakeholder group. This paper describes a web-based tool, ICEP, that uses multi-layered GIS maps to establish a standard method for analyzing claims of environmental inequity and establish a database of correlation coefficients between environmental indicators, industry type by SIC code, and demographic characteristics of the population in proximity to noxious facilities. The maps are generated from stakeholder reports of environmental quality and are designed to be accessible via the Internet. This provides stakeholders with direct access to graphical displays of the perceptions of their co-stakeholders and provides all groups with links to relevant information sources about the issues in dispute. ICEP enhances existing community environmental websites like Scorecard and Envirofacts by providing displays of median household income as a measure of the distribution of benefits accrued within an area.

AB  - The documented under-representation of ethnoracial minority population in peri-urban parks can be considered an environmental justice issue. This exploratory qualitative study examined the outreach efforts and challenges faced by a large state parks agency in attracting underserved and under-represented visitors from low-income and ethnoracial minority groups to its parks. It also explored if and under what conditions partnerships between the public agency and community-based and nonprofit organisations or their coalitions may help bring more under-represented groups to parks. Findings were based on a triangulated three-pronged set of qualitative data from a) an online survey of state park personnel that yielded 58 responses; b) semi-structured interviews with 19 park leaders; and b) semi-structured interviews with representatives of 12 nonprofit groups. Findings indicated that despite its good intentions, the State Parks agency fell short of increasing the accessibility and fit of its parks for its low-income and ethnoracial minority constituents. Further findings suggested that partnerships between the state parks agency and open space nonprofit organisations and their coalitions offer a promising strategy for increasing diversity in parks, but only under certain caveats.

The successful deployment of these new technologies, like all new infrastructure projects, will be more successful if the projects have strong public support. Successful deployment of energy infrastructure correlates with thoughtful approaches to equitable energy transitions. This work recalls the history of recent energy infrastructure deployments, shows where the inclusion of social scientists has improved the possibility of success and proposes specific steps to make future deployments of advanced nuclear technologies successful.

AB  - Studio courses can transform practice and impart planning values, but increasing university expectations around revenue generation could create barriers for these objectives. To understand how funding demands could impact planning education, we examine a New Orleans-based case study in which external funders pressured university stakeholders to change a studio course. The studio, focused on environmental justice and freight rail planning, remained much the same, but shifted from an advocacy framework to a technical approach. This approach did little to impart social justice values or transform practice, but planning education can still support social justice values.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to demonstrate why and how efforts at UC Santa Cruz have begun to shift from sustainability as a technical, expert-oriented activity focused on aspects such as built environment, climate, energy, food and water, to more of a concern with inclusive sustainability, which centers on issues of power dynamics, difference, and ethical considerations. As the campus undergoes significant demographic change (e.g., UCSC's undergraduate population is 66% non- white and 43% are first generation college students), framings of sustainability must resonate with these increasingly diverse populations. The People of Color Sustainability Collective (PoCSC) is a groundbreaking partnership between UCSC's Ethnic Resource Centers, Colleges Nine and Ten, and Sustainability Office. PoCSC's efforts to recognize, celebrate, and validate diverse understandings and expressions of sustainability is a response to evidence of exclusion among certain sectors of our student population. Based on a recent campus- wide survey, this paper compares and contrasts responses between white, non- Hispanic students and students of color in terms of their participation in and perceptions about the environmental sustainability movement, finding that the former participate at a higher rate and rate mainstream environmental concerns such as conservation of biodiversity as more important, while environmental justice issues such as food access were rated more important to students of color. However, many areas of convergence between the two groups was found, notably a broad agreement about the importance of environmental issues.

AB  - The role of transport disadvantage in the social exclusion of low income and marginalised households and communities has received increasing academic and policy interest over the last 10 years or so. Against a backdrop of studies that have predominantly considered this issue within various national contexts, this paper offers a unique opportunity to compare different national context. The paper is informed by a commissioned study for the State of Victoria Department of Transport (Lucas, Study of transport exclusion in the state of Victoria: It doesn't have to be this way, 2008), which wished to draw lessons from the United Kingdom in order to promote a similar policy agenda for the State. It is the authors' contention that the issue of transport-related social exclusion is likely receive growing international policy recognition in the context of global recession, associated local job losses and reduced disposable incomes, as well as the ageing structure of most Western societies. The paper seeks to disseminate the important findings of our study about the potential for policy transfer to other national and local contexts to a wider academic, policy and practitioner audience.

AB  - The Basel Convention is regaining attention for the potential entry into force of the heretofore stalled Ban Amendment. In this paper, we draw parallels between the current debate surrounding the Ban Amendment and contestations that occurred in the early years of the Basel Convention's Technical Working Group (TWG) over defining 'hazardousness.' Like the present debate, TWG deliberations involved a contestation between two divergent discourses concerning how hazardous wastes should be regulated-as ideally managed versus actually managed in the global South. Scholars have shown how the TWG is a site for industry to press for a definition of hazardousness favorable to their economic interests. However, explorations of the specific processes by which this occurred-particularly, how a framework for defining hazardousness that privileges private technical expertise over concerns of precaution and equity was successfully institutionalized within the TWG-have yet to be completed. We show that it is important to reexamine this debate today in order to better understand current Basel Convention developments.

AB  - The rapid growth of distributed solar adoption in California provides an opportunity to lower electricity bills for the adopters and realize additional community benefits, including grid resilience and lower grid emissions. It is unclear, however, whether this transition is occurring equitably across the state's various demographic and socioeconomic groups and whether historically disadvantaged environmental justice (EJ) communities have been able to exploit the bill savings and other associated benefits of rooftop solar. Here we analyze the cumulative and annualized (spatial and temporal) rates of PV adoption across California and compare those with data from the state's cumulative impact EJ methodology (CalEnviroScreen). We find persistently lower levels of PV adoption in disadvantaged communities, suggesting clear distributive and equity impacts of existing PV support policies, and indicating that the benefits bypass some of the state's most vulnerable populations. The analysis reveals strong correlation of solar adoption with not only socioeconomic variables, but also with health, environmental and demographic indicators, contributing to our growing understanding of the role these factors play in household clean-energy adoption trends. The results provide a baseline from which to develop more effective policies, strategically design incentives, and track the efficacy of existing solar programs that target disadvantaged communities.

AB  - There has been a major shift of investment in extractive industry to the global South in recent decades. The repercussions are evident in the rise of protests from local communities against mining, but these face multinational companies, state and financial institutions operating as a coalition of the powerful. This article investigates how an apparently powerless community in Bangladesh succeeded in harnessing long and strong connections with transnational organisations to halt a proposed open-cast mine. Local protestors first connected with national environmental rights groups and then with diverse transnational partners. I examine how the Phulbari resistance, as it is known, succeeded by managing connections using reciprocal tenacity and obligation towards the environment. A strong and independent national-level environmental justice mediator (National Committee) kept the coalition close to its local core. The article presents an empirical case on the rise of the global South in transnational environmental politics.

AB  - The ''environment'' is a cultural construct which is shaped by shared life experiences and which differs with ethnicity Environmental justice requires attention to divergent environmental constructions. U.S. Latino environmental discourse differs from mainstream discourses, but u rarely heard. This paper sheds light on U.S. Latino environmental discourses by examining ideal landscapes, explanations for decline, and the relationship of the environment to ethnic identity Latino discourses suggest the need to reexamine the environmental/technology relationship the importance of social class in shaping environmental consciousness, and the limits of impact assessment as a tool for achieving social justice. Sociological tools for retrieving Latino environmental discourse include literary criticism and analysis of Latino environmental social movements. The former helps to identify the cultural content of different environmentalisms and to clarify relationships between culture and environment; the latter indicates the political potency of different elements of Latino environmental discourse.

AB  - The present study examines deaths and diseases associated with pollution from coal fired power plants (CFPPs) and compares the volume of those deaths and diseases to deaths and injuries associated with street crimes. This comparison illustrates that the single form of pollution studied here-CFPP small particle pollution-causes more deaths in the US than homicides and deserves additional criminological attention. We frame our examination of CFPP deaths and injuries in the corporate crime and green criminological literatures, and explore CFPP pollution as an example of corporate environmental violence. The widespread nature of CFPP violence justifies focusing greater criminological attention on this issue, including the development of policies for remedying pollution, which is now a ubiquitous problem with severe health consequences.

AB  - Tailings dam failures represent one of the highest risks associated with the mining industry. When such a disaster happens, it usually has enormous social and environmental consequences. The literature commonly suggests that dam failure events happen after periods of increased mineral demand. During high demand peaks, more waste material is generated, and during recession, financial cutbacks can lead to unpredicted effects on safety, especially in operations where the domestic authorities have less capacity to monitor and reinforce the rule of law. Based on document analysis from data collected during the first 60 days after the Fundao dam failure in Brazil, results highlight the capacity of companies and authorities to deal with disaster remediation, which have enabled multilevel activism. It shows how collective actions are relevant to support local claims/campaigns connected to rights and the service of justice in the disaster aftermath.

AB  - Several studies have revealed that urban green spaces (UGSs) provide a number of environmental and social benefits for human beings. However, with the acceleration of urbanization and population growth, the problem of unevenly distributed UGSs presents a challenge for sustainable urban development. This paper classified UGSs based on a spatial design network analysis (sDNA) model and mapped the spatial distribution of the population in central Jinan. Based on this method, an equity evaluation model was established, and the spatial equity of the UGS distribution was analyzed. The results indicated that the core area of central Jinan spread from the center to the east and west along the axis, and the range of the UGS in the core area of central Jinan within a 15-minute walking distance included more than 30 % and nearly 50 % of the population at the local and city-wide scales, respectively. In addition, a correlation analysis showed that the size of the population had a significant negative correlation with UGS accessibility in the study area. The main contribution of this paper was the provision of a new way to assess equity on a more precise scale with the combination of spatial syntax and population data.

AB  - The announcement by the Scottish Government of a global 'climate emergency' in May 2019, and the selection of Glasgow as the host city for the main COP26 talks to be held in late 2021 has helped focus attention to the impact of climate change in Scotland. The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought into sharp focus the disproportionate effect that shocks and stresses have on already vulnerable people and places. This short communication aims to contribute to these debates by clarifying existing strengths and open issues for an evidence-driven response to climate change in Scotland's marginalised communities. Growing support for rapid and radical climate action, both in Scotland and overseas, brings into question the role of learned societies and reasoned debate within a climate emergency. To this end, we synthesise recent Scotland-based research into issues relating to climate justice and, drawing on the outcomes of a workshop held in summer 2019, identify aspects where good progress has been made and areas where further work is required for an evidence-driven and just response to climate change in Scotland and beyond.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore the concept of an environmental racism claim through the use of several environmental management tools. The EPAs Toxics Release Inventory, Cumulative Exposure Project, and the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services' Hot Zone Census Tract Assessment were combined with racial and socioeconomic data to test claims that minorities in South Central Los Angeles are disproportionately exposed to environmental lead. Multivariate analysis indicated that race is strongly associated with the number of cases of elevated blood lead levels in South Central, irrespective of poverty status. Proximity to point sources, a common focal point for studies of environmental racism, was not a contributing factor to health outcomes. Proximity to transportation corridors was consistently the strongest indicator of environmental lead exposure, while median home values were significantly and positively related to elevated blood lead levels. Implications for environmental justice advocates and social and environmental scientists are discussed.

AB  - The emergence of an unconventional extractive industry of coal seam gas (CSG) in New South Wales, Australia has caused a range of social tensions. Although the industry has generally received strong support from state-level governments across Australia, an eclectic social movement has arisen in opposition. Critical questions of justice have emerged in these debates about CSG, particularly about the 'winners' and 'losers' that would emerge should large-scale CSG extraction be introduced into New South Wales. However, the question of justice in relation to CSG extraction is not altogether so simple. Actors on all sides of CSG development have mobilised the language of justice in their claims about this energy source in sophisticated ways and at different scales. In this paper, we draw upon 'energy justice' scholarship to tease out different energy justice dimensions of the CSG debate in New South Wales. We show how there are significant issues that will likely intensify regarding the recognition of different forms of knowledge, the access citizens have to forms of decision-making, and the risks that span geographic and temporal scales. We argue that it is vital to appreciate the significant and interrelated injustices faced by those challenging the industry.

AB  - Situated within the broader climate justice movement, the fossil fuel divestment movement calls for both public and private divestment of financial holdings from fossil fuel companies. This paper examines the extent of fossil fuel divestment campaigns at higher education institutions across Canada, examining key actions and tactics through which campaigns are initiated and mobilized, as led by students, faculty, alumni, and climate justice organizations. Findings indicate that out of 220 accredited Canadian universities and colleges, there are 38 active divestment campaigns and 6 institutions that have committed to varying degrees of divestment. Tactics used in these campaigns include signing of petitions, sit-ins, rallies, and protests, facilitated through face-to-face and online platforms. Findings revealed significant borrowing of actions and tactics among campaign actors, including the use of branding and messaging from international environmental organizations, such as 350.org. This research contributes to scholarly knowledge on how higher education divestment movements and related campaigns for institutional change can influence how sustainability and climate change are addressed. Actors can build on this knowledge to develop sustained collaborative systems to address current and future challenges across institutions and in society at large. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rural Pennsylvania, the epicenter of the Marcellus Shale region, hosts the most prolific unconventional natural gas extraction and production activity in the US. Farmers of small and midsized operations in Marcellus counties depend increasingly on incomes from booming natural gas operations, while the industry needs their land to access energy resources. These farmers thus bridge two economic sectors unconventional natural gas production and agriculture. Related dynamics rapidly transform the social, economic, and environmental landscapes for Pennsylvania's rural communities. We ask: What, if any, are the environmental justice implications of the unconventional natural gas industry's presence in rural agricultural spaces, particularly for farmers with small and midsized operations? Presenting findings from 42 in-depth interviews, participant observation, and archival analysis, we show how farmers benefit from natural gas leases to support their agricultural livelihoods. However, they face a devil's bargain. Farmers risk entrenchment in a long-term web of natural resource dependence, increasingly Unable to determine their livelihoods or land use on their own terms. Our study demonstrates how farmers' intersectoral dependence conditions procedural inequities and greater environmental risk. We show how farmers of small and midsized operations experience rural environmental injustices as they endure corporate bullying; face procedural inequities negotiating and enforcing lease terms; and increasingly contend with environmental risks associated with unconventional natural gas production.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in collaborative approaches between the environmental justice (EJ) and reproductive justice (RJ) movements to address the higher burden of toxic exposures and associated reproductive health outcomes in vulnerable communities. This study examined the collective action frames (CAFs) of advocates at the EJ/RJ nexus. CAFs highlight how advocates identify problems and solutions, and motivate action. The use of intersectionality was identified as a main CAF used in three key ways: breaking free from identity-based, issue-based, and movement-based siloes. First, interviewees described breaking free from identity-based siloes by identifying risks of toxic exposures that result from intersecting social locations (e.g. gender, race/ethnicity, income, immigration status) and by equally prioritizing multiple aspects of their identities as they engage in advocacy. Second, they described breaking free from issue-based siloes by developing multi-issue agendas that address a complex web of interrelated problems impacting health. Third, they described breaking free from movement-based siloes by developing cross-movement collaborations to address issues of mutual concern. Among multiple reasons given for cross-movement collaborations, advocates perceived them as valuable in order to disrupt social, political, and economic power imbalances that shape environmental reproductive health inequities, as well as other health and social inequities. Based on these findings, we suggest that intersectionality is a master frame, and thus may be useful to advocates in other social movements addressing intersectional issues. Understanding an intersectionality frame can help to inform advocacy approaches to promote health and health equity, particularly those focused on policies and structural drivers of health.

AB  - There is an emerging consensus that the health of the planet depends on the coexistence between rapidly growing cities and the natural world. One strategy for guiding cities towards sustainability is to facilitate a planning process based on positive visions for urban systems among actors and stakeholders. This paper presents the Urban Nature Futures Framework (UNFF), a framework for scenario building for cities that is based on three Nature Futures perspectives: Nature for Nature, Nature for Society, and Nature as Culture. Our framework engages stakeholders with envisioning the three Nature Futures perspectives through four components using participatory methods and quantitative models: identification of the socio-ecological feedbacks in cities, assessment of indirect impacts of cities on biodiversity, development of multi-scale indicators, and development of scenarios. Stakeholders in cities may use this framework to explore different options for integrating nature in its various manifestations within urban areas and to assess how different community preferences result in various cityscapes and distribution of associated benefits from nature among urban dwellers across multiple scales.

AB  - The Southeast CARE Coalition has been using community-based participatory research to examine environmental degradation in the Southeast Community, Newport News, Virginia. A survey was developed to collect assessment data. Up to 66% of respondents were concerned about environmental problems in their community. Those with health conditions were significantly more likely to identify specific environmental problems. The top 5 environmental concerns included coal dust, air quality, crime, water quality, and trash. The community-based participatory research process is building community capacity and participation, providing community input into strategic planning, and empowering community members to take control of environmental justice issues in their community.

AB  - The development of air quality management (AQM) strategies provides opportunities to improve public health and reduce health inequalities. This study evaluates health and inequality impacts of alternate SO2 control strategies in Detroit, MI, a designated non-attainment area. Control alternatives include uniform reductions across sources, ranking approaches based on total emissions and health impacts per ton of pollutant emitted, and optimizations that meet concentration and health goals. Using dispersion modeling and quantitative health impact assessment (HIA), these strategies are evaluated in terms of ambient concentrations, health impacts, and the inequality in health risks. The health burden attributable to SO2 emissions in Detroit falls primarily among children and includes 70 hospitalizations and 6000 asthma-related respiratory symptom days annually, equivalent to 7 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The health burden disproportionately falls on Hispanic/Latino residents, residents with less than a high school diploma, and foreign-born residents. Control strategies that target smaller facilities near exposed populations provide the greatest benefit in terms of the overall health burden reductions and the inequality of attributable health risk; conventional strategies that target the largest emission sources can increase inequality and provide only modest health benefits. The assessment is novel in using spatial analyses that account for urban scale gradients in exposure, demographics, vulnerability, and population health. We show that quantitative HIA methods can be used to develop AQM strategies that simultaneously meet environmental, public health, and environmental justice goals, advancing AQM beyond its current compliance-oriented focus.

AB  - The environmental burden of disease is the mortality and morbidity attributable to exposures of air pollution and other stressors. The inequality metrics used in cumulative impact and environmental justice studies can be incorporated into environmental burden studies to better understand the health disparities of ambient air pollutant exposures. This study examines the diseases and health disparities attributable to air pollutants for the Detroit urban area. We apportion this burden to various groups of emission sources and pollutants, and show how the burden is distributed among demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. The analysis uses spatially-resolved estimates of exposures, baseline health rates, age-stratified populations, and demographic characteristics that serve as proxies for increased vulnerability, e.g., race/ethnicity and income. Based on current levels, exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O-3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are responsible for more than 10,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per year, causing an annual monetized health impact of $6.5 billion. This burden is mainly driven by PM2.5 and O-3 exposures, which cause 660 premature deaths each year among the 945,000 individuals in the study area. NO2 exposures, largely from traffic, are important for respiratory outcomes among older adults and children with asthma, e.g., 46% of air-pollution related asthma hospitalizations are due to NO2 exposures. Based on quantitative inequality metrics, the greatest inequality of health burdens results from industrial and traffic emissions. These metrics also show disproportionate burdens among Hispanic/Latino populations due to industrial emissions, and among low income populations due to traffic emissions. Attributable health burdens are a function of exposures, susceptibility and vulnerability (e.g., baseline incidence rates), and population density. Because of these dependencies, inequality metrics should be calculated using the attributable health burden when feasible to avoid potentially underestimating inequality. Quantitative health impact and inequality analyses can inform health and environmental justice evaluations, providing important information to decision makers for prioritizing strategies to address exposures at the local level.

AB  - The contemporary interest in urban cultivation in the global North as a component of sustainable food production warrants assessment of both its quantitative and qualitative roles. This exploratory study weighs the nutritional, ecological, and social sustainability contributions of urban agriculture by examining three casesa community garden in the core of New York, a community farm on the edge of London, and an agricultural park on the periphery of San Francisco. Our field analysis of these sites, confirmed by generic estimates, shows very low food outputs relative to the populations of their catchment areas; the great share of urban food will continue to come from multiple foodsheds beyond urban peripheries, often far beyond. Cultivation is a more appropriate designation than agriculture for urban food growing because its sustainability benefits are more social than agronomic or ecological. A major potential benefit lies in enhancing the ecological knowledge of urbanites, including an appreciation of the role that organic food may play in promoting both sustainability and health. This study illustrates how benefits differ according to local conditions, including population density and demographics, operational scale, soil quality, and access to labor and consumers. Recognizing the real benefits, including the promotion of sustainable diets, could enable urban food growing to be developed as a component of regional foodsheds to improve the sustainability and resilience of food supply, and to further the process of public co-production of new forms of urban conviviality and wellbeing.

AB  - The economy is not circular, it is increasingly entropic. Energy from the photosynthesis of the distant past, fossil fuels, is burned and dissipated. Even without further economic growth the industrial economy would need new supplies of energy and materials extracted from the "commodity frontiers", producing also more waste (including excessive amounts of greenhouse gases). Therefore, new ecological distribution conflicts (EDC) arise all the time. Such EDCs are often "valuation contests" displaying incommensurable plural values. Examples from the Atlas of Environmental Justice are given of coal, oil and gas-related conflicts in several countries combining local and global complaints. Claims for climate justice and recognition of an ecological debt have been put forward by environmentalists from the South since 1991, together with a strategy of leaving fossil fuels underground (LFFU) through bottom-up movements. This could make a substantial contribution to the decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - The proximity to urban green spaces (UGS) is important to facilitate their use by citizens, mainly by the most vulnerable groups in society who are usually unable to walk long distances. Furthermore, there are several ecosystem services from which the population can only benefit if UGS are close. In addition to being important to identify areas without a UGS nearby, it is also important to indicate possible locations for a new UGS, thus avoiding wasting resources by overlapping coverage areas or leaving gaps in coverage. It is also important to understand among all possible locations where the construction of a UGS is most needed. The present study aims (i) to identify possible locations for future UGS and order them by construction priority, (ii) to develop and test a methodology for decision-makers and urban planners and (iii) to contribute to increasing and developing UGS in cities. Considering residential areas, the results reveal a deficiency in UGS coverage in all the cities studied, as only 43.86-57.09% of residential areas have a UGS within 300 m. Construction of proposed UGS will lead to a 12.30-26.15% increase in coverage. The proposed methodology needs further improvement, but it can be a valuable tool for urban planners and decision-makers, and can encourage the construction of more UGS.

AB  - Severe land surface temperature (LST) significantly impacts residents' thermal discomfort and can be lifethreatening during warm seasons. Therefore, it is essential to identify the inequalities in LST exposure, i.e. the socioeconomic groups who are over- or underexposed to LST. There is a knowledge gap in the literature: there is no previous study which differentiates between national-scale inequalities -i.e. inequalities apparent in all location of a country, and the local-scale inequalities -i.e. inequalities existing in some areas of a country. Employing a semi-parametric geographically weighted regression model to study LST in Dutch residential zones in the summer of 2014, the results of this study show that two national-scale inequalities are significant: overexposure of high-income groups and underexposure of the owners of high-value properties. Additionally, eight local-scale inequalities are identified. Among the latter, ethnic inequalities, overexposure of Non-western and Western immigrants, found to be the most severe and frequent at the local scale. Additionally, females are often the second most overexposed to LST at the local-scale. To a lesser degree Rental dwellings and Population age 15-24 are the second most overexposed of a zone's population. In the end, the results and policy implications are discussed.

AB  - Spatial disparities in environmental quality and practices are contributing to rising health inequalities worldwide. To date, the field of health promotion has not contributed as significantly as it might to a systematic analysis of the physical environment as a determinant of health nor to a critique of inequitable environmental governance practices responsible for social injustice-particularly in the Canadian context. In this paper, we explore ways in which health promotion and environmental justice perspectives can be combined into an integrated movement for environmental health justice in health promotion. Drawing on Canadian experiences, we describe the historical contributions and limitations of each perspective in research, policy and particularly professional practice. We then demonstrate how recent environmental justice research in Canada is moving toward a deeper and multi-level analysis of environmental health inequalities, a development that we believe can inform a comprehensive research, policy and advocacy agenda in health promotion toward environmental health justice as a fundamental determinant of health. Lastly, we propose four key considerations for health promotion professionals to consider in advancing this movement.

AB  - The Anthropocene, a proposed name for a geological epoch marked by human impacts on global ecosystems, has inspired anthropologists to critique, to engage in theoretical and methodological experimentation, and to develop new forms of collaboration. Critics are concerned that the term Anthropocene overemphasizes human mastery or erases differential human responsibilities, including imperialism, capitalism, and racism, and new forms of technocratic governance. Others find the term helpful in drawing attention to disastrous environmental change, inspiring a reinvigorated attention to the ontological unruliness of the world, to multiple temporal scales, and to intertwined social and natural histories. New forms of noticing can be linked to systems analytics, including capitalist world systems, structural comparisons of patchy landscapes, infrastructures and ecological models, emerging sociotechnical assemblages, and spirits. Rather than a historical epoch defined by geologists, the Anthropocene is a problem that is pulling anthropologists into new forms of noticing and analysis, and into experiments and collaborations beyond anthropology.

AB  - Since mid-2018, school students across the world have been leading mass strikes to demand strengthened political action on climate change. This article explores how young people's political participation in the School Strike for Climate movement in Australia was represented in newspaper coverage over a 17-month period (August 2018-December 2019), with particular attention to the representation of young people's emotions and actions. The analysis works with a corpus of 500 articles published in Australian national, state (New South Wales and Victoria), and a select sample of regional and rural newspapers. The corpus is read with affective-discursive attunement to historical representations of children and young people, the politics of emotion, and contemporary media representational politics surrounding climate justice activism. Four dominant characterisations of the young strikers are analysed: ignorant zealots, anxious pawns, rebellious truants, and extraordinary heroes. Alongside these characterisations, we consider how young people speak back to these characterisations, and draw implications for future research with young climate justice activists.

AB  - The topic of organization-environment relations informs how organizational managers, community leaders, and policymakers and advocates secure essential resources, justify their strategic importance, collaborate and compete, and engage in civic participation and politics. Yet the topic has rarely focused upon the built and natural environments; and research on environmental justice (as a sister of social justice) has lagged despite longstanding concerns of environmental racism and strong interest in the development and sustainment of community-based practices, programs, and policies in response to environmental degradation. We provide a brief vision of macro practice, education, research, and theory that is (1) centered in environmental justice and (2) rooted in what managers and leaders do within organizations and communities. Our analysis identifies novel and needed directions for the future, as we imply that important theoretical and conceptual perspectives supporting macro practice, programming, and research are being unmoored by environmental dislocations facing targeted communities.

AB  - The rise of environmental justice activism since the 1980s provides an exceptional opportunity to study the relations between a grassroots movement and philanthropic foundations. I utilize archival documents and interviews with activists and funders to pose two guiding questions. One, to what degree has the environmental justice movement gained access to foundations? Two, to what degree does this movement maintain self-determination in its relations with foundations? This paper shows that the movement successfully established connections with a few key foundations. I also show how environmental justice grantee organizations maneuvered around some of the foundation-related constraints that might otherwise present very real threats to their self-determination. This analysis builds on, but also goes beyond, the channeling and co-optation literatures that emphasize the potentially negative influence of foundation funding on grantees. It also contributes to the newly developing social relations perspective which conceptualizes social movement philanthropy as a relationship that is mediated by many factors (for instance, the political orientation of the funder and grantee, among others).

AB  - Targeting public redevelopment funding toward the most marketable brownfields is viewed as an economically efficient use of scarce resources because it may guarantee the greatest likelihood of success. But to what extent does this policy result in spatial and social inequities by neglecting contaminated sites in distressed neighborhoods containing minority and low-income populations? This case study of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, identified that tracts with above-average percentages of African Americans and Hispanics, although containing above-average numbers of brownfields per square mile and higher percentages of brownfields compared to percentage of the city's area, had below-average city-assisted redevelopments as a percentage of all brownfields. A policy implication is that despite difficulties promoting brownfield redevelopment in distressed neighborhoods, in addition to economic efficiencies, more emphasis is needed on the social benefits of public assistance for brownfield redevelopment, including potential spillover benefits, such as crime reduction and health improvements for surrounding neighborhoods.

AB  - The development of energy infrastructure in the Arctic poses serious far reaching justice based questions for local, regional and international communities. Oil and gas rigs, renewable energy sites, shipping and transportation all force us to reflect on how fair and equitable infrastructural expansion is locally and globally. We examine the justice claims of business, government and civil society in an attempt to understand current problems, and their likely solutions. The results suggest that we need to replace the current stakeholder-centred approach of energy policy, with one based upon justice. A widening of procedural justice to include not only the co-production of decisions, but also knowledge should be complemented with new ways of recognising the vulnerabilities of mis-and under-represented people, as well as exploring the sensitivities around proximity to new energy infrastructures.

AB  - There are few data on pesticide exposures of migrant Latino farmworker children, and access to this vulnerable population is often difficult. In this paper we describe a community-based approach to implement culturally appropriate research methods with a migrant Latino farmworker community in Oregon. Assessments were conducted in 96 farmworker homes and 24 grower homes in two agricultural communities in Oregon. Measurements included surveys of pesticide use and work protection practices and analyses of home-dust samples for pesticide residues of major organophosphates used in area crops. Results indicate that migrant farmworker housing is diverse, and the amounts and types of pesticide residues found in homes differ. Azinphos-methyl (AZM) was the pesticide residue found most often in both farmworker and grower homes. The median level of AZM in farmworker homes was 1.45 ppm compared to 1.64 ppm in the entry area of grower homes. The median level of AZM in the play areas of grower homes was 0.71 ppm. The levels of AZM in migrant farmworker homes were most associated with the distance from fields and the number of agricultural workers in the home. Although the levels of AZM in growers and farmworker homes were comparable in certain areas, potential for disproportionate exposures occur in areas of the homes where children are most likely to play. The relationship between home resident density, levels of pesticide residues, and play behaviors of children merit further attention.

AB  - Social justice and water refers to fairness of access to water resources and equality of burden from poor water quality and water hazards. This chapter considers briefly the origins and definition of social justice, and ways in which social justice and water interact. Global scale water justice is considered mainly in respect of disease and the lack of progress towards effective provision of water and sanitation. A detailed case study of the links between water debt and deprivation in the UK is then examined, concluding with a consideration of the options available to resolve water debt issues whilst respecting social justice. We conclude with a consideration of the future constraints on water resources in the light of the latest UK climate projections, and recognise that difficult choices might be encountered in which social justice for people might have to have priority over environmental justice for river and land habitats.

AB  - The Scottish Executive has declared its intention to 'put environmental concerns at the heart of public policy and secure environmental justice for all communities'. By way of secondary analysis, we explore two high-profile community campaigns which convey a fundamental tension between the rhetoric and practice of environmental justice within an urban framework. A number of concerns from local communities suggest that the proclaimed enthusiasm for sustainability conceals the true cost of its implementation at a local level. We are of the view that environmental justice - flaunted as a core policy government commitment - throws up a range of contradictions and misconceptions, which implies the need for a more progressive and inclusive approach to the implementation of policy.

AB  - The 2009 Copenhagen Accord marked a significant shift in global climate governance which has been substantially adopted in the 2015 Paris Agreement. At Copenhagen, binding targets for states to reduce emissions were replaced by voluntary pledges. We argue that the Polanyian 'double movement' offers a useful lens to understand the Copenhagen shift in global climate governance as part of ongoing contestation in the international law system between principles of economic liberalisation and redistributive intervention. In the second half of the 20th century, redistributive design of international legal institutions became evident in a number of issue areas including trade law, oceans law and the seminal climate treaties. However, there has been ongoing US lead opposition to 'redistributive multilateralism' (RM), particularly over the last decade of climate negotiations. The Copenhagen model of voluntary pledges, therefore, needs to be viewed as an outcome of this opposition to RM and a related weakening of differentiation in international environmental law.

AB  - The Paris Agreement (2015) and the Rulebook (2018) introduce the terms 'fair' and 'climate justice' for burden-sharing and differentiation. The article analyses to what extent these terms amend the existing term 'equity' and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR). The principle of CBDR is an open balancing concept with one clear requirement: Contracting parties contribute to climate protection to a different extent. The terms which appear to have normative weight ('equity' and 'climate justice'), in international climate agreements, are limited to their procedural relevance. They aim at an equal participation in sub-institutions of the Paris Agreement or at making arguments for differentiation transparent. The term 'fair' focuses on the discourse on individual concepts of differentiation and on narrowing down common criteria in the long-run. Considering the operationalization of differentiation beyond the terms, it becomes clear that criteria are hardly specified, not weighted against each other and that self-differentiation dominates pre-defined criteria, in particular within the central rules on mitigation and financial transfers. However, the Paris Agreement still specifies criteria with different relevance: Capabilities are followed by vulnerability and the responsibility for emissions. After all, the prevailing procedural terms and rules of differentiation might give orientation, inspire subsequent decisions and the nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The more transparent the various specifications of differentiation are, the more the rules of differentiation can be narrowed. If the reference of criteria to individual states is possible, the Paris Agreement might be implemented effectively which allows for better compliance with the Agreement.

AB  - The crux of sustainability concerns hinges on humanity's overshoot of our global carrying capacity, which we currently exceed by about 50 %. Overshoot of the earth's natural resource bases militates against our current and future prospects for sustainability. Despite the theoretical and practical impetus to examine these dynamics, there is a dearth of empirical sociological research that analyzes overshoot. The paper fills this gap by offering a structural equation model of each nation's relative contributions to overshoot. The model tests key theorizations in the environmental sociology, development, and global political-economy literatures, and adds to them by theorizing and empirically testing ecofeminist positions that the status of women affects and is affected by environmental conditions. Findings support ecofeminist interpretations that resource degradation yields adverse impacts on women and that their representation in government bodes well for the environment. The theoretical, empirical, and policy-based conclusions and implications are treated, as well as future areas of research.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to gain empirical footing on the mechanisms that drive and mitigate global warming, which is a topic of growing significance to themes of social justice. Using components of the ecological footprint, we construct a measure of each nation's relative contributions to carbon dioxide emissions after accounting for the amount sequestered by domestic forestlands. We refer to this measure as the "climate footprint," and construct a structural equation model to test key theorizations in the environmental sociology literature. We add to this body of work by incorporating and empirically testing ecofeminist positions that the status of women is a cause and an effect of environmental conditions. Results suggest women and the environment are interconnected dimensions of exploitation, as ecological losses weaken women's status in nations. We also find that nations with greater female representation in governing bodies have lower climate footprints, controlling for domestic (urbanization, production) and global (world-system integration) drivers. Conclusions point to the potential for gender equality and improving the status of women worldwide to curtail climate change. Other theoretical and empirical implications are treated, including the benefits of bringing women into theories of the environment and the utility of structural equation techniques for testing hypotheses that specify direct and indirect connections among relevant predictors and the outcome.

AB  - The debate on "Loss and Damage" (L&D) has gained traction over the last few years. Supported by growing scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change amplifying frequency, intensity and duration of climate-related hazards as well as observed increases in climate-related impacts and risks in many regions, the "Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage" was established in 2013 and further supported through the Paris Agreement in 2015. Despite advances, the debate currently is broad, diffuse and somewhat confusing, while concepts, methods and tools, as well as directions for policy remain vague and often contested. This book, a joint effort of the Loss and Damage Network-a partnership effort by scientists and practitioners from around the globe-provides evidence-based insight into the L&D discourse by highlighting state-of-the-art research conducted across multiple disciplines, by showcasing applications in practice and by providing insight into policy contexts and salient policy options. This introductory chapter summarises key findings of the twenty-two book chapters in terms of five propositions. These propositions, each building on relevant findings linked to forward-looking suggestions for research, policy and practice, reflect the architecture of the book, whose sections proceed from setting the stage to critical issues, followed by a section on methods and tools, to chapters that provide geographic perspectives, and finally to a section that identifies potential policy options. The propositions comprise (1) Risk management can be an effective entry point for aligning perspectives and debates, if framed comprehensively, coupled with climate justice considerations and linked to established risk management and adaptation practice; (2) Attribution science is advancing rapidly and fundamental to informing actions to minimise, avert, and address losses and damages; (3) Climate change research, in addition to identifying physical/hard limits to adaptation, needs to more systematically examine soft limits to adaptation, for which we find some evidence across several geographies globally; (4) Climate risk insurance mechanisms can serve the prevention and cure aspects emphasised in the L&D debate but solidarity and accountability aspects need further attention, for which we find tentative indication in applications around the world; (5) Policy deliberations may need to overcome the perception that L&D constitutes a win-lose negotiation "game" by developing a more inclusive narrative that highlights collective ambition for tackling risks, mutual benefits and the role of transformation.

AB  - Safe and secure water is a cornerstone of modern life in the global North. This article critically examines a set of prevalent myths about household water in high-income countries, with a focus on Canada and the United States. Taking a relational approach, we argue that household water insecurity is a product of institutionalized structures and power, manifests unevenly through space and time, and is reproduced in places we tend to assume are the most water-secure in the world. We first briefly introduce "modern water" and the modern infrastructural ideal, a highly influential set of ideas that have shaped household water provision and infrastructure development over the past two centuries. Against this backdrop, we consolidate evidence to disrupt a set of narratives about water in high-income countries: the notion that water access is universal, clean, affordable, trustworthy, and uniformly or equitably governed. We identify five thematic areas of future research to delineate an agenda for advancing scholarship and action-including challenges of legal and regulatory regimes, the housing-water nexus, water affordability, and water quality and contamination. Data gaps underpin the experiences of household water insecurity. Taken together, our review of water security for households in high-income countries provides a conceptual map to direct critical research in this area for the coming years. This article is categorized under: Human Water > Human Water

AB  - The concept of biophilic urban planning has inspired neighborhood greening projects in many older urban communities in the USA and beyond. The strengths (e.g., environmental management, biodiversity, heat island mitigation) and challenges (e.g., greenwashing, green gentrification) of such projects are well-documented. Additional research on the relationship between these projects and various social factors (e.g., public perceptions, feelings, and mental health and well-being) is necessary to better understand how people adapt to said projects while struggling to navigate other more pressing socioeconomic issues, especially in communities facing environmental injustice and health inequity. In this article, we focus on one aspect of biophilic urban planning-green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) (e.g., rain gardens, bio-swales, pervious pavements, and wildflower meadows)-in Waterfront South, a post-industrial neighborhood in Camden, NJ, USA, where residents have faced environmental injustices for decades. Our qualitative analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews of sixteen residents offered a thorough insight into their perceptions and emotions regarding different types of urban GSI projects. Residents acknowledge the many benefits that GSI offers to combat the neighborhood's social and environmental injustices, but they are cautious about the possibility of some projects prompting new issues and concerns within the community. Our findings reveal potential implications in GSI planning, research, and practice in this neighborhood and similar urban places elsewhere that have yet to undergo gentrification.

AB  - The present study evaluates the principal forms of socioenvironmental damage suffered by local traditional populations and indigenous communities as a result of the installation and operation of the Pecem Industrial and Shipping Complex. The main problem being pollution in the municipalities of Sao Goncalo do Amarante and Caucaia, which is in the Brazilian state of Ceara. As a theoretical framework, we use the concept of "environmental justice," and "environmental racism." The latter were used to understand the process of "deterritorialization" of these communities that resulted in extensive impacts on the natural environment, as well as the way of life and productive practices of these communities. Our analyses confirm the destruction of the means that allow noncapitalist exploitation of natural resources, such as artisanal fisheries, subsistence farming, and the use of commons. We show how all these processes are constitutive of environmental injustice and environmental racism. These may contribute to the organization of the resistance and struggle of the affected populations, namely indigenous peoples and traditional communities.

AB  - Substance use disorders are widely recognized as one of the most pressing global public health problems, and recent research indicates that environmental factors, including access and exposure to substances of abuse, neighborhood disadvantage and disorder, and environmental barriers to treatment, influence substance use behaviors. Racial and socioeconomic inequities in the factors that create risky substance use environments may engender disparities in rates of substance use disorders and treatment outcomes. Environmental justice researchers, with substantial experience in addressing racial and ethnic inequities in environmental risk from technological and other hazards, should consider similar inequities in risky substance use environments as an environmental justice issue. Research should aim at illustrating where, why, and how such inequities in risky substance use environments occur, the implications of such inequities for disparities in substance use disorders and treatment outcomes, and the implications for tobacco, alcohol, and drug policies and prevention and treatment programs.

AB  - The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present in-sights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win-win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands.

AB  - There are numerous indicators that Hispanics face a disproportionate risk of exposure to environmental hazards. Ambient air pollution, worker exposure to chemicals, indoor air pollution, and drinking water quality are among the top four threats to human health and are all areas in which indicators point to elevated risk for Hispanic populations. These data, juxtaposed with data on the health status of Hispanics, tell us that the environmental health status of Hispanics and their children is poor. At the same time. significant inadequacies in the collection of data on Hispanics make it difficult to make improving Hispanic environmental health status a priority. These inadequacies include the failure to use Hispanic identifiers in data collection and failure to collect sample sizes large enough to allow for breakouts of data by Hispanic subgroup. In addressing environmental justice issues, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) should prioritize improving the quantifiability of environmental exposures and risk based on race or ethnicity. However, improving data should not be the prerequisite to significant, affirmative steps by DHHS and U.S. EPA to address environmental and environmental health problems facing Hispanic communities. In particular, a health-based approach to environmental justice should be the priority.

AB  - The theme for the 2019 SSSP meetings is a call to sociologists and social scientists to draw on their sociological roots to illuminate the social in all social problems with an eye to solving those problems. The address encourages sociologists to speak as broadly as possible so that the discipline becomes a central voice in larger public discourses. The 2019 SSSP Presidential Address is a call to focus on what is the largest social problem: climate change. After a brief overview of the science of climate change, the address focuses on the anthropogenic causes of climate change and the reasons why climate change is a social justice issue. Looking specifically at rising sea levels, the address then focuses on New York City as an example of the effects of and some responses to climate change. The address concludes with a discussion of how sociologists can and should draw deeply on the discipline's theoretical roots, empirical tools, and pedagogical skills to illuminate climate change as a social problem.

AB  - Soils are evaluated as a diagnostic tool of environmental conditions that influence health. The samples for this study are urban topsoil (0-2.5 cm depth) samples (n = 4026) analyzed for Pb, Zn, and Cd by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The parent materials for New Orleans soils are derived from the Mississippi River, and alluvium from the Bonnet Carre Spillway (n = 31) serve as control samples for this study. The urban samples were stratified by census tract (n = 286). Blood Pb (BL) levels of children less than or equal to 6 years were also stratified by census tract and paired with soil Pb (SL) (n = 175). A significant association (P = 1.2 x 10(-23)) was found between median BL and median SL. The association was modeled by BL = 3.06 + 0.33 (SL)(0.5) (correlation coefficient = 0.69 between the modeled BL and the observed BL and P = 3.5 x 10(-22)). A median SL threshold (greater than or equal to 310 mu g g(-1) and <310 mu g g(-1)) for higher metal census tracts (HMCTs) and lower metal census tracts (LMCTs), respectively, represents median BL exposures above and below 9 mu g dL(-1). HMCTs and LMCTs were characterized by demographic and socioeconomic data. HMCTs are more likely (P = 4.5 x 10(-6)) inhabited by Blacks than by Whites. Of 13,803 children less than or equal to 6 years in HMCTs, 75% are Black and 22% are White, with other making up the remaining 3%. In LMCTs, the Black to White children ratio is 50:50. In HMCTs, socioeconomic indicators for Blacks are depressed compared to Whites. Zn and Cd are potentially phytotoxic in HMCTs. Children exhibit a steep rise in BL at SL < 100 mu g g(-1), and empirically, a safe SL for most children is around 80 mu g g(-1). SL is a useful diagnostic tool, and curtailing SL may complement primary Pb prevention for children. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - That climate change is a major disruptor of rural livelihoods in the low- and middle-income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa, has been a key narrative for the continent's development for at least a decade. And while the severity of climate impacts on African development should not be underestimated, in this paper I argue that the vulnerability of smallholders in Sao Tome and Principe should be considered in the broader political economic and historical context of progressing depeasantisation and proletarianisation of global agricultural labour. Moreover, I posit that certain smallholders' vulnerability can actually increase as a result of both autonomous and externally planned adaptation strategies, the latter most commonly promoted by governments and their international development partners. To substantiate these arguments, the paper combines theoretical insights from labour geography and critical adaptation studies with ethnographic data collected in Liberdade - a village in the small island nation of Sao Tome and Principe - which participated in a nationwide climate change adaptation project. I trace local smallholders' vulnerability back to the country's political economic history and complement this by an investigation of the changing labour relations at the community level. Here, I analyse the autonomous adaptation strategies pursued by the residents and critically assess the localised effects of planned adaptation embodied by the project, with a specific focus on how they affect local labour relations. I conclude by providing some reflections on addressing the current pitfalls of planned adaptation.

AB  - Smart grid systems are considered as key enablers in the transition to more sustainable energy systems. However, debates reflect concerns that they affect social and moral values such as privacy and justice. The energy justice framework has been proposed as a lens to evaluate social and moral aspects of changes in energy systems. This paper seeks to investigate this proposition for smart grid systems by exploring the public debates in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Findings show that smart grids have the potential to effectively address justice issues, for example by facilitating small-scale electricity generation and transparent and reliable billing. It is a matter of debate, however, whether current smart grid designs contribute to cost and energy savings, advance a more equitable and democratic energy system, or reinforce distributive and procedural injustices. The increased use of information and communication technology raises value conflicts on privacy and cyber security, which are related to energy justice. This research contributes by conceptualizing energy justice in the context of smart grids for the first time. The energy justice framework is broadened by including values and value conflicts that pertain directly to the increased use of information and communication technology. For policy makers and designers of smart grids, the paper provides guidance for considering interconnected social and moral values in the design of policies and smart grid technologies.

AB  - Social equity is an important normative construct in public administration. However, its operationalization is vague and it is empirically underutilized. This article combines political economy, social equity, and environmental justice literatures to explore the contentious issue of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas (commonly called "fracking"). Through interviews with local officials, we show that local officials are aware of equity issues, many take action to reduce inequities related to gas drilling, and equity is often at odds with private property rights. Finally, equity issues are more likely to be associated with inequitable distribution of costs and benefits than traditional distributional social equity.

AB  - The USD 12 billion steel project of POSCO in Odisha, India, conceived in 2005, was to be one of the largest investments in the country. But the project could not materialize, and in 2017 POSCO withdrew from the project after a lot of controversies. For this classic example of a lose-lose situation, the role of impact assessment (IA) has not been discussed adequately. Using a single case study method, this paper analyzes various dimensions of IA exercises conducted for the project. These IA exercises failed to notice the complex livelihood systems and potential dissent among the people of the area. Stakeholders' consultations were weak, IA reports did not highlight the negative impacts, and the potential loss of livelihoods was not noticed. Questions have also been raised on the legitimacy and authenticity of the claims made in these IA studies. However, the role of IA was also found be to be limited and the expectation from IA was also low. This negates the role of an ideal IA that should have been a comprehensive one and should have taken note of issues that are detrimental for the society, and particularly for the project.

AB  - The combined effects of two global trends, urbanization and climate change, have generated considerable concern regarding their adverse and disproportionate impacts on the health of urban populations. This study contributes to climate-justice research by determining whether elevated levels of urban heat, indicated by land surface temperature (LST), are distributed inequitably with respect to race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status in Pinellas County, Florida. Our study utilizes 2010 MODIS and Landsat medium-resolution, remotely sensed thermal data, census socio-demographic information, and both conventional and spatial statistical methods. Results indicate that LST is significantly greater in census tracts characterized by higher percentages of certain racial/ethnic minorities and higher poverty rates, even after controlling for contextual factors and the effects of spatial autocorrelation. This reveals the presence of a landscape of thermal inequity: uneven distribution of heat within the built urban environment and a community structure with varying vulnerability.

AB  - Sustainable development requires that the goals of economic development, environmental protection and social justice are considered collectively when formulating development strategies. In the context of planning sustainable transport systems, trade-offs between the economy and the environment, and between the economy and social justice have received considerable attention. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to environmental equity, the trade-off between environmental and social justice goals, a significant omission given the growing attention to environmental justice by policy makers in the EU and elsewhere. In many countries, considerable effort has been made to develop clean transport systems by using, for example, technical. economic and planning instruments. However, little effort has been made to understand the distributive and environmental justice implications of these measures. This paper investigates the relationship between urban air quality (as NO2) and social deprivation for the city of Leeds, UK. Through application of a series of linked dynamic models of traffic simulation and assignment, vehicle emission, and pollutant dispersion, the environmental equity implications of a series of urban transport strategies, including road user cordon and distance-based charging, road network development, and emission control are assessed. Results indicate a significant degree of environmental inequity exists in Leeds. Analysis of the transport strategies indicates that this inequity will be reduced through natural fleet renewal, and, perhaps contrary to expectations, road user charging is also capable of promoting environmental equity. The environmental equity response is, however, sensitive to road pricing scheme design. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 1979 partial nuclear reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island was simultaneously hyper-visible and hidden from public view. It was the subject of non-stop media attention, but its causes and consequences required expert explanation. No fire or explosion marked the moment when insensible radionuclides escaped the facility. Yet, residents recalled a variety of troubling sights, sounds, odors, tastes, and sensations. Public distrust percolated in the interstices between government assertions that little radiation had escaped the facility and residents' sense memories of the incident. This article traces intertwined networks of activists from Japan and Pennsylvania as they mobilized legally, politically, and scientifically to develop evidence about the offsite effects of Three Mile Island. Exploring the distinct cosmology of evidence that activists marshaled, the article shows how they placed the messy, contingent, dynamic living world at the center of inquiries about the meltdown's consequences. Activists developed new practices of biological witness that reconfigured the interplay between scientific, legal, and moral authority, while concurrently reformulating sufferers' subjectivities and notions of scientific objectivity. In the process, they suggested that environmental justice entailed epistemic justice. Their cosmology of evidence served as an argument and a material proof that the beloved but suffering living world, and the sciences used to understand it, could and should frame the governance of industrial society's invisible harms.

AB  - The world is too complex for humans to grasp. Frames and news values (or 'journalistic selection procedures') make it more intelligible, foregrounding salient elements. Giving shape to reality, both concepts cannot be separated from ideological interests, either. Previous research suggests, accordingly, that frames and newsworthiness take shape in mutual interaction. Yet, the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear as in-depth discursive research is lacking. Therefore, we have conducted a combined framing-news value analysis, drawing on a corpus of climate articles published in three mainstream and two alternative media outlets in Northern Belgium. This article discusses the relations among four selected news values and the ideologically coloured subframes of the Cycles of Nature and Environmental Justice frames. The presented schemata and exemplary analyses demonstrate the strong overlap between the salience-enhancing devices of subframes and news values. Also, they make tangible the ideological argumentations at the intersection of newsworthiness and framing, explicating the diverging realizations of news values in the context of various subframes. As such, this study lays bare some of the journalistic conventions which are often used in climate reporting to naturalize certain worldviews. Moreover, it contributes to the development of the Discursive News Values Analysis framework proposed by (Bednarek and Caple (2017). The Discourse of News Values.

AB  - The relationship between the pattern of pollutant releases and neighborhood characteristics has been in the center of environmental justice debates for the last decades. One part of the discourse revolves around the question if the siting decision of polluting firms or the sorting decision of households is the explanatory factor for the pattern of pollutant releases. The aim of this study is to contribute to the discussion by investigating the potential correlation between polluting facilities and socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods in Ontario, Canada, using data from the Canadian census and National Pollutant Release Inventory. The analysis shows that when the results are considered from the perspectives of the siting decision of firms and sorting decision of households' hypotheses, the results weigh in favor of the sorting decision of households.

AB  - The article reviews two decades of scholars' claims that exposures to pollution and other environmental risks are unequally distributed by race and class, examines case studies of environmental justice social movements and the history and politics of environmental justice policy making in the United States, and describes the emerging issue of global climate justice. The authors engage the contentious literature on how to quantitatively measure and document environmental injustice, especially the complex problems of having data of very different types and areas (such as zip codes, census tracts, or concentric circles) around polluting facilities or exposed populations. Also considered is the value of perspectives from critical race theory and ethnic studies for making sense of these social phenomena. The article concludes with a discussion of the globalization of the environmental justice movement, discourse, and issues, as well as with some policy implications of finding and understanding environmental justice. One unique feature of this review is its breadth and diversity, given the different approaches taken by the three coauthors.

AB  - Standard regression analyses are often plagued with problems encountered when one tries to make inference going beyond main effects, using datasets that contain dozens of variables that are potentially correlated. This situation arises, for example, in environmental deprivation studies, where a large number of deprivation scores are used as covariates, yielding a potentially unwieldy set of interrelated data from which teasing out the joint effect of multiple deprivation indices is difficult. We propose a method, based on Dirichlet-process mixture models that addresses these problems by using, as its basic unit of inference, a profile formed from a sequence of continuous deprivation measures. These deprivation profiles are clustered into groups and associated via a regression model to an air pollution outcome. The Bayesian clustering aspect of the proposed modeling framework has a number of advantages over traditional clustering approaches in that it allows the number of groups to vary, uncovers clusters and examines their association with an outcome of interest and fits the model as a unit, allowing a region's outcome potentially to influence cluster membership. The method is demonstrated with an analysis UK Indices of Deprivation and PM10 exposure measures corresponding to super output areas (SOA's) in greater London.

AB  - The scope of empirical environmental justice (EJ) research has expanded beyond hazards exposure to scrutinize social inequities in access to amenities, but no prior study has examined the EJ implications of public beach access. Furthermore, quantitative research on white privilege is very scarce. To address these knowledge gaps, our study examines racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in access to public beaches in the Miami metropolitan statistical area, Florida. Public beach accessibility is modeled with an innovative geospatial approach that involves population weighted distances to beach access sites. To assess EJ implications of public beach access for various racial/ethnic and socioeconomically vulnerable groups, spatial regression models are estimated using census tract-level data. Results indicate that beaches are more accessible to neighborhoods with a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Whites, while neighborhoods with higher percentages of Hispanics and socioeconomically disadvantaged residents have limited access. This study demonstrates the importance of assessing white privilege and access to environmental amenities in EJ research to better understand social inequities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Risk scenarios are caused by the convergence of a hazard with a potentially affected system in a specific place and time. One urban planning goal is to prevent environmental hazards, such as those generated by chemical accidents, from reaching human settlements, as they can cause public health issues. However, in many developing countries, due to their strategic positioning in global value chains, the quick and easy access to labor pools, and competitive production costs, urban sprawls have engulfed industrial areas, exposing residential conurbations to environmental hazards. This case study analyzes the spatial configuration of accidental chemical risk scenarios in three major Mexican metropolitan areas: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Spatial analyses use an areal locations of hazardous atmosphere (ALOHA) dispersion model to represent the spatial effects of high-risk industrial activities in conurbations and the potentially affected populations vulnerable to chemical hazards. Complementary geostatistical correlation analyses use population data, marginalization indexes, and industrial clustering sectors to identify trends that can lead to comprehensive environmental justice approaches. In addition, the marginalization degree of inhabitants evaluates social inequalities concerning chemical risk scenarios.

AB  - The concept of environmental justice (EJ) has recently gained currency, both as a factor for and a goal of sustainable development. Its implementation in practice implies establishing current environmental injustice patterns and analysing planning policies, with the aim to reduce socio-demographic inequalities in the negative environmental impact borne by different population groups. This paper proposes a method to assess differential exposure to excessive pollution levels by socio-demographic groups in intra-urban spaces. The approach developed in this paper is based upon GIS and quantitative spatial analysis techniques. It incorporates the idea of an 'environmental justice weighting scale' for policy-making, using normative pollution thresholds to measure inequalities more objectively and consistently. Spain's two largest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, have been chosen as case-studies, taking nitrogen dioxide as the pollutant, and the geographic distribution of six vulnerable population groups (children, elderly people and international immigrants) in the year 2010. The results reveal that a large part of these groups suffer exposure to air pollution exceeding the maximum permitted levels disproportionately, which would imply a case of environmental injustice.

AB  - There is growing interest in links between poor health and socio-environmental inequalities (e.g. inferior housing, crime and industrial emissions) under the environmental justice agenda. The current project assessed associations between soil metal content, air pollution (NO2/PM10) and deprivation and health (respiratory case incidence) across Glasgow. This is the first time that both chemical land quality and air pollution have been assessed citywide in the context of deprivation and health for a major UK conurbation. Based on the dataset 'averages' for intermediate geography areas, generalised linear modelling of respiratory cases showed significant associations with overall soil metal concentration (p = 0.0367) and with deprivation (p < 0.0448). Of the individual soil metals, only nickel showed a significant relationship with respiratory cases (p = 0.0056). Whilst these associations could simply represent concordant lower soil metal concentrations and fewer respiratory cases in the rural versus the urban environment, they are interesting given (1) possible contributions from soil to air particulate loading and (2) known associations between airborne metals like nickel and health. This study also demonstrated a statistically significant correlation (-0.213; p < 0.05) between soil metal concentration and deprivation across Glasgow. This highlights the fact that despite numerous regeneration programmes, the legacy of environmental pollution remains in post-industrial areas of Glasgow many decades after heavy industry has declined. Further epidemiological investigations would be required to determine whether there are any causal links between soil quality and population health/well-being. However, the results of this study suggest that poor soil quality warrants greater consideration in future health and socio-environmental inequality assessments.

AB  - The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 defines Appalachia as a region of the eastern United States that historically has relied on mining and other extractive industries. A major purpose of this Act was to decrease economic ineqities in more than 400 countries in thirteen states. These counties have contributed to national prosperity but have not reaped the benefits of this contribution. As part of Appalachia, southeastern Ohio posts the highest poverty levels in the state. Combined with this poverty are numerous environmental problems that expose area residents to environmental health hazards. There is a relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and environmental conditions that leads to both positive and negative health outcomes. This paper discusses "environmental justice" and "health disparities" are explored. Several case studies are presented, including a case of perfluorooctanoic acid (C8) exposure, a case involving the siting of a medical waste incinerator, and a case in which an entire community was purchased by a major power company because of uncontrollable emissions. All of the cases set precedents that may lead to improvements in our understanding of the political, social, and environmental factors that lead to health disparities in poor rural populations worldwide.

AB  - The relationship between consumption and deprivation has been explored at various scales in the literature. It would be expected that increased deprivation leads to less consumption and vice versa. However, what is the form of that relationship? Evidence from international studies using the Human Development Index (HDI) and Ecological Footprint (EF) for nation states suggest that the relationship is curved such that an increase in HDI (decrease in deprivation) is linearly associated with an increase in EF (consumption and impact on the environment) up to a point but beyond that there can be widely different values for the EF for the same value of HDI. Given that deprivation and consumption within a single country can be expected to be more homogenous than that observed between countries does this result in a linear relationship between the two variables? We tested the relationship between the Townsend Index of Deprivation (TID) and EF for English regions, using fine scale data as derived from the UK Census and the Stockholm Environment Institute respectively. The results suggest that the relationship between the EF and deprivation for most English regions is markedly linear; with the level of deprivation declining with increasing EF. The picture is remarkably consistent across most of the regions and the only region where this simple picture becomes distorted is London. The paper discusses the relevance of this finding and implications for future research.

AB  - The transition towards renewable energy is likely to be uneven across social and spatial dimensions. To ensure this transition is equitable and just, energy injustice has become the key framework for analyzing and interpreting the distribution of energy infrastructure. Wind energy development has experienced a significant gap between broad public support for increased development but persistent localized opposition to proposed projects, indicating that wind represents a locally unwanted land use. We present the theoretical argument that although the negative impacts of wind energy infrastructure are less extreme than those posed by other, more toxic, unwanted land uses, their status as a locally unwanted land use will produce similar distributional injustices as have been found throughout the environmental injustice literature. Using data from both the American Community Survey, the U.S. Wind Turbine Database, and the National Renewable Energy Lab we use logistic and Poisson regressions, fixed effects, and temporal lags to evaluate the current landscape of wind energy injustice along the social dimensions of income, race and ethnicity, age, education, labor force participation, and rurality at three spatial scales: between all counties within the contiguous United States, between counties within states with wind energy, and between census tracts within counties with wind energy. We do not find strong evidence of distributional injustice along the lines of race, ethnicity, or low-income. However, we do find evidence of injustice for populations which are younger, less educated, have lower labor force participation, and are more rural.

AB  - There is a tendency by scholars arguing for a more just and sustainable future to position the "ecological crisis" as a fundamental reason for major educational reforms. Relying on crisis-talk to fuel social and environmental justice and environmentalism reinforces the thinking of the past, which inadvertently perpetuates the acceptance of present cultural attitudes which frame our relationships with others and the natural world. To evaluate previous cultural thinking and associated traditions of Euro-West society, Chet Bowers asserts that we ought to analyze how assumptions are carried forward as metaphors, which are associated with attitudes towards science, technology, and nature. This pedagogy is called ecojustice education and serves to conserve and sustain cultural diversity and the biodiversity of Earth's ecosystems, which are threatened and vulnerable. But, also carried forward in the language of ecojustice philosophy (and other ecological works) is a presumption that feeds into scientifically proving that a crisis exists, which is associated with organizing schools around an implicit shock doctrine of fear and urgency. This paper explores these assumptions and others associated with a supposition of ecological crisis. The ecological crisis has the potential to marginalize many diverse people who are needed during these times of increasing ecological awareness and uncertainties. Situating education (and the world) in the frenzy associated with crisis, versus the assertion that schools should increase awareness around the belief that a more sustainable lifestyle is beneficial for the individual, the community and the environment is a worthwhile debate and is rich with respect to research opportunities in education.

AB  - The concept of gentrification, which has recently been expanded beyond residential displacement to address issues of equitable access to public spaces, is deemed an environmental justice issue. Environmental gentrification presents a new threat to economically vulnerable areas looking to add parks, recreation, or green space to their neighborhoods because gentrification may attract newcomers who displace existing residents from public spaces as well as from housing. Consequently, park, recreation, and leisure scholars should study this phenomenon. A systematic review was conducted to assess current knowledge regarding relationships among gentrification and park, recreation, and leisure spaces. A search of three databases uncovered 27 articles. Little leisure scholarship was found, representing an opportunity for leisure scholars to promote environmental justice. Six themes derived from the articles described how policy can negatively impact residents, how strategies can prevent gentrification, and how research methods to study gentrification can impact how results are interpreted.

AB  - The ability of urban parks and public spaces to address distrust and social isolation needs to be rigorously tested, as the predominance of such claims may crowd out discussions of environmental racism and structural inequality. This study tested some commonly stated claims about parks' influence on social well-being using a survey of residents in St. Louis, Missouri. We tested relationships between park and public space visitation frequency, positive and negative social contact with people of other races/ethnicities, and trust, using structural equation modeling. The model had strong fit but had few significant paths, indicating assertions are not fully supported by our data. Recommendations for urban park planners, managers, and community advocates include improving the design and planning process to accommodate diverse users, as well as modifying their discourse to reflect the growing need for social equity.

AB  - The transition to renewable energy generates significant conflicts over time when technical innovations allowing larger wind turbine construction coincides with spatial regimentation as energy governance. The interplay of space, time and money, we argue, is crucial for understanding these conflicts. Wind energy's spatial advantage of potential social co-existence of energy generation and farming gets eaten up by differently constituted chronoscapes and regional planning, resulting in local perception of renewable energy as a threat and encroachment and experts working against a renewable energy transition. Drawing on the example of Brandenburg in East Germany, we demonstrate that financial means is next to space and time the third utmost relevant factor for local attitudes towards renewable energy.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to critically analyse so-called 'successful' low-carbon energy transitions under the energy justice magnifying glass. We focus on two case studies that have been arguably referred to as successful local energy transitions in the literature: Samso (Denmark) and Feldheim (Germany). The study examines community perspectives and causal inferences about perceived energy (in)justice during the transition to a low-carbon local energy system. Theories of justice and process tracing form the core of our methodological approach. We identify and examine evidence in relation to four main areas: consultation processes, information flow/sharing, decision making and outcomes. The findings reveal that the transition processes were triggered by a multi-dimensional crisis in a unique context, and highlight the role of procedural justice in the investigated areas. Multiple tensions and conflicts were identified (notably concerning the location and ownership of wind turbines). However, and strongly driven by local, bottom-up, intensive information and consultation processes, evidence of perceived procedural Justice was found in both cases. With regard to distributive justice, communities perceived the outcomes of the transition as beneficial to some groups, particularly from the point of view of benefits for individuals. Perceived energy justice was more positive if social and environmental outcomes were considered, including the implementation of compensation schemes. However, a quantitative analysis is required to qualify these assertions. With due limitations, we conclude that the perceived fairness of procedures, as identified in both cases, seemed to be a critical pre-condition for the perceived legitimacy of outcomes.

AB  - The concept of just transition has emerged as an important governance framework guiding sectors transitioning from unsustainable to sustainable practices and is most dominant in debates on the energy transition. This research, in contrast, explores if and how this framework can make sense of the challenges facing Irish beef farming. The sector is transforming in response to an intersecting range of social, environmental, and market pressures. Beef farmers are at the centre of this, yet little research has been conducted gathering their perspectives on the changing state of their livelihoods and their concerns for the future. Here, we use a novel methodological approach, drawing on the concept of framing as a strategic communication device to explore the perspectives of key actors in this sector and a multi-dimensional environmental justice framework to identify the elements of (in)justice present within frames. This novel just transition frames and functions model exposes how misalignment between powerful key actors, concerned with distributional matters, and beef farmers, concerned with declining social status, shifting identities, and under-representation is found to be contributing to conflict. We show how the application of this model can inform pathways to just and sustainable futures.

AB  - The state of Kerala in India is known for its active civil society and the massive decentralization campaign launched in 1996. However marginalization of tribal communities hampers the state's decentralized environmental management strategies. The proposed construction of a dam along the Chalakkudy River will displace two colonies of the Kadar tribe in Chalakkudy and Athirapilly towns, destroy habitats of local wildlife and devastate unique riverine vegetation endemic to the region. This brings to light issues of social and environmental justice as well as a wider responsibility to protect and preserve unique flora and fauna. The state's decentralization strategies, as they relate to tribal communities, lack consideration of local power distribution and cultural conditioning. This raises questions about the state's role in social justice as well as biodiversity conservation. In 2010 and 2011, the author's interviews in Chalakkudy and Athirapilly towns reveal that tribal communities perceive that their place in society restricts their contribution regarding natural resource management and use. The paper suggests that unless the culture of planning and decision making in the state are changed, decentralized strategies will be ineffective, resulting in a predominately top-down approach towards natural resource management, and will negate Kerala's goal of democratic decentralization.

The structure of the paper is threefold: (1) in the introductory section I briefly explain the meaning of the concept and how it relates to other similar concepts such as public-private partnerships or growth coalitions; (2) the second part focuses on analyzing the characteristics for the structuring or restructuring of traditional local and regional political entities; (3) the last section focuses on how planners and other public officials could use or partner with business coalitions in order to advance their own regional agenda. In the conclusion section I argue that though business coalitions are important for the development of a regional economy and regional identity, it would be a mistake to think that they alone can determine the success of a region. Regional government should continue to be pursued as it represents the only solution to problems such as social and environmental justice, tax sharing, education, and inner city redevelopment.

AB  - Sustainable development (SD) is a controversial concept informed by conflictual narratives which reshape the way we envision the earth, the sea and the stars. Its integration in international policies and national strategy plans for development influences the ways we now know the past, our understanding of the present, and our paths to the future. It influences our lives through policies that regulate daily practices, such as the European Common Fisheries Policy which focuses its strategies for SD in trade and education. However, the problems faced by the ocean require understanding sustainable marine ecosystems through the complex interactions between ecological, social, economic, and political dimensions. Analysing the intersection of those dimensions, while respecting peoples' voices, allowed us to identify how policies and regulations for SD fail, and opened spaces for an emancipatory reflexive research on SD: responsible, accountable and transformative. This approach inevitably raised questions of environmental justice that challenged us to look critically at research and education norms for SD, as well as question how the deficit-model of research is built on the assumption that the failures of SD are due to lack of knowledge. In this chapter we bring together research experience on education and research practices, overlapping our reflexive and educational practices, with the Azores archipelago in Portugal as our background, in order to explore other possibilities. With the help of Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed, we explore the potential of multi-directional learning via aesthetic practices and action-based research to enable narrative inquiry to engage people in research, and SD policy development that are environmentally just and sustainable.

AB  - Since its initial introduction in the 1970s, the field of environmental justice (EJ) continues to grow, with significant contributions from the disciplines of sustainability science, geography, political science, public policy and administration, urban planning, law, and many others. Each of these disciplines approach EJ research from slightly different perspectives, but all offer unique and valuable insight to the EJ knowledge domain. Although the interdisciplinary nature of environmental justice should be viewed as a strength, it presents a challenge when attempting to both summarize and synthesize key contributions to the field, due to disciplinary bias, narrow subfield foci, or gaps in knowledge by a research team without a representative disciplinary composition. The purpose of this paper is to provide a succinct, panoptic review of key research contributions to environmental justice, while simultaneously minimizing common problems associated with traditional reviews. In particular, this paper explores the utility of co-citation network analysis, to provide insight into the most important subdomains of environmental justice research. The results suggest that while early EJ research is initially focused on environmental disamenities and a continued focus on race and inequality, the research gradually shifts to foci more concerned with environmental amenities, such as parks and greenspace. We also find that race and inequality remain an important and consist line of research over the duration of the study time period. Implications for environmental justice research and its allied subfields are discussed.

AB  - The availability of demographic information from census data has enabled the development of indices that describe the relative social vulnerability of populations at different locations. These indices are often used in conjunction with models of physical exposure to environmental hazards, such as flooding and hazardous waste emission, to identify populations at greatest risk. However, using standard census areal units to calculate social vulnerability can lead to significant underestimation of vulnerable populations as environmental hazards typically occur on a finer spatial scale than census units such as block groups. This paper describes and illustrates a hybrid method for creating a social vulnerability index (SVI) at a tax parcel level by utilizing supplementary information about tax parcels to link cadastral dasymetric mapping techniques and established social vulnerability indexing methods. This high resolution social vulnerability index may be used for planning at the municipal level to address existing or potential environmental justice issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of climate change lead to increasing social injustice and hence justice is intrinsically linked to a socio-ecological transformation. In this study, we investigate whether justice sensitivity motivates pro-environmental intention (PEI) and behavior (PEB) and, if so, to what extent emotions and moral disengagement determine this process. For this purpose, we conducted two quota-sampling surveys (Study 1: N = 174, Study 2: N = 880). Multiple regression analyses in both studies suggest that a higher perception of injustice from a perpetrator's, beneficiary's, and observer's perspective is associated with an increased PEI. However, moral disengagement best predicted PEB and PEI. Guilt and authentic pride were found to be emotional predictors of PEI. Additionally, mediation analyses demonstrated that guilt mediates the connection between both perpetrator and beneficiary sensitivity and PEI. These results suggest that when the predominant originators of climate change (i.e., individuals from industrialized countries) perceive global climate injustice from the perspective of a beneficiary or a perpetrator, they experience guilt and have a higher PEI. Based on this mechanism, it seems promising to render global injustice more salient to those responsible for activities that lead to climate change to motivate them to adapt their behavior. The role of moral disengagement and victim sensitivity as barriers to pro-environmental behavior is discussed in this context.

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect remains a major threat to society as cities densify and sprawl. Urban greening through local to landscape management is a proposed strategy to combat UHI and improve environmental justice in city neighborhoods. For example, urban community gardens are multifunctional green spaces that play an important role for biodiversity and for civic engagement. But the role of urban gardens in urban cooling and relieving UHI remain unclear, specifically how temperatures fluctuate within gardens in relation to garden management factors and city landscape context, and how this relates to urban heat in city neighborhoods. We investigated diurnal and nocturnal temperature ranges, and daily maximum and minimum temperatures in 18 urban gardens over the peak of the summer agricultural growing season. We then analyzed how temperatures were correlated to local land cover factors within the garden, to surrounding landscape imperviousness at various spatial scales, and to environmental justice indicators (stressors) of garden neighborhoods. We found that nocturnal temperature range is negatively correlated to landscape imperviousness, and that the relationship decreases in strength with increasing spatial scale. This result supports the importance of evapotranspiration processes of surrounding green areas for nocturnal cooling. Some local land cover factors were important for temperatures, indicating heating or cooling management mechanisms from within urban gardens. Finally, the mean number of environmental stressors in neighborhoods negatively related to temperature variation. The results of this work can inform resource use and crop selection in urban agriculture, as well as how temperature-related ecosystem services of gardens relate to environmental justice of city neighborhoods.

AB  - The aim of this editorial is to explore, conceptualize, and research the need to internalize both animals and ecosystems in our understanding of social citizenship and social policy. This editorial should be seen as a brief overview of the themes that should be covered in the contributions to the Special Issue, "Internalizing Animals and Ecosystems in Social Citizenship and Social Policy: From Political Community to Political Country". This Special Issue argues the importance of integrating animals and ecosystems as a way to re-politicize humans' social relation with both animals and our ecosystem as in sustainable development and social policy. If environmental policy becomes social policy, we would re-construct social citizenship to include consideration for animals and ecosystems as integral part of social policy. This expansion in scope is a progression from seeing humans as part of a political community to becoming more involved in their political country. This aligns with the concept of Country-an all-encompassing term in Australia, involving a people's territory, land, water, biological resources, the complex obligations and relationships involved.

AB  - Socio-environmental vulnerable populations are often unrepresented in land-use planning yet have great potential for loss when exposed to changes in ecosystem services. Administrative boundaries, cultural differences, and language barriers increase the disassociation between land-use management and marginalized populations living in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. This paper describes the development of a Modified Socio-Environmental Vulnerability Index (M-SEVI), using determinants from binational census and neighborhood data that describe levels of education, access to resources, migratory status, housing, and number of dependents, to provide a simplified snapshot of the region's populace that can be used in binational planning efforts. We apply this index at the SCW, located on the border between Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico. For comparison, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool is concurrently applied to assess the provision of erosion- and flood control services over a 9-year period. We describe how this coupling of data can form the base for an ecosystem services assessment across political boundaries that can be used by land-use planners. Results reveal potential disparities in environmental risks and burdens throughout the binational watershed in residential districts surrounding and between urban centers. The M-SEVI can be used as an important first step in addressing environmental justice for binational decision-making. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tanure Ojaide and Niyi Osundare are among the foremost politically committed Nigerian poets at present The overriding concern in virtually all their literary works is commenting on the politics of the season. In Osundare's words, poetry is "man meaning to man." For Ojaide, a creative writer is not "an airplant" that is not situated in a place. Both writers envision literature should have political message. Thus, in Osundare's collection The Eye of the Earth (1986) and Tanure Ojaide's Delta Blues & Home Songs (1998) the major aesthetic focus is eco-poetry, which interrogates the politics behind oil exploration in Nigeria as well as its consequences on our environment Both writers refract this with what Osundare calls "semantics of terrestiality": i.e. poetry for the earth. Leo-poetry deals with environmental politics and ecological implications of humankind's activities on the planet. Armed with this poetic commitment, both writers unearth commodification of socio-economic relations, environmental/ecological dissonance, leadership malaise and endangered Nigerian environment mediated through (global) capitalism. Both writers maintain that eco-poetry is a platform for upturning environmental justice; and for decrying man's unbridled materialist pursuits. Thus, the preoccupation of this paper is to explore how both poetry collections: The Eye of the Earth and Delta Blues & Home Song interrogate the despicable state of Nigeria's environment as a consequence of global capitalism.

AB  - The past two decades have witnessed a rapid proliferation of community-based participatory research (CBPR) projects. CBPR methodology presents an alternative to traditional population-based biomedical research practices by encouraging active and equal partnerships between community members and academic investigators. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the premier biomedical research facility for environmental health, is a leader in promoting the use of CBPR in instances where community-university partnerships serve to advance our understanding of environmentally related disease. In this article, the authors highlight six key principles of CBPR and describe how these principles are met within specific NIEHS-supported research investigations. These projects demonstrate that community-based participatory research can be an effective tool, to enhance our knowledge of the causes and mechanisms of disorders having an environmental etiology, reduce adverse health outcomes through innovative intervention strategies and policy change, and address the environmental health concerns of community residents.

AB  - The effects of both ambient air pollution and socioeconomic position (SEP) on health are well documented. A limited number of recent studies suggest that SEP may itself play a role in the epidemiology of disease and death associated with exposure to air pollution. Together with evidence that poor and working-class communities are often more exposed to air pollution, these studies have stimulated discussion among scientists, policy makers, and the public about the differential distribution of the health impacts from air pollution. Science and public policy would benefit from additional research that integrates the theory and practice from both air pollution and social epidemiologies to gain a better understanding of this issue. In this article we aim to promote such research by introducing readers to methodologic and conceptual approaches in the fields of air pollution and social epidemiology; by proposing theories and hypotheses about how air pollution and socioeconomic factors may interact to influence health, drawing on studies conducted worldwide; by discussing methodologic issues in the design and analysis of studies to determine whether health effects of exposure to ambient air pollution are modified by SEP; and by proposing specific steps that will advance knowledge in this field, fill information gaps, and apply research results to improve public health in collaboration with affected communities.

AB  - The article explores framing of the siting process of a deep geological repository of nuclear waste in the Czech Republic by the municipalities' representatives in the pre-selected localities. Three distinguished frames have been reconstructed. The risk frame, which connects the project with a number of predominantly environmental threats, is counter-balanced by the responsibility frame that uses the 'Not-In-My-Back-Yard' label to delegitimize the local opposition. The third frame then portrays the siting process as a display of general distrust towards political elites and state institutions. It is argued that the distinguished frames stem from a deeper ideological conflict about the nature of democratic governance and the value attributed to environment, further stressing the importance of a siting process' institutional arrangement that goes beyond technocratic solutions.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe the approaches and recruitment strategies of a study focused on the impact of coal fly ash on neurobehavioral performance among children living in proximity to coal-burning power plants. Challenges encountered with each recruitment approach are highlighted as well as solutions used to overcome those challenges and ultimately enroll children and one of their parents or guardians. To ensure participants were distributed throughout the study area, geographical information systems were used to guide recruitment and achieve the target sample size (N = 300). Several approaches were employed to recruit the number of needed participants, including "shoe leather" or door-to-door recruitment, placement of flyers and brochures in public spaces, mailings to targeted addresses, media announcements, and local government outreach. Since September 2015, 265 participants have been enrolled in the study using a combination of the described recruitment approaches. Even with a well-designed plan, it is important to re-examine strategies at every step to maximize recruitment efforts. Researcher flexibility in adapting to new strategies is vital in facilitating recruitment efforts, and the recruitment of participants in the study remains a dynamic and evolving process.

AB  - The United States and the Canadian province of Ontario have enacted endangered species laws that regulate private land. The rationale for this is that the vast majority of endangered species in the two countries rely on private lands for survival. However, from a landowner perspective the law is deemed unfair. This paper presents analysis from 141 interviews with landowners in three U.S. states and Ontario. In recognition of distributive justice claims, both the U.S. government and the Ontario government have enacted programs aimed at increasing financial incentives for participation and compliance with the law. However, the law is still perceived as unfair. The central argument of this paper is that future amendments and new policies for endangered species should confront two other forms of environmental justice: procedural justice and justice-as-recognition. Landowners in both countries expressed not only concerns about compensation, but also a deep desire to be included in the protection and recovery process, as well as to be recognized by government and society as good stewards of the land. The paper concludes by stating that future policy amendments need to address justice-as-recognition if endangered species conservation on private lands is to be considered fair by landowners.

AB  - The rapid growth of human population and associated industrialisation creates strains on resources and climate. One way to understand the impact of human activity is to quantify the total environmental pressures by measuring the 'footprint'. Footprints account for the total direct and/or indirect effects of a product or a consumption activity, which may be related to e.g. carbon, water or land use, and can be seen as a proxy for environmental responsibility. Footprints shape climate and resource debates, especially concerning environmental strategies. However, in general, footprints hold a dichotomous producer-consumer perspective that is not unanimously accepted. In addition, the current footprinting system transmits a simplistic message about environmental responsibility that taints the justice debate and jeopardises the validity of policies based on them. Consequently, it is crucial to question who is (and should be) accountable for adverse environmental effects. It is also critical to investigate how the methodological characteristics of footprints shape and affect the efficacy of policies on climate and natural resources. This article examines these challenges, focusing on negative justice and policy implications resulting from assigning environmental responsibility to a sole agent. The article proposes, and morally justifies, the development of a footprinting method that includes justice parameters in an attempt to render fair results that are more meaningful for environmental action. The second objective is to establish the potential of this new framework to promote environmental responsibility and justice while facilitating policymaking. The suggested justice elements aim at turning footprints into a concrete environmental policy instrument framed under the value of environmental fairness.

AB  - The 20 years since geography's 'moral turn' have generated a robust field of scholarship around diverse ethical engagements. However, as geographers continue to build articulate claims to care and justice in and beyond the academy, the role of 'the moral' has often been resigned to the margins of our theories and empirical work. In my third and final progress report on geography and ethics, I suggest that new approaches toward moral geographies and economies are already signaling directions for geography's next moral turn. Some of these approaches use more traditional theoretical and empirical options to explain and raise challenges for confronting harmful moral projects endorsed by states. But other more critical and controversial shifts are also evident in the speculative ethics of post-humanism which destabilize and reassemble what we think we know about moral status and moral agency.

AB  - Sustainability and sustainable development are political and essentially contested social phenomena. Despite this ambiguity, they continue to hold a central position as apolitical concepts in much of social science and policy making. In Europe, public procurement is increasingly used as a tool to reach sustainability, a fact that actualizes an inherent tension between politically charged objectives on the one hand, and technological processes and market logics on the other. Therefore, in this article, we investigate this tension by studying policies relating to sustainable public procurement of the built environment in the EU. We argue that governing any policy domain entails the construction and representation of particular policy problems. Hence, we focus on how the 'problems' of sustainable public procurement are represented in EU policy guidance and best practice documents. Our analysis shows that these central policy documents are dominated by a problem representation where unsustainability is constructed as technical design flaws and market failure. This has the primary effect that it renders sustainable development as, primarily, a technical issue, and beyond politics. Therefore, we conclude that current policy reproduces 'weak' forms of sustainable development, where the practice is depoliticized and premised upon continued growth and innovation.

AB  - The question whether a single extreme climate event, such as a hurricane or heatwave, can be attributed to human induced climate change has become a vibrant field of research and discussion in recent years. Proponents of the most common approach (probabilistic event attribution) argue for using single event attribution for advancing climate policy, not least in the context of loss and damages, while critics are raising concerns about inductive risks which may result in misguided policies. Here, we present six ethical predicaments, rooted in epistemic choices of single event attribution for policy making, with a focus on problems related to loss and damage. Our results show that probabilistic event attribution is particularly sensitive to these predicaments, rendering the choice of method value laden and hence political. Our review shows how the putatively apolitical approach becomes political and deeply problematic from a climate justice perspective. We also suggest that extreme event attribution (EEA) is becoming more and more irrelevant for projecting loss and damages as socio-ecological systems are increasingly destabilized by climate change. We conclude by suggesting a more causality driven approach for understanding loss and damage, that is, less prone to the ethical predicaments of EEA.

AB  - The socio-economic inferiority of the Arab minority compared to the Jewish majority and the unequal distribution of resources between Jewish and Arab towns in Israel are well known facts. However, so far there has been no evidence establishing whether unequal resource allocation also occurs within mixed Jewish-Arab cities. Based on high-resolution sociodemographic and infrastructure data, this paper examines the access that populations of differing socio-economic levels and ethnic identity have to green spaces in the mixed Jewish-Arab cities of Ramla and Lod. Results show that the Arab minority in these cities has much less access to green spaces than the Jewish majority. The findings produced in this study can serve as a basis for public debates concerning injustice in the distribution of urban services and help urban planners achieve a more balanced and fair allocation. It can also serve as a powerful tool for empowering minorities, social organisations and NGOs and motivating them to act against spatial inequality and social discrimination.

AB  - The potential for developing the participatory dimensions of the Ecosystem Approach are examined through the work of Habermas to guide the design of Deliberative Democratic Monetary Valuation (DDMV) and elicit social willingness to pay. DDMV is contrasted with Deliberated Preferences approaches, which are a deliberative adaptation of stated preference techniques and comprise almost all Deliberative Monetary Valuation studies so far. In a detailed case study where coastal and marine cultural ecosystem services were set within a broader societal context, DDMV was undertaken through three iterative workshops involving a single group of participants representing local residents and different interests across the public, private and third sectors. The use of DDMV generates insights into its potential for securing a socially sustainable route to environmental management: sustainable development that brings together values for ecosystem services with other social priorities, is more inclusive of diverse user needs and values, and is sensitive to issues of environmental justice. As well as highlighting the benefits and challenges that a more democratic deliberative valuation presents, we highlight the practical strengths and vulnerabilities of this approach and indicate directions for further methodological evolution of DDMV.

AB  - The WHO has advocated monitoring adherence to the Food and Agriculture Organization's Code of Conduct to reduce use of highly hazardous pesticides in lower and middle income Countries. We re-framed Code articles in terms of farmers' rights and drew on survey data, farmer focus group results, and direct observations of agrochemical stores in Ecuador and Peru to construct indicators reflecting respect for such rights. Use of highly (Ia and Ib) and moderately (II) hazardous pesticides was common. Worse indicators were observed in places with lower education, greater poverty, and more use of indigenous languages. Limited government enforcement capacity, social irresponsibility of the pesticide industry, and lack of farmers' knowledge of the Code were all factors impeding respect for farmers' rights. Addressing the power imbalance among social actors requires informed farmer and farmworker participation in monitoring adherence and active involvement of non-governmental organizations and municipal governments.

AB  - Shrinking cities are places characterized by long-term population decline, property abandonment, social inequality, and environmental degradation. Urban scholarship, however, has not yet addressed the challenges of promoting social and environmental justice in shrinking cities. Focusing on Kitakyushu City, Japan, this article explores the manner in which grassroots movements can push forward environmental justice and how that can lead to policies coping with urban shrinkage and environmental degradation. Kitakyushu City was Japan's major iron and steel center during the rapid industrialization years, which culminated in severe environmental degradation. The need for environmental justice pushed grassroots movements and, in particular, women's associations to initiate different campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the city's environmental hazards and to trigger governmental response. Since then, environmental policies are driving Kitakyushu City's fight against the negative consequences that shrinkage brings about in Japanese cities. Using case study methodology and critically assessing the implemented policies, this article argues that seeking environmental justice presents an opportunity to tackle long-term decline. Hence, the article explores the theoretical implications and empirical factors behind environmental justice as the basis for a new urban revitalization model.

AB  - The author examines geographies of environmental hazards in Accra, declared a Millennium City on 15 January 2010. With the aid of both primary and secondary data, it is shown how environmental governance has shifted under neoliberalism, and the author demonstrates how a review of Accra's waste disposal problems could elucidate how such paradigm shift has contributed to urban social injustice. Current practices are seen as a symptom of poor governance and the value of understanding intraurban differentials is interrogated. It is posited that the current representations as to who bears the brunt of any possible health-risk outcomes appear abstract, incomplete, and poorly understood. The author illustrates how ineffective and insufficiently attentive governance can exacerbate health risks facing the entire society, and suggests that addressing inequalities may be among the most effective interventions to ensure sustainable environmental management, improve health, and guarantee social cohesion in the urban space.

AB  - The article wishes to analyze the ethical foundations of claims for environmental justice. By doing so, it addresses the contested relation between equality and justice. The article also wishes to shed some light into the deep religious back- ground of egalitarian justice. Two sections deal with basic distinctions in theories of justice, as the 'equality of what?-debate and the problem of intrinsic value of equality. Three nonnative pillars of environmental justice are proposed: a) legal and political equality, h) sufficiency-thresholds, and c) obligations against victimization. These pillars are to be applied to environmental geographical topics, facing the problem of natural heterogeneities, unequal environmental endowments and economic structures. The article intends to provide the reader with conceptual ethical devices and, by doing so, to enable her making solid claims for environmental justice.

AB  - The theory of ecologically unequal exchange CEDE) posits that international trade is structurally organized in a manner that allows a net transfer of resources from peripheral developing to core industrialized countries. The consequence, it is argued, is under-development in the periphery and augmented productive capacity in the core. EUE thus challenges the neoliberal free-market argument that exchange at market prices is symmetric and fair. An LCA-based methodology for estimating EUE that holds constant the variable market price is introduced and tested on contemporary trade of Dutch cheese and Kenyan coffee and roses. Specifically, the exchange of embodied land, water, energy, global warming potential, and labor is assessed. The results confirm the theory's hypothesis. At a fixed market price, more embodied Kenyan resources are exchanged for less Dutch resources. However, Kenyan roses give different results from coffee. EUE between countries can only be conclusively determined by considering the total biophysical trade balance, but by calculating quantities of embodied resources per unit of exchange value, it is possible to detect unequal exchange even at the level of individual commodities. While integration of biophysical metrics alongside monetary valuation is recommended, ultimately, rethinking the structure, policies and politics of international trade is necessary.

AB  - The Drinking Water Tool (DWT) is a community-driven online tool that provides diverse users with information about drinking water sources and threats to drinking water quality and access due to drought. Development of the DWT was guided by the Community Water Center (CWC) as part of the Water Equity Science Shop (WESS), a research partnership integrating elements of community-based participatory research and the European Science Shop model. The WESS engages in scientific projects that inform policy change, advance water justice, and reduce cumulative exposure and disproportionate health burdens among impacted communities in California. WESS researchers conducted qualitative analysis of 15 stakeholder interviews regarding the DWT, including iterative feedback and the stakeholder consultation process as well as stakeholder perceptions of the tool's impact on California water policy, organizing, and research. Results indicate that the DWT and the stakeholder engagement process which developed it were effective in influencing policy priorities and in promoting interagency coordination at multiple levels to address water equity challenges and their disproportionate burdens, particularly among rural and low socioeconomic status areas and communities of color.

AB  - There is a crisis in international human rights law. In a series of cases, the Supreme Court has drastically reduced the Alien Tort Statute's ("ATS") utility as a vehicle for transnational justice, effectively ending a remarkable four-decade string of human rights litigation under the statute. Since 1980, private plaintiffs have filed hundreds of ATS suits in federal courts seeking to hold a rogue's gallery of international despots, torturers, mass murderers, and their corporate accomplices accountable for violations of international law. But ATS suits proved controversial. The Court's hamstringing of the ATS was driven largely by concerns over assertions of extraterritorial jurisdiction by private parties that might embroil the United States in sensitive foreign policy disputes. As internationally minded social justice activists and scholars mourn the ATS's demise, they are avidly seeking a replacement. Many increasingly look to state law and state courts as a vehicle for transnational redress. Yet, state law is even more problematic than the ATS as a vehicle for asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction. There is a better option, at least for corporate misconduct, which accounts for the vast majority of the ATS suits. Long overlooked as a remedial tool for extraterritorial violations, section 337 unfair competition actions in the International Trade Commission ("ITC") are well-suited to hold corporations accountable for supply chain abuses. Under section 337 the ITC has the power to block the importation of goods produced abroad using a broad range of unfair methods and practices. Section 337 is also better positioned than state law remedies to withstand the criticisms that felled the ATS. Its use of in rem jurisdiction and focus on imports avoids the extraterritorial concerns raised by the ATS and other judicial remedies. In addition, the ITC offers an underappreciated hybrid model of private and public enforcement, which mitigates concerns that its decisions will undermine U.S. foreign policy. Expanded use of section 337 to address misconduct abroad may be particularly attractive to American policymakers in our current circumstances. A new presidential administration is struggling to address unfair trade practices that harm domestic industries and workers while avoiding the damaging economic fall-out from the Trump trade wars. The ITC presents a ready-made tool to level the playing field for American industries, helping our economy recover from the current economic crisis while advancing human rights and environmental justice.

AB  - Stakeholder engagement has been identified as an integral element of sustainable construction projects. While the outputs for stakeholder engagement are being defined, the inputs required to, for example, "respond quickly to community concerns and perceptions" are still very vague. Building upon a recent framework for social sustainability developed by Rodolfo Valdes-Vasquez and Leidy Klotz, this case study presents social sustainability process details of a residential education center. To inform the social sustainability framework, stakeholder interviews, organization documents, and social media posts were analyzed to collect details which determine the inputs, cost, and time required to execute social sustainability processes. This case study focuses on a project led by SustainabilityInc, a non-profit dedicated to improving their local economic, social, and natural environment. SustainabilityInc developed the Peggy's House project to be a model for sustainable living in environmental justice neighborhoods. Through active engagement methods, over 30 local partners collaborated on the Peggy's House project. Preliminary data has been collected, suggesting inputs, such as staff members focused on the community, can be leveraged to deliver thousands of dollars in value to a project. This paper outlines a process for developing case studies which can provide essential details about improving stakeholder engagement in construction projects.

AB  - The unequal exposure to industrial hazards via differential residential attainment and/or differential sitings of toxic facilities is a long-standing environmental justice issue. This study examines individual trajectories of residential exposure to the risk of industrial hazard over nearly two decades. Using a latent class growth analysis on longitudinal geocoded data merged with the neighborhood-level pollution measures, we discover large racial differences in trajectories of pollution exposure. A majority of individuals are exposed to above-average pollution levels at some point during the study period, but blacks are more likely than whites to experience persistent exposure to high pollution. These differences are only partially explained by racial differences in suburban neighborhood attainment, socioeconomic status, and the frequency of inter-neighborhood moves. Immobile blacks also saw their exposure increase.

AB  - The 'Circular Economy' has become a new buzzword in debates about sustainability. Circularity, however, is usually presented in terms of scientific and technological challenges that often neglect the socio-political aspects related to the transition towards more sustainable futures, such as participation, co-creation and social justice. We argue that the Circular Economy agenda might greatly benefit from the field of Responsible Innovation. This argument is at the centre of the EU funded project, 'A Just Transition to Circular Economy' (JUST2CE), which aspires to address the present shortcomings of Circular Economy literature and practices. JUST2CE aims at understanding, in a critical way, under which conditions a responsible, inclusive and socially just transition to a Circular Economy is possible and desirable, what technical, political and social factors can enable or hamper such transformation and how these aspects can contribute to the development of transitional policy measures.

AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration promises to educate society on the many ways ecological restoration projects can benefit humankind. One avenue of possibilities for restoration ecology lies with concerns of environmental justice. The concept of futuristic restoration, which posits a paradigm of ecological restoration that is future-oriented, aligns well with calls for policymakers to address the circumstances, processes, and systems within which environmental inequalities are typically produced. This article offers three policy arenas where futuristic restoration can be employed in order to further environmental justice goals: (1) Land conservation prioritization; (2) Urban development plans; and (3) Mine remediation projects. The temporal dimension of sustainability and how it pertains to restoration projects will also be addressed.

AB  - Strategies for climate change adaptation are contingent on normative analyses of ideal development outcomes and possible futures. Competing visions for the future thus result in adaptation programmes that benefit some while disadvantaging others. In coastal Bangladesh, shrimp aquaculture provides an example of one such adaptation strategy with contested unequal outcomes. Focusing on the impacts of adaptation on the poorest and most vulnerable reduces the risk of negative impacts on the most structural disadvantaged. Attention to power imbalances, as opposed to technical solutions, can help ensure more equitable outcomes of adaptation measures.

AB  - The rapid evolution of air sensor technologies has offered enormous opportunities for community-engaged research by enabling citizens to monitor the air quality at any time and location. However, many low-cost portable sensors do not provide sufficient accuracy or are designed only for technically capable individuals by requiring pairing with smartphone applications or other devices to view/store air quality data and collect location data. This paper describes important design considerations for portable devices to ensure effective citizen engagement and reliable data collection for the geospatial analysis of personal exposure. It proposes a new, standalone, portable air monitor, GeoAir, which integrates a particulate matter (PM) sensor, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensor, humidity and temperature sensor, LTE-M and GPS module, Wi-Fi, long-lasting battery, and display screen. The preliminary laboratory test results demonstrate that the PM sensor shows strong performance when compared to a reference instrument. The VOC sensor presents reasonable accuracy, while further assessments with other types of VOC are needed. The field deployment and geo-visualization of the field data illustrate that GeoAir collects fine-grained, georeferenced air pollution data. GeoAir can be used by all citizens regardless of their technical proficiency and is widely applicable in many fields, including environmental justice and health disparity research.

AB  - The communities residing close to industrially contaminated sites are often affected by several fragilities, particularly of a socioeconomic nature. The disadvantaged conditions have often resulted from their marginalization in the decision-making related to the industrialization processes and may persist even when action is taken to limit the harmful consequences for the natural and social environment. Exposure to contaminants and the resulting health risks often regard socioeconomic deprived communities or the most disadvantaged subgroups, generating conditions of environmental injustice. This paper reports the results of a multidisciplinary reflection focusing on the Italian context. It describes how the national epidemiological surveillance system of communities residing close to industrially contaminated sites (named SENTIERI) and local epidemiological surveillance systems can be implemented to document local conditions of distributive injustice (inequalities in harmful exposures and consequent health risks). Furthermore, it analyses the mechanisms for generating and maintaining marginalities that prevent local communities from participating in decision-making processes (procedural injustice). Finally, after having identified and described the dimensions of community capacity, which concern both to the understanding of the adverse effects of environmental contamination and to the capability of promoting interventions against environmental injustices, it proposes an environmental justice promotion approach that starts from mapping the dimensions of community capacity as a premise to the identification of interventions for community empowerment.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement It is increasingly common for plant scientists and urban planning and design professionals to collaborate on interdisciplinary teams that integrate scientific experiments into public and social urban spaces. However, neither the procedural ethics that govern scientific experimentation, nor the professional ethics of urban design and planning practice, fully account for the possible impacts of urban ecological experiments on local residents and communities. Scientists that participate in design and planning teams act as decision-makers, and must expand their domain of ethical consideration accordingly. Conversely, practitioners who engage in ecological experiments take on the moral responsibilities inherent in generation of knowledge. To avoid potential harm to human and non-human inhabitants of cities while maintaining scientific and professional integrity in research and practice, an integrated ethical framework is needed for urban ecological planning and design. While there are many ethical and procedural guidelines for scientists who wish to inform decision-making and public policy, urban ecologists are increasingly embedded in planning and design teams to integrate scientific measurements and experiments into urban landscapes. These scientists are not just informing decision-making - they are themselves acting as decision-makers. As such, researchers take on additional moral obligations beyond scientific procedural ethics when designing and conducting ecological design and planning experiments. We describe the growing field of urban ecological design and planning and present a framework for expanding the ethical considerations of socioecological researchers and urban practitioners who collaborate on interdisciplinary teams. Drawing on existing ethical frameworks from a range of disciplines, we outline possible ways in which ecologists, social scientists, and practitioners should expand the traditional ethical considerations of their work to ensure that urban residents, communities, and non-human entities are not harmed as researchers and practitioners carry out their individual obligations to clients, municipalities, and scientific practice. We present an integrated framework to aid in the development of ethical codes for research, practice, and education in integrated urban ecology, socioenvironmental sciences, and design and planning.

AB  - The reshaping of South African cities is being guided by policies aiming to build socially and environmentally just communities. Despite widespread commitment to this goal, there is little consensus on what it means and how it should and could translate into practice. The paper shows that despite the emphasis on environmental justice and building sustainable communities in policy, the institutional context for implementation (including expert driven and deliberative approaches) do not always deliver on this mandate. Consequently, policy outcomes do not reflect those of the communities and households it is meant to serve, raising challenging moral and ethical questions for institutions involved in environmental governance. This paper shows how the institutional context of environmental assessment combined with the role played by the values held by environmental practitioners charged with influencing decision-making result in the perpetuation of environmental injustices. The lack of a clearly defined profession and professional body, reflecting a diversity of values, debating, regulating, defining and defending a set of principles to guide decision-making in cities is identified as a possible reason for the lack of congruence between the values reflected in policy with those held by the communities these interventions are intended to serve. The resulting value added by sustainable cities interventions in the light of this mismatch is therefore questionable, raising challenges regarding international calls for local action as well as an increasing policy focus in South Africa on the local level as the agent of political and spatial transformation of cities.

AB  - The availability of green spaces is an important issue for urban populations worldwide, given the benefits that the green spaces provide for health, well-being, and quality of life. But urban green spaces are not always distributed equally for different population groups within cities. Latin America is the second most urbanized region of the world, but there are few published studies analysing the green space availability for different urban population groups, and less so analysing the long-term trends. This work presents an analysis of long-term availability of urban green spaces by different socioeconomic status population groups in Medellin city, Colombia, using open geospatial data and open software tools. The results indicate that disparities between different groups have been decreasing in the last years, but there are still efforts to do. Showing this kind of analysis based on open data and tools is essential as it opens the possibility for replicating it in other cities with scarce budgets.

AB  - The consideration of ethical issues relating to pediatric environmental health is a recent phenomenon. Discussions of biomedical ethics, research on children, and environmental health research have a longer history. In the late 1990s, researchers at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, undertook a study to compare the effectiveness of several methods of reducing lead risk in housing. In a preliminary finding in the case of Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger Institute, Inc., a Maryland court questioned the ethics of performing research on children when there is no prospect of direct benefit to those children and whether parents can consent to such research. This case dramatically raised the profile of ethical issues among the pediatric environmental health research community. To broaden the discussion of these issues and in response to the Kennedy-Krieger case, the Children's Environmental Health Network held a working meeting on 5 and 6 March 2004 to explore this topic. The articles in this mini-monograph were prepared by the authors as a result of the workshop and represent their opinions. This article is an introduction to the workshop and a summary of the articles to follow.

AB  - There are no moral entitlements with respect to pollution prior to legal conventions that establish them, or so I will argue. While some moral entitlements precede legal conventions, pollution is part of a category of harms against interests that stands apart in this regard. More specifically, pollution is a problematic type of harm that creates liability only under certain conditions. Human interactions lead to harm and to the invasion of others' space regularly, and therefore we need an account of undue harm as a basis of assigning legal protections (rights) and obligations (duties) to different agents, which creates standards for holding those agents responsible for harm. Absent such positive standards with respect to pollution at the domestic or international level, it does not make sense to hold agents responsible. This fact has two fundamental implications. First, contrary to what some defenders of environmental justice argue, we cannot hold people responsible for polluting without a system of legal rights in place that assigns entitlements, protections, and obligations, and second, contrary to what opponents of environmental regulation claim, the lack of moral entitlements to pollute creates room for quite extensive legal restrictions on people's ability to pollute for the sake of the environment and human health. Indeed the scope of those restrictions is wide and open-ended.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in the unequal socio-spatial distribution of environmental 'goods' and 'bads' and the associated implications for geographical inequalities in health. Until recently, research in this area has focused on solitary environmental characteristics and has been hindered by the absence of geographically-specific measures that recognise the multifactorial nature of the physical environment. However, recent work in the United Kingdom has developed an area-level multivariate index of health-related physical environmental deprivation that captures both pathogenic and salutogenic environmental characteristics. Applications of this index have demonstrated that, at the national level, multiple environmental deprivation increased as the degree of income deprivation rose. Further, after adjusting for key confounders, there was a significant association between multiple environmental deprivation and the health outcomes of local residents. In the current study we tested the methods developed in the UK to create the New Zealand Multiple Environmental Deprivation Index (NZ-MEDIx) for small areas across the country (n = 1860). We considered whether socially disadvantaged places in New Zealand had higher levels of multiple environmental deprivation, and if environmental disadvantage exerted an influence on health after adjustment for key confounders such as socioeconomic status. We found that although neighbourhoods with higher levels of multiple environmental deprivation tended to have greater social disadvantage, this association was not linear. Further, multiple environmental deprivation tended to exert a modest effect on health that was independent of the age, sex and socioeconomic structure of the population. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop an index of multiple environmental deprivation in an alternative national context which has utility in epidemiological investigations.

AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) is widely utilized to study urban heat islands in the context of human health and thermal exposure. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that LST may be a poor indicator of apparent temperature, or the human-perceived equivalent temperature that reflects both heat and humidity. Moreover, heat index (HI), the apparent temperature metric used by the US National Weather Service, has yet to be computed at an increased spatial resolution and coverage beyond weather station observations. The goals of this study were to: 1) assess the extent to which HI can be estimated by a combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and other satellite-derived products available at continental scales, and 2) determine which factors are most important in this estimation. Specifically, daily maximum 1-km HI from May through September of 2012 was modelled across the conterminous United States as a function of MODIS LST, precipitable water vapor (PWV), and near-infrared indices, in addition to static variables capturing land cover, topographic, and locational factors.The derived model was capable of estimating HI within a reasonable level of error (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 4.4 degrees F). This is the first time that HI has been directly estimated using exclusively remotely sensed products and validated over a large spatial extent. Analysis of individual variables indicated that LST and PWV were, by far, the most important factors for estimation. However, the incorporation of additional parameters further improved model performance (R-2: +0.14, RMSE: -1.6 degrees F). We hope that our work will eventually result in a national HI product assisting researchers in a variety of fields, including epidemiology, building energy demand, and environmental justice. Further work to interpolate cloud-contaminated satellite observations and downscale estimates to a 60-m resolution would considerably increase the utility of this HI estimation methodology.

AB  - The study evaluates the sustainability of consumption patterns among different socioeconomic deciles based on individual ecological footprints generated by four of the world's most polluting industries: animal products/meat, textiles, transport, and residential energy. Online shopping is also considered due to its mounting popularity. A national survey, which ensured equal representation of socioeconomic deciles, involving 600 respondents in Israel was conducted, supplemented by follow-up semi-structured personal interviews with 25 participants. Conventional wisdom supports the notion that wealthier segments of society produce greater ecological footprints in all aspects of their consumption. In fact, our findings reveal that patterns are more nuanced and that there are areas in which poorer populations reveal less sustainable consumption patterns: poorer populations in the lower deciles report a greater per capita ecological footprint in their purchases of textiles and food consumption. By contrast, wealthier deciles have relatively larger ecological footprints in the areas of transport and residential patterns (which drive their energy consumption). Results suggest that some of the fundamental assumptions among environmental justice advocates regarding contrasting consumption patterns in affluent and poorer segments of society are not always supported by empirical evidence. Findings also indicate that there is room for greater government interventions to facilitate more sustainable consumption patterns among poorer populations.

AB  - The Texaco/Chevron lawsuit, which started inNovember 1993 and is still being litigated in 2020, is a prominent example of the process of judicialization of environmental conflict. The Ecuadorian plaintiffs claim that the oil company's operations generated ruinous impacts on the environment and on the development prospects and health of nearby individuals and communities. The tortuous and lengthy judiciary process was further hindered by an arbitration process, an Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism nested in the Ecuador-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty. The significance of the case goes beyond the specifics of Ecuador and provides further arguments fuelling the protracted legitimacy crisis experienced by International Investment Agreements. The current praxis of Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanisms is generating an asymmetrical system, protecting the interest of investors, and intruding into the space ofhuman and environmental rights. These issues are resonating with social movements, activist scholars and policy makers who are reacting to the vulnerabilities engendered by International Investment Agreements through multipronged strategies. These asymmetries provide ammunition to resist the signing of new International Investment Agreements, support the inclusion of human and environmental rights safeguards in International Investment Agreements, and contribute to the rationale of pre-empting extractive projects that are likely to produce severe environmental liabilities. Some of the potential ways in which a somewhat more level playing field can be created include, in addition to denouncing investment agreements, transforming Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanisms towards a format that can also accommodate the complaints of affected communities or enacting moratoria on extraction projects that are prone to adverse socioenvironmental impacts. Both strategies could prove to be productive avenues towards the achievement of justice.

AB  - The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) provides private parties with the right to recover their cleanup costs from third parties responsible for contaminating sites with hazardous waste. To do so, plaintiffs must show that their response costs are consistent with the National Contingency Plan (NCP), which establishes procedures and standards for hazardous waste cleanup. Courts presently diverge regarding the NCP community relations requirement. Some courts find that private parties satisfy these public participation provisions by working with a government agency. Other courts hold that private parties cannot recover their cleanup costs without providing the public with an opportunity to comment. This Comment examines CERCLA and the NCP community relations requirement, and argues that courts must recognize that public participation, which involves highly localized and distinct community concerns, is crucial to the attainment of a CERCLA-quality cleanup. Therefore, private parties must provide an opportunity for public participation to recover their cleanup costs under the NCP.

AB  - Sustainable development, ecological modernisation, eco-efficiency and the like have reframed material limits as conventional barriers to growth. Even in recent arguments for degrowth, limits recede to the background in favour of self-limitation. To reclaim limits as the grounds for an effective environmental politics. I reconstruct how the case for the limits to growth was reversed into a case for the growth of limits, and how foundational boundaries were increasingly blurred. Arguing that lifestyle politics is unlikely to be effective against the growth machine, I elaborate on the notion of form-of-life. If not understood as a solipsistic self-mastery but as the mutually formative encounter of living entities - provided with their own dispositions yet sharing a common destiny - this notion puts the focus on how freedom and equality are premised on, rather than hampered by, limits. I conclude with four reasons why a radical theory and politics for the environment should make use of the notion.

AB  - There are a number of conceptual, theoretical, and methodological issues in the literature on environmental justice and environmental inequalities in need of refinement. Using dat from the recycling industry, the author proposes an environmental inequality formation (EIF) perspective to address these issues. The EIF perspective synthesizes three major points that are largely neglected in research on environmental inequalities: (a) the importance of process and history, (b) the role of multiple stakeholder relationships, and (c) a Life-cycle approach to the study of hazards. The EIF model captures sociological dynamics in ways that suggest that environmental racism and inequalities originate and emerge in a,much more complex process than previously considered. Theory building in this area of research will aid scholars in understanding the mechanisms that produce environmental inequalities as well as their socioenvironmental consequences.

AB  - Studies of green corporate crime tend to be ahistorical in nature. This article explores the coal industry in the Central Appalachian region of the United States to highlight how historical context is crucial for understanding ongoing societal ills. The linkage between capitalism's traumatic legacy and current social problems is quantified in negative indicators like high poverty, low life expectancy, and high rates of opioid addiction, and is manifest in the failed economic strategy of prison building. I examine the foundational role the coal industry has played in these modern outcomes, as well as the incalculable ecological damage to the region, by tracing corporate entities' appropriation of land and resources and their maltreatment of labor in the region. I then address the capture of regulatory bodies and politicians that has resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths and the erasure of unique ecosystems, before exploring the ideological machinations that generate misplaced support for the industry today.

Last year, DDOT conducted spatio-statistical analysis to determine demographic and spatial trends that highlights PBC adoption and usage frequency. This paper serves as a continuation of that investigation, looking into spatial statistical patterns of non-PBC usage, trip patterns, and unbanked populations. Furthermore, an intercept survey was used to start assessing behavioral factors barring PBC adoption and usage frequency.

AB  - There currently is a scarcity of scientific information to guide public policy decisions about issues of ''environmental justice''; broadly defined as the goal of achieving adequate protection from the harmful effects of environmental agents for everyone, regardless of age, culture, ethnicity, gender, race, or socioeconomic status. This paper highlights several key methodological issues that need to be addressed as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen the scientific foundation for informed decision-making regarding environmental justice. Specifically, careful thought must be given to the selection of appropriate (1) statistical tests, (2) geographic unit(s) of analysis, (3)exposure estimators, and (4) comparison (reference) populations. These methodological issues are examined in the context of a nationwide study looking at the differences by ethnicity/race and household income in county-level air emissions of industrial chemicals. National and regional comparisons are made for 1990 using emission estimates from the Toxic Release Inventory, demographic data from the Census, and income data from the Donnelley Marketing Information Services.

AB  - The uneven effects of the climate crisis and the need for decarbonization by reducing fossil fuel exploitation and eliminating subsidies create critical trade-offs and tensions for low-income developing countries. Recent reform of fuel consumption subsidies has shown a perennial mitigation bias largely imposed by external forces, in particular multilateral agencies and foreign governments in the context of the Paris accord. Contradictorily, external pressures to reduce subsidies have created competitive markets for multinationals to have a disproportionate role in supplying energy products which foreground the inequities in Haitian society that have spurred social and political resistance. Empirical work on energy-subsidy reform and climate policy do not sufficiently interrogate the interplay and implications of underlying assumptions, power imbalances between domestic and foreign actors, the challenging infrastructural and political context of renewable energy promotion, and immediate concerns to address worsening social conditions and development priorities. Drawing upon these policy debates, this paper considers the recent experience of Haiti to reform its energy subsidies required by the International Monetary Fund to enforce austerity. The paper takes a more integrated and critical approach to these policy discussions in a context of interconnecting political and socio-ecological crises and climate policy in Haiti. By inductively analyzing Haiti's main climate and energy policies and evidence drawn from field experience, the paper offers a more nuanced understanding of decarbonization and energy debates in this extremely vulnerable context. This approach gives priority to a more dynamic historical analysis of the sociopolitical context and factors that seek to advance climate justice.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a normative framework for external financing that emphasizes stimulating investor interest to address so-called development challenges. However, their underpinnings reflecting continuities of longstanding structural divergence along racial lines when it comes to determinants of finance and uneven climate devastation are not well explored. Additionally, the current global configuration of "billions to trillions" of development finance remains silent on the historical responsibility and continuing coloniality that reproduce uneven and extreme consequences in climate-impacted Caribbean communities. This paper interrogates the role of the SDGs in reproducing racialized peripheries and extracting surplus value from these formerly colonized communities through the use of financial logics and innovative tools. The adoption of the SDGs at the same time of the International Decade of People of African Descent (2015-2024) appears merely coincidental. A lack of concern about climate justice and reparations for historical harms and climate-related losses is evident. This absence highlights the manner in which financial interests are privileged and mobilized in pursuit of high-yielding returns to be made from climate disaster, debt and dispossession. These contradictions usher in a new era of "bond-age" and coloniality that justify reparations for loss and damage facing frontline marginalised communities centred on climate justice.

AB  - The rapidly growing physical footprint of cities makes understanding residential landscaping preferences increasingly important for water quality, biodiversity conservation, and addressing climate change. In this paper we answer four interrelated questions about residential landscaping preferences with a case study in Raleigh, NC: (1) How are residents' landscaping preferences influenced by what residents believe their neighbors prefer? (2) Do residents accurately assess their neighbors' landscaping preferences? (3) How does ethnicity influence landscaping preferences? and (4) Do the socio-demographic and neighborhood norm based correlates of landscaping preferences persist when both are accounted for in multivariate models? Respondents (n = 179) in this study preferred a 50% native plant garden design over 100% turf grass or the 75% and 100% native plant garden designs, and inaccurately assumed that their neighbors preferred turf over the native plant garden based landscaping designs. These results suggest that correcting erroneous assumptions about neighborhood preferences may alleviate normative pressure against adopting alternatives to turf grass landscaping. Although landscaping choices were best predicted by what residents perceived their neighbors preferred, ethnicity, income, and home ownership were also related to landscape preferences. African American ethnicity and income were positively related to preference for turf grass coverage. Environmental justice concerns linked to urban vegetation should be considered in light of the finding that African Americans appeared to prefer turf grass dominated landscaping. Results from this study indicate that middle income neighborhoods with high levels of home ownership may prove most receptive to initiatives aimed at increasing the use of more sustainable landscaping.

AB  - The study uncovers the drama of Stei Baita (Romania), a former uranium mine, which experienced during the communism period, an intensive industrialization. This shaped the territorial pattern, cultural, economic and social relationships, with a tremendous impact on the quality of the environment which was sacrificed against a rapid of a so-called economic growth. Stei Baita is a classic example of legacy mine land and the authors aim is to capture and assess all important aspects of sustainable development within this study-case of disadvantaged community living in a radon prone area. More specifically, authors introduce their responses to several questions: (1) What do we know about social, economic and environmental capital of the selected settlement?; (2) Is the legacy of a uranium mine the platform of debate for negotiating for sustainable development?; and (3) What is the role of ethics in the current context of Stei Baita? Within the framework of analysis, equity, seen as part of ethics, is valued both as the premise of the debate and mandatory requirement for human development that should target sustainability. Authors have not discussed truths, but positions on identified problems by investigating community members' perceptions. Thus, peculiarities of this community are dealt within a thematic context (e.g., resources and environment, individual development, social system). Finally, ethics is valued as social construct built by negotiating interpretations of morally desirable situations and behaviors accepted in a particular society at a certain historical moment. This view is consistent with ethical relativism which denies the existence of a unique moral truth and which sets the understanding of Stei Baita context on the path of the new ethics. The new ethics depicts the world in nuances, allowing society to surpass obstacles to the progress of understanding.

AB  - Several grassroots initiatives in the last two decades have shown the need for different food practices that should be locally based and founded on ethical goals of social and environmental justice. Among the many "alternative food networks ", the Community Supported Agriculture model is particularly significant and interesting. By redefining meanings and social norms around food practices, this model actualizes significant processes of food re-socialization and re-territorialization. Focusing on Italy, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of the potential of this model. It does so through two investigations carried out in 2019 and 2020, aimed at analyzing, respectively, structural and organizational aspects of CSAs and the features of resilience shown by these initiatives during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. On the whole, the two surveys give us the image of a radically innovative experience, potentially capable of deeply redefining production and consumption practices, being rooted in socially-shared knowledge, motivations, willingness, commitment and sense of community. In addition to being characterized by a determination to pursue sustainability and equity goals, the model shows a remarkable character of resilience thanks to the original arrangements that the common value basis and the strong sense of interdependence and solidarity of its members can provide.

AB  - The Earth's population will become more than 80% urban during this century. This threshold is often regarded as sufficient justification for pursuing urban ecology. However, pursuit has primarily focused on building empirical richness, and urban ecology theory is rarely discussed. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has been grounded in theory since its inception and its two decades of data collection have stimulated progress toward comprehensive urban theory. Emerging urban ecology theory integrates biology, physical sciences, social sciences, and urban design, probes interdisciplinary frontiers while being founded on textbook disciplinary theories, and accommodates surprising empirical results. Theoretical growth in urban ecology has relied on refined frameworks, increased disciplinary scope, and longevity of interdisciplinary interactions. We describe the theories used by BES initially, and trace ongoing theoretical development that increasingly reflects the hybrid biological-physical-social nature of the Baltimore ecosystem. The specific mix of theories used in Baltimore likely will require modification when applied to other urban areas, but the developmental process, and the key results, will continue to benefit other urban social-ecological research projects.

AB  - Siting of mental health service facilities has often been subject to public opposition and political struggles. These processes have produced a landscape of mental health provision that is powerfully uneven and concentrated in economically and socially depressed areas. We argue that understanding this landscape requires an examination of the political processes that shape such siting decisions. Although health geographers (most importantly Dear and Wolch) have periodically engaged with politics, the important role of informal development politics in producing landscapes of health remains insufficiently examined. We introduce the case of residential social service facility (" group home") siting in central Massachusetts to explore the political dynamics of the production of health. Siting of group homes in Massachusetts is governed by a legal framework that provides social service agencies with legal protection and autonomy from local governments as they make siting choices. This exemption from local zoning ordinances often shifts local politics from formal to informal channels, leading to the application of many forms of soft influence over siting decisions. A comprehensive geographic analysis of mental health should include the social and political processes of siting.

AB  - The youth climate movement is known for its demands that political leaders listen to the views of scientists. Behind this argumentation, however, are multiple values, ideals, and statements for how societies should change in order to become more just and avoid the worst of the climate crisis. This article analyses how young climate activists in Finland understand climate justice, how they regard the current society as socio-ecologically unjust, and how, in their views, these injustices should be addressed. The analysis is based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews (n = 18) conducted during 2020. A theory of justice by John Rawls is applied as a theoretical framework. The results reveal that the status quo is regarded as unjust by climate activists in various dimensions: individual, socio-economic, intergenerational, global, and ecological. However, it was also found that a shared interpretation of climate justice is hard to reach, resulting in a pluralism of views on how the climate crisis should be tackled in a socio-ecologically sound manner. Common ground is found in moderation, which interconnects values and practices and points toward a 'fairer' society. Moderation and 'slowing down' are a point of departure for societal change.

AB  - The toxic pollution problem is composed of several interrelated parts which are involved in the process of production, use, and disposal of chemicals and products considered necessary for society. Each day, millions of pounds of toxic chemicals are used, stored, disposed of, and transported in and out of communities throughout the United States. Most Americans assume that pollution and other environmental hazards are problems faced equally by everyone in our society. But a growing body of research shows that the most common victims of environmental hazards and pollution are minorities and the poor. Disproportionate exposure to environmental hazards is part of the complex cycle of discrimination and deprivation faced by minorities in the United States. This article examines social science empirical research on the relationship between race, class, and the distribution of environmental hazards and the theoretical perspectives which have emerged to explain environmental inequities. The article also discusses the link between the environmental justice movement, which seeks to confront the causes and consequences of environmental inequities, and social science research on environmental inequity.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between news media and political education within consumer society. We argue that political education today needs to be understood as part of consumerism and media culture, in which individuals selectively expose themselves to and scrutinize various media representations not only of political issues, but also of political subjectivity and action. Individuals learn about how they might become political and act politically through their engagements with the news, in the context of the characteristics of liquid modernity, namely consumer culture, individualization, and choice. When examined through a lens of public pedagogy, political education becomes intertwined with consumer culture and the role of media in the education and socialization of political subjectivity. In this paper, we look at one example of the relationship between news and the education of political subjectivity by drawing from a larger research study, which examined the role of mainstream and alternative media in citizens' political mobilization on climate change. We argue that news consumption is part of a public political pedagogy through which individuals negotiate becoming liquid subjects, that is, citizens who take a critical, monitorial, and individualistic consumer approach to becoming political and taking part in social change.

AB  - Sustainable luxury cannot only be understood as a vehicle for more respect for the environment and social development, but also as a synonym of culture, art and innovation of different nationalities and the maintenance of the legacy of local craftsmanship. The overall aim of this chapter is to explore the important intersection between traditional Aboriginal cultural and environmental management, knowledge and heritage, with the interest of sustainable luxury tourism in remote wilderness communities in Australia. Socially Sustainable luxury tourism could encompass important element of empowering and life-sustaining activities for remote Indigenous groups on a global scale based if informed by Indigenous cultural governance to facilitate sustainable tourism. We argue that such a development could bridge the divide between culture and nature explaining how and why management and protection of landscapes and eco-systems are integral to human heritage, culture and a new wave of sustainable luxury tourism. The Mardoowarra, the Fitzroy River and its life ways, in the vast Kimberley, northern Western Australia, is highlighted to exemplify both our meaning and concern.

AB  - The air quality impacts of a metropolitan region's long range transportation plans are generally evaluated by estimating the change in a region's vehicle emission inventory. A change in the overall quantity of vehicle emissions in a region is generally associated with lower concentrations of vehicle related air pollutants and therefore a reduction in public health risks from exposure to vehicle emissions. A major limitation of this common approach is that aggregate emission inventories provide no information about localized impacts. While some areas experience air quality improvements, air quality can become worse in others. Such aggregate analyses are ill suited for addressing contemporary transportation planning questions such as identifying vehicle emission exposure hotspots, quantifying health risks, and evaluating environmental justice concerns. In this paper we describe a computationally efficient analysis framework for evaluating a regional transportation plan with spatially detailed estimates of vehicle emission exposures and related health outcomes. We then apply our framework in a case study of fine particulate matter exposure in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area and the changes expected to occur through the year 2040 under the region's long range transportation plan. We find that exposure and health risks decline from current levels by 2020 but then begin to slowly increase in some areas by 2040. We also find that low income and minority populations have the greatest health risks, confirming environmental justice concerns that have been noted in other regions.

AB  - The article, a critical essay, presents the notion of an emancipatory promotion of health (EPH), which seeks to relate the field of public health in theoretical and practical terms with the reinvention of utopias and relevant social struggles of our time principally in the Global South, a metaphor designating the peripheral or semiperipheral regions of the modern world-system. This is a relevant topic in the face of the planetary socio-ecological crisis and the debate on economic development, democracy and sustainability at a moment especially critical for the Brazilian reality and other countries. In particular, the contributions of peoples and social movements from rural, forests and water-dominated regions in Brazil to the emancipatory practices of health are discussed. The article is mainly based on two theoretical and methodological references, the Political Ecology and post-colonial approaches. The first focuses its analysis on the intensification of the social metabolism and environmental conflicts in the global capitalist economy, based on an unfair and unsustainable international trade that generates numerous socio-environmental conflicts, mainly in the Global South, that is, the peripheral countries that export agricultural and mineral commodities to richer ones. The second reference broadens and integrates the critique of capitalism with colonialism and patriarchy, understood as the three axes of oppression resulting from the Eurocentric modernity project. The challenge here is to deconstruct and reconstruct through an intercultural dialogue new conceptions of society, economy, nature, development, work and health. Such references help us to understand the importance of indigenous, peasant and Afro-descendant struggles for an emancipatory health promotion.

AB  - The 1st National Environmental Health Conference, in December 2009, presents countless challenges to the field of Public Health. It debates key concepts as development, sustainability, production and consumption processes, democracy and public policies; advocating for innovative, interdisciplinary and intersectorial aspects of Environmental Health. The Conference recovers and articulates important themes for the Public Health, and also indicates the need of reflecting the socio-environmental determinants of health at the present time, in order to provide progresses in the construction of guidelines and actions to health surveillance and promotion. This article discusses the characteristics of the Brazilian model of development, its impacts and conflicts within social, environmental and health fields. We use theoretical and empirical contributions from the fields of Ecological Economy and Political Ecology, as well as, experiences of cooperation with the Brazilian Network on Environmental Justice and several social movements. Two cases are discussed in more detail: the first related to agribusiness and the use of pesticides, and the other about the expansion of the iron and steel industry in Brazil. We conclude proposing some elements that could be incorporated by a research agenda committed to the debate about the "socioenvironmental crisis".

AB  - The article proposes a reinterpretation about the health crisis within a broader crisis of utopias and the need to reinvent social emancipation that can show us realistic paths of hope from the present. For this purpose, we propose the association of four types of justice: social, health, environmental and cognitive. The two first ones are well known in critical thinking and collective health, and the last two extend the understanding of the crisis in its civilizing, ethical, and planetary aspects, marked by the contradictions and destructive potential of Eurocentric, Western and capitalist modernity. The social is considered inseparable from the ecological, ontological, and epistemological dimensions in the interface between ethics, politics, science and social transformation related to the various crises and the necessary civilizational transition. The article is based on contributions from three fields of knowledge: collective health, political ecology and post-colonial approaches, especially the Epistemologies of the South, as presented by Boaventura de Sousa Santos around the reinvention of social emancipation. Finally, we propose some brief reflections for collective health to produce alternatives on topics such as economic, scientific and technological development, health promotion, surveillance, and care.

It is considered that the environmental crisis imposes new challenges and requires an updating of the theoretical and methodological foundations of collective health and the social determinants of health. The scope of this paper is to present theoretical contributions to the construction of a critical socio-environmental approach from a review of the literature structured around previous work on the mapping of environmental conflicts, and conducting empirical studies in conflicting areas. The contributions of sociology, political ecology, postcolonial studies and geography is summarized for the discussion of the socio-environmental determinants of health, as well as experiences that integrate emancipatory knowledge, political subjects, resistances and alternatives for society.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with a powerful upsurge in antiracist activism in the United States, linking many forms and consequences of racism to public and environmental health. This commentary develops the concept of eco-pandemic injustice to explain interrelationships between the pandemic and socioecological systems, demonstrating how COVID-19 both reveals and deepens structural inequalities that form along lines of environmental health. Using Pellow's critical environmental justice theory, we examine how the crisis has made more visible and exacerbated links between racism, poverty, and health while providing opportunities to enact change through collective embodied health movements. We describe new collaborations and the potential for meaningful opportunities at the intersections between health, antiracist, environmental, and political movements that are advocating for the types of transformational change described by critical environmental justice.

AB  - The theorization of borderland environmental justice is expanded by examining the specificities of fragmented governance and accountability and how this affects environmental injustice in the region. I argue that borderland environmental justice is distinct from U.S.-based environmental justice because of the congruence of three elements: socio-economic and ecological integration, the core-periphery relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, and the fragmented governance in the region. These elements are both a source of environmental injustices and also provide apertures for community activists to access international forums in order to meet their movement goals.

AB  - Systemic social justice issues are characterized as having complex and far-reaching causes. Food justice is one such an issue. Food justice is defined as "justice for all [people] in the food system," from agricultural production to consumer products. Policies seeking to remedy systemic social justice issues often need to include the attention of many levels of government and coordination across multiple agencies to move issues forward. That is why finding a model for interagency collaboration that has evidenced success, especially over the long-term, is inspiring and worth mirroring. This Comment compares food justice to the environmental justice movement, and proposes modeling a federal, interagency program to address food justice based on the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Justice Interagency Working Group (EJ IWG). This Comment includes an overview of the food justice movement, and argues that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), despite its history of civil rights violations, would be the best federal agency to lead an interagency working group because it administers essential rural development and consumer programs. It also explores whether the model employed by the Environmental Protection Agency's EJ IWG is a viable model for a food justice program at the USDA, and what features of the EJ IWG would suit such a food justice interagency working group.

AB  - The standpoint of environmental justice has become integral to environmental law in the last thirty years. Environmental justice criticizes mainstream environmental law and advocacy institutions on three main fronts: for paying too little attention to the distributive effects of environmental policy; for emphasizing elite and professional advocacy over participation in decision making by affected communities; and for adhering to a woods-and-waters view of which problems count as "environmental" that disregards the importance of neighborhoods, workplaces, and cities. This Article highlights the existence of a "long environmental justice movement" that, like the long movements for racial equality and labor organizing, put questions of economic power and distribution, democracy, and workplaces and neighborhoods at the center of environmental politics for many decades before the watershed era of environmental law making, 1970-77. The mystery is why this long environmental justice movement did not have more effect on the mainstream environmental law that arose in that period. The Article shows that we can better understand the omissions of environmental justice concerns by appreciating that mainstream environmental law was the last major legal product of "the great exception," the decades of the mid-twentieth century when, unlike any other time in modern history, economic inequality was declining and robust growth was widely shared. The assumptions of that time, along with key contingent decisions by the Ford Foundation, labor unions, and other early funders produced an environmental law that, more than much of the preceding environmental politics, neglected questions of justice. To give both environmental law and environmental justice their due, we must both locate environmental law within our new historical understanding of patterns of economic inequality and recognize that environmental justice is a recovery and extension of an essential and neglected strand of politics and law.

AB  - The 10 percent mandatory target for 'renewable energy' adopted by the European Parliament in December 2008 is fuelling a frenzy of investment in palm oil across Southeast Asia, leading in turn to the emergence of new, transnational campaign alliances. The specific dynamics of alliance building, political strategies and impacts of palm oil activism are shaped by the key role of the Indonesian environmental and agrarian justice movement, the broadening and radicalisation of groups in Europe and the ways in which these are interconnected by transnational activists. Campaigning has been successful in creating a transnational political debate around palm oil and biofuels and in influencing public opinion in Europe. Peasant activists have played an important role by combining issues of biodiversity and climate change with food sovereignty and by embedding the critique of biofuels within the global movement for climate justice. However, discontented palm oil smallholders and plantation workers are conspicuously absent at the transnational level. Building alliances between agrarian movements and plantation workers could strengthen the movement against biofuels by tapping into the potential offered by the transnational social and economic spaces which characterise the palm oil industry.

AB  - The collection of environmental samples presents a responsibility to return information to the affected participants. Explaining complex and often ambiguous scientific information to a lay audience is a challenge. As shown by environmental justice research, this audience frequently has limited formal education, increasing the challenge for researchers to explain the data collected, the risk indicated by the findings, and action the affected community should take. In this study we describe the development and implementation of a risk communication strategy for environmental pesticide samples collected in the homes of Latino/a migrant and seasonal farmworkers in a community-based participatory research project. The communication strategy was developed with community input and was based on face-to-face meetings with members of participating households. Using visual displays of data effectively conveyed information about individual household contamination and placed it in the context of community findings. The lack of national reference data and definitive standards for action necessitated a simplified risk message. We review the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach and suggest areas for future research in risk communication to communities affected by environmental health risks.

AB  - The San Diego/Tijuana US Mexico border crossing at the San Ysidro Port of Entry (POE) is the world's busiest international land border crossing (GSA, 2013). San Ysidro, California, is the US community immediately adjacent to the border crossing. More than 90% of San Ysidro residents are Hispanic, and the average household income is less than 60% of the San Diego regional average. This study investigated the San Ysidro POE as a source of traffic-related air pollutants in San Ysidro, especially in relation to wind direction and northbound vehicle wait times. The pollutants ultrafine particulate matter (UFP), black carbon (BC), and particulate matter < 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) were periodically sampled through the course of 2010 at four rooftop locations: one commercial establishment near the POE, two elementary schools in San Ysidro, and a coastal estuary reference site. Weather data from two nearby sites and northbound border wait times were also collected. Results indicate consistently higher daytime BC and UFP concentrations at the measurement sites near the POE. Pollution concentrations were higher during low wind speeds or when wind was blowing from the POE towards San Ysidro. In February, March and November measurements, black carbon pollution appeared to be significantly positively associated with the POE northbound wait times when the wind direction was blowing from the POE towards San Ysidro or during low wind speeds, but not when the wind direction was from the west/northwest towards the POE. This pilot study is the first to investigate the potential effect of the POE, especially the long northbound traffic delays, on the nearby community of San Ysidro. Disparities in traffic exposures are an environmental justice issue and this should be taken into account during planning and operation of POEs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable urban development is a major issue in developing countries, namely in environmental and social aspects. Urban forests have the potential to address these issues. Thus, it is not surprising that urban forest research is slowly gaining traction in these regions. However, there have been limited urban forest research reviews focusing on developing countries, especially tropical countries in the global south. Research reviews are vital in identifying the distribution of research themes, hence revealing research gaps and needs. Therefore, this review paper aims to provide a deep insight into the development of urban forest research in Malaysia in the past 20 years. The core purpose of this review is to analyze the distribution of research themes in Malaysia, thus identifying research gaps and needs in developing countries. A total of 43 articles were selected for this review, using the PRISMA framework. The distribution of research articles showed a continuous increase over time, especially for the past five years (2016 to 2021). The reviewed articles were categorized according to five emerging research themes in urban forestry. More than 41% of the reviewed articles fell under Theme 1 (the physicality of urban forests), with the majority being on biodiversity (n = 10). Theme 5 (the governance of urban forest) had the lowest research output (n = 3). Urban forestry research is slowly gaining prominence globally including the global south; however, there are obvious preferences in research focus, causing some research questions to be neglected. These research gaps are especially evident in four areas-soil science, ecophysiology, valuation (economics), and environmental justice. These research gaps should be addressed by the scientific community to ensure a thorough and complete research growth pertaining to urban forestry.

AB  - Since the end of the twentieth century extractive activities have intensified due to the increase in social metabolism, the erosion of exploitable reserves, and investment speculation in the commodities market. In Latin America (LA) the proliferation of projects is particularly notable in the case of precious metals but also on other strategic material such as copper, nickel, iron and zinc. This paper opens with a review of the mining sector in LA and Mexico, followed by an analysis of the open-pit mining project Caballo Blanco in Veracruz state, Mexico, notable for its' location close to the country's only nuclear plant. Potential ecological costs are assessed in detail while acknowledging the social impact and discontent that such mining projects usually generate. The paper concludes by appealing for a revalorization of socio-ecological impact as an obligatory starting point in seeking genuine environmental socio-ecological justice, more equal international trade, and above all a development framework that encompasses more than the merely economical.

AB  - The environment is increasingly seen as a meta-injustice or master frame of the politics of the new century. If this is indeed the case, environmental concerns should transcend national and organizational boundaries and should have a discursive claims-making space of their own. Research on environmental advocacy, however, shows that many claims for environmental justice are rooted in specific locales and advocacy is often mediated through, and at times overshadowed by, other dimensions of power. Using Nancy Fraser's conception of dimensions of justice, and a Bourdieusian inspired field approach, this paper maps Greenpeace and Sierra Club's press advocacy between 2006 and 2010. In doing so, the paper identifies environmental advocacy spaces and argues that non-parametric approaches to analysing ENGO media advocacy are needed to explain the complexity of multi-scaled political contexts.

AB  - The Brazilian Amazon has long served as a site of infrastructure development and natural resource extraction. Development projects including dams and mines have largely benefited distant urban actors at a cost to local communities and the environment. We draw from theories of internal colonialism and environmental justice to examine the ways that dam building undermined the well-being of communities affected by construction of the Belo Monte Dam, and to understand how those communities engaged in collective action to minimize negative impacts on their livelihoods. Drawing from semi-structured interview and ethnographic data, we find that farmers and fishers impacted by Belo Monte used a variety of tactics to resist exploitation and ultimately receive more equitable compensation for their losses. We propose two processes that were central to their success in mobilizing for environmental justice: transformative resistance and collaborative claims-making.

AB  - There is growing interest in the importance of ensuring that biodiversity conservation is not achieved at the expense of local people's well-being. It has been suggested that when evaluating the impact of an intervention, the affected population should be allowed to define well-being (requiring a subjective measure), and impacts (requiring a participatory approach), but very few, if any, conservation evaluations live up to these standards. We used a participatory impact evaluation approach with the Global Person Generated Index (GPGI) to investigate the relative impacts of strict protection and community forest management on local well-being in Madagascar's rainforests. The GPGI captures the subjective and multidimensional nature of well-being by asking respondents to identify the five most important domains for their quality of life, to evaluate their own performance in each domain, and the relative importance of the five identified domains. Participatory impact evaluation establishes local perceptions of the cause-effect relationship between an intervention and respondents' performance in each domain. Over half the respondents perceived no positive or negative impacts from the conservation interventions. We found no significant difference between strict protection and community forest management in the measures we used to examine the magnitude of their relative impacts, but there were differences in the characteristics of domains impacted and in the priority domains that could be targeted to improve well-being in locally meaningful ways. Because of its subjectivity, the GPGI cannot provide quantitative information on the magnitude of impacts. Its strength lies in the wealth of information it provides on what life domains people value and their performance in these domains. Combined with the participatory impact evaluation approach, the GPGI provides highly relevant insights that can be used to improve interventions in ways which increase the local legitimacy and acceptability of conservation initiatives.

AB  - Single-family residential rooftop solar adoption in the United States has not occurred equitably across the country, nor across socioeconomic and demographic groups. In response, state and local governments have developed solar equity programs, primarily focused on increasing adoption by low- and moderate-income (LMI) households. This study merged national datasets that estimate rooftop solar potential, the distribution of rooftop solar systems, and census tract- level socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to answer three questions. First, how are spatial distributions of rooftop potential and penetration similar and different across cities? Second, how is rooftop penetration distributed across non-LMI and LMI communities in different cities? Third, how do the relationships between rooftop penetration and local socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, identified as barriers to solar adoption, differ? Using GIS, bivariate and multivariate analyses, these questions were examined in four US cities - Riverside and San Bernardino, California, Washington, DC, and Chicago, Illinois - to understand both universal and distinct local manifestations. Findings include: higher rooftop potential existed in some LMI communities; higher rooftop potential did not necessarily translate to higher rooftop penetration, especially if higher potential was in LMI communities; and beyond income, other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, limited English proficiency, age of housing stock, and internet access were associated with rooftop penetration. While there remains great potential for expanding rooftop solar to LMI households and communities, understanding the local dynamics of solar potential and penetration may inform better policy development and implementation.

AB  - Societies aiming for a sustainable future need more effective and legitimate planning and decision making practices, in which various actors together find pathways towards a sustainable transition. In this paper, we approach sustainability and environmental justice as epistemological (and ontological) challenges for land-use planning, and empirically analyse how action research could support planners' social learning and planning towards fair and sustainable development. We analysed qualitatively the evolution of the researcher-planner dialogue while co-designing and developing better methods, means and practices to improve environmental justice in regional scale planning in Kymenlaakso Region, South-East Finland. We found that researcher-planner dialogue developed during cooperation. While in the beginning, social learning related to approaching environmental justice as a fair distribution of power evolved incrementally, later, when dialogue became more focused, communicative and reflective as an outcome of mutual frames and trust, learning occurred in a more transformative way. Such transformative learning concerned recognising youth as a silent group in the planning process and the means to involve their perceptions in planning. In order to support sustainability transformation in the future, we conclude that it is essential to create opportunities for such incremental and transformative social learning through innovative modes of interaction in various contexts.

AB  - The environmental benefits from electric cars (ECs) depend on several aspects, including source of electric energy generation, type of EC, and associated air pollutant emissions. For example, EC fleet (full ECs, no hybrid ECs) do not emit gaseous pollutants, but still emit a certain amount of particulate matter. Full ECs emit particulate matter through their non-exhaust sources, which includes wear and tear of tires and brakes. Often, non-exhaust particulate emissions are neglected by decision makers and environmental agencies. This may impact the development of effective environmental and public health policies. In this paper, we assess particulate matter emissions (PM10 and PM2.5) considering two EC adoption scenarios within a major metropolitan area in Canada-Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). In addition, we estimate potential human health risk for each scenario. Our results show that non-exhaust particle emissions (brake and tire) consist of mostly PM10. We estimate that for Scenarios 1 (10% of EC penetration) and 2 (100% of EC penetration), the respective emission reductions (exhaust + brake + tire) will be 37 and 94% for PM2.5, and 4 and 85% for PM10. Furthermore, compared to baseline, 10 and 100% EC adoption scenarios will reduce PM-related annual deaths by 37 and 87%, respectively. However, even considering the aggressive 100% EC adoption scenario, we will still have considerable PM10 and PM2.5 non-tailpipe emissions, i.e., similar to 743 and 189kgday(-1), respectively. If 100% EC adoption scenario is realized, each individual in the GTHA will inhale about 0.80x10(-3)ppmday(-1) (where 1ppm indicates that 1g inhaled per each ton emitted). Our results underline the importance of non-tailpipe emissions. Therefore, we suggest that environmental agencies must develop policies to account for and limit non-exhaust PM emissions, and the automotive industry must focus on reducing non-exhaust emissions from ECs.

AB  - There is limited evidence that socially responsible investment (SRI) strategies can resolve persistent concerns brought up in scholarship on the industry, particularly as it relates to considerations of justice. It is critical that SRI initiatives be interrogated about their broader impacts on environmental inequality and justice in the context of global power relations. Drawing upon environmental justice (EJ) theory, we propose a framework for transformative investment to halt the exploitation of humans and environment in pursuit of profit. We posit that transformative investment initiatives, including those related to strategies of screening and shareholder resolutions, would reflect three general conditions of environmental justice. They would require (1) cumulative responsibility that focuses on holistic gains so that investment initiatives do not replace one harm with another; (2) embedded accountability that is rooted in the decision-making and concerns of directly impacted communities; and (3) counter-hegemonic practices that are integrated with broader strategies and movements that challenge structures of oppression and exploitation. Through these principles, we address problems with SRI that have already been identified in scholarship on the subject. Moreover, we draw upon Antonio Gramsci's concept of 'strategic power' to conceptualize the conditions and actions necessary for transformative investment to take root.

AB  - Since its construction in 1940, the All-American Canal (AAC) could hardly be considered "All-American." Instead, for over sixty years a substantial portion of the AA C water seeped from the canal into the ground and crossed the border into northern Mexico. In the mid-1990s, the United States Bureau of Reclamation developed a project to replace a portion of the AAC with a parallel, concrete-lined canal, which will prevent this water-seepage loss and recover the water for use by hundreds of thousands of Southern Californians. At the same time, however, the lining project is expected to cut off the water supply to,farmers in the Mexican Valley who have been using the water for irrigation for decades, and will also dry a flow of seepage water that has been sustaining wetlands habitat in the Colorado River Delta. In 2006, a coalition of community and environmental groups in the United States and Mexico brought suit in federal court against the Bureau of Reclamation to halt further construction on the project. Yet their claims were ultimately precluded by a 1944 treaty that fixed the apportionment of Colorado River water between the United States and Mexico and intervening legislation passed in December of 2006 mandating that the project proceed "without delay." The rigid terms of these acts provided no room for the courts to devise a flexible or equitable remedy for those harmed by the unilateral lining project. This Note argues that the disposition of the CDEM litigation, while perhaps proper as a legal matter, is unsatisfying. The material and social investment the people of the Mexican Valley expended on reliance of the seepage water from the AAC, whether or not buttressed by a viable legal claim, should not be so easily disregarded. Instead, bordering nations should develop legal regimes that can adapt to changed circumstances and adjust obligations over time. This would encourage parallel rather than unilateral action by riparian states, and prevent private parties from needing to resort to litigation to advocate for their rights to shared resources.

AB  - Socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequities in access to recreation settings are widely considered environmental justice (EJ) issues. Researchers in leisure, geography, urban planning, and other disciplines have published important theoretical contributions on EJ related to recreation and parks, but such contributions have not been examined conjointly to identify their broader implications. In this article, we use an integrated definition of EJ that includes distributional, procedural, and interactional justice to connect previous theoretical perspectives on EJ about recreation and parks. First, we present an ecological model of recreation that recognizes EJ. We use the ecological model to systematically analyze the policy, physical, social, and perceived environmental factors and the individual factors that impact marginalized people's recreation participation. Second, we connect the EJ model to theory-relevant literature about recreation and parks. Third, we present future research areas on EJ for recreation and parks with key implications for advancing justice through policy change.

AB  - The walkability of streets located near parks matters for public health and environmental justice. Urban parks could help address increasing health concerns in the United States; however, parks tend to be inequitably distributed, and unsafe or uncomfortable routes to parks might be additional impediments to park use. We therefore seek to uncover whether low-income ethnic minority communities near a neighborhood park have less walkable routes to parks, compared to wealthier and Whiter areas. We use Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley as a case study and a street audit tool measuring walkability through microscale variables (e.g., pedestrian facilities). We find that low-income neighborhoods near parks have higher traffic volumes, fewer shade trees, and street environments that are less clean and well maintained compared to high-income areas and that similar disparities exist between ethnic minority and White communities. These inequities could deter low-income people of color, especially children, from visiting urban parks.

AB  - Rural territories and cultures have been increasingly sacrificed through depopulation, invasion by infrastructure, and the presence of industries which are incompatible with agriculture. Meanwhile, the expansion of urban space through demographic agglomeration and the concentration of activities in cities is leading to a progressively urbanised world. This article sheds light on the particularities of the relationship between urban expansion and the assault on agrarian modes of existence that survive at the diffuse urban frontiers in Central Mexico. A multiple case study was carried out; nine social-environmental conflicts where an agrarian community resisted the installation of urban infrastructure or city enterprises were analysed through the perspective of Political Ecology and environmental justice. Peasant communities question the political, economic, environmental, and cultural factors of the hegemonic social configuration as urban megaprojects menace their territory. In their struggles, they highlight that urban development undermines the very conditions necessary for the existence of the city, as its social metabolism depends in part on the resources these rural communities are defending.

AB  - Substantial evidence suggests that minorities and the poor are exposed to disproportionately high levels of environmental risk While there are numerous possible causes for inequities in the distribution of pollution, some researchers have identified actions of the federal judiciary as one element contributing to bias in environmental protection Environmental justice advocates have suggested that penalties for violating environmental regulations are systematically lower in poor and minority areas, signaling that pollution is more acceptable in these areas. Using data from all civil cases died under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act between 1974 and 1991, I test the proposition that penalties in these cases disadvantage poor and minority areas. The results from this analysis demonstrate that such penalties are not, in bet, smaller in these areas, suggesting that the judicial contributions to inequities in the distribution of environmental risk are negligible.

With air travel demand expected to grow by 77% in the next twenty years, there is a growing need to address airports' impacts on residents. This study examines the impacts of aircraft emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a harmful form of air pollution, at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest airport. Aircraft landing and takeoff emissions were modeled for June-July 2002 using the Advanced Modeling System for Transport, Emissions, Reactions, and Deposition of Atmospheric Matter (AMSTERDAM). Distributional analyses show that within 675 of 710 census tracts of the 29-county Atlanta metropolitan region, the average aircraft contribution to PM2.5 was low (<20 ng/m(3)). However, in tracts where aircraft contribution to PM2.5 exceeded 20 ng/m(3) (36 tracts), populations overwhelmingly had lower median incomes, home values, and educational attainment, as well as higher percentages of nonwhite residents, (p < 0.01). OLS regression, principal components analysis, and quantile regression explore the mediating relationships between socioeconomic variables. The relationship between minority population percentages and aircraft-derived particulate matter was found to grow stronger as concentrations increased. Analysis using a concentration-response function indicates that the airport's influence on PM2.5 concentrations may be responsible for approximate to 1.4 premature adult (age 25+) deaths per year (90% confidence interval: 0.5-2.7). The use of air quality modeling in planning decisions may help protect residents and give them necessary information to push for policies and technologies that would reduce emissions and exposure.

AB  - The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is an agricultural, recreational, historical, and cultural center and the hub of the state's water supply system. For decades the region has been ripe with political controversies stemming from conflicting interests over its natural resources which all depend on the protection of approximately 1800 km of earthen levees that surround over 60 islands, some of which are below sea level and two-thirds of which are privately owned. This study uses the Q methodology to explore the discourses of the broad range of stakeholders, including farmers, land- and water-based recreation enthusiasts, water exporters, utilities, environmentalists, and government agencies, about flood risk and flood management in the Delta. The results of this study reveal five distinct views regarding the risk of submersion of one or more islands due to either overtopping during high waters or structural levee failures. The findings of this study also elucidate nuanced narratives on the viability of anticipatory climate change adaptation in the Delta. Proximity, sense of vulnerability, values, trust, and views of climate change are the underlying factors in these perspectives. The perspectives identified suggest that resolving decades of distrust among stakeholder groups will remain difficult; however, taking a cultural approach to understanding perspectives may provide an opportunity to open up the conversations to adaptation approaches, and thus fulfill the legal mandate to protect the Delta as an evolving place.

AB  - The aim of this study is twofold. First, it explores the local discourses of poverty and well-being in a fishing community in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Second, the study examines the several constraints that fishers face for secure and sustainable livelihoods. The assessment used the sustainable livelihoods framework as analytical approach. The study concluded that poverty and marginalization in this fishing community is closely linked with institutional and social factors rather than to economics issues. The most severe constraints observed were corruption in the allocation of fishing licenses and permits, social exclusion and marginalization of new settlers and domestic violence associated with alcoholism and drug addictions. The current discourse that explains poverty exclusively in economic terms is discussed largely and confronted with empirical evidence. Finally, the study emphasizes the necessity to implement a marine protected area in the region, with the aim to preserve the marine resources as well as to establish a normative framework which guarantees transparency and justice in the resources allocation.

AB  - The deployment of renewable technologies as part of climate mitigation strategies have provoked a range of responses from various actors, bringing public acceptance to the forefront of energy debates. A key example is the reaction of communities when renewable projects are proposed in their local areas. This paper analyses the effect that community acceptance has had on planning applications for onshore wind and solar farms in Great Britain between 1990 and 2017. It does this by compiling a set of indicators for community acceptance and testing their association with planning outcomes using binomial logistic regression. It identifies 12 variables with statistically significant effects: 4 for onshore wind, 4 for solar farms, and 4 spanning both. For both technologies, the visibility of a project, its installed capacity, the social deprivation of the area, and the year of the application are significant. The paper draws conclusions from these results for community acceptance and energy justice, and discusses the implications for energy decision-making.

AB  - Stemming from human accident, error, or neglect, technological disasters, such as chemical spills, toxic waste contamination, nuclear radiation, transportation accidents, and factory explosions, are products of the modern industrial complex. Toxic contamination of the land can permanently displace people from their homes and erase places from the landscape. Commemoration provides an opportunity to remember the past and celebrate culturally significant place attachments while contributing to the recovery process by aiding in community healing after devastating events. We focus on two key components regarding commemoration after technological disaster, namely the acknowledgement of wrongdoing and the celebration of a resilient population and landscape. We argue that a combination of ecofeminist phi-losophy and environmental justice frameworks allows for a better understanding of the cycle of disaster and mitigation as it pertains to targeted groups, and that commemorative acts and artifacts following human-made disasters often fail to successfully reform this cycle. Moreover, the combination of ecofeminist philosophy and environmental justice allows us to examine the complex relationship be-tween responsibility and targeted groups through disaster commemoration, which serves as an important way to communicate wrongdoing to both the local and greater population. Through engagement with ecofeminist philosophy and environmental justice frameworks, we explicate how commemoration after technological disaster can disrupt or reinforce systematic inequalities.

AB  - There is a sizable literature about the factors shaping park visitation and use especially for urban parks, including (i) geographic (e.g. proximity), (ii) socio-cultural (e.g. population characteristics) and to a lesser extent, (iii) individual psychometric factors (e.g. attitudes and values). Yet comparatively little is known about how factors related to distance may affect pen-urban national park use, particularly outside the United States. This paper reports on research investigating distance-related factors affecting use of a peri-urban national park in Brisbane, Australia. This study found that older visitors live closer to the park while younger visitors travel further to use it. Surprisingly, travel distance did not vary with the type of recreational activities that users were conducting in the park. These results have implications for park planning and management including user demand for different recreational activities in pen-urban national parks. Results are useful for scholars using distance decay models to explain travel behaviour, evidencing the empirical veracity of the model in different places and across different service types. The findings are especially important for geographers because they demonstrate that assumptions about uniform park catchments may be unsupported and need to be empirically validated.

AB  - The author of this study conducted focus groups with African American women to explore their perspectives on obesity, disease causation, and their ideas on the functionality of cultural, social, historical, environmental, and psychological forces in altering healthy eating habits. Reoccurring themes centered on four areas: (a) the definition of health as a mind, body, and spiritual construct; (b) conceptualizations of cultural norms regarding healthy foods versus unhealthy foods; (c) the importance of eating and social rituals on food choices; and (d) the impact of the environment in sustaining healthy initiatives. Structural constraints that uphold legacies of disenfranchisement, environmental injustice, and segregation influence the food choices available in low-wealth communities. These factors continue to operate and are vital issues to consider when designing culturally relevant wellness programs.

AB  - The biocultural ethic affirms the vital value of the links that have coevolved between specific life habits, habitats, and communities of co-in-habitants ("3Hs"). The conservation of habitats and access to them by communities of co-inhabitants is the condition of possibility for the continuity of their life; it becomes an ethical imperative that should be incorporated into development policies as a matter of ecosocial justice. The conceptual framework of the biocultural ethic recognizes that there are numerous communities (inhabiting cities, rural, or remote areas) with cultural traditions that have ethical values centered in life, sustainable practices, and low environmental impact. It also recognizes agents that have values centered on short-term profit, non-sustainable practices, and disproportionately high environmental impact. Therefore, it would be technically and ethically right to define and enforce differential responsibilities among social groups, corporations, and nations that are contributing to the negative socio-environmental impacts that we face today. We have now reached a state of "plutonomy" that is dividing the world into two blocs: the wealthy 1 % of the world's population that owns 50 % of the world's wealth, and "the rest." To achieve Earth stewardship, this trend needs to be overcome by (i) changing the current regime of plutocracy towards one of more participatory democracy that ceases to be indifferent to the well-being of the majority of human and other-than-human living beings, (ii) reorienting the current habits of plutonomy, and its associated consumerism and land-grabbing practices, towards habits of stewardship, and (iii) broadening the prevailing perspective of ecosystem services toward an ethical concept of sustainable co-inhabitation. By more precisely identifying the diversity of Earth stewards, their languages, values, cultures, and practices in heterogeneous habitats of the planet, as well as the specific agents that are mostly responsible for current socio-environmental problems, the biocultural ethic can significantly contribute to orient clearer collaborative and supportive ways for a responsible and intercultural Earth stewardship.

AB  - Sustainable forms of co-inhabitation in this world are not only possibilities; they are actualities. However, for their expression, it is essential to undertake a twofold task: (1) to precisely and severely sanction those agents who act guided by a self-absorbed economic interest threating the sustainability of life, and (2) to decisively defend those traditions of thought and communities who favor the continuity of life in its diversity of biological and cultural expressions. For the second task to be undertaken effectively, it is critical to understand that the conservation of, and the access to, the diverse native habitats is the condition of possibility for the continuity of the diverse and sustainable life habits of communities of co-inhabitants that inhabit them. The conservation of habitats and life habits is so critical that it constitutes an ethical imperative that should be incorporated into government policies as a matter of socio-environmental justice. To implement this ethical imperative, it is essential to reorient global society to foster a culture that achieves a better integration of ontological-, ecosocial-, and ethical-biocultural foundations into education, policies, and governance. This triple integration aims to contribute to more fully understanding pressing socio-environmental problems and to more effectively implement biocultural conservation. In order to contribute to this triple integration, we offer the "3Hs conceptual lens" of the biocultural ethic to re-cognize and re-value the multiplicity of ecological worldviews, practices, and values hosted by diverse cultures in heterogeneous regions of the planet that contribute to the sustainability of life.

AB  - Sabah, on the northeastern corner of Borneo, is concurrently Malaysia's largest producer of oil palm (Elaeisguineensis)and home to the endangered Bornean elephants (Elephas maximus bomeensis; elephants). Concomitantly, Sabah has been experiencing increasing and unsustainable human-elephant conflicts (HECs), which have not been thoroughly investigated from a human dimensions standpoint. To address this void, in March 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 37 villagers located in the Sabah districts of Lahad Datu, Tawau, and Telupid to investigate villager cognitions regarding elephants, behaviors toward elephants, the formal and informal village institutions employed to mediate HECs, and the future viability of human-elephant coexistence. Respondents highlighted emotions of fear, anger, and frustration over crop and property damage that villagers were unable to effectively mitigate employing traditional institutions and strategies. Although negative emotions were somewhat tempered by the cultural significance of elephants, respondents indicated that coexistence with elephants remains challenging and is likely only viable under certain conditions: domestication of elephants, if elephants no longer destroyed crops, and/or if elephants were provided separate forested habitat away from humans. Our results demonstrated that elephant conservation in Sabah is viewed as a "not in my backyard" claim, which can hint at the presence of environmental injustice. We further examined Sabah HECs using an environmental justice framework and concluded that HEC as an environmental justice problem requires traditional fixes to be merged with more extensive, sustainable solutions that improve stakeholder agency.

AB  - Sociological theories about the political economy of the environment have appeared in two waves. The first wave has a productivist orientation, showing how the normal workings of industrial production damage the environment. It includes impact theories (IPAT and STIRPAT), the treadmill of production, growth machine theories, and resource extraction/ecologically unequal exchange theories. A second wave of theories focuses on environmental destruction and the social movements that challenge the agents of destruction. To accommodate popular unrest over environmental declines, states have typically created corporatist policymaking circles that include long-established, moderate environmental nongovernmental organizations and exclude disadvantaged and unorganized peoples. Advocates for environmental justice and sustainable consumption have attempted to mobilize the excluded, articulating a just sustainability theory that addresses both concerns. Current controversies in the field focus on the predictive power of first- and second-wave theories. This theoretical focus may shift toward the political economy of disasters as climate change intensifies.

AB  - The climate-policy debate has only recently turned its full attention to adaptation how to address the impacts of the climate change that we have already begun to experience and that will likely increase over time. Legal scholars have in turn begun to explore how the many different fields of law will and should respond. During this nascent period, one overarching question has gone unexamined: How will the legal system as a whole organize around climate change adaptation? Will a new, distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy emerge, or will legal institutions simply work away at the problem through unrelated, self-contained fields, as in the famous Law of the Horse? This Article is the first to examine that question comprehensively, to move beyond thinking about the law and climate change adaptation to consider the law of climate change adaptation. Part I of the Article lays out our methodological premises and approach. Using a model we call Stationarity Assessment, Part I explores how legal fields are structured and sustained based on assumptions about the variability of natural, social, and economic conditions, and how disruptions to that regime of variability can lead to the emergence of new fields of law and policy. Case studies of environmental law and environmental justice demonstrate the model's predictive power for the formation of new, distinct legal regimes. Part II applies the Stationarity Assessment model to the topic of climate change adaptation, using a case study of a hypothetical coastal region to demonstrate the potential for climate change impacts to disrupt relevant legal doctrines and institutions. We find that most fields of law appear to be capable of adapting effectively to climate change. In other words, without some active intervention, we expect the law and policy of climate change adaptation to follow the path of the Law of the Horse a collection of fields independently adapting to climate change rather than organically coalescing into a new and distinct field. Part III explores why, notwithstanding this conclusion, it may still be desirable to seek a different trajectory. Focusing on the likelihood of systemic adaptation decisions with perverse and harmful results, we identify the potential benefits offered by intervening to shape a new and distinct field of climate adaptation law and policy. Part IV then identifies the contours of such a field, exploring the distinct purposes of reducing vulnerability, ensuring resiliency, and safeguarding equity. These features provide the normative policy components for a law of climate change adaptation that would be more than just a Law of the Horse. This new field would not replace or supplant any existing field, however, as environmental law did with regard to nuisance law, and it would not be dominated by substantive doctrine. Rather, like the field of environmental justice, this new legal regime would serve as a holistic overlay across other fields to ensure more efficient, effective, and just climate adaptation solutions.

AB  - The world's poor are especially vulnerable to environmental disasters, including the adverse consequences of climate change. This creates a challenge for climate justice advocates who seek to ensure that those least responsible for causing climate change do not bear unwanted burdens of mitigation. One way to promote climate justice could be to pay particular attention to the environmental policy preferences of citizens from poorer, lower-emitting countries. This paper examines opinions on environment-economy trade-offs and willingness to make personal financial contributions to protect the environment among residents of 42 developed and developing countries using data from the 2005-2008 World Values Survey, the 2010 Climate Risk Index, and World Bank development indicators. Results reveal that individuals in developing countries are less likely to support policies to prioritize environmental protection over economic growth but are more willing to donate personal income for pro-environmental efforts compared to citizens of more developed nations.

AB  - The problematic of the activist/academic relationship has been a source of sustained concern for radical Geographers over the past 15 years. Drawing on my personal experience within the radical climate movement(s), this paper looks to develop on the commitments of militant research, contribute to the development of militant ethnography as a research approach and consider the subsequent implications for thinking through the activist/academic problematic. Elaborating on the epistemological distinction between 'truth relaying' and 'knowledge production', it is contended that militant research is an orientation and process synonymous with the disavowal of positivist knowledge and the construction of situated partisan knowledge(s). Rather than the (social) science of transmitting truth, research thus becomes the art of producing tools you can fight with. From this perspective, the activist/academic problematic is not a 'neutral' problem but a product of a certain way of knowing associated with the academy. The paper concludes that our concern should not be to navigate between (and thus reiterate) the fields of 'activism' and 'academy', but to surpass the problematic altogether. We are tasked not with reproducing the university in its current form, but reimagining it as a machine for the production of other worlds.

AB  - The proposal of the Mescalero Apache Indians of New Mexico to host a nuclear waste storage facility raised difficult questions about political sovereignty, environmental justice, and democratic consent. Mile the proposal had numerous drawbacks and deserved to be opposed, many of the arguments used against it were conceptually flawed and paternalistic, Arguments decrying bribery of a poor community were particularly weak, while those criticizing targeting of Indian tribes by the United States government and coercion of tribal members by the Mescalero leadership had more merit. The core ethical arguments should be separated from the rhetoric so that policy makers, Native Americans, environmentalists, and industry leaders can better evaluate similar projects in the future.

AB  - The aim is to study how ideologies come through in urban regeneration plans. Neo-liberalism, participatory democracy and environmentalism are systems of ideas competing for the minds of citizens in large parts of the world. Typical urban policies linked to each ideology are listed to provide a basis for identifying features of development plans that reflect aspirations for an entrepreneurial, green or open and inclusive society. A case study from Trondheim, Norway, maps ideological traces in waterfront development plans. The central question to be addressed is whether the internationally widespread allegations of neo-liberal hegemony over urban plans are reasonable. In light of the case data, it can be questioned whether neo-liberal ideology, although influential, is hegemonic in the plans. This doubt lingers, even if the chosen case Nedre Elvehavn is the kind of large-scale transformation of former dockyards close to the central business district that is often regarded as prototypical neo-liberal development in academic planning literature.

AB  - Siting controversies have become familiar in windpower development. Process and outcome fairness in the form of economic benefits to local communities and inclusion in decision-making processes are recognised as important elements in local acceptance of windpower installations. To these, we add the concept of "relative fairness" influencing perceptions of overall fairness. In this article, we examine why Norwegian municipalities agree to host windpower, and the role of process, outcome and relative fairness in this decision. Municipalities are central in providing welfare services, and in ensuring a viable local economy and local workplaces. Process fairness is important, as is evident when municipalities have little influence in the detailed planning of the plants. Also, outcome fairness, in the form of economic compensation - particularly through property tax - is decisive for positive attitudes towards windfarms, as municipalities can strengthen their role as welfare providers and boost local economic activities. Less emphasised are the effects on global climate and national climate goals. However, effects on local landscape and nature are also important for municipalities, as became clear when the national government proposed withdrawing the municipalities' possibilities of levying property taxes. The municipalities argue that it is only fair to receive something in return for hosting windmills, and relative fairness is important to their argument for equal treatment regarding hydro- and wind-power electricity production in the form of a natural resource tax.

AB  - The present study explored whether perceived neighborhood environmental attributes associated with physical activity differ by neighborhood income. Adults aged 20-65 years (n=2199; 48% female; mean age=45 years; 26% ethnic minority) were recruited from 32 neighborhoods from the Seattle. WA and Baltimore, MD regions that varied in objectively measured walkability and neighborhood income. Perceived built and social environment variables were assessed with the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale. There were neighborhood income disparities on 10 of 15 variables. Residents from high-income neighborhoods reported more favorable esthetics, pedestrian/biking facilities, safety from traffic, safety from crime, and access to recreation facilities than residents of low-income areas (all p's <0.001). Low-income neighborhoods may lack amenities and safety attributes that can facilitate high levels of physical activity for both transportation and recreation purposes.

AB  - The concept of planetary justice has received increasing attention within the field of earth systems governance. Although a significant epistemic shift, planetary justice discussions have primarily focused on western and (re) distributive notions of justice. By doing so, planetary justice is depriving current debates of crucial dimensions of what justice has meant for different communities and organisations. These trajectories spanning the realms of social activism, research, and institutional change have historically called for more than (re)distributional approaches to justice. We argue that recentring procedural, epistemic, and recognition-based notions of justice is critical in addressing the challenges of planetary justice in both research and practice of earth systems governance. Pluralising Planetary Justice (PPJ) requires a series of epistemic shifts in the way we research and practice the governance of environmental inequalities. These shifts demand attention to the links and gaps between justice movements and scholarship beyond the industrialised North. They also require scaling debates within climate justice and developmental ethics regarding peoples' abilities to achieve well-being and the challenges of public deliberation across spatio-temporal scales. Finally, these shifts need to recognise long-lasting processes of epistemic colonialism and integrate intersectional, multispecies, intergenerational, and non-western notions of justice. We argue procedural, epistemic, and recognition-based justice are essential guiding principles and empirical standpoints to developing pluriversal and multiscale human-earth governance systems. Without appealing to procedural, recognition, and epistemic concerns, planetary justice cannot meaningfully engage with the necessary agents and trajectories or outline the normative ends to which it aims to advance in earth systems governance.

AB  - The dynamics and relationships between society and nature are complex and difficult to predict. Anthropogenic activities affect the ecological integrity of our natural resources, specifically our streams. Further, it is well-established that the costs of these activities are born unequally by different human communities. This study considered the utility of integrating stream health metrics, based on stream health indicators, with socio-economic measures of communities, to better characterize these effects. This study used a spatial multi-factor model and bivariate mapping to produce a novel assessment for watershed management, identification of vulnerable areas, and allocation of resources. The study area is the Saginaw River watershed located in Michigan. In-stream hydrological and water quality data were used to predict fish and macroinvertebrate measures of stream health. These measures include the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Family IBI, and total number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Stream health indicators were then compared to spatially coincident socioeconomic data, obtained from the United States Census Bureau (2010), including race, income, education, housing, and population size. Statistical analysis including spatial regression and cluster analysis were used to examine the correlation between vulnerable human populations and environmental conditions. Overall, limited correlation was observed between the socio-economic data and ecological measures of stream health, with the highest being a negative correlation of 0.18 between HBI and the social parameter household size. Clustering was observed in the datasets with urban areas representing a second order clustering effect over the watershed. Regions with the worst stream health and most vulnerable social populations were most commonly located nearby or down-stream to highly populated areas and agricultural lands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The advent of government transparency through online data publication should provide a transformative benefit to the information gathering practices of civic organizations and environmental advocates. However, environmental agencies and other reporters often disseminate this critical data only in siloed repositories and in technically complex, inconsistent formats, limiting its impact. We have developed a new open source web resource, the Archive of Massachusetts ENvironmental Data or AMEND, which curates information relating to federal, state, and local environmental stewardship in Massachusetts, focused on water quality. We describe the construction of AMEND, its operation, and the datasets we have integrated to date. This tool supports the development and advocacy of policy positions with published analyses that are fully reproducible, versioned, and archived online. As a case study, we present the first publicly reported analysis of the distributional impact of combined sewer overflows on Environmental Justice (EJ) communities. Our analysis of the historical geospatial distribution of these sewer overflows and block-level US Census data on EJ indicators tracking race, income, and linguistic isolation demonstrates that vulnerable communities in Massachusetts are significantly overburdened by this form of pollution. We discuss applications of this analysis to the state-level legislative process in Massachusetts. We believe that this approach to increasing the accessibility of regulatory data, and the code underlying AMEND, can serve as a model for other civic organizations seeking to leverage data to build trust with and advocate to policymakers and the public.

AB  - The recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Venn v Secretary of the State for Communities and the Local Government provided necessary clarification on the application of the current costs protection regime in cases within the scope of the Aarhus Convention. The case made the problematic features of the new costs rules explicit in ensuring access to environmental justice. Prohibitively expensive and unpredictable litigation costs in environmental litigation, a traditional feature of English law, are principally addressed through the implementation of the third pillar of the Aarhus Convention. Article 9(4), the key provision, provides that access to justice should be 'fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive'. The recent amendments to the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR 45.41-45.44 and Practice Direction 45) reflect an urgent, but superficial, attempt to secure compliance with the Convention. This case note discusses the specific criticisms of CPR 45.41, and the broader implications of the case concerning the legal status of the obligations under the Aarhus Convention, the relationship between environmental justice and procedure, and the nature of environmental law and policy.

AB  - Rubbertown, located in West Louisville, Kentucky, USA, is a highly industrialized area with several chemical and materials manufacturing plants. For decades, residents in the area have experienced continuous air pollution problems. City monitoring and enforcement of pollution has improved recently, after residents and nongovernment organizations protested. However, overall pollution levels in Rubbertown remain high because of inconsistent monitoring, enforcement, and we argue- gaps in citizen-government co-production of pollution control. Collaborative solutions are required because air pollution is difficult to monitor completely top-down, and effective coordination requires shared decision making. To understand the root causes of this dilemma, and identify potential policy solutions, we interviewed key stakeholders and collected background information about the case. We used Ostrom?s Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to understand the factors and political/economic dynamics that have created the current problem. We analyze this dilemma using Ostrom?s design principles for co-production, and related concepts of state-reinforced self-governance. We find significant gaps in co-production. Grassroots, neighborhood-level monitoring is not integrated with or legitimized by formal government agencies. Communication among key stakeholders is infrequent, and decision making is primarily top-down, giving residents little control over pollution in their neighborhoods. Costs and benefits of monitoring and enforcement are not shared equitably among the key actors, and there are low levels of trust. These gaps may be remedied by policies that empower residents to formally monitor air pollution in their neighborhoods, greater representation of residents on the pollution control district board, and collaborative programs that facilitate shared decision making among key actors.

AB  - Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are an important socio-environmental problem associated with large cities, such as the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA), in Chile. Here, we analyze daytime and nighttime variations of SUHIs for each season of the year during the period 2000-2020. To evaluate socioeconomic inequities in the distribution of SUHIs, we establish statistical relationships with socioeconomic status, land price, and urban vegetation. We use the MODIS satellite images to obtain the land surface temperatures and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) through the Google Earth Engine platform. The results indicate more intense SUHIs during the nighttime in the eastern sector, coinciding with higher socioeconomic status and larger green areas. This area during the day is cooler than the rest of the city. The areas with lower and middle socioeconomic status suffer more intense SUHIs (daytime and nighttime) and match poor environmental and urban qualities. These results show the high segregation of SMA. Urban planning is subordinated to land prices with a structure maintained over the study period. The lack of social-climate justice is unsustainable, and such inequalities maybe exacerbated in the context of climate change. Thus, these results can contribute to the planning of the SMA.

AB  - The theoretical frameworks of the treadmill of production and the treadmill of destruction are used to explore how the expansionary dynamics of capitalism and militarism, along with a complicit state apparatus, harm the environment and human health. The treadmill analysis is extended beyond a structural explanation of the occurrence of environmental inequality by showing how elite shareholders interact with marginalised stakeholders. A historical-comparative study of uranium mining on the Navajo Nation's lands and the toxic contamination of the North Carolina military base, Camp Lejeune, is carried out to explore claims-making strategies, to understand how each claimant negotiates their position, and to unearth power differences among multiple interests. Secondary data analysis is conducted on government documents, journalists' accounts, public health records, and scholarly research to elucidate resistance to these treadmills, and bridge the role that the economy, the state, and the military play in degrading human health and the natural environment.

AB  - Stormwater has immense impacts on urban flooding and water quality, leaving the marginalized and the impoverished disproportionately impacted by and vulnerable to stormwater hazards. However, the environmental health concerns of socially and economically marginalized individuals are largely underestimated. Through regression analysis of data from three longitudinal surveys, this article examines if and how an individual's race, gender, and education level help predict one's concern about and willingness to participate in stormwater management. We found that people of color, women, and less-educated respondents had a greater willingness to participate in stormwater management than White, male, and more-educated respondents, and their concern about local stormwater hazards drove their willingness to participate. Our analysis suggests that physical exposure and high vulnerability to stormwater hazards may shape an individual's concern about and willingness to participate in stormwater management.

AB  - The United States is a racially and ethnically diverse country, but only recently have researchers and scholars paid much attention to the significance of this diversity for natural resource management and. policy. This article reviews the literature on racial discrimination and ethnic differences in valuing and using natural resources. The review indicates that the effects of past and current racial discrimination and ethnocentrism in the natural resource field continue to be felt today, both in individual behavior and in social structures. The review also finds complex linkages between culture and values, natural resource uses; social organization, and ecosystem characteristics that highlight the need for serious attention to racial and ethnic diversity in natural resource management and policy. Ethnocentrism in the natural resource field comes into play in many ways but may be most pernicious in cases of scientific uncertainty when managers and policy makers tend to fall back on culturally and professionally coded models that may have biases built into them. There is a need for greater attention to race and ethnicity by all in the natural resource field, and also for greater diversity among professionals in the field itself. A broader and more inclusive view of natural resource values, use, and management will both better serve a diverse U.S. population and attract more diversity to the natural resource professions.

AB  - The concept of energy sovereignty redefines the priorities for decision making regarding energy systems while encouraging increased reliance on renewable energy technologies like solar. Energy sovereignty involves centering the inherent right of humans and communities to make decisions about the energy systems they use, including decisions about the sources, scales, and forms of ownership that structure energy access. Current U.S energy policy does not center concerns of energy sovereignty, and in many cases may work against it. Policies to enhance energy sovereignty can accelerate electricity decarbonization while also empowering community scale decision making and offering communities control to reduce the myriad externalities associated with the fossil-fuel energy system.

AB  - The Warsaw Loss and Damage Mechanism holds high appeal for complementing actions on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and for delivering needed support for tackling intolerable climate related-risks that will neither be addressed by mitigation nor by adaptation. Yet, negotiations under the UNFCCC are caught between demands for climate justice, understood as compensation, for increases in extreme and slow-onset event risk, and the reluctance of other parties to consider Loss and Damage outside of an adaptation framework. Working towards a jointly acceptable position we suggest an actionable way forward for the deliberations may be based on aligning comprehensive climate risk analytics with distributive and compensatory justice considerations. Our proposed framework involves in a short-medium term, needs-based perspective support for climate risk management beyond countries ability to absorb risk. In a medium-longer term, liability-based perspective we particularly suggest to consider liabilities attributable to anthropogenic climate change and associated impacts. We develop the framework based on principles of need and liability, and identify the policy space for Loss and Damage as composed of curative and transformative measures. Transformative measures, such as managed retreat, have already received attention in discussions on comprehensive climate risk management. Curative action is less clearly defined, and more contested. Among others, support for a climate displacement facility could qualify here. For both sets of measures, risk financing (such as 'climate insurance') emerges as an entry point for further policy action, as it holds potential for both risk management as well as compensation functions. To quantify the Loss and Damage space for specific countries, we suggest as one option to build on a risk layering approach that segments risk and risk interventions according to risk tolerance. An application to fiscal risks in Bangladesh and at the global scale provides an estimate of countries' financial support needs for dealing with intolerable layers of flood risk. With many aspects of Loss and Damage being of immaterial nature, we finally suggest that our broad risk and justice approach in principle can also see application to issues such as migration and preservation of cultural heritage.

The relationship between social work and environmental sustainability: Implications for interdisciplinary practice The Brundtland Commission, formally the World Commission on Environment and Development, established by the United Nations in 1983, links peace, security, development and the environment claiming that war, poverty and structural violence result in the oppression and degradation of the human community as well as the physical environment. Likewise, human rights and social and environmental justice are intertwined, and social work, as a profession that collaborates across disciplines and within communities, is uniquely situated to provide leadership in the field of environmental studies. Its strong focus on human rights, social justice and community building creates a sound base from which to engage in the collaborative, creative, interactional processes required for environmental practice. This article seeks to discern a model for environmental social work within the context of interdisciplinary practice with peace and conflict workers and through the integration of inclusive models of economic development.

AB  - The article explores the historical process of creating unjust environmental conditions in one geographical area in the Finnish capital, Helsinki. The study traces back the decision-making processes about placing environmentally burdensome, communal facilities, such as power plants, waste disposal and other infrastructural facilities. Also the lack of environmental amenities is investigated. The study covers a time period from the latter half of the nineteenth century to the 1980s. The historical analysis of the development of land-use decisions in the city is based on documentary and archival sources about the decision-making processes and it is conducted in the framework of distributive and procedural environmental justice. Four different periods of siting policies are identified. The motives for land-use decisions at each phase reflect geographical, political and historical reasoning. The concept of path dependency is introduced to explain, how environmental injustices were reproduced because of past paths of siting policies locked in subsequent decisions and created a negative twist of accumulating environmental burden.

AB  - There is mounting evidence linking land development and transportation investments to physical activity with resulting implications for chronic disease prevention. Links between the physical environment and health have traditionally focused on harmful exposures such as air pollution, noise, and traffic injury. Given limited funds and competition for how and where investments are made, there is a need to prioritize and target resources to maximize health benefits that can include activity related chronic disease prevention. The ability to apply this evidence to decision making has been limited by the complexity and inconsistency of research methods, and lack of a direct connection with the planning contexts in which decisions are made. Scenario planning tools provide a method to apply evidence with spatial planning decisions at a range of geographic scales. The US Environmental Protection Agency commissioned the development of a National Public Health Assessment Model (N-PHAM). This project utilized built and natural environment data at the block-group level and large population surveys to model the relationships of the environment with several health outcomes for a range of age and income groups. N-PHAM is the first health assessment tool that can connect to multiple existing scenario planning platforms utilizing nationally available data and can be consistently applied nationally. Such tools can empower communities to choose investments that have the greatest potential to improve public health and quality of life, reduce health care costs, and address environmental justice related disparities.

AB  - Systematic research into social inequalities in the distribution of environmental hazards, though well-established in American sociology, has largely not been conducted using quantitative data from developing countries. In this study we consider whether theory and methods developed to test for and explain environmental inequality in the U.S. can be extended to a major developing country such as China. We argue that, due in part to the state's hukou registry system, urban workers in China with an official rural residence may be subject to disproportionate exposure to environmental pollution. We also argue that environmental inequalities in China may be shaped in part by social processes analogous to those which have been held to explain racial differences in pollution exposure in the U.S. In an analysis of the locations and emissions of pollution-producing facilities in China's Jiangsu province, we find that townships with a higher percentage of rural migrants are more likely to be exposed to high levels of air and water pollution. This finding holds even after we control for income and for the presence of "dirty and hard" industries in which rural migrants are most likely to find work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - South African political reform coincided with a global trend in the reform of water resource management. Consequently, South Africa is an excellent case study in the role of water in addressing historic socio-economic inequity while at the same time trying to legislate for sustainable development. Undoing the legacy of more than a century of institutionalised discrimination is a complex undertaking made even more problematic by the fact that water scarcity constraints limit the future South African economic potential. Getting it right is therefore a political necessity and also a necessary condition for the future wellbeing of a country that plays a vital role as the engine of growth on the African continent. This chapter charts the evolution of a fledgling democracy in which water resources management is seen as a vehicle for social and environmental justice as well as a tool for deepening the democratic experience. The case of the Phongolopoort Dam is used to illustrate these complexities.

AB  - Since W. E. B. Du Bois documented the physical and social environments of Philadelphia's predominantly African American Seventh Ward over a century ago, there has been continued interest in understanding the distribution of social and physical environments by racial make-up of communities. Characterization of these environments allows for documentation of inequities, identifies communities which encounter heightened risk, and can inform action to promote health equity. In this paper, we apply and extend Du Bois's approach to examine the contemporary distribution of physical environmental exposures, health risks, and social vulnerabilities in the Detroit metropolitan area, one of the most racially-segregated areas in the United States. We begin by mapping the proximity of sensitive populations to hazardous land uses, their exposure to air pollutants and associated health risks, and social vulnerabilities, as well as cumulative risk (combined proximity, exposure, and vulnerability), across Census tracts. Next, we assess, quantitatively, the extent to which communities of color experience excess burdens of environmental exposures and associated health risks, economic and age-related vulnerabilities, and cumulative risk. The results, depicted in maps presented in the paper, suggest that Census tracts with greater proportions of people of color disproportionately encounter physical environmental exposures, socioeconomic vulnerabilities, and combined risk. Quantitative tests of inequality confirm these distributions, with statistically greater exposures, vulnerabilities, and cumulative risk in Census tracts with larger proportions of people of color. Together, these findings identify communities that experience disproportionate cumulative risk in the Detroit metropolitan area and quantify the inequitable distribution of risk by Census tract relative to the proportion of people of color. They identify clear opportunities for prioritizing communities for legislative, regulatory, policy, and local actions to promote environmental justice and health equity.

AB  - The relationship between urban green spaces (UGS) and residential development is complex: UGS have positive and negative immediate impacts on residents' well-being, residential location choice, housing, and land markets. Property owners and real estate agents might consider how prospective clients perceive UGS and act accordingly, while urban planners influence UGS location and management as well as aim at steering the built environment. Typically, studies focus on one of these perspectives at a time. Here, we provide a synopsis of results from studies, taking different perspectives for a single case study: Leipzig, Germany. We summarise and discuss the findings of eight studies on UGS and residential development. In detail, these studies focus on spatial pattern analysis, hedonic pricing analysis, mixed-methods studies on experts' perspectives, surveys, and choice experiments exploring residents' perceptions of UGS. We reflect on the feasibility of deriving a synthesis out of these independent studies and to what extent context matters. We conclude that both triangulating of data and methods, as well as long-term and context-sensitive studies are needed to explain the interlinkages between UGS and residential development and their context dependency.

AB  - The emergence of an environmental movement in post-apartheid South Africa has involved the reframing of the environment as a 'brown' issue, articulating the discourse of social and environmental justice and a rights-based notion of democracy. Environmental movements have pursued a dual strategy of deliberation and activist opposition. Environmental movements have deployed science to pursue the strategic task of democratic opposition and have established networks of environmental knowledge and expertise. Ecological modernization is the dominant approach to environmental governance and adopts a science-based policy approach. In this context the regulation and management of the environment is premised on the need for science, which provides the authoritative basis for a regulatory response. In local environmental movements, there exists a fundamental tension between a cumulative history of lay knowledge about pollution and the lack of official acknowledgement of qualitative narratives. This is accompanied by a lack and suspicion of reliable official data. Environmental movements have thus employed 'civic science' strategically to place the issue of air pollution on the political agenda. This paper uses the case of environmental politics in Durban to reflect on the ways in which civic science and lay knowledge, together constituting community hybrid knowledge, are produced and disseminated in order to pressure the state and capital. The three ways in which knowledge is deployed are: to frame environmental problems, in strategies of oppositional advocacy, and in deliberative policy forums. Empirical analysis shows that civic science is produced through knowledge networks, and both lay knowledge and civic science are opportunistically used by environmental movements to engage both inside and outside formal policy making arenas. This deployment of hybrid knowledge by environmental movements represents a broader challenge to the power of science and technology based on increasing evidence of the hazards and risks facing ordinary people in their daily lives.

AB  - The CA Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) developed methods to select pesticides and a community to fulfill criteria for an ambient air monitoring study it conducted as part of the CA Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Justice Action Plan. Using a scoring system, CDPR evaluated 100 pesticides based on statewide-reported pesticide use, volatility, and priority in CDPR's risk assessment process (indicators of exposure and toxicity) to produce a list of pesticides to consider as candidates for monitoring. The CDPR also evaluated and scored 83 communities based on demographics and health factors, availability of cumulative impacts data, and reported pesticide use to create a list of community candidates. The scores provide relative rankings to distinguish more highly impacted communities from less impacted ones and to identify which pesticides might contribute most to potential adverse health effects. These methods use criteria that can be quantified, validated, and verified in order to provide a transparent and fair selection process. Based on public comments and highest scores, CDPR recommended 40 pesticides (including some of their degradation products) and one community for its yearlong monitoring study. The CDPR then further refined its list of pesticides by soliciting input from local and technical advisory groups. The CDPR plans to use these methods to select pesticides and communities in future monitoring activities.

AB  - The distribution of urban ecosystem services (UES) is often uneven across socioeconomic groups, leading to environmental justice issues. Understanding the distribution of UES across a landscape can help managers ensure an equitable distribution of services. While many past studies have focused on the distribution of green spaces in relation to socioeconomic variables, this research analyzes the distribution of UES provided by these green spaces. This research quantified air pollution removal, atmospheric carbon reduction, and surface runoff mitigation provided by urban trees in Strasbourg city (France). The provision of these three UES was studied at the census block scale by creating an index of UES delivery, which was contrasted with a constructed social deprivation index. Our results show that there is no significant association between the delivery of UES and social deprivation. Some deprived populations benefit from high UES delivery. Results also suggest that mapping associations between UES delivery and social deprivation should be integrated with future development plans to enhance the equitable distribution of UES. This study provides insights into the French context where studies about the distribution of UES at a small-area level remain lacking.

AB  - The tremendous global toll of the COVID-19 pandemic does not fall equally on all populations. Indeed, this crisis has exerted more severe impacts on the most vulnerable communities, spotlighting the continued consequences of longstanding structural, social, and healthcare inequities. This disparity in COVID-19 parallels the unequal health consequences of climate change, whereby underlying inequities perpetuate adverse health outcomes disproportionately among vulnerable populations. As these two crises continue to unfold, there is an urgent need for healthcare practitioners to identify and implement solutions to mitigate adverse health outcomes, especially in the face of global crises. To support this need, the 2021 Clinical Climate Change Conference held a virtual meeting to discuss the implications of the convergence of the climate crisis and COVID-19, particularly for vulnerable patient populations and the clinicians who care for them. Presenters and panelists provided evidence-based solutions to help health professionals improve and adapt their practice to these evolving scenarios. Together, participants explored the community health system and national solutions to reduce the impacts of COVID-19 and the climate crisis, to promote community advocacy, and foster new partnerships between community and healthcare leaders to combat systemic racism and achieve a more just and equitable society.

AB  - The 2030 Agenda has influenced the design of public policies in Colombia and other countries in the region, but there are many gaps in the way a global policy can be interpreted and adapted to the territories. Thus, this article aims to critically evaluate the public policy of sustainability implemented in the Colombian Caribbean and to suggest contributions from an intercultural socioenvironmental justice perspective. For this purpose, the public policy of sustainability that orients the plans for the use of insular ecosystems in Cartagena de Indias has been examined and confronted with local evidence that shows significant changes in the forms of life and ecological degradation in multi-temporally analysed coverages. Methodologically, this research is based on three aspects: the theoretical discussion of the notions of sustainability and justice in public policies, spatial databases to analyse the transformation of landscapes and ethnographic work with Afro-descendant peoples to recognise their socioecological systems. We found that the public policy of territorial planning aligned with the 2030 Agenda nominally includes a rights approach, but management practices or governance structures do not consider the very high asymmetry in land tenure, the growing private and non-participatory regulation of coasts and the sea or the exclusion of Afro-descendant peoples who claim tenure and autonomy rights. Then, we propose integrated dimensions of sustainability that overcome the socioecological negativity observed and articulate criteria of intercultural justice in public, social and environmental policies.

AB  - Southern California is the largest international trade gateway in the United States. The region generates enormous activity involving the movement of local and domestic goods. Given the expected growth in international trade and movement of domestic goods, significant growth in truck volumes and rail traffic to facilitate the reliable movement of goods and to support economic growth is anticipated in the region. As the movement of goods is a major contributor to local and regional environmental issues such as air pollution and health risk, a regional priority is not only to mitigate the environmental impacts of the system involving the movement of goods but also to ensure that, pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, equity exists in the distribution of environmental benefits and burdens from federally funded programs involving the movement of goods and projects. Therefore, to prevent disproportionately high and adverse environmental effects and health risks from affecting minority and low-income populations as a result of the movement of goods, the Southern California Association of Governments analyzed the environmental justice implications of the system involving the movement of goods included in the regional transportation plan. The objective of this paper is to identify the minority and low-income populations affected, to analyze their spatial distributions along major truck corridors and freight rail corridors, and to address the environmental justice implications of the system involving the movement of goods in Southern California.

AB  - Susceptibility is well-recognized as a potentially important aspect of health risk assessment, particularly for groups such as pregnant women and their fetuses, infants, children, the elderly, and the infirm, that are known or suspected to be more vulnerable to environmental insults. More recently, it has become apparent that economically disadvantaged groups are likely to be systematically both more exposed and more susceptible to environmental pollution. This article reviews the reasons why low-income communities and many racial minorities are at an increased risk because they are more susceptible to the adverse health effects of toxic chemicals. The scientific challenges of quantifying the magnitude of environmental health risks for these groups are discussed, emphasizing ramifications for risk assessment and risk management decisions. Problems incorporating susceptibility into risk-based decision making are identified, and specific actions are recommended to address these deficiencies. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The term "environmental justice" is a relatively recent addition to the lexicon of public health and risk-based decision making. Although it is currently a prominent public policy issue, there is no consensus-derived definition, nor is there general agreement about viable mechanisms for putting worthwhile social goals (e.g., fairness, equity, and justice) into operation. Nevertheless, the concept of environmental justice has focused attention on important questions of whether economically and politically disadvantaged communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution, and whether past environmental policies, programs and practices have been fair and equitable. Among individuals and organizations involved with issues of environmental justice there is a spectrum of strong and often contradictory convictions about the nature and role of risk assessment. Critics are convinced it is part of the problem and are inclined to see it as an ethically suspect, resource-intensive, elitist, never-ending process used to maintain the status quo. Advocates, on the other hand, contend that risk assessment is an essential policy and regulatory tool for identifying, evaluating, and resolving instances of environmental injustice, and that it provides a unifying conceptual framework and a common language for constructive dialogue on the issue. This article argues that, in practice, risk assessment has contributed to both the reality and the perception of environmental justice problems because of the overly narrow and restricted manner in which it has been applied. In principle, however, risk assessment is part of the solution to environment injustices because it provides a beneficial construct for framing key questions and fostering constructive debate about how to answer them. Well-designed research studies and high-quality risk assessments are necessary to define the dimensions of the problem, to understand the root causes, and to identify effective, efficient, and equitable solutions. Ultimately, attaining the goal of environmental justice depends on putting risk assessment principles into practice.

AB  - Systematic evaluation of cumulative health risks from the combined effects of multiple environmental stressors is becoming a vital component of risk-based decisions aimed at protecting human populations and communities. This article briefly examines the historical development of cumulative risk assessment as an analytical tool, and discusses current approaches for evaluating cumulative health effects from exposure to both chemical mixtures and combinations of chemical and nonchemical stressors. A comparison of stressor-based and effects-based assessment methods is presented, and the potential value of focusing on viable risk management options to limit the scope of cumulative evaluations is discussed. The ultimate goal of cumulative risk assessment is to provide answers to decision-relevant questions based on organized scientific analysis; even if the answers, at least for the time being, are inexact and uncertain.

AB  - The School Health Initiative: Environment, Learning, Disease (SHIELD) study is a novel school-based investigation of children's environmental health in economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods of Minneapolis. This article describes the study design and summarizes lessons learned about recruiting and monitoring this historically understudied population. The SHIELD study focused on measuring children's exposures to multiple environmental stressors [volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), environmental tobacco smoke, allergens, bioaerosols, metals, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), phthalates] and exploring related effects on respiratory health (e.g., lung function) and learning outcomes (e.g., standardized test scores, academic achievement). It involved intensive exposure monitoring, including environmental measurements inside and outside the children's schools and inside their homes, personal measurements with passive dosimeters worn by the children, and biological marker measurements in blood and urine. The SHIELD participants comprised a stratified random sample of 153 "index" children and 51 of their siblings enrolled in grades 2-5 at two adjacent elementary schools. The Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) assisted with identifying, contacting, recruiting, and monitoring this population, which traditionally is difficult to study because families/children are highly mobile, speak a diversity of languages, frequently do not have a telephone, endure economic hardships, often do not trust researchers, and have a spectrum of unconventional lifestyles and living arrangements. Using a school-based approach, the overall SHIELD enrollment (response) rate was 56.7%, with a wide disparity between English-speaking (41.7%) and non-English-speaking (71.0%) families/children. Most children remained involved in die study through both monitoring sessions and exhibited an acceptable degree of compliance with study protocols, including providing blood and urine samples. Results indicate that it is both practical and affordable to conduct probability-based exposure studies in this population, but that it is also important to improve our understanding of factors (e.g., cultural, economic, psychological, social) affecting the willingness of families/children to participate in such studies, with special emphasis on developing cost-effective recruitment methods.

AB  - There is strong presumptive evidence that people living in poverty and certain racial and ethnic groups bear a disproportionate burden of environmental health risk. Many have argued that conducting formal assessments of the health risk experienced by affected communities is both unnecessary and counterproductive-that instead of analyzing the situation our efforts should be devoted to fixing obvious problems and rectifying observable wrongs. We contend that formal assessment of cumulative health risks from combined effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors is a valuable tool to aid decision makers in choosing risk management options that are effective, efficient, and equitable. If used properly, cumulative risk assessment need not impair decision makers' discretion, nor should it be used as an excuse for doing nothing in the face of evident harm. Good policy decisions require more than good intentions; they necessitate analysis of risk-related information along with careful consideration of economic issues, ethical and moral principles, legal precedents, political realities, cultural beliefs, societal values, and bureaucratic impediments.

AB  - The protection of natural rivers and watersheds face important concerns related to environmental (in) justice and (in) equity. Using the Queensland Wild Rivers Act as a case study, we advocate that ethical water governance attends to multiple and diverse values, specifically in ways that: (i) locate them within stakeholders' claims of inequality that emerge from a given or practiced water ethic; and (ii) historicize and understand them as resonating or reflecting natural resource management frameworks that have led to structural injustices. This approach, combined with adaptive co-governance, can contribute to more inclusive water ethics and even support reflexive spaces where radical change in social-ecological resource governance can be imagined.

AB  - Since the December 2011 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties 17 in Durban and the Rio+20 Summit on Sustainable Development, attention has turned to whether the 'Green Economy', the concept of 'natural capital' and 'Payment for Ecosystem Services' together facilitate the management of new environmentally-financialised markets whose aim is to price nature and its pollution, so as to achieve maximally efficient exploitation of resources (an example of which is carbon trading). Alternatively, if there are flaws in such markets, should society instead move towards retributive payments for 'ecological debt' based on both 'loss and damage' accounting (introduced at the UNFCCC COP18 in Doha) and environmental justice, in order that the valuing of nature is limited to fines for damages and then prohibitions on further pollution. These two countervailing philosophies play out in high-profile projects and pilot social-policy schemes in southern Africa, in ways that will teach the world foundational concepts surrounding ecological reparations.

AB  - Social work has developed to meet the needs of an industrializing society. As environmental concerns have increased, national, and international social work organizations have called on social workers to incorporate issues of the environment into their professional practice. Although there is a small body of literature related to social work and the environment, the profession has not fully embraced the need to incorporate these issues into social work education or practice. This cross-sectional survey in the United States of a random sample of National Association of Social Workers (NASW) members (n = 373) was designed to gauge the environmental knowledge and attitudes of social work professionals. Findings: Though social work shares many of the same underlying tenets of groups interested in environmental justice, results suggest that social workers as a profession are no more, nor less, environmentally friendly than the general population. Applications: By failing to incorporate ecological issues facing the United States and abroad, our current social policies are at best not sustainable, and at worst dangerous for our continued social well-being. Social workers can play a leading role through an understanding of the interrelationship that exists between people and the environment, the integration of environmental issues into their social work practice, and advocating for vulnerable populations.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which the existence of a polycentric climate governance regime in Pakistan has enabled diverse framings of climate justice to emerge and be operationalized within policymaking. A two-part analysis is conducted through systematic coding and textual analysis of interview transcripts and policy documents. Firstly, an analysis based on climate justice framings reveals that, whilst national governmental actors predominantly adopt an international framing of climate justice, non-state actors have increasingly adopted vulnerability, human rights and transformational framings of justice, thereby supporting the theory that polycentricity is widening the space for voicing diverse framings. Secondly, a polycentric governance-based analysis reveals that several institutional barriers limit the ability of non-state actors to operationalize these framings, particularly capacity and resource constraints, limits of scale and scope, changing legislation and the unequivocal power held by the state. Hence, Pakistan's overarching climate change strategy prioritizes justice between countries, while obscuring domestic inequalities, poverty and vulnerability, which are only addressed by non-state actors through isolated activities rather than in a coordinated manner within national policy. This finding suggests that polycentric governance can diversify climate discourse, but also that the intergovernmental climate regime may reinforce the nation state's international framings of justice at the expense of domestic justice concerns. Key policy insights Non-state actors within the polycentric climate governance regime in Pakistan are increasingly adopting framings of climate justice beyond those of the nation state, thereby bringing attention to issues of domestic poverty, inequality and vulnerability. Differences in power between state and non-state actors limit the extent to which different justice issues can be addressed through nationally and internationally-led climate policy. There are limitations to the ability of national-level polycentric climate governance regimes, when embedded in intergovernmental negotiations, to engage in redistributing power and advocating for different framings and dimensions of justice being raised by local actors.

AB  - Sustainability is the main challenge for humanity. The current climate crisis and growing inequality are both the direct consequence of human choices and activities, particularly through the corporation. Addressing these challenges requires clarity on what we mean by sustainability and justice and precisely how the corporation contributes to the situation. Both sustainability and justice have geographic and time dimensions. Law, however, is limited because it is largely jurisdictionally based and corporate law is heavily short-term orientated. This set of circumstances creates an imperative to consider how the issue can be resolved including changes to the long-standing institutions of corporate law. This paper considers the sustainability challenges and places them in the context of justice. It argues for corporate reforms of board and shareholder structures such that rights and duties are redistributed to parties with greater interests in sustainability and justice. It then explores how that could be done and the corporation re-normed to better serve society.

However, there have been serendipitous outcomes from the associated lockdowns ranging from improved air quality to reductions in carbon emissions. Liu et al. (2022, ) revealed that even the magnitude of the heat islands in Chinese cities were reduced due to a decline in human activities and their associated anthropogenic contributions. These surprising findings have significant implications for understanding intersections among climate, health, energy, urban planning, transportation, and infrastructure.

AB  - There is growing interest in the role of psychosocial stress in health disparities. Identifying which social stressors are most important to community residents is critical for accurately incorporating stressor exposures into health research. Using a community-academic partnered approach, we designed a multi-community study across the five boroughs of New York City to characterize resident perceptions of key neighborhood stressors. We conducted 14 community focus groups; two to three in each borough, with one adolescent group and one Spanish-speaking group per borough. We then used systematic content analysis and participant ranking data to describe prominent neighborhood stressors and identify dominant themes. Three inter-related themes regarding the social and structural sources of stressful experiences were most commonly identified across neighborhoods: (1) physical disorder and perceived neglect, (2) harassment by police and perceived safety and (3) gentrification and racial discrimination. Our findings suggest that multiple sources of distress, including social, political, physical and economic factors, should be considered when investigating health effects of community stressor exposures and psychological distress. Community expertise is essential for comprehensively characterizing the range of neighborhood stressors that may be implicated in psychosocial exposure pathways.

AB  - The uneven geographical distribution of environmental pathogens and salutogens, as well as the political, social, and cultural antecedents leading to this sociospatial arrangement, have been posited as a partial explanation for the stark inequalities in health across many high-income nations. Whilst there is significant international evidence for the maldistribution of health-related environmental features, few studies have examined the material outcomes (including health) of this unequal environmental 'exposure'. In this paper we utilise the theoretical stances offered by work in the fields of environmental justice and socioecological models of health to consider the pathway between physical environmental deprivation and health. We consider the influence of multiple aspects of the 'natural' physical environment on individual-level levels of physical activity-both utilitarian and physical activity for leisure. We found that, for physical activity conducted for recreational purposes, there is a strong relationship with the natural physical environment: those living in the least deprived physical environments are most likely to engage in physical activity. However, for utilitarian physical activity, physical activity whose primary purpose is not the activity itself, we observed increased levels in the most environmentally deprived areas. Finally, the important role that the environment may play in shaping capabilities, particularly during the current economic and political climate, is recognised. Our results show that the environment matters and that rhetoric regarding 'lifestyle choice' needs to be viewed in a broader environmental context.

AB  - The Paris Agreement on climate change recognizes, reluctantly albeit, the importance of climate justice' in its Preamble. Despite a change from a top-down burden-sharing approach to a bottom-up pledge and review regime, concerns of distributive justice remain central to the evolution of climate research, regime, and policy. The Paris Agreement also proposes a new market-based mechanism to promote ambition. Reasserting the unavoidability of climate justice' concerns, and responding to the suggestion that the proposed new market-based mechanism could learn from the experience of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), this paper argues that such a recommendation should be tested against a comprehensive understanding of compatibility between justice and the market. This paper postulates that both justice and the market have institutional underpinnings, which embed them into deeper, and interconnected, layers of values and relations. Arguing that climate justice' is best understood as an agreed ensemble of values,' we propose that the architecture of the UNFCCC in which these values are articulated, negotiated, and agreed upon needs to be conceptualized as consisting of four distinct, but evolving, institutional spheres: ambition, obligations and entitlements, mechanisms, and deliberation. The approach is illustrated using the case of the CDM, and implications are suggested for the proposed market-based mechanism under the Paris Agreement. The paper argues that the concerns of climate justice' have multiple institutional dimensions, and the market-based mechanisms may contribute to realizing certain dimensions of climate justice,' while considerably subverting others. The extent of both outcomes depends greatly on the agreed' conception of justice, design of mechanisms, and capabilities of the participants. Our findings suggest a judicious combination of non-market mechanisms with the market-based mechanisms would better serve the desired goal.

AB  - The consumption of energy services for everyday mobility and domestic life is a fundamental precondition for participating in many contemporary societies, but it can also impact upon current and future generations in ways that raise questions of equity and fairness. Whilst the field of 'energy justice' has become more established in recent years, much work remains to be done to further this area of study. In this lead article for a Special Issue on 'Energy demand for mobility and domestic life: new insights from energy justice', we begin by outlining the many interlocking issues of (in) justice raised by energy consumption for mobility and domestic services, identifying gaps in the current literature. We then describe the articles within the Special Issue, discussing these in relation to three themes: uneven access to energy and transport services; the unequal burdens of low-carbon policies; and reducing energy demand and the good society. We conclude by highlighting potential directions for future research; for example, conceptualising 'excessive' consumption as an issue of (in) justice, and identifying low-energy social practices and arrangements that simultaneously contribute to human well-being.

AB  - Substantial funding is being allocated to new land protection and access to protected open space for marginalized communities is a crucial concern. Using New England as a study area, we show striking disparities in the distribution of protected open space across multiple dimensions of social marginalization. Using a quartile-based approach within states, we find that communities in the lowest income quartile have just 52% as much nearby protected land as those in the most affluent quartile. Similarly, communities with the highest proportions of people of color have just 47% as much protected land as those in the lowest quartile. These disparities persist across both public and private protected land, within urban, exurban and rural communities, for different sized buffers around communities, and across time. To help address these disparities in future conservation plans, we develop a screening tool to identify and map communities with high social marginalization and low nearby protected open space within each state. We then show that areas prioritized according to these environmental justice (EJ) criteria are substantially different from areas prioritized according to conventional conservation criteria. This demonstrates how incorporating EJ criteria in conservation prioritization processes could shift patterns of future land protection. Our work provides methods that can be used broadly across regions to inform conservation efforts.

AB  - The Paris Agreement articulates a global goal on adaptation, which aims to ensure an 'adequate adaptation response' to the 'global temperature goal', and requires countries to report progress through periodic global stocktakes. However, there remain conceptual and methodological challenges in defining an adaptation goal and mixed evidence on what effective adaptation looks like and how it can be enabled. In this review, we demonstrate how different normative views on adaptation outcomes, arising from different epistemological and disciplinary entry points, can lead to very different interpretations of adaptation effectiveness. We argue that how effectiveness is framed will significantly impact adaptation implementation and outcomes. This, furthermore, represents a way of exercising influence in adaptation decision-making. Eleven principles of effective adaptation are distilled as a way to pluralize guidance in international processes such as the Global Stocktake as well as national and sub-national exercises on tracking and monitoring adaptation.

AB  - Struggles for Environmental Justice, more widespread in the global South, are often framed as traditional societies defending "old ways of life"; while degrowth, a relatively new movement in the global North is seen as striving for a "new ways of life." I argue that both assert or aspire for other ways of being and belonging to the world and open possibilities for post-capitalist futures. In this Commentary, I focus on ontological continuities between the two movements and the grounds for alliance building. I argue that EJ and degrowth movements need to not only learn from each other, but think with the actual practices on the ground and the epistemologies of the South to foster pluriversal world-making practices. Moreover, dialogues and alliance between the two movements can help to reconceptualize work and care in a post-production, post-growth world.

AB  - Since the mid-1970s the forested area of Klity Creek, northwest of Bangkok, suffered from one of the worst cases of industrial pollution in Thailand caused by a floating lead mine that operated in the area. Toxic waste found its way into the stream, used for daily food and water consumption by the local (Pwo-) speaking Karen villagers. After an NGO came to their aid, introducing the Karen villagers to the environmental justice movement of Thailand, the villagers came to seek redress. They demanded pharmacological intervention from the Ministry of Public Health. The intervention they received was "health surveillance," which led them to reject the treatment offered. This article focuses on the protest as well as the gap between medical intervention and the experiential needs of people suffering from environmental illness as well as the role of civic activism in framing the issue of illness.

AB  - Storm surges, flooding, heatwaves, and prolonged drought, as ever more regular features of life under deteriorating climate conditions, are unmistakably violent. Their effects on the lives of vulnerable human populations and ecosystems across the world are widely known to be devastating. Yet a legal order that denies the victims of such ecological persecution safe haven, no matter how great its use of force (e.g., detention, arrest, forced return) cannot, by definition, be violent. The power of law, used to protect states' rights to exclude from their jurisdictions growing numbers displaced involuntarily by global climate harms, in being a source of legitimate right', is never the same as violence. This article challenges the ongoing validity of this assumption. It points to some of the ways in which legal instruments are used today to deny those displaced by climatic conditions sufficient normative status to guarantee their safety. What is needed instead is a new critical normative understanding of the evolving relationship between climate change, violence, justice, and law, one that re-assesses the democratic justificatory grounds for the current positions of non-responsibility for the climate displaced whilst re-affirming such people's legal and political status as equal co-members of the politically constituted international community of humanity.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created opportunities for cities to close streets to automobile traffic in the name of public health. Although these interventions promise numerous benefits, neighborhood activists and scholars of color suggest they can perpetuate structurally racist inequities. In this Viewpoint, we implore planners and other city builders to think critically about the impact of these interventions by employing an environmental justice framework. Applying this framework in the open streets context exposes several potential paradoxes that arise. We conclude with a set of best practices that can help city builders transcend these paradoxes and extend this livability revolution to all.

I integrate manufacturing decline in metropolitan areas into the study of environmental inequality by using data on industrial air pollution in 1990, 2000, and 2010. I test to see if an indicator of change in the number of manufacturing workers in a metropolitan area from 1970 to each of the three study years is associated with more or less industrially produced toxic emissions. Findings show, somewhat counterintuitively, that metropolitan areas that have had a larger drop in manufacturing work are linked to greater industrial air pollution and that these findings hold in all U.S. regions except the West. Implications focus on how the indelible imprint of manufacturing history may condition contemporary pollution levels.

AB  - The scale of contemporary environmental risks suggests that they should be managed at the societal level, but neoliberal planning transfers some responsibility for their management to individuals. Devolution of these responsibilities ignores disparities in individual capacity to address or contest risk scenarios. Abandoning risk management to market forces disregards discrimination in planning processes, thereby ignoring the needs of socio-economic groups which are unable to participate equally within an increasingly marketised and scientised debate. Through an examination of a contaminated land crisis in the cities of Auckland, New Zealand, we illustrate how newly responsibilised individuals do not possess the financial resources to influence both their exposure to risk and risk management decisions. Obliging individuals to undertake risk avoidance measures in the absence of such resources has been employed by local authorities to evade responsibility and to reduce the cost of research and remediation. This not only responsibilises those who are least able to respond to problems which are not of their own making, it also fails to address the underlying causes of risk exposure.

AB  - The research presented here weighs the ability of two major explanations of social inequality-Massey and Denton's racial segregation explanation and Wilson's emphasis on economic deprivation (concentrated poverty)-to predict environmental inequality. Two sets of logistic regression analyses are used to predict the location of Superfund sites in Portland, Oregon and Detroit, Michigan providing a conditional understanding of environmental inequality within a larger sociological context. The analysis includes a general examination of the two theories in all census tracts in both cities and a set of analyses focusing upon Black neighborhoods in Detroit. The findings indicate that there is support for explanations of environmental inequality that include both racial segregation and economic deprivation, but that the more powerful of the two is economic deprivation. The results suggest that even though African-American neighborhoods disproportionately house Superfund sites, these facilities are more likely to be located in Black neighborhoods that are economically deprived.

AB  - The social cost of carbon (SCC) is an estimate of the costs that society will incur because of the emission of one tonne of CO2. Because of the large uncertainties in the effects of climate change and the subjectivity of the discount rate, estimates of SCC range widely, from - 10.2 to 105 213$ t(-1)in 2010 USD. Despite this range, the SCC has been used or proposed as a basis for a wide variety of policymaking including cost-benefit analysis and carbon taxes. The SCC suffers from several practical and philosophical weaknesses: it is anthropocentric, it neglects the acidification of oceans, it assumes that quantifiable economic variables like GDP are the primary costs that humans will experience from climate change, and it is impossible to quantify objectively. Further, the ethical implications of a carbon pricing policy include both the value of the carbon price, and the use of revenues generated by the policy. Thus, revenue neutral carbon policies as in some SCC-based proposals, are unlikely to be just. Here, we propose that the cost of emerging negative-emission technologies would be an alternative means for setting a carbon price and avoid these philosophical and practical weaknesses.

AB  - The Paris Climate agreement of 2015 implies that a large portion of the world's coal, oil, and gas resources must be left non-combusted in order to meet the goal of limiting climate change to 2 degrees C. As a result of this commitment, some of the national and corporate owners of fossil fuel reserves will be required to leave their reserves in the ground. However, which reserves should be left in the ground, and when and how should reserve-owners be compensated? Using the oil reserves in Uganda's Albertine Graben as a case study, we show that Ugandan oil development is likely to be cost-effective but unlikely to be consistent with the Paris Treaty commitments. We argue that Western nations should compensate Uganda for their foregone oil revenues and we propose a mechanism called "climate easements" for such compensation.

AB  - The province of Ontario has shown great commitment towards the development of renewable energy and, specifically, wind power. Fuelled by the Green Energy Act (GEA) of 2009, the Province has emerged as Canada's leader in wind energy development (WED). Nonetheless, Ontario's WED trajectory is characterized by social conflicts, particularly around environmental health. Utilizing the Social Amplification of Risk Framework, this paper presents an eight-year longitudinal media content analysis conducted to understand the role Ontario's media may be playing in both reflecting and shaping public perceptions of wind turbine health risks. We find that before and after the GEA, instances of health risk amplification were far greater than attenuations in both quantity and quality. Discourses that amplified turbine health risks often simultaneously highlighted injustices in the WED process, especially after the GEA. Based on these findings, we suggest that Ontario's media may be amplifying perceptions of wind turbine health risks within the public domain. We conclude with policy recommendations around public engagement for more just WED.

AB  - The present study identified the various zones vulnerable to urban flood in Cochin City, one of the biggest metro cities on the southwest coast of peninsular India. The analysis and assessment of vulnerability was done through the application of multi-criteria evaluation approach in a geographical information system environment with inputs from remotely sensed images. Other input data sources include SRTM DEM, census details, city maps and field study. Flood vulnerability mapping in the study area is fundamental in flood risk management. Among the three vulnerability zones, the very high and high vulnerable zones together constituted 8.6 % of the total area of the city. The major factors contributed are the blockage of drainage channels and the proximity to coastal waters where there is influence of tides.

AB  - Spiritual ecology explores the interface of religions and spiritualities on the one hand, and environments, ecologies, and environmentalisms on the other. As an international environmental movement, spiritual ecology involves a multitude of diverse leaders, organizations, and initiatives. They share a common concern and commitment to pursuing the vital role of religion and spirituality in environmentalism to complement secular approaches to environmental problems and issues from the local to the global levels. Here, after some background, spiritual ecology as a component of the phenomena of international environmental movements is exemplified through three cases: the Green Belt Movement beginning in Kenya, the Green Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Alliance of Religions and Conservation affiliate of the World Wide Fund for Nature (formerly World Wildlife Fund).

AB  - The UK's Climate Change Act offers a framework for civil society to achieve 'low carbon' realignment through to 2050. The Act is reviewed for its coherence as a mechanism for directing future policy. The legislation establishes a carbon budgetary process, mandates greenhouse gas reduction targets and strategies, and imposes a novel range of duties supported by processes for ensuring transparency concerning progress. Following an overview of climate change risks and likely economic consequences, the analysis identifies selected regulatory strategies. It explores the main statutory features, with an emphasis upon the implications of imposing mandatory duties on decision makers. An evaluation of the key policy choice of emissions trading is informed by perspectives of environmental justice, in particular as to questions of equitable burden-sharing in relation to impacts of climate change and related policies. A concluding section summarises reasonable expectations and ongoing challenges.

AB  - The distribution of conservation effort on the landscape is affected by both ecological and social priorities and constraints. Together these influences can result in bias towards certain types of ecological or human communities. We evaluate the distribution of restoration projects on the California Central Coast, USA, to evaluate sociopolitical and biophysical influences on the type and distribution of one type of conservation effort. We compiled data on 699 sites with publicly funded stream restoration and management projects completed in the past 30 years and the biophysical and sociopolitical characteristics of the 310 sub-catchments in our study area. Our database contains three categories of stream projects: ecological restoration to benefit natural ecosystems, human-oriented projects to enhance ecosystem services, and data collection projects for planning and monitoring. Both ecological and human-oriented restoration efforts were clustered near the coastline. Stream activities of all kinds were highest in sub-catchments with water quality impairment, high population density, high pro-environmental voting, and a highly educated, wealthy, non-Hispanic white population. Ecological restoration and data collection were also greater in catchments with higher native fish richness. Our findings indicate that restoration activity is aligned with, and perhaps responding to, ecological need, and that restoration efforts are concentrated near human population centers and restoration organizations. Disparities in conservation effort by income, race, and education are concerning and should be evaluated in more depth and in other regions.

AB  - The adoption in 2018 of the Escazu Agreement by the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region marks the second regional legal instrument aimed at the implementation of Principle 10 of the 1992 Rio Declaration, joining the Aarhus Convention of the pan-European region. The international community has settled upon the regional level as the appropriate means for implementing standards related to access to information, public participation, and access to justice in environmental matters. The appropriateness of the regional level is demonstrated by the differences and innovations found in the Escazu Agreement, in its scope and definitions, background principles, burden of proof and protections of environmental defenders and vulnerable populations. Yet, the regional approach also entails risks, as demonstrated by the limitation of the scope of rights for nationals of the country where specific activities are planned or occurring.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem-based management (EBM) emerged from growing concern around adverse environmental impacts associated with resource management in the late twentieth century. Despite inconsistencies and ambiguities in both definition and implementation, the concept has seen considerable uptake in federal and provincial/state policies. More recently, municipal urban forest plans and programs have been making reference to EBM, yet there is almost no existing research on EBM in urban settings. In this paper, we discuss EBM in the context of urban forest ecosystems. Specifically, we ask three questions: (1) how might the concept of EBM remain relevant and be applied in densely-populated urban settings; (2) what structure and form might EBM take in the management of urban forest ecosystems; and (3) what are some examples of EBM applications in municipal urban forestry? The review is structured around 10 prominent themes from the EBM literature, which are re-negotiated for the urban context and, where necessary, are altered, omitted, or replaced with new themes. We also draw from four complementary cases of EBM in practice in Halifax, Toronto, and Edmonton. The resulting 12 themes of urban forest EBM include: Resilience, hierarchical context, social-ecological boundaries, data and information management, monitoring, adaptive management, interagency cooperation, partnerships and civic engagement, organizational change, social change, environmental justice, and values. Urban forests are important ecosystem service providers, but managers face a host of challenges, ranging from a consistent lack of resources to degraded urban sites. Continued dialogue on best approaches for integrating ecological principles into management is essential.

AB  - The universally dire threat of climate change disproportionately affects marginalized populations, including the over one billion persons with disabilities worldwide. States that disregard the Paris Agreement, or exclude disabled persons from climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, are violating agreed-upon human rights obligations. Notably, the rights contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, are threatened by climate change. To date, however, disability has largely been excluded from international climate change negotiations as well as national-level discharge of climate-related measures. By contrast, a disability human rights approach views disabled persons as disproportionately experiencing environmental threats and unnatural disasters due to their exclusion from state laws, policies, and services available to their non-disabled peers. Additionally, a disability human rights approach mandates the removal of exclusionary barriers and the implementation of positive measures to ensure the equitable treatment of individuals with disabilities. Achieving disability-inclusive climate justice requires "participatory justice"-empowering persons with disabilities to ascertain climate mitigation and adaptation approaches that are efficacious for, successfully implementable by, and accountable to disabled people. Disability-inclusive climate justice solutions are in synergy with universal climate justice goals and benefit entire societies, not "only" those with disabilities.

AB  - The U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) 2021 report on solar geoengineering research is a political intervention in global climate politics. Although the NASEM report explicitly acknowledges the risks of unilateral research without broad-based public participation and global governance, the report minimizes these concerns by recommending that the U.S. act swiftly to establish a publicly funded national research program. By providing details for how the research program should be designed, the report contradicts its own recommendations for an inclusive and international process. By mainstreaming solar geoengineering, the report risks increasing the likelihood of international conflict and unilateral deployment, and further exacerbates delays in prioritizing other climate actions. Instead of expanding research on global manipulation of the earth's climate, the United States, like other countries around the world, should commit to multilateral, coordinated efforts to phase out fossil fuels, advance global climate action, and invest in climate justice.

AB  - The disparities in the burden of ill health caused by environmental risks should be an important consideration beyond their aggregate population effects. We used comparative risk assessment methods to calculate the mortality effects of unsafe water and sanitation, indoor air pollution from household solid fuel use, and ambient urban particulate matter pollution in Mexico. We also estimated the disparities in mortality caused by each risk factor, across municipios (counties) of residence and by municipio socioeconomic status (SES). Data sources for the analysis were the national census, population-representative health surveys, and air quality monitoring for risk factor exposure; systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies for risk factor effects; and vital statistics for disease-specific mortality. During 2001-2005, unsafe water and sanitation, household solid fuel use, and urban particulate matter pollution were responsible for 3,000, 3,600, and 7,600 annual deaths, respectively. Annual child mortality rates would decrease by 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 per 1,000 children, and life expectancy would increase by 1.0, 1.2, and 2.4 months, respectively, in the absence of these environmental exposures. Together, these risk factors caused 10.6% of child deaths in the lowest-SES communities (0.9 deaths per 1,000 children), but only 4.0% in communities in the highest-SES ones (0.1 per 1,000). In the 50 most-affected municipios, these 3 exposures were responsible for 3.2 deaths per 1,000 children and a 10-month loss of life expectancy. The large disparities in the mortality effects of these 3 environmental risks should form the basis of interventions and environmental monitoring programs.

AB  - The scope and meaning of terms like African American Studies, Black Studies, and Africana Studies have evolved continually since the field was established in schools, colleges, and universities in the late 1960s. Discourse about the economic conditions of people of African descent has always constituted an important dimension of the Black intellectual tradition that Africana Studies seeks to preserve and extend. Significant barriers exist, however, to collaboration between economists and Africana Studies specialists. Opportunities to collaborate across the disciplines arise in addressing issues such as hyper-unemployment, pervasive poverty, environmental racism, Black land loss, and the plight of Black farmers. The author suggests that efforts by Africana Studies specialists to understand many of the current dynamics could be enhanced through collaboration with those economists attempting to develop the subfield of stratification economics.

AB  - Some peri-urban African-American communities in North Carolina remain excluded from nearby municipal water service, forcing them to rely on unregulated private wells. Despite evidence of elevated drinking water contamination risks in these communities, water monitoring is rare. To identify factors influencing decisions to test private wells, we developed and administered a survey to residents of affected areas. A factor analysis identified three constructs significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of water testing: (1) the misconception that contaminants can be detected by sensory perception, (2) concerns about costs of testing and/or water treatment, and (3) not knowing how to get a water test or having time to do so. Increased knowledge about how to test and the importance of testing was significantly associated with a decreased concern about costs which, in turn, was significantly associated with an increased odds of testing. These results suggest the need for targeted risk communications that correct the misperception that contaminants can be tasted, smelled, or seen. The results also suggest the need for clear information about how to get a water test and for low-cost testing programs. Increased monitoring could empower residents to take protective actions and potentially mobilize political support for water service extensions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Arctic is one of the most radically altered parts of the world due to climate change, with significant social and cultural impacts as a result. Using discourse network analysis and qualitative textual analysis of articles published in the Globe and Mail and National Post during the period 2006 to 2010, we identify and analyze key frames that interpret the implications of climate change on the Arctic. We examine Canadian national news media coverage to ask: How does the Arctic enter media coverage of climate change? Is there evidence of a climate justice discourse in relation to regional disparities in the risks and harms of climate change between northern and southern Canada? Climate change in the Arctic is often framed through the lens of Canadian national interests, which downplays climate-related social impacts that are already occurring at subnational political and geographical scales.

AB  - The authors examine environmentalists' attribution of responsibility for addressing climate change and their beliefs about solutions to this problem. Their analysis is based on responses to open-ended questions completed by 1,227 members of nine different environmental organizations. For these environmental movement participants, the federal government is seen as most responsible for addressing climate change. Government leadership is necessary because it has the power to set regulations and lead corporations and citizens toward pro-environmental behavior. However, a substantial number of participants also assert that "individuals are the driving force" in dealing with climate change. In this framework, individuals can take responsibility either through making lifestyle changes, or through applying pressure to government and businesses as citizens and consumers. Corporations are interpreted as unwilling to change on their own but must be coerced into becoming more environmentally sustainable by a strong state.

AB  - There is a renewed interest in expanding domestic oil and gas development in the United Kingdom (UK). However, the potential social consequences of this expansion are still unknown. Thus, the current study assesses whether the number of spudded oil and gas wells are correlated with violent and property crime rates within 69 local authorities between 2004 and 2015 (n = 828). Fixed effects regression analyses indicate that wells are positively correlated with violent crime rates. That is, each additional well is associated with a 1.5% increase in violent crime. When the analysis is limited to those local authorities that have constructed the most wells, the correlation between wells and crime increases as the boomtown literature might suggest. In particular, each additional well is associated with a 4.9% increase in violent crime and a 4.9% increase in property crime. We conclude by pointing out that this study stands as the first to empirically examine the relationship between oil and gas development and crime within UK local authorities over time and suggest that results have important implications for crime, social disorganisation and environmental justice.

AB  - Studies of environmental injustice have been intensely scrutinized by social science researchers since the publication of the United Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice report entitled Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States in 1987. Importantly, there has been an emphasis on analysing longitudinal data to answer the question 'which came first, people or pollution?' In addition, determining where environmental hazards are located and how demographics around those hazards are estimated has become central to any empirical enquiry on the topic. This new letter by Mohai and Saha (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 115008) adds to our emerging understanding of environmental justice by analysing the distribution of Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities across the United States to determine why they are concentrated in non-white and low income neighbourhoods. The researchers clearly demonstrate how longitudinal analysis and advances in geographic information system methodology can help address meaningful social questions about environmental inequality that are central to environmental policy and practice.

AB  - The current natural gas and oil boom in North America requires new pipelines, which pose environmental risks from wellheads to their destinations. The environmental justice literature suggests that ethno-racial minorities, populations with low socioeconomic status, and rural communities are disproportionally exposed to risks associated with potentially harmful land uses. Using data from the American Community Survey's 2015 five-year estimates and data on the route of proposed pipelines compiled by The FracTracker Alliance, this study tests whether the above assumptions are true for proposed FERC-permitted natural gas transmission pipelines in the United States for which planned routes have been made available. The results of logistic regression models provide only limited, and in some cases contradictory, support for these hypotheses. Although an increased share of highly educated residents significantly decreases the likelihood of a pipeline proposal in a census tract, a higher poverty rate also significantly lowers this probability. Likewise, the share of Black and Hispanic residents is significantly and negatively associated with pipeline proposals. However, reliable routing data are needed to test whether this holds true for built pipelines, but these data are considered confidential and thus inaccessible in the United States.

AB  - The potential for inequities between population subgroups in air pollution exposures and in regulatory protection because of small-scale intraurban differences in outdoor air pollution and air quality monitoring are studied here. The focus subgroups are blacks, Hispanics, whites, and the population living below poverty, with Tampa, FL, used as the case study area for quantitative analyses. A geographical database is developed for the surrounding county that includes population demographics, source locations, monitor locations, and air pollutant concentrations. Data included are residential population demographics at the block-group spatial scale from the year 2000 U.S. Census, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Toxic Releases Inventory source locations and air source release amounts, EPA Air Quality System monitoring data, and Florida major highway source locations and roadway traffic data. This database is applied for analysis of the spatial relationships between residence locations of population subgroups and outdoor air pollution surrogates. A quantitative index to evaluate the inequity between subpopulations is developed and applied. Findings include that blacks, Hispanics, and people living in poverty are disproportionately living closer to sources of air pollution and further from regulatory air quality monitoring sites compared with the overall county population. Conversely, whites are disproportionately living away from sources and near monitoring sites. Analysis of the regulatory monitoring guidelines indicates that recent changes in those guidelines may exacerbate existent inequities. The results suggest disparities in exposures to air pollution, disparities in regulatory monitoring representation, and the need for more monitoring and analyses at smaller spatial scales.

AB  - The authors apply Ulrich Beck's theory of reflexive modernization to examine how farmers in the United States perceive and respond to climate change. Using a case study, the authors identify diversions from Beck's original theory and explore the importance of social constructionist and political economy perspectives. The article focuses on corn farmers in southwestern Michigan to examine climate risk recognition and reflexive responses, concentrating on the role of nitrogen fertilizer as a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Results from interviews, focus groups, and a mail survey indicate that dualistic worldviews and exposure to limited and/or biased information can inhibit farmers from acknowledging climate change as a risk. In addition, structural barriers inhibit farmers from reducing nitrogen fertilizer application in response to climate change. These findings offer insights applicable to climate change mitigation efforts and also demonstrate the importance of both social constructionist and political economy perspectives to identify barriers to reflexive modernization.

AB  - Since Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation "Plus" (REDD+) starting gaining traction in the UN climate negotiations in 2007, its architects and scholars have grappled with its community-level justice implications. On the one hand, supporters argue that REDD+ will help the environment and forest-dependent communities by generating payments for forest carbon services from industrialized countries seeking lower cost emissions reductions. Critics, by contrast, increasingly argue that REDD+ is a new form of colonization through capitalism, producing injustice by stripping forest communities of their rights, denying them capabilities for wellbeing, and rendering forest peoples voiceless in forest governance. This paper argues that current REDD+ debates are too focused on relatively simple visions of either distributive or procedural justice, and pay too little attention to the core recognitional justice concerns of REDD+ critics, namely questions of what values, worldviews, rights, and identities are privileged or displaced in the emergence, design, and implementation of REDD+ and with what effects. This paper examines the tensions that emerge when designing institutions to promote multi-scalar, multivalent justice in REDD+ to ask: what are the justice demands that REDD+ architects face when designing REDD+ institutions? Complexifying the concepts of justice as deployed in the debates on REDD+ can illuminate the possibilities for a diversity of alternative perspectives to generate new institutional design ideas for REDD+.

AB  - The Trump administration has severely curtailed the work of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA has rolled back environmental protections, lost ground on addressing climate change and environmental justice, and shed large numbers of experienced staff. All of this has accelerated a longer-term decline in EPA resources, expertise, and authority. Here, we present perspectives of EPA employees and retirees on reconfiguring and strengthening the agency to address current and future environmental health problems, based on qualitative data obtained through 100 semi-structured interviews with 76 current and former EPA employees. Interviewees emphasized a number of internal and external issues, including a hyper-partisan context in which the agency operates, lack of public understanding of the extent of domestic and global environmental problems, budget shortfalls, staffing and leadership challenges, reduced scientific capacity and use of science in decision-making, insufficient attention to environmental justice, and lagging technology. We argue that reforms cannot only be expert-driven but must also come from the public, incorporating community driven solutions and focusing on remedying environmental injustice.

AB  - The study focused on the justice of residents' opportunity to engage in healthy behavior under different environments is not vast, especially in a hilly dwelling environment. Therefore, this paper investigates environmental inequalities in a hilly urban environment in the context of the booming real estate market in China, comprised of health promotion-related elements, namely, built environment, physical activity facilities, street infrastructure, green spaces, and environmental perceptions. The multi-source data are used to calculate environmental attributes and the socioeconomic status of communities. We take the central districts of Dalian city as the research area and measure environmental equity across different socioeconomic residential areas using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. The results reveal the spatial disparities in physical activity facilities, street greening, and positive perceptions between different communities. However, green injustice is mitigated in the hilly neighborhoods when we consider only ground-level greenness. This paper studies environmental justice by taking a health-enhancing view, and the results of this study can provide guidance on hilly urban development for government leaders and planners.

AB  - Socio-political conflicts relating to survival on this planet have become pressing over the last few decades. Global risks and conflicts are developing within the context of global capitalism with an evident conjunction of environmentally and socially destructive changes. The aim for a critical theory of globalization is to develop further analysis of this conjunction by studying social and ecological crises. Today we see a conflict between environmental justice and risk distribution related to the problems of growing social inequality and poverty. Global capitalism is characterized by an evident conjunction between destructive environmental changes, and social, economic and political (governance) crises. The complex of global transformations brings ever greater interdependence between economic, political, technological, social and environmental processes. Many negative consequences become increasingly unsustainable and less manageable.

AB  - There is a rich, but unacknowledged, heritage of rural subalterns, crofters, in Scandinavia. A Swedish-Norwegian interdisciplinary research-network investigated the most prominent category - the remains of crofts. Due to industrialisation, urbanisation and the modern welfare state, the institution of crofting was abolished, and many crofters left for opportunities elsewhere. The welfare state transformed a landscape of living and working people into a one filled with relicts mostly from the nineteenth century. Although numerous and important to local citizens, these sites fall outside the authorised heritage discourse (AHD) in terms of both research and heritage management. This paper takes an environmental justice perspective to challenge the AHD. Three themes are in focus: (1) bringing out the history of a subaltern and marginalised group of people; (2) promoting crofts as heritage of importance to local citizens and demanding complex management due to the various historical narratives and risks; (3) considering the crofting landscapes in relation to the (economisation) framing of heritage in development processes, especially in relation to fair development in present rural communities.

AB  - Social considerations lie at the core of conservation challenges and are increasingly motivating researchers to seek methodological approaches that illuminate these social aspects in nuanced and actionable ways. Thus, theoretical approaches and methods from social science fields such as public health, education, and environmental justice may offer productive insights for the conservation endeavor. One approach long-used in these fields are Visual Participatory Methods (VPMs), which incorporate community-generated images as data. VPMs emphasize community perspectives by coalescing and representing data in ways that are authentic to and embedded in local context while facilitating flexibility in the research toolkit. Yet conservation research has underused VPMs, specifically with regard to people-centered approaches, which VPMs have the potential to help evolve beyond standing critiques toward more inclusive, equitable, and productive formulations. To understand how conservation researchers have employed VPMs to date-including key goals, findings, and outcomes-we conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature. Through this process, our final sample identified 24 conservation-research studies that employed VPMs. Our review findings suggest that employing VPMs can lead to tangible conservation outcomes, and that they are useful to researchers across several dimensions: (1) understanding how residents' current perceptions of their social-ecological system have evolved over time, and how historical events have shaped them; (2) revealing residents' current perceptions of their surrounding environment, how they situate themselves within it, and how their values and worldviews may align or conflict with those of interacting institutions; and (3) uncovering potential avenues for reconciling those differences.

AB  - The quality of life in our cities critically depends on the intelligent planning and shaping of urban living space, in particular urban nature. By providing a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), urban nature essentially contributes to the well-being of city dwellers and plays a major role in avoiding common diseases through its positive impact on physical and mental health. Health is one of the most important factors underlying human welfare and is, thus, vital to sustainable development. The ES of urban green space provide other social-cultural functions alongside public health, for example by fostering environmental justice and citizenship participation. Thus, they should always be considered when searching for solutions to urban problems. The aim of this research was to determine the impact of green areas in three selected cities on the health and well-being of people by self-reporting of green areas' visitors. To this end, we posed the research question: which types and characteristics of urban green space are most appreciated by city dwellers? Based on our findings, we have drawn up recommendations for practices to promote better living conditions. We have also pinpointed obstacles to and opportunities for leisure time activities as well as ways of supporting the public health of citizens.

AB  - The role of neighborhood green spaces in improving residential satisfaction has attracted attention in recent years. However, most existing research focuses on the quantity of neighborhood green spaces, while there is still little systematic understanding of the effect of green space quality, which is represented by plant communities, on residential satisfaction. This study investigates the relationship between neighborhood green spaces and residential satisfaction considering both the quantity and quality of green space. Green space quantity is measured by the ratio of green space, and quality consists of plant community structure and foliar habits. Satisfaction evaluations were gathered from 1050 residents through a questionnaire survey conducted in suburban Shanghai in 2017, with neighborhood green spaces investigated through a manual audit on-site survey. The results show that both the quantity and quality of neighborhood green spaces contribute to residential satisfaction. A higher greening level contributes to higher residential satisfaction. The impact of green space quality is more significant than that of quantity. The impact of the quality of green space on residential satisfaction is complex. A higher ratio of deciduous plants has a positive association on residential satisfaction. More herbs and herb-tree structures also correlate positively with residential satisfaction. The findings provide planning implications for configuring neighborhood green spaces to improve residents' satisfaction through the design of plant community diversity.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between travel behavior and immigrant status. The National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) allows us to explore the relationships between travel behavior and characteristics that are usually hard to discern in surveys with smaller samples. The correlation between travel behavior and immigrant characteristics such as place of birth and year of immigration in the US was tested while controlling for spatial and socio-demographic variables. The effects of place of birth and year of arriving to the US were found to be significant for some places of birth and for immigrants who entered the US in recent years. Understanding the differences in travel behavior and the possible explanations for these differences can help in modeling travel demand, finding policies best suited to meeting the travel needs of foreign-born communities, and addressing environmental justice concerns.

AB  - There has been a scholarly interest in the demographic characteristics of American environmental organizations since the 1960s, but until recently there was no readily available way of knowing the composition of the staff or board of these institutions as few revealed any of their demographic data publicly. For the past five years, there has been a high-profile campaign to get environmental nonprofits to disclose their demographic data. This paper examines 12,054 small, medium-sized, and large environmental organizations to find out how many of them have released diversity data on GuideStar. The article also examines how the state in which organizations are located, region of the country, urban or rural setting, organizational typology, amount of revenue, size of the staff, size of the board, gender of the chief executive officer (CEO), race of the CEO, and the year of completion of the GuideStar profile influenced the disclosure of diversity data. The researchers collected financial data from Internal Revenue Service tax forms and diversity data from GuideStar. The study found that 3.7% of the nonprofits studied divulged diversity data. However, organizations in the Pacific and Mid-Atlantic regions were most likely and nonprofits in the South least likely to report diversity data. Urban nonprofits were more likely to divulge diversity data than those located in the suburbs or in the rural areas. The highest level of reporting was in Washington, D.C. In addition, environmental justice organizations were more likely to disclose diversity data than other types of organizations. The larger the staff and the higher the revenue, the more likely it is that the organization divulged its diversity data. Organizations with female CEOs were more likely to reveal diversity data than male-headed nonprofits. Environmental organizations with ethnic/racial minority CEOs were also more likely to disclose demographic data than organizations with white CEOs.

AB  - Similar to other global cities, Toronto (Canada) is addressing conflicting energy concerns in the form of the need to consider energy sustainability while concurrently continuing to expand urban development in response to high levels of immigrant population growth. We argue that energy solutions and policy interventions cannot be successful unless they are sensitive to the social, spatial, and economic concerns of Toronto's diverse communities. Drawing on interview findings of a three-year study "Who has the power? The energy crisis and environmental justice in Toronto," this paper considers whether current Toronto-based environmental non-governmental organization (ENGO) strategies to enhance awareness of energy problems and environmental sustainability are framed in a manner that includes Toronto's many marginalized and racialized residents. Findings also highlight the extent to which ENGOs are adopting environmental justice as both a discourse for environmental change and a set of principles to guide energy-related programming, policy, and partnerships.

AB  - The role of science and knowledge production is at a crossroads, as societal transformation calls for challenging dominant forms of knowledge production that have contributed to marginalizing other ways of knowing. This presents a challenge to mainstream science and invites a deeper reflection on our roles as scientists and exploration of alternative engaged, post-normal and activist approaches to research. This paper examines the diverse ways researchers are meeting this challenge. Employing the device of the Tarot deck we describe seven "characters" to illustrate the variety of roles and approaches that trans-disciplinary, transformative, transgressive and activist researchers are engaging in. These characters are used to introduce and develop the concept of political rigour as a means of expanded academic rigour in new emancipatory scientific paradigms. We demonstrate how these Tarot characters can be used as an activity for collective and personal reflexivity and propose ten principles that frequently emerge in a 'political' peer review process. We argue that the insights emerging from these strands of radical, critical, engaged and applied forms of scholarship, can significantly improve the understanding of what a "transformative knowledge paradigm" may look like in practice and how it can be mobilized for social change and environmental justice.

AB  - The adoption of the sustainable development goals marks a transition in the global sustainability discourse to a growing focus on equity, with urban areas' role in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth more explicit in sustainable development goal-11. Within this discourse, urban sustainability indicators could be used to monitor environmental quality and equity within individual cities, while promising to deepen our understanding of how urban areas contribute to global environmental sustainability. We examine 484 indicators of urban and regional environmental sustainability sourced from 40 indexes and online data repositories to determine their suitability for measuring both urban environmental performance and equity. Despite the large number of existing indicators related to urban environmental monitoring, we find that they are inadequate as tools for evaluating progress towards sustainable development goal-11's integrated goal of sustainable and inclusive (i.e. equitable) urban areas, due to a lack of benchmarks, targets, and explicit measurement of equity considerations. Future research should emphasize data collection that can be disaggregated geographically to make it possible to measure distributional equity and establish locally appropriate benchmarks and realistic targets for urban sustainability indicators. Lastly, we argue that utilizing large-scale, high-resolution datasets has the potential to help overcome these data collection challenges.

AB  - Saving energy at home is often portrayed as the "low-hanging fruit" of climate change solutions, yet little is known about its labor or gendering. To understand these aspects of climate change mitigation more broadly, this research uses a case study of the U.S. transition to energy efficient lighting. The results show that even though using efficient bulbs is commonly portrayed as easy, it can involve six phases of additional labor. The case of CFLs indicates that home climate practices beyond light bulbs can add up to significant work, particularly when they require the navigation of toxic or complex shifts in materiality, specialized knowledge, and uncertainties. Because home climate practices like using CFLs are the kind of work traditionally performed by women, they can expand the gender "climate gap" and are often devalued in inequitable ways. This research illuminates the importance of making the labor and gendering of environmental practices visible.

AB  - The current literature links flood exposure and the consequent damage in the sub-Saharan Africa to urban expansion. The main implication of this pertains to the fact that cities are the target of flood risk reduction. However, our knowledge of the built-up area expansion-flood damage nexus is still too scarce to support any risk reduction policy at the local scale. The objective of this study is to reconsider the link between urban expansion and flood damage widening the observation to rural settlements with open access information alternative to global datasets on flood damages and moderate resolution satellite images. Using very high-resolution satellite images accessible via Google Earth Pro, the expansion of 122 flooded settlements in the Dosso region (Niger) during the past 20 years is evaluated. Spatial dynamics is then compared with the rate of collapsed houses due to flooding. Finally, house collapses and retrofitting are compared. We discovered that cities expand at faster rates and with an opposite trend to that reported by the global datasets. However, hamlets and villages expand even more rapidly and suffer more house collapses than rural towns and cities. House consolidation is quicker than the settlement expansion but this is not sufficient to reduce damage from pluvial flooding. The proportion of the Poor to the total number of inhabitants in rural settlements is three times higher than that in urban settlements. Environmental justice is, therefore, not just an urban issue but a rural urgency.

AB  - The production of bioenergy and especially of agrofuels is highly contested, both on a local and global scale. While most research has focused on rural areas and sustainability, our case study explores a conflict around bioethanol production within an urban context: the city of Cordoba, Argentina. Describing the emergence and narratives of a local protest movement within the neighbourhood next to the ethanol factory, our article aims to contribute to the debate on the externalities of bioenergy from an environmental justice perspective. The article shows that the struggle against bioethanol production in the neighbourhood emerged as a local environmental justice movement concerned about the uncertainties regarding health risks and the danger of explosions. At the start, the activists did not define themselves as 'environmentalists' or 'ecologists'. This is not an environmentalism of choice, but an environmentalism 'of obligation', starting from their struggle to defend their bodies, health, lives and territory. The authorities ignored their claims, and so, facing sociotechnical controversies, the movement invested huge efforts into critical epidemiology and created alliances with health and science professionals and institutions. Through their struggle, they developed their own narrative, questioning the enterprise's narrative of:green' and 'sustainable' energy. The movement fully developed its own understanding of environmental justice in unison with other environmental and human rights movements in the country.

AB  - The purpose of this essay is to introduce and take a critical look at the emerging ecological Restoration (ER) movement. The typical characterization of the ER movement is that it focuses on restoring ecosystems to pre-European settlement conditions, even in urban environments; thus neglecting social justice issues and alienating the disadvantaged people living in these environments. The restoration movement is often accused of redefining these spaces from a culturally and ideologically privileged standpoint-a standpoint with historical links to the exclusionary preservationist discourse of the mainstream environmental movement. On the contrary, I argue that the ER movement has closer ties to the environmental Justice (EJ) movement than previously recognized. Toward that end, I present an ecocultural map of the actual and potential relationships between the EJ and ER movements. The map reveals boundary objects ( instruments, ideas, techniques, landscapes, and actions that each culture has in common) that can serve as avenues of communication between these movements. This analysis also identifies two newly emerging cultures within the ER movement, which incorporate both restoration and social justice among their goals: the Indigenous Peoples' Restoration (IPR) movement and the environmental Justice Restoration (EJR) movement. The IPR and EJR cultures represent examples of how the broader EJ and ER cultures can find common ground while redefining ecocultural spaces and restoring degraded ecosystems within urban and rural environments.

AB  - The Sao Paulo Macro Metropolis (SPMM) is one of the richest and most inequitable regions of the Global South and is already experiencing the impacts of severe climate events. This study analyzes climate risk assessments and policy responses for this territory as well as its vulnerabilities. The Index of Vulnerability to Natural Disasters related to Droughts in the Context of Climate Change (IVDNS-acronym in Portuguese) was used to identify and select the most vulnerable municipalities in the SPMM. Following vulnerability analysis, the municipalities were subjected to risk analysis in the context of existing Brazilian legislation. The results indicate that, despite having positive capacities to respond to climate change, the analyzed municipalities are far from advancing from the status quo or taking the actions that are necessary to face future challenges in a climate emergency scenario. The results indicate that, despite being the most vulnerable to droughts and natural disasters, the cities analyzed are not the most vulnerable in the Sao Paulo Macro Metropolis from a socio-economic point of view. On the contrary, these are regions that could have a strong institutional capacity to respond to present and future challenges.

AB  - The current requirements and status of air quality modeling of hazardous pollutants are reviewed. Many applications require the ability to predict the local impacts from industrial sources or large roadways as needed for community health characterization and evaluating environmental justice concerns. Such local-scale modeling assessments can be performed by using Gaussian dispersion models. However, these models have a limited ability to handle chemical transformations. A new generation of Eulerian grid-based models is now capable of comprehensively treating transport and chemical transformations of air toxics. However, they typically have coarse spatial resolution, and their computational requirements increase dramatically with finer spatial resolution. The authors present and discuss possible advanced approaches that can combine the grid-based models with local-scale information.

AB  - The compatibility between an agenda for sustainable urban development and the neoliberal economic restructuring of urban space has been observed within cities in developed countries across the globe. From providing economic support to local 'green' industries to creating bike lanes, municipalities develop sustainability strategies that are designed to boost their competitive advantage. Moreover, municipalities are responding to demands from popular social movements and national governments that seek to reconfigure societal relationships with the natural environment in cities. Cities are increasingly understood not as part of the ecological crisis but as part of the solution, or as places where alternative patterns of sustainable consumption and new socially and ecologically responsible industries can be developed. Over the last decade in Austin, environmental sustainability has become an uncontested paradigm that has progressively shaped the city's urban space and policy. Two competing conceptualizations of the environment, so-called 'environmental' and 'just' sustainability groups, are explored in this article. I demonstrate how the notion of environmental sustainability has been selectively incorporated into the hegemonic vision of Austin's strategic growth plan. I argue that the dominance of this conceptualization is best understood by asking what counts as the 'environment' for environmentalists, and understanding the unstated assumptions about the environment shared by the business community and environmentalists.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has compromised the 'healthy cities' vision, as it has unveiled the need to give more prominence to caring tasks while addressing intersectional social inequities and environmental injustices. However, much-needed transdisciplinary approaches to study and address post-COVID-19 healthy cities challenges and agendas have been scarce so far. To address this gap, we propose a 'just ecofeminist healthy cities' research approach, which would be informed by the caring city, environmental justice, just ecofeminist sustainability and the healthy cities paradigms and research fields. Our proposed approach aims to achieve the highest standards of human health possible for the whole population-yet putting the health of socially underprivileged residents in the centre-through preserving and/or improving the existing physical, social and political environment. Importantly, the proposed approach recognises all spheres of daily life (productive, reproductive, personal and political) and their connections with inequities, justice and power dynamics. Last, the just ecofeminist healthy cities approach understands human health as interconnected with the health of non-human animals and the ecosystem. We illustrate the proposed new approach focusing on the implications for women's health and public green spaces research and propose principles and practices for its operationalisation.

AB  - Service provision for Afridev handpumps through community management in Malawi is a notable challenge. Essential preventative maintenance is often neglected, and repairs are undertaken on a reactive basis. The costs of major repairs are not recognized at community level and are typically neglected across the lifecycle of infrastructure or left to external stakeholders. The aim of this study was to investigate preventative maintenance and capital maintenance expenditure over the 15-year design lifecycle of 21,997 Afridev handpumps in Malawi, and how costs change based on different local tariff collection scenarios. A total of four tariff collection scenarios were investigated, for assets both subject and not subject to rehabilitation. The findings highlight poor initial capacity building into appropriate cost recovery and maintenance approaches. Major repair costs increase over the pump lifecycle when service consists of the replacement of low-cost, fast-wearing parts. Rehabilitation/major repair costs increase as a result but tend to be focused on simple longer-life components, such as pump rods. In both cases, a reliance on external support was highlighted, as larger costs are primarily covered by donors and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Proactive tariff scenarios may provide a greater capability of replacement throughout the lifecycle of major items when compared to reactive tariff scenarios. It is recommended that policy and practitioners should focus on capacity building of sustainable maintenance models that consider the full lifecycle costs of assets.

AB  - The sustainability of rural groundwater supply infrastructure, primarily boreholes fitted with hand pumps, remains a challenge. This study evaluates whether coverage targets set out within the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) inadvertently increased the challenge to sustainably manage water supply infrastructure. Furthermore, the drive towards decentralised service delivery contributes to the financial burden of water supply assets. A sample size of 14,943 Afridev hand pump boreholes was extracted from a comprehensive live data set of 68,984 water points across Malawi to investigate the sustainability burden as emphasis shifts to the 2030 agenda. The results demonstrate that the push for coverage within the MDG era has impacted the sustainability of assets. A lack of proactive approaches towards major repairs and sub-standard borehole construction alongside aging infrastructure contributes to reduced functionality of decentralised supplies. Furthermore, costly rehabilitation is required to bring assets to operational standards, in which external support is commonly relied upon. Acceleration towards the coverage targets has contributed towards unsustainable infrastructure that has further implications moving forward. These findings support the need for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) investment planning to move from a focus on coverage targets to a focus on quality infrastructure and proactive monitoring approaches to reduce the future burden placed on communities.

AB  - The climate emergency demands that principles and practices of justice and injustice, harm, loss, suffering, and hope are revisited, to encompass both the human and the natural world and the many interconnections between them. Following work on the Unknown Other in climate justice discourse, I examine a relational space of proximity, empathy, and responsibility across human and non-human Others to advance current understandings of multispecies justice. Via four types of encounters - the visual, the embodied, the ethical, and the political - it is possible to engage in empathetic experiences with and enact responsibility toward infinite other beings and confront layers of shared vulnerabilities and histories of silencing and erasures. These encounters across space and time make tangible what a nature of human and more-than-human togetherness and solidarity may look like and what ethics and politics would be required to overcome untenable human exceptionalism in today's crises.

This chapter will draw on relevant Australian judicial decisions and related literature to show how aspects of procedural and distributive justice have arisen for a variety of stakeholders associated with CSG extraction. Noting that social justice questions have been considered by geographers in the past and that aspects of spatial justice figure prominently in the work of legal geographers, this chapter focuses on the spatial and temporal features of CSG in Australia from an environmental and social justice perspective - using court judgments as short, illustrative case studies. Because both law and landscapes are shaped by contests over what is deemed just and unjust in society, this chapter also responds to recent calls for greater attention to justice questions by legal geography and justice scholars.

This article aims to fill parts of this gap by discussing these issues in relation to Chinese overseas hydropower dams in Ghana (Bui Dam) and Cambodia (Kamchay Dam). Both projects are built by Sinohydro and financed by ExIm Bank. This article draws on in-depths interviews and focus group discussions with local communities affected by the dams, institutional actors in Ghana and Cambodia, Chinese actors, and dam builders. The article uses an environmental justice perspective as an analytical framework. The article concludes that the dam projects could improve their social sustainability framework in practice and theory; social benchmarking should be introduced and social policies need to be improved to be in line with international social standards on hydropower projects.

AB  - The present article examines two Latin American gold mining conflicts, one in the city of Esquel (Patagonia in Argentina) and the other in Pascua-Lama (Chilean border with Argentina). We identify the emergence of three dimensions of environmental justice (distribution, recognition, participation) in the anti-mining movements of these two cases. The study finds that some dimensions of justice appear first (participation and recognition), while distribution emerges later, as movements jump scales engaging with national and international networks that provide a systemic perspective of the conflicts. The findings are consistent with other studies that refer to environmental justice as multi-scalar and context related. We also point to the relevance of studying decision-making procedures and jumping scales to understand how environmental justice claims are framed in resource extraction conflicts.

AB  - The UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration is poised to trigger the recovery of ecosystem services and transform structural injustices across the world in a way unparalleled in human history. The inclusion of diverse Indigenous and local communities to co-create robust native seed supply systems is the backbone to achieve the goals for the Decade. Here we show how community-based organizations have co-developed native seed supply strategies for landscape restoration from the bottom-up. We draw on the interconnections over two decades of seed networks in Brazil and the emerging Indigenous participation in native seed production in Australia. From an environmental justice perspective, we provide a participatory seed supply approach for local engagement, noting local geographical, social and cultural contexts. Meeting large-scale restoration goals requires the connection between local seed production and collaborative platforms to negotiate roles, rights and responsibilities between stakeholders. An enduring native seed supply must include a diversity of voices and autonomy of community groups that builds equitable participation in social, economic, and environmental benefits.

AB  - Ten statements in the 1993 General Social Surveys that relate to general themes about the environment were reduced to three scales after factor analysis: Pro-Environment, Less-Growth, and Pro-Animal. These scales were regressed on social-economic characteristics of respondents (N = 1,268). It was found that (a) those with lower incomes and less education were more pro-environment and pro-animal, (b) Black respondents were more likely than White respondents to be more pro-environment, (c) younger respondents were more less-growth than older ones, and (d) women were more inclined than men to be supportive of animal rights. Most previous research has found that higher socioeconomic groups are pro-environment. This research suggests there is support to help the environment among lower socioeconomic groups, minorities, and women. There is reason for optimism about the future of the environmental justice movement and the mainstream environmental movement.

AB  - The adoption of green building certification schemes, such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Schools, establishes common building factors among certified schools. Many building factors influence student performance outcomes including cognitive skills, standardized test scores and rates of absenteeism. This review synthesizes current research from 28 new studies and 101 other studies that were previously included in 15 reviews of associations between LEED-specified building factors and these performance outcomes in schools. In appraising the relative quantity and quality of studies, along with the frequency of LEED credits found in certified schools, this review finds that building features common to 100% of LEED-certified schools also have the strongest research supporting associations with academic outcomes, and largely come under the purview of indoor air quality (e.g., minimum ventilation rate, filtration or air cleaning) and acoustic performance. Comparatively, building factors related to the school site and daylighting have fewer associated studies, but findings suggest these are good targets for future research as they may be important for influencing student performance. Achieving a transition to a lower carbon future requires that schools be built with their energy impacts in mind; and this review provides value to those involved in the planning and design of these green schools that facilitate improved student performance outcomes.

AB  - Technology plays a critical role in the ability to retain, reduce or transfer climate risk or address impacts. However, vulnerable communities do not fully benefit from existing technology, whereas they are disproportionally impacted by climate change. This chapter assesses how technology can shape limits to adaptation and how to report on this injustice as part of key global agreements. We develop an access, use and innovation of technology framework. As a case on a relevant technology, we test it on transboundary early warning systems in South Asia. We find that only a limited set of the state-of-the-art technologies available globally is accessed and used. Insufficient capacity and funding result in the bare minimum, largely copycat type of technology. As climate change progresses, demands on technology increase, whereas, if no action is taken, the technology remains the same widening the adaptation deficit. A better understanding of the crossover from disaster risk reduction to climate adaptation and the emerging policy domain of loss and damage allows trade-offs in terms of reducing risks through greater investment in technologies for adaptation versus absorbing risks and then financing curative or transformative loss and damage measures. We argue that attention to especially distributive, compensatory and procedural climate justice principles, in terms of distributing technology, building capacity and providing finance, can help to motivate support for widening the technology spectrum available to developing countries. We propose as part of comprehensive risk management that, first, an inventory should be developed how of technologies shape soft and hard adaptation limits. Second, technology for climate justice might be included in the adaptation communications to support reporting on the expected and experienced impact of measures on loss and damage, at a sufficiently disaggregated level. Third, soft adaptation limits should be levelled by making technology research, innovation and design equitable between those countries having capacity and those not, recognising the commitment to leave no one behind.

AB  - The production and widespread use of synthetic chemicals since the 1940s have resulted in ubiquitous contamination of fish, wildlife and human populations. Since the 1960s, observers have documented major damage to wildlife reproduction across the globe, and subsequently, damage to reproductive health in exposed humans as well. The sex ratio in human communities and populations can be readily measured to ascertain whether reproductive effects, such as subtle birth defects of the reproductive tract caused by exposures to chemicals, might be occurring. Male to female sex ratios appear to be declining in populations in several parts of the globe, possibly as a result of prenatal exposures to chemicals. Sex ratio data for communities with unusual occupational or environmental exposures can be compiled using traditional epidemiological techniques in pursuit of environmental justice. Local, regional and national population health. researchers and occupational hygienists can use health statistics to examine sex ratios as sentinel health events that might portend patterns of subtle structural birth defects of the reproductive tract and functional deficits in neurodevelopment.

AB  - Scholars concerned with abuses of the "resource privilege" by the governments of developing states sometimes call for national sovereignty over the natural resources that lie within its borders. While such claims may resist a key driver of the "resource curse" when applied to mineral resources in the ground, and are often recognized as among a people's territorial rights, their implications differ in the context of climate change, where they are invoked on behalf of a right to extract and combust fossil fuels that is set in opposition to global climate change mitigation imperatives. Moreover, granting full national sovereignty over territorial carbon sinks may conflict with commitments to equity in the sharing of national mitigation burdens, since much of the planet's carbon sink capacity lies within territorial borders to which peoples have widely disparate access. In this paper, I shall explore this tension between a global justice principle that is often applied to mineral resources and its tension with contrary principles that are often applied to carbon sink access, developing an analysis that seeks to reconcile what would otherwise appear to be fundamentally incompatible aims.

AB  - The development of Latin American cities has been characterized by an inadequate process of nature appropriation, that could be observed in the urban space fragmentation and in the disproportionate distribution of environmental threaten and amenities among different socioeconomic groups of inhabitants. To analyze and assess spatial relationship between environmental risks and socioeconomic groups, two urban communes, Penalolen and San Pedro de la Paz, were chosen. Further, the distribution of such threats and their relations with mechanisms that are acting over the physical vulnerability of socioeconomic groups were taken into consideration. in the case of San Pedro cle la Paz, it is possible to observe a large exposition of the poorest people to environmental threats. In the case of Penalolen, income level differences are acting as a determinant factor in the capacity to reduce physical vulnerability.

AB  - Risk communication is being characterized as one way of facilitating more effective, democratic and participatory risk management strategies. An emphasis on formal communication approaches as a means to improve decisions and decrease conflict will highlight the challenge of managing hazards within a culturally heterogeneous society. Communication and participatory strategies will be considered successful only if diverse communities can be engaged as partners in the policy process. Because responses to risks are embedded and evolve within broader social environments, achieving the promise of risk communication across a diverse society may not be possible absent an understanding of how sociocultural variables and past experiences shape the exchange of ideas or information in any particular situation. This paper considers the implications of ethnic and socioeconomic variability for the risk communication process, summarizing theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence on the link between sociocultural features and risk responses. Specifically, the factors that define the context of communication may influence: the initial framing of a risk issue, particularly, the adoption of an environmental justice vs. scientific/economic perspective; the perceived importance of various aspects of the decision problem; and prior beliefs about environmental hazards and agencies involved in risk management. Two examples of situations requiring communications about risk are presented and illustrate how these principles could operate in minority or lower-income communities. A significant challenge for health and regulatory officials will be to engage in an interactive process of information and opinion exchanges that is reasonable and effective within vastly different socioeconomic and cultural contexts.

AB  - The paper looks at Colombia's first major environmental justice legal case involving a riparian Afro-Colombian community and the Pacific Energy Company (EPSA). Riverine Afro-Colombian communities gained political recognition as a culturally distinct group largely based on their conservation practices in riparian environments. The work contrasts the complexities of the case with the vulnerable reality of the people of Anchicaya who largely live in conditions of poverty, violence and political isolation. It also describes the institutions that frame watershed management, the ethnic rights to collective land and self-governance and the property rights of energy companies in the backdrop of decentralisation reforms that clarified different types of property rights and refounded Colombia as a multicultural nation. The legal suit, however, demonstrates that the government failed to offer equal protection to collective versus private cultural and socio-economic uses of land and water in order to protect energy investments. The Constitutional Court's jurisprudence ultimately privileged technical and legal know-how and overlooked the limits community intermediaries face offering similar evidence. By doing so, the court not only disregarded the constitutional rights of Afro-Colombians, but it also failed to mitigate a socio-environmental conflict.

AB  - The concept of prospective environmental (in)justice (PEJ) is proposed to make sense of situations in which development proposals and the actions of state and market actors create injustices even before the development projects become a material reality. Through this concept and its application to two cases of opencast gold-mining, a broader conceptualization of socio-environmental (in)justice is invited that considers multiple forms of injustice of rural communities in Romania and Bulgaria during more than a decade of waiting for the 'actual harm' of mining to happen. The mere prospects of opencast gold-mining have, in fact, shed light on deep-seated and ongoing dimensions of socio-environmental injustice such as, land-grabbing, slow community disappearance and marginalization, daily psychological damage, disavowal of alternatives and disqualification as political subjects. These injustices experienced collectively could be seen as constitutive moments of systemic violence.

AB  - Theories of climate justice retain a persistent tension between transcorporeal entanglement and coherent individuality. The ontology of bodily separation required for accountability for polluters and reparation for the vulnerable enacts a worldview potentially inconsistent with the more-than-human relationality of climate change. Yet theories of material agency and posthuman becoming are criticised for offering limited guidance for political practice. Engaging with the bushfire smoke that blanketed eastern Australia throughout 2019/2020, I seek to revitalise climate justice by engaging with theories of more-than-human transcorporeality. To do so, I articulate an aspirational climate justice, where aspiration is understood as a yearning arising from inhibited breath. Aspirational climate justice considers the relationally composed human and non-human bodies that breathe, as well as the relationship - respiration - itself, as subjects, and offers a politics through which we might keep breathing together towards a more liveable world.

AB  - The population living in large urban areas faces multiple pressures on their physical and psychological well-being coming from various polluting sources: air pollution, water pollution, and high noise level, thermal and visual stress. Urban green spaces have a positive impact on human health, as they help people relax more. Stress relief through physical exercise and social interaction is possible by having an increased access to parks or other green areas. As in the case of many growing cities, Craiova faces a continuous demand for more construction development space, while the shrinkage of urban green areas is becoming an issue. Using a GIS-based method, this study analyses the accessibility of Craiova residents to urban green spaces, identifying the areas with reduced green spaces and making recommendations for the improvement of the green areas available to residents. The number and location of the parks in the city are correlated with the population density within residential areas in order to analyse the accessibility to green areas based on both walking and driving distance between the access points of the green spaces and the residential areas. Data indicate an unevenly distribution of parks and access to green areas.

AB  - Spatial decisions increasingly are made by both professional and citizen stakeholders using interactive maps, yet few empirically-derived guidelines exist for designing interactive maps that support complex reasoning and decision making across problem contexts. We address this gap through an online map study with 122 participants with varying expertise. The study required participants to assume two hypothetical scenarios in the North American hazardous waste trade, review geographic information on environmental justice impacts using a different interactive map for each scenario, and arrive at an optimal decision outcome. This study followed a 2 x 2 factorial design, varying interface complexity (the number of supported interaction operators) and decision complexity (the number of decision criteria) as the independent variables and controlling for participant expertise with the hazardous waste trade and other aspects of cartographic design. Our findings indicate that interface complexity, not decision complexity, influenced decision outcomes, with participants arriving at better decisions using the simpler interface. However, expertise was a moderating effect, with experts and non-experts using different interaction strategies to arrive at their decisions. The research contributes to cartography, geovisualization, spatial decision science, urban planning, and visual analytics as well as to scholarship on environmental justice, the geography of hazardous waste, and participatory mapping.

AB  - Risk equity serves as the purported rationale for a wide range of inefficient policy practices, such as the concern that hypothetical individual risks not be too great. This paper proposes an alternative risk equity concept in terms of equitable tradeoffs rather than equity in risk levels. Equalizing the cost per life saved across policy contexts will save additional lives and will give fair treatment to risks arising in a variety of domains. Equitable trade-offs will also benefit minorities who currently are disadvantaged by politically based inefficient policies.

Lee's film gives voice to those who were directly affected by the Katrina disaster and reminds us that for historical and socio-political reasons African-American and other minority perspectives on issues of sustainability are necessarily different from those of mainstream environmentalists. Through its powerful presentation of these alternative perspectives and needs, When the Levees Broke raises awareness for the fact that any concept for a osustainableo New Orleans that does not address the enormous class and race-based inequities within the city will be unjust and thus fundamentally flawed.

AB  - Teacher education is pivotal to advancing pedagogies, practices, and content knowledge that promote sustainability literacy in formal education settings. To explore preservice teachers' (PST) readiness to implement transformative sustainability learning with elementary (i.e. kindergarten to 6th grade) students, we analyzed unit plans created by PSTs in a sustainability teacher education course. Within these units, we looked for evidence of content and pedagogy which (i) embraces the complexity of human-environmental interactions, (ii) advances sustainability literacy by enlisting both knowledge and engagement, and (iii) mobilizes action in local and global contexts to advance social and environmental justice aims. We describe the range of topics and analyze the rationales and learning activities through the 'Head, Hands and Heart' framework for transformative sustainability learning. We found that, though most PSTs integrated learning objectives and activities intended to engage students' heads, hearts, and hands into their units, they struggled to embrace the complexity of sustainability issues and to engage students in justice-focused action. We provide three recommendations for preservice teacher education to increase PSTs' readiness to implement transformative sustainability learning.

AB  - The provision of financial incentives to local communities by energy developers has attracted cynicism across many localities, with some suggesting such community benefits are akin to bribery. The current study used an experimental design embedded within a community postal survey to explore whether potentially damaging effects of bribery rhetoric upon local support for a wind farm can be overcome through (a) portraying community benefits as a policy requirement (rather than a discretionary gesture by developers), and/or (b) the deployment of different discursive strategies by developers to manage their stake in the outcome of the project. Participants told about community benefits as being a policy requirement showed significantly higher support for the wind farm, an effect that was mediated by heightened perceptions of individually and collectively favorable outcomes from the development. We discuss our results in relation to their implications for government policy approaches to promoting renewable energy supply.

AB  - The Anthropocene thesis invokes the 'enormous geological power' of industrialism: driven by hydrocarbon combustion, manifest in planetary heating. Yet political theory has proceeded as if the organisation of geological power were incidental to history. Geological agency, we submit, is precisely what mining industries are organised to achieve, materially and politically. We propose mineral sovereignty as a term of method to analyse geological power in its legible, institutional and intentional forms. We deploy it to excavate an entwined genealogy of state and corporation: one evident in the constitutional (or extra-parliamentary) technologies of sovereignty and property that order the appropriation and distribution of mineral wealth. Through three provocations, we 'stratify' the concept of sovereignty: in the 'royal metals' of early modern states; in the rise of neoliberalism as a re-privatisation of mineral-energy infrastructures against the claims of social democracy; and in anticipatory extensions of mineral sovereignty to outer space. Mineral sovereignty discloses methodological problems for energy and climate policy. Pre-analytical distinctions between public law and the private power of fossil capital imply a hierarchy and separation that cannot be presumed, but must be achieved. We must 'leave it in the ground': this requires the re-assertion of democratic control over the mineral estate.

AB  - The past quarter century has seen an explosion of concern about widening health inequities in the United States and worldwide. These inequities are central to the research mission in 2 arenas of public health: social epidemiology and community-engaged interventions. Yet only modest success has been achieved in eliminating health inequities. We advocate dialogue and reciprocal learning between researchers with these 2 perspectives to enhance emerging transdisciplinary language, support new approaches to identifying research questions, and apply integrated theories and methods. We recommend ways to promote transdisciplinary training, practice, and research through creative academic opportunities as well as new funding and structural mechanisms.

AB  - Ship demolition is a significant source of marine pollution. Not recycled properly, toxic chemicals can be released and pose great dangers to both the environment and public health. By investigating over 22,500 scrapped vessels' business records ranging between 2000 and 2019, we find how business owners in developed countries disguise ships' true identity by registering them in developing regions with loose approaches to labor and environmental protection, thus creating a leeway to violate environmental justice. International treaties and regional regulations have failed to correct the problem. Neither the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal nor enhanced regional regulations from the European Commission are effective. We propose three reforms to make the shipping industry more sustainable.

AB  - The Chinese "coal-to-gas" and "coal-to-electricity" strategies aim at reducing dispersed coal consumption and related air pollution by promoting the use of clean and low-carbon fuels in northern China. Here, we show that on top of meteorological influences, the effective emission mitigation measures achieved an average decrease of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations of-14% in Beijing and surrounding areas (the "2+26" pilot cities) in winter 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, where the dispersed coal control measures contributed-60% of the total PM2.5 reductions. However, the localized air quality improvement was accompanied by a contemporaneous-15% upsurge of PM2.5 concentrations over large areas in southern China. We find that the pollution transfer that resulted from a shift in emissions was of a high likelihood caused by a natural gas shortage in the south due to the coal-to-gas transition in the north. The overall shortage of natural gas greatly jeopardized the air quality benefits of the coal-to-gas strategy in winter 2017 and reflects structural challenges and potential threats in China's clean-energy transition.

AB  - The ecosystem services (ES) provided by urban parks are critically important for urban sustainability, but their performance evaluation needs to be further enhanced for cost-effective park governance. Importance performance analysis (IPA) can prioritize ES performance, but most ongoing IPA studies are based on surveys with limited scalability. The recent upsurge of social media data (SMD) offers new data sources and research opportunities in varied realms. However, there is a prominent research gap on SMD's capacity in ES prioritization compared to surveys considering data advantages and limitations. Based on Pearl River Park and Yunxi Ecological Park in Guangzhou, China, this study explores the similarities and differences in satisfaction and importance characteristics, and IPA results of perceived ES based on both SMD and survey data. This study found that SMD can fully prioritize ES relevant to public welfare but only partially to personal welfare. There are consistent IPA results for all ES relevant to public welfare through both data sources. IPA results of the ES relevant to personal welfare demonstrate varied conclusions through the two data sources: some (aesthetic service, physical and mental recovery, and religion) are similar, but the rest are different (recreational service, social interaction, and education). The consistency is mainly because some ES have similar experiences to most users, while the difference is affected primarily by different user groups. SMD directly reflects users' feedback to varied ES. While survey data can cover more extensive user groups, detailed classification is necessary for analysis. By distinguishing different IPA results for different ES from two data sources, this study offers methodological insights for ES assessment and other related urban studies. It also has methodological and practical significance for the realization of urban social-environmental justice and human well-being.

AB  - The ecological debt concept emerged in the early 1990s from within social movements driven by rising environmental awareness, emerging Western consciousness of responsibility for past colonial subjugations, and a general sense of unease during the debt crisis. First developed organically, mainly in locally-scaled, civil contexts, ecological debt has since gained attention in academia and international environmental negotiations. Now, the concept of ecological debt requires further elucidation and elaboration, especially in light of its historical interconnection with environmental justice. In this paper, the development of the concept of ecological debt in both activist and academic circles is described, proposed theoretical building blocks for its operationalization are discussed and three brief cases illustrating its recent utilization are presented. Ecological debt is built upon a theoretical foundation that draws on biophysical accounting systems, ecological economics, environmental justice and human rights, historical injustices and restitution, and an ecologically-oriented world-system analysis framework. Drawing on these building blocks, the concept of ecological debt has been used as a biophysical measure, a legal instrument and a distributional principle. In theory and in practice, it has much to offer the environmental justice movement. We conclude by reflecting on some of the pros and cons of the ecological debt concept as a tool to be used in fulfilling some of the goals of environmental justice movements in the world today.

AB  - The decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma is being heralded as the most important Indian law decision of the last 100 years, as it affirmed the reservation boundaries of the Muscogee (Creek) Reservation-an area long considered by many to be under Oklahoma's jurisdiction. Following release of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, the outcry from the oil and gas industry was almost instantaneous. Roughly twenty-five percent of Oklahoma's oil and gas wells and sixty percent of its oil refineries are located on land impacted by the Court's decision. The territory affected by the Court's decision also includes pipelines crucial to the successful operation of the nationwide Keystone XL pipeline. While the Court's holding addressed criminal jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act, the decision has broader implications for Indian country, including natural resource development and the corresponding regulatory framework. Tribal communities generally have a special connection to their lands. Yet, they have historically suffered various inequities rooted in federal policies. Rich in natural resources, Indian country has been exploited at the expense of the local tribal community, raising issues of environmental injustice. By upholding treaty rights and obligations, the McGirt decision has the potential to further empower tribes in the protection of their lands and the important cultural values therein. Fearing that they will now have to work with tribes and the federal government instead of favorable state officials, oil and gas industry officials decry the Court's decision as being detrimental to the industry. But how exactly will the McGirt decision affect the oil and gas industry, and natural resources development in Indian country more broadly? While the full impacts of the Court's decision are only beginning to unfold, this Article seeks to answer the questions left hanging by the Court's decision as they relate to traditional energy development. This Article explores the impact of the McGirt decision on traditional energy development through an environmental justice lens. After a brief introduction, Part I of the Article summarizes the legal background that governs oil and gas development in Indian country. Part II provides an in-depth analysis of McGirt-first, describing its predecessor, Sharp v. Murphy, followed by an explanation of McGirt and its holding. The Article concludes by discussing future implications of McGirt, including what it means for oil and gas development going forward as well as collateral effects. The Article constitutes an important scholarly contribution as it answers important questions left open after the Court's decision and explains how the Court's decision has broader implications for Indian country and natural resource development generally.

AB  - There is ample evidence that urban trees benefit the physical, mental, and social health of urban residents. The environmental justice hypothesis posits that environmental amenities are inequitably low in poor and minority communities, and predicts these communities experience fewer urban environmental benefits. Some previous research has found that urban forest cover is inequitably distributed by race, though other studies have found no relationship or negative inequity. These conflicting results and the single-city nature of the current literature suggest a need for a research synthesis. Using a systematic literature search and meta-analytic techniques, we examined the relationship between urban forest cover and race. First, we estimated the average (unconditional) relationship between urban forest cover and race across studies (studies = 40; effect sizes = 388). We find evidence of significant race-based inequity in urban forest cover. Second, we included characteristics of the original studies and study sites in meta-regressions to illuminate drivers of variation of urban forest cover between studies. Our meta-regressions reveal that the relationship varies across racial groups and by study methodology. Models reveal significant inequity on public land and that environmental and social characteristics of cities help explain variation across studies. As tree planting and other urban forestry programs proliferate, urban forestry professionals are encouraged to consider the equity consequences of urban forestry activities, particularly on public land.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic brings to the forefront the complex interconnected dilemmas of globalization, health equity, economic security, environmental justice, and collective trauma, severely impacting the marginalized and people of color in the United States. This lack of access to and the quality of healthcare, affordable housing, and lack of financial resources also continue to have a more significant impact on documented and undocumented immigrants. This paper aims at examining these critical issues and developing a framework for family therapists to address these challenges by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: cultural values, social determinants of health, collective trauma, and the ethical and moral responsibility of family therapists. Given the fact that family therapists may unwittingly function as the best ally of an economic and political system that perpetuates institutionalized racism and class discrimination, we need to utilize a set of principles, values, and practices that are not just palliative or after the fact but bring forth into the psychotherapeutic and policy work a politics of care. Therefore, a strong call to promote and advocate for the broader continuum of health and critical thinking preparing professionals to meet the challenges of health equity, as well as economic and environmental justice, is needed. The issues discussed in this paper are specific to the United States despite their relevance to family therapy as a field. We are mindful not to generalize the United States' reality to the rest of the world, recognizing that issues discussed in this paper could potentially contribute to international discourse.

AB  - The science on the effects of global climate change and air pollution on morbidity and mortality is clear and debate now centres around the scale and precise contributions of particular pollutants. Sufficient data existed in recent decades to support the adoption of precautionary public health policies relating to fossil fuels including shale exploration. Yet air quality and related public health impacts linked to ethical and environmental justice elements are often marginalized or missing in planning and associated decision making. Industry and government policies and practices, laws and planning regulations lagged well behind the science in the United Kingdom. This paper explores the reasons for this and what shaped some of those policies. Why did shale gas policies in England fail to fully address public health priorities and neglect ethical and environmental justice concerns. To answer this question, an interdisciplinary analysis is needed informed by a theoretical framework of how air pollution and climate change are largely discounted in the complex realpolitik of policy and regulation for shale gas development in England. Sources, including official government, regulatory and planning documents, as well as industry and scientific publications are examined and benchmarked against the science and ethical and environmental justice criteria. Further, our typology illustrates how the process works drawing on an analysis of official policy documents and statements on planning and regulatory oversight of shale exploration in England, and material from industry and their consultants relating to proposed shale oil and gas development. Currently the oil, gas and chemical industries in England continue to dominate and influence energy and feedstock-related policy making to the detriment of ethical and environmental justice decision making with significant consequences for public health.

AB  - There is a fragmented approach to social sustainability in the literature, and this paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the meanings and interpretations of that concept while reviewing and discussing the social dimension of sustainability from the perspectives of two fields: urban development as well as companies and products. The analysis identifies commonalities and differences in the understanding of the conceptualization of social sustainability and helps to identify core aspects that cross disciplinary boundaries. The paper shows that compiling a list of comprehensive aspects that is representative of social sustainability is not straightforward, as interpretations are context dependant and aspects are often closely interconnected. Differences often occur because of variations in scoping and context, or whether or not a life cycle perspective is used. Nonetheless, there seems to be an underlying common understanding of what social sustainability is, and a set of key themes (social capital, human capital and well-being) is suggested as an alternative to put more specific measures and indicators in perspective. However, context-specific information is still necessary in practical applications. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - The Bear River is driven by a highly variable, snow-driven montane ecosystem and flows through a drought-prone arid region of the western United States. It traverses three states, is diverted to store water in an ecologically unique natural lake, Bear Lake, and empties into the Great Salt Lake at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (BRMBR). People in the Bear River Basin have come to anticipate droughts, building a legal, institutional, and engineered infrastructure to adapt to the watershed's hydrologic realities and historical legacies. Their ways of understanding linked vulnerabilities has led to what might appear as paradoxical outcomes: farmers with the most legally secure water rights are the most vulnerable to severe drought; managers at the federal Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge engage in wetland farming and make unlikely political alliances; and, increased agricultural irrigation efficiency in the Bear River Basin actually threatens the water supply of some wetlands. The rationality of locality is the key to understanding how people in the Bear River Basin have increased their adaptive capacity to droughts by recognizing their interdependencies. As the effects of climate change unfold, understanding social-ecological system linkages will be important for guiding future adaptations and enhancing resilience in ways that appropriately integrate localized ecosystem capacity and human needs.

AB  - The rapid transition to clean energy is fraught with potential inequities. As clean energy policies ramp up in scale and ambition, they confront challenging new questions: Who should pay for the transition? Who should live next to the industrial-scale wind and solar farms these policies promote? Will the new "green" economy be a fairer one, with more widespread opportunity, than the fossil fuel economy it is replacing? Who gets to decide what kinds of resources power our decarbonized world? In this article, we frame these challenges as part of an emerging agenda of "clean energy justice." Mapping this agenda highlights the equity challenges that will attend the transition to clean energy, and allows for more comprehensive, creative approaches to legal and policy solutions. A cleaner energy economy does not ineluctably translate into a more just economy. We identify four considerations that will be critical to ensure that clean energy does not entrench widening inequalities in wealth and power: (1) how to fund the transition; (2) who benefits from the upsides of the new clean energy economy, including green jobs and new technologies like rooftop solar panels; (3) who participates in decisions about the shape of the new clean energy economy; and (4) how and where new clean energy infrastructure is sited. Drawing from available data, we describe why there are real risks that the gains of clean energy might be unequally distributed, while the costs fall on rural communities and non-adopters of new technologies, thus exacerbating inequality while greening the grid. And through original empirical research, we highlight the challenges of full and equal participation in the esoteric, technocratic procedures of energy law. The present moment is a critical one for bringing these diverse considerations together into this overarching agenda. The U.S. energy system is in the early days of a long transition away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. It is time for energy lawmakers and energy law scholars to better anticipate the distributive and procedural justice concerns that will attend this transition, and to forge new ways to address them.

Muskegon Heights is a small, predominantly African-American city near the shores of Lake Michigan. The City had a thriving industrial job base from the early 1900's until the early 1970's, when many plants closed their doors and moved to the southern United States or other countries. The economic devastation caused by the City's high unemployment rate, the loss of high paying manufacturing jobs, and environmental degradation cannot be overestimated. Despite these significant obstacles, the City is deeply committed to urban revitalization. Muskegon Heights' brownfields program is a key part of this community-based revitalization process. A decades-old wastewater treatment plant caught a national spotlight in the United States through the efforts of the City. The City operated the plant from the 1920's until the early 1970's when it connected to a regional treatment system. The plant was then leased to a succession of hazardous waste treatment companies that used it to treat electroplating and oil wastes until 1990. The current corporate successor of the lessee, the Safety-Kleen Corporation, is in bankruptcy. The site has been unused for the last decade due to concerns about heavy metal and solvent contamination and cleanup liability. Instead of being discouraged by the regulatory and financial hurdles, the City has approached the project as an opportunity to create both needed housing and a prototype for other low-income, minority, urban communities that want to attract middle-income families back to their community. In 2001 this project was selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) as one of five national Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Brownfields pilots.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning is a scientific method of prioritising scarce resources to minimise the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. The approach aims to consider social, economic and political imperatives, and may be used by municipalities to designate their (predominantly) natural open space systems, in the form of a conservation plan. However, the multidimensional outcomes of implementing these conservation plans - in terms of both positive and negative ecological, social, and institutional dimensions - are rarely critically evaluated. We present a practical approach to assess the outcomes of implementing natural open space plans in urban areas, especially for the local (municipal) level where resource challenges may hinder assessment. The approach, drawn from comparisons of existing conservation assessment frameworks, considers the following outcome categories: ecological/natural; social/human; financial (institutional); and management (institutional). The approach is tested on a South African case study, and factors (challenges and opportunities) affecting the outcomes of implementing natural open space plans are identified. The results underscore how ecological outcomes are negatively affected by habitat transformation attributed to urbanisation and inappropriate land use management; and transgressions such as illegal, exploitive land uses. In respect of the social/human outcomes, collaborative partnerships with civil society, and the involvement of champions, are pivotal to implementation success. We found that financial and management institutional constraints contribute to inadequate investment in natural open space planning exacerbated by budget alignment to short and medium-term socio-economic and political priorities. The inter-dependence of the different outcomes emphasises the complexity of socialecological systems and the need for a holistic assessment. Understanding the factors affecting the outcomes of implementing natural open space plans allows local government to respond to the emerging knowledge of changing ecological and socio-economic conditions, facilitating the institutionalisation of adaptive management approaches, which appreciate the intertwined nature of social-ecological systems. This can, in turn, enhance decision-making processes, and advance conservation outcomes, ecosystem resilience and resulting flows of ecosystem services provided by nature, which are essential for human well-being.

AB  - There is growing recognition that "human development" frameworks, such as the Capabilities Approach (CA) with its emphasis on the promotion of justice, offer promise for guiding efforts aimed at enhancing mental wellbeing. This article explores challenges that might arise when there is a need to arbitrate among the competing demands of different parties in their efforts to enhance capabilities. Particular tensions can arise when the efforts of particular individuals to enhance their capabilities exert pressure on scarce resources, or threaten the safety and security of people living in precarious environmental contexts. Consideration is given to the need for "an ethos of restraint" to balance the consumption of resources aimed at facilitating human development on the one hand, with the need to promote environmental justice on the other. The paper highlights research that has investigated how environmental factors can impact on mental wellbeing, including rapid urbanization, climate change related issues (such as weather systems, drought, food insecurity and rising sea-levels), and access to "green/blue spaces". As such, the paper explores the important links that can exist between people and the ecosystems in which they live (including the way in which particular cultural beliefs and practices of indigenous groups can be tethered to the land). Elinor Ostrom's "design principles", derived from her work investigating the sustainable use of pooled resources, are presented as a helpful means of assisting members of communities to negotiate and apply "functioning constraints", which can promote environmental justice whilst not compromising efforts aimed at promoting mental wellbeing.

AB  - Since the introduction of neoclassical economic theory, material wealth and accumulation have been linked to hedonic wellbeing. In turn, Utilitarian notions have generated the belief that infinite growth is not only good but necessary for society to prosper. Unsurprisingly, this belief system has supported the considerable depletion of natural resources and has not always led to social equitability or environmental justice, two pillars of sustainable development. Given these limitations, this paper looks into eudaimonic wellbeing, as defined by Stoicism. The latter originating in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome, has been used throughout the centuries to discuss and support the flourishing of individuals, but has rarely been applied to collective wellbeing. Consequently, we explore whether, and to what extent, this virtue-based philosophy can answer questions regarding the value and the role of material acquisition in societal development, as directed by sustainable policy. We propose the idea that the Stoic emphasis on prudence, self-control, courage and justice, as the only means to achieve "happiness", is intrinsically linked to sustainable wellbeing and that its principles can be used to demonstrate that society does not require limitless growth to flourish.

AB  - The anthropocene is often discussed as an era of 'new' environmental changes that require unprecedented forms of societal adaptation, one example being climate-induced resettlement. Yet discussions of the anthropocene can also be better contextualized in terms of their featuring certain phenomena as 'new' that are really much more longstanding phenomena. For example, many Indigenous peoples have ancient traditions of environmental 'mobility.' This essay reviews some of the history of Indigenous philosophies, especially Anishinaabe, of mobility, migration, and resettlement. Often these philosophies focus on fluid and transformative relationships as constituting the fabric of resilient societies. Indigenous traditions of mobility are critically relevant for climate justice. They put into relief how colonial power can operate as a containment strategy that works to curtail mobility. In this way, looking at Indigenous mobility in the anthropocene involves unraveling layers of colonialism where containment has been widely imposed. This claim can be used to signal some of the dangers of centering the causal role of climate change in certain cases societal movement. To further support our claims, the essay concludes with a brief analysis of some of the literature and testimonies on resettlement in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.

AB  - Social movements move and grow by autopoesis-by calling their prospective ranks to order using public pronouncements replete with consequential assumptions about the world as they see it. In the same way, governing bodies and vested economic interests stake out opposing public positions. In the wake of the crucial international climate negotiations in Paris, December 2015, at which the nations adopted the first truly universal climate treaty, we look back over five years of participatory ethnographic research inside the UN climate talks and the social movements for climate justice, identifying key lifeworld assumptions inscribed in the public position-taking of central economic, public, and political sphere actors. Our findings include grounds for skepticism that UN climate policy can transcend the power of the fossil fuel companies to attenuate both international ambitions and national contributions to the universal effort, but also an exciting possibility that climate justice philosophy and tactics, aided by bold counter-spectacle techniques from the Occupy movement, might return to the stage in the coming years and lead the necessary deep culture shift that decarbonization will require.

AB  - The term 'Just Transition' (JT) emerged from the 1970s North American labour movement to become a campaign for a planned energy transition that includes justice and fairness for workers. There is diversity in the JT narratives and ambitions that different actors put forward regarding its aims and strategies. This article critically reviews academic and grey literature on the JT in the Global North and South Africa to examine how labour, advocacy, private sector, and governmental actors frame and formulate the JT, and how narrative patterns across actors can signal transformative justice. Highlighting the JT's origins, we fill a gap in transition literature by reintroducing the labour perspective into an analysis of affirmative and transformative justice, and propose an original theoretical framework that unites scholarship in environmental and labour studies. JT proposals are examined through an analysis of the actors, approaches, and tensions across five key themes: depth & urgency, scale & scope, identity & inclusion, material equity, and participation & power. Finally, we synthesise trends in our findings in relation to prominent JT discourses in the literature - Green Growth, Green Keynesianism, Energy Democracy, and Green Revolution - and discuss the transformative potential of JT alliances and coalitions going into the future.

However, the scholarship in this area is lacking. In this brief note, we explore a case of environmental migration that was linked to drought in Kenya. We found that their experiences tend to be different than those that are highlighted or warned about in the literature. Through considering these differences, we propose several avenues for social work to support this population appropriately and ethically.

AB  - The Anacostia River severs Washington, D.C. Military waste, urban runoff, and former farmland dirty the water, but people who live along its shores cherish the river and fight to make it clean. Political ecology, stressing the power relations, inequalities, connections, and contradictions that join natural and social processes over time, enlarges historical and anthropological theory in Washington. In this article I explore the experiences and perspectives of people who have lived along the Anacostia River over the last 10,000 years. Linked transformations in environmental and social processes repeatedly created unsettled, contradictory, and unjust relations between people and the natural and built environment. The pollution of the Anacostia River reflects colonialism and conquest: nationalism, militarism, empire; racism, inequality, and urban renewal. I begin with the British conquest, then turn to four successive moments in state formation: the founding of the capital, the invention of a strong central government, urban renewal in the capital core, and the contemporary development of the waterfront. The use values of people who live along the river conflict with the exchange values that have dominated the city's history. The city's environmental justice movement has emerged from these use values and today confronts a massive redevelopment plan that exploits and undermines the movement.

AB  - The costs of anthropogenic environmental change are usually discussed in broad terms, for example embracing damage to the ecosystem or buildings. There has been little consideration of the direct human dimension - the cost to and of environmental victims - except in clinical terms. In order to prevent and minimise environmental victimisation it seems outlines the personal, social and cash costs of environmental victimisation, using the psyche-social literature, and brief case studies of intellectual disability, road transport and cross-border pollution. It is proposed that governments and commerce might not respond in obvious ways to these cost arguments, but 'trust' is identified as a cost that both may recognise. It is concluded that the concept of loss-costs should be central to any analysis, and the paper provides a 'Framework for comprehensive argument of the costs of environmental victimisation', in the form of a simple matrix.

AB  - Sexually violent predator (SVP) statutes define some sex offenders as dangerous enough to be segregated from society, but then require their release into local communities. This article examines how decision makers and community members interpret and respond to this inherent contradiction during disputes over SVP placements. The article departs from traditional moral panic explanations of reactions to sex offenders by linking literature on local siting conflicts to insights from legal mobilization studies in order to understand the origins and features of community opposition to sex offenders. Data from three case studies of SVP placements in California suggest that interpretations of what I call legal signals, or implicit messages embedded in state laws, produced these conflicts. The findings shed new light on the role of law in siting conflicts and collective action by explaining how state laws facilitate communities' exclusion from siting decisions, encourage local opposition, and disempower already marginalized communities.

AB  - Social scientists have entered the debate over the environmental inequities facing the poor in general, and communities of color in particular. Crucial to their empirical studies is the operational definition of "community" as a unit of analysis. Different operationalizations of community exist, leading to divergent conclusions about the extent of the problem. Earlier research concluded that inequities were national in scope, while later studies found little evidence to support the previous research. This paper examines three general ways in which community has been framed as a geographical unit of analysis in environmental justice research: (1) as a neighborhood (a place of cultural identity); (2) as part of a political jurisdiction (county, city, etc.); and (3) as approximated by data constructs (like zip code areas and census tracts). The paper discusses several theoretical and methodological issues involved in operationally defining an appropriate unit, or units, of analysis for research on environmental inequity.

AB  - Safety is an important dimension of access to green space. When parks are perceived as unsafe, people are unlikely to derive the health and community benefits from them. In this study, we examine inequities in green space access in five medium-to-large US cities using parcel-level, network-based analysis. We quantify access using three measures: proximity, congestion-weighted acreage, and crime-constrained proximity. We find that, in the five US cities studied, there is a striking lack of access to safe parks. In addition, inequalities between socioeconomic subgroups are substantially exacerbated when considering access to safe parks, with racial/ethnic minorities and low-income communities fairly consistently worse off. The results suggest that interventions to improve park safety could result in large and immediate improvements for access and environmental justice. However, even once these inequalities are addressed, there remains significant work to provide all residents with sufficient and proximal access to green space and the wide array of benefits that it has to offer.

AB  - Singapore in the 1950s was a deeply divided society. Struggling to recover from the hardships of the Second World War and fighting an internal battle that the British government termed an 'emergency', it was a time of hardship, tension, and anxiety. In the midst of this crisis, Singapore's inhabitants continued to manage the natural elements of their climate and environment, especially the dangerous combination of heavy monsoonal rains, low-lying marshland, and tidal flooding. This article examines the circumstances surrounding a particularly severe episode of flooding that occurred in December 1954. It explores how the flood's impact was exacerbated by human exigencies, especially recent government resettlement plans and infrastructural weaknesses. In line with the themes of this special issue, it explores the notion of 'justice' during a disaster. In this case, justice was intimately related to political agency, social vulnerability and resilience. Viewed in this way, the flood story can be used as a lens into the wider socio-political contexts of the time.

AB  - There exist few examples of functioning water co-governance systems where Indigenous and settler colonial governments work together to share authority for water on a nation-to-nation basis. In this paper I examine the multiple barriers to achieving water co-governance, highlighted by a multidimensional framework including distributional, procedural and recognitional (in)justices. I apply this framework to a case study in the Yukon, Canada, which is based on research conducted in partnership with four out of fourteen Yukon First Nations (Carcross/Tagish, Kluane, Tr'onclek Hwech'in and White River First Nations); all are in areas where the water governance system is shaped by Indigenous water rights and authorities that are acknowledged in modern land claim and self-government agreements. Despite the many substantive and positive changes resulting from the explicit acknowledgement of Yukon First Nation water rights, I find that this system falls short of achieving co-governance. In particular, Yukon First Nations critiques highlight the limitations imposed by the continued assertion of 'Crown' jurisdiction over water and by the marginalisation of Indigenous legal orders that follows from the privileging of settler worldviews and forms of governance. Thus, co-governance arrangements depend not only on the distributional justice of shared jurisdiction; Indigenous legal orders and relationships to water must also be reflected in the procedural and recognitional justices of the decision-making processes and institutions that are developed.

AB  - The recent growth and restructuring of the swine industry in the state of Mississippi has raised various environmental and socioeconomic concerns. We spatially examined the location and attributes of 67 industrial hug operations to determine if African American and low-income communities have a high prevalence of industrial hog operations located near their neighborhoods at the census block group level. We used spatial data and cross-classification analysis to compare the prevalence of industrial hog operations in neighborhoods that are primarily African American and low income with the prevalence in neighborhoods that are African American and affluent. We also used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between the environmental justice variables and the location of the industrial hog operations. The block group characterization showed a high prevalence of hog operations in the four highest quintiles compared with the lowest quintile for percentage African American and percentage poverty. At increasing levels of percentage African Americans and percentage of persons in poverty, there are 2.4-3.6 times more operations compared with the referent group; additionally, scale adjustment to only the hog counties reduces this to 1.8-3.1 more operations compared with the referent group, The inequitable distribution of hog-confined agricultural feeding operations in these communities may have adverse environmental impacts associated with industrial hug production, such as increased health risks and quality of life degradation, as have occurred in other areas having similar facilities.

AB  - The value of urban green space for environmental education fieldwork is empirically investigated in a study among all secondary schools in Amsterdam. The article describes how the proximity of schools to green spaces emerges as a new factor in the sustainable city' and the compact city' debate. For fieldwork excursions proximity to green spaces is crucial for establishing a pattern of outdoor environmental education. Once established, it shapes teachers' attitudes on excursions. A linear structural path analysis reveals how this in turn results in more fieldwork excursions to other destinations. Interviews with teachers show how this can be interpreted mainly as a result from iterative positive experiences with excursions close to the school, which are triggered by the availability of nearby green space. Remarkably, beside the effects of green spaces for well-being and health, the significance of green space for environmental education of children remained under-investigated. This argument came prominently to the fore in a case of urban densification within the framework of compact city policies. In the dispute about the elimination of green space, citizens claimed a high educational value would vanish, but they felt this value was not recognized in the decision-making process.

AB  - The compact city is advocated as a key strategy to establish sustainable cities. Compact city policy implies urban densification, sometimes with elimination of green space. Citizen's valuable arguments in urban densification developments in green space are easily ignored, as is explored in a case study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Place making decisions are more often legitimized with sustainability claims, and arguments from less convinced residents are denied or remain unexamined. About green space these also concern environmental qualities significant for long term sustainability of cities. This is illustrated by presenting empirical evidence about environmental education, an argument emerging from the explorative study. Environmental education should be seen as an important element in longterm sustainability, but the educational relevance of proximity of green space to schools had remained unknown. Empirical evidence of the negative effect of larger distances to green space on environmental education is presented in a geographical survey. The results suggest that close proximity to urban green space also reinforces fieldwork activities further away. As the validity of this argument was denied in the case study, this illustrates the need to establish frameworks that foster recognition and learning in open processes in urban densification.

AB  - Southeast Asia has long promoted social forestry (SF) in conservation areas, fallow forests, tree plantations, areas in timber concessions and locally managed agro-forest systems, with the engagement of diverse actors and objectives. SF has evolved from early aims of empowerment and devolution of rights advocated by global reform movements, and is now reframed in the market ideal as a win-win-win endeavor for sustainable forest management, climate change mitigation and robust entrepreneurial livelihoods. Southeast Asian states have formulated numerous standardized SF programs and policies that are often linked to broader development goals and priorities, but which have not always been a 'win' for local communities in falling short to provide full tenure rights. Civil society organizations that have provided grounded perspectives on environmental justice and rights have also converged with states on entrepreneurship and market-based solutions. Meanwhile, the private sector actor that is seen as key to these solutions is conspicuously absent within the SF policy space. Within this space of diverse and at times contradictory objectives, whose interests do SF policies serve? We examine the social forestry assemblage to investigate the different discourses, interests and agendas in the implementation of SF schemes in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Malaysian state of Sabah. The formal SF schemes involve shifting or reinforcing old discourses around forest problems and possible solutions, territorialization processes that can lead to inequities in the exclusion of rights, participation and access, and risks exacerbating contestations and inequities in claims to forest land and resources.

AB  - The Simanjiro plains, east of Tarangire National Park in Northern Tanzania are a key dispersal area for wildlife, and are of vital importance to Maasai pastoral livelihoods, which are rapidly diversifying. Diversification is coupled with fragmentation of the rangelands as agriculture expands and multiple actors compete for land. These changes reflect transformations occurring across pastoral rangelands, and pose the broader challenge of reconciling conservation and development objectives. We propose that qualitative research using a three-dimensional human well-being framework, encompassing material, relational, and subjective aspects, can inform locally legitimate and socially just conservation. Through semistructured group interviews across four villages, we explore well-being conceptions of Maasai men and women in Simanjiro. In particular we focus on the value of understanding social complexity for conservation research in the form of (i) the heterogeneity of conceptions of well-being across gender, age groups, and villages; (ii) temporal dynamics in notions and experiences. Material assets, namely land (for grazing and agriculture) and livestock are important to people but are intertwined with other aspects of well-being. Subjective well-being is centered on concerns about future security, especially with regards to land. Autonomy and social unity (relational dimension) are key priorities. We reflect on the implications for conservation at the study site, and more broadly on how well-being can better be incorporated into policy and practice that takes social justice seriously. The diversity we find in well-being priorities and experiences shows the importance of taking a disaggregated approach that conceptualizes benefits and burdens across a range of locally important well-being components ensuring the priorities of the most marginalized groups are represented.

AB  - The study analyzes the distributional equity of urban green space (UGS) among different social groups across all urban areas in China. Urban green space is measured in two ways: Park area per capita and vegetation coverage ratio within 1.6 km and 3.2 km featuring different ecosystem services they provide. Multiple regression analyses are conducted to assess relationships between different groups (children, the elderly, and migrant populations) and distributed UGS. Largely consistent to other national level studies, the nationwide analytical results indicate emerging social inequality of UGS during the urbanization of China, with a few nuances. A bi-fold pattern is observed in our case: Whilst areas with higher portions of children and senior people have less parks and high vegetation coverage, a marginalized group-internal migrant people, have more parks and low vegetation coverage in their vicinities. The results of regression analyses in different regions further shed light on revealing disparities of UGS in areas with varying socioeconomic development levels, geographical features, and urbanization paces. The implication of the study informs the decision makers to incorporate spatial patterns of social groups into green space guidance and evaluation for the purpose of promoting more equal development of UGS.

AB  - The spatial implications of urban parks on people's residential satisfaction are fueled by the desire to mitigate the rise of environmental injustice concerns in the developing world. While previous studies have examined the socio-spatial differentiation of park access and residential satisfaction, direct evidence on the role of park usage to play has been limited. This study shifts the focus from access to usage and quantitatively assess their associations with residential satisfaction. Our results quantify the evidence on the significant effects of park usage on residential satisfaction. Importantly, the association between park usage and residential satisfaction tends to be varied with local contextual amenities.

AB  - The willingness to pay can be considered as the fiscal dimension of equity in a planning context. The common solution in most western countries for such fiscal inequity is to apply taxation to rebalance; however, there is no equivalent tax category in China, where residential segregation has already occurred and intensified. This paper re-examines the traditional economic aspects of urban green space in relation to size, type and proximity level, and questions whether green fiscal equity appeared in China by exploring how homebuyers in different price ranges value green space services. Specifically, this paper uses the empirical case of Shanghai, China, to test the hypothesis via the quantile hedonic approach. The results show that people at the lowest percentile level paid a higher value for accessing urban public goods than people at the higher income percentiles, and that wealthy people prefer to purchase green space services privately. These results indicate that the traditional social equity problem may not appear in the Chines context, instead urban China's problem with social quity may be more related to the privatisation of green space provision, which is only accessible to homeowners and the resulting decline of public green space developments, which primarily affects low-income renters.

AB  - The benefits that urban green resources bring to humanity have received increasing attention, with the evidence from recent studies into public service provision specifically regarding access to green space being rather mixed. Despite a growing literature base, there is no consensus among scholars on how to measure green space access properly. The traditional GIS-based approach is criticized for inappropriately specifying geographic units and threshold distances, and for ignoring people's self-movement. This research proposes a novel approach, emphasizing the actual park users' activities, both spatially and temporally. We took advantage of the large dataset available from mobile phones to analyze billions of anonymized data samples in order to characterize the behavioral patterns of millions of people who accessed green space in an experimental procedure. We chose Shanghai as the case study because residential segregation had occurred expected to be accompanied by issues of environmental justice. The results found that social equity could be achieved, even where territorial inequity was manifest in a high-population-density context that is undergoing rapid urban growth and transition. Shanghai's vulnerable groups are not found to be unequally treated at present, but there are warning signs that market mechanisms may worsen the uneven development. Therefore, the local municipalities are required to rethink how to provide green infrastructure to different social groups, responding to the inequality and uneven development that capital can bring.

AB  - The question whether urban green resources are equitably distributed across different social groups is a major concern of social equity and environmental justice for both governments and scholars. This topic is particularly relevant for rapidly developing countries such as China where inequality is growing. This paper examines whether and to what extent the distribution of urban park services is equitable for marginalised population in China. We choose Shanghai as the case study and took into account three dimensions of group delineation, namely demographic characteristics, social economic status and social spatial structure. We employ the spatial clustering method to assess the similarities and differences of the association between the spatial patterns of accessibility to urban parks among different social groups. Interestingly, we found that vulnerable groups are favoured over more affluent citizens. Local municipal endeavours have ensured that the access to Shanghai's parks remains socially equitable. Additionally, we attributed it to the path dependence of China's socialism legacy before the market-oriented reforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The refuge function of urban parks is regarded as a place of refuge for urban residents after natural or man-made disasters and refers to survival justice. Limited research has given an account of the definition and measurement of the refuge function of urban parks. This study will propose a novel evaluation framework that will comprehensively measure the potential and invisible inequality through the access to parks for residents' refuge and will make a comparative analysis in multiscenarios, respectively from the wall effects, multiscales, different traffic modes, and supply and demand aspects. The results provide several insights that might be of great significance to the adequacy and spatial equality evaluation of urban parks for refuges in cities. The least-cost distance (LCD) model was employed to measure the minimum time cost (MTC) as accessibility for potential and invisible equality analysis. The spatial and statistics comparative analysis in multiscales suggested a considerable inequality in accessibility by different traffic modes to parks for refuging in Wuhan urban center area, China. By assessing whether the MTC for residents that reached the nearest park increased, the results confirmed that wall effect increased the invisible inequality. In particular, the invisible equality caused by wall effect of refuging was relatively greater at a finer scale and more apparent by walking. In addition, the wall effect was related to the socioeconomics of the MTC for residents that reached the nearest refuge park, which was relatively short in medium economic level areas. The findings might remind urban planners to plan and construct urban parks that consider refuge capacity and contribute to reducing the vulnerability of cities, and then help urban residents deal with natural or man-made disasters in future.

AB  - The sustainable development goals (SDGs) reflect the pursuit of achieving spatial justice. Both SDG 1.4 and SDG 11.1 reflect a concern for urban services. Life service resources, which are the new concept proposed by the Chinese government, also call for sustainable development path. However, few studies have focused on the realization of spatial justice in life service resources. This paper proposes a two-level, four-step analysis framework composed of quantity, structure, pattern, and coupling coordination to perceive the spatial justice of life service resources. Based on remote sensing technology and geographic information science, this paper acquires and analyses multi-source data including population density, building outlines, point of interests, subway lines, etc. Furthermore, the case study in downtown Beijing found the following: (1) The total life service resources are extensive and varying in type; (2) regional differences are evident and low-level equilibrium and high-level priority development coexist; (3) life service resources are concentrated in contiguous and multi-centre clusters with a greater north-south than east-west difference; (4) the overall level of life service resources is low, specifically for "high in the centre and low in the periphery" and "high in the east and low in the west". Future management should consider narrowing the development gap and formulating industry development plans to improve spatial justice. Finally, the comparison between Beijing and London and more cities in the future needs to consider the urban development stage, population density, and other aspects.

AB  - Solar PV is being rolled out on a large scale in India and other emerging economies, but in the enthusiasm for solar's promise of plentiful, low carbon energy, the social and environmental justice concerns accompanying such infrastructure development are in danger of being overlooked. In this context, this paper, using the case study of 'Charanaka Solar Park' in Gujarat state, qualitatively analyses the degree of provision for procedural justice in solar energy implementation in India using a framework drawn from social environmental and energy justice literatures. The case study illustrates how the failure of various aspects of procedural justice can result in unnecessarily large impacts on the livelihoods of rural communities and the further marginalisation of those of lowest status. We conclude with discussion of the aspects of procedural justice that need attention in low carbon energy developments in developing countries alongside some policy and governance suggestions for the achievement of this in India and elsewhere.

AB  - There is no safe detectable level of lead (Pb) in the blood of young children. In the United States, predominantly African-American Black children are exposed to more Pb and present with the highest mean blood lead levels (BLLs). However, racial disparity has not been fully examined within risk factors for early childhood Pb exposure. Therefore, we conducted secondary analysis of blood Pb determinations for 2841 US children at ages 1-5 years with citizenship examined by the cross-sectional 1999 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The primary measures were racial disparities for continuous BLLs or an elevated BLL (EBLL) >= 5 mu g/dL in selected risk factors between non-Hispanic Black children (n = 608) and both non-Hispanic White (n = 1208) or Hispanic (n = 1025) children. Selected risk factors included indoor household smoking, low income or poverty, older housing built before 1978 or 1950, low primary guardian education <12th grade/general education diploma (GED), or younger age between 1 and 3 years. Data were analyzed using a regression model corrected for risk factors and other confounding variables. Overall, Black children had an adjusted +0.83 mu g/dL blood Pb (95% CI 0.65 to 1.00, p < 0.001) and a 2.8 times higher odds of having an EBLL >= 5 mu g/dL (95% CI 1.9 to 3.9, p < 0.001). When stratified by risk factor group, Black children had an adjusted 0.73 to 1.41 mu g/dL more blood Pb (p < 0.001 respectively) and a 1.8 to 5.6 times higher odds of having an EBLL >= 5 mu g/dL (p <= 0.05 respectively) for every selected risk factor that was tested. For Black children nationwide, one in four residing in pre-1950 housing and one in six living in poverty presented with an EBLL >= 5 mu g/dL. In conclusion, significant nationwide racial disparity in blood Pb outcomes persist for predominantly African-American Black children even after correcting for risk factors and other variables. This racial disparity further persists within housing, socio-economic, and age-related risk factors of blood Pb outcomes that are much more severe for Black children.

AB  - The various benefits of urban green space are gaining increasing attention nowadays. Hence, the distribution of green space has become a scrutinized concern for spatial equity among local governments and the planning scholars. This study is the first quantitative evaluation of urban park accessibility using house-level data in urban China, from the perspective of social equity. We chose Nanjing as the empirical case and examined 2709 real estate units and 79 parks within the city. Accessibility is measured by the 10-min walking distance from homes to the adjacent urban parks. Using the Street Network Analysis model in ArcGIS and the statistical methods in SPSS, the result shows that 60.5% of the real estates in Nanjing are located within a 10-min walk to access urban parks. However, this accessibility is positively correlated with housing prices, and negatively correlated with the age of the buildings, holding all other factors constant. While affluent homeowners capture a high-quality green amenity, newly-built low-income communities, where most residents are classified as a vulnerable population, have the lowest percentage of accessible green space. This study reveals the existing spatial disparities of urban park accessibility among different socio-economic groups in Nanjing, China. Additionally, we found that urban redevelopment projects with greening and the large-scale affordable housing construction are pricing out the urban poor and rural immigrants from the inner city to the urban peripheral areas. This will reduce the accessibility to urban parks and other public service facilities among the lower income families, and exacerbate the inequality among the rich and the poor in terms of their quality of life. Main findings of this study can inform policy decisions regarding equitable park provision in the construction of the green city and the sustainable development in urban China and other developing countries.

We use data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area and examine the spatial relationship between freight-related crashes and neighborhoods with low-income and minority populations. We find that both household income and percentage of minority population are significantly correlated with the density of both freight-related crashes and freight-related crashes causing severe injuries and fatalities. The results indicate that freight-related crashes are subject to a spatial inequity problem. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating freight-related safety improvement within these low-income and minority neighborhoods.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as the "fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." The last decade has focused considerable national attention on the environmental pollution inequity that persists among the nation's poorest communities. Despite these environmental justice efforts, poor communities continue to face adverse environmental conditions. For the more than 550 Native American communities, the struggle to attain environmental justice is more than a matter of enforcing national laws equitably; it is also a matter of a federal trust duty for the protection of Indian lands and natural resources, honoring a promise that Native American homelands would forever be sustainable. Equally important is the federal promise to assist tribes in managing their reservation environments under their reserved powers of self-government, an attribute that most distinguishes tribes from other communities. The PM Northwest, Inc. (PMNW) dumpsite is located within the boundaries of the Swinomish Indian Reservation in Washington State. Between approximately 1958 and 1970, PMNW contracted with local oil refineries to dispose of hazardous wastes from their operations at the reservation dumpsite. Almost two decades would pass before the Swinomish tribe was able to persuade EPA that a cleanup action under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) was warranted. This article reviews the enduring struggle to achieve Indian environmental justice in the Swinomish homeland, a process that was dependent upon the development of the tribe's political and environmental management capacity as well as EPA's eventual acknowledgement that Indian environmental justice is integrally linked to its federal trust responsibility.

AB  - The purpose of this integrative review is to examine recent literature on the intersection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 novel coronavirus) and climate change that will lead to a greater understanding of the complexities of the urgent pandemic linked with the emerging climate crisis. A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations' views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century.

AB  - Sociological research on global climate change (GCC) can be found in several subfields, but it has primarily emerged within the theoretical and substantive domain of sociology of the environment. This review provides an overview of sociological literature on climate change and identifies key areas for further research and development. The review focuses on four broad areas: social causes, construction of the problem, relationship between GCC and social inequality, and social dimensions of mitigation and adaptation.

AB  - The decline in human mobility and socioeconomic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by reports of significant improvements in air quality. We evaluate whether there was a uniform improvement in air quality across neighborhoods, with a special attention on differences by race. We focus on the COVID-19 lockdown in New York State, an early epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. Using a triple difference-in-differences model, we find that, despite the seasonal decline in particulate matter pollution starting late March (concurrent with the lockdown period), the lockdown narrowed the disparity in air quality between census tracts with high and low shares of non-white population in rural New York, whereas the racial gap in air quality remained unchanged in urban New York.

AB  - Since the kickoff of reform and opening up, with the rapid social and economic development, China's environmental problems get increasingly serious. A review of the emergence and development of environmental problems will reveal that not all social strata cause the same degree of environmental damage, and people with different social backgrounds and lifestyles will have different impacts on the environment. Moreover, environmental risks are not evenly distributed among all social members. Different social strata and regions are subject to different proportion of environmental risks. This concerns environmental justice. Particularly, as the inter-regional economic disparities widen, the issue of environmental justice among all regions gets more and more obvious. This poses a threat to the distribution of limited environmental capacity among regions, and a potential hazard to coordinated and sustainable development among regions. Adherence to the scientific outlook of development to ensure environmental justice and coordinated development among regions has now become an important research subject on building a harmonious socialist society. In this paper, we will, taking Jiangsu Province as an example and based on the analysis of regional differences and development trends, build an environmental justice assessment index system to assess the environmental justice under regional differences and put forth suggestions on regional coordinated development.

AB  - The environment is the common property of all human beings, and all should enjoy equal rights to use the environment. Years of growth have greatly improved China's overall economic development, but the problem of environmental inequality has become prominent. Based on data from 278 prefecture-level cities, the Williamson coefficient is used to measure the environmental inequality and environmental pollution-inequality indices of 25 regions from 2003 to 2015, and the effects of the stringency of environmental policy instruments on environ-mental inequality are discussed. The results demonstrate that the provincial environmental inequalities in China between 2003 and 2015 declined at first and then rose, thus showing a U-shaped trend, and the heterogeneity of various pollutant emissions is substantial. The extent of public participation is negatively correlated with environmental inequality, while the stringencies of command-and-control and market-based instruments are positively correlated with environmental inequality. An inequality process may be necessary during the trans-formation from a high-pollution to a low-pollution state, so governments should mix a variety of environmental policy instruments to narrow or even eliminate regional environmental inequality. The findings of this study have important implications for the government to effectively choose policy instruments, improve policymaking ability, and eliminate environmental inequality.

AB  - The Clean Air Act requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency to review routinely the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5). A non-governmental Independent Particulate Matter Review Panel recently concluded that the current PM2.5 standards do not protect public health adequately and recommended revising the daily standard from 35 to 25-30 mu g/m(3) and the annual standard from 12 to 8-10 mu g/m(3). To assess the public health implications of adopting the PM2.5 standards proposed by the panel, the health benefits are quantified from their implementation based on both current (observed) and future (simulated) air quality data for California. The findings indicate that strengthening the standards would provide significant public health benefits valued at $42-$149 billion. Additionally, the stronger standards are shown to benefit environmental justice via health savings that are allocated more within environmentally and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.

AB  - The purpose of SENTIERI-ReNaM Project is to describe mesothelioma incidence in the Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs). The present report deals with 39 NPCSs (20 in Northern Italy, 8 in Central Italy and 11 in Southern Italy). Asbestos is specifically mentioned in the regulatory acts of recognition for 10 NPCSs and it is the only agent that has determined environmental contamination in 3 of them (Casale Monferrato, Broni, and Bari). The timeframe of the study is 2000-2011 for 34 out of 39 sites. The corresponding reference periods for the sites of Latium, Campania, Umbria, and Bolzano Province are, respectively, 2001-2011, 2005-2011, and 2006-2011. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) for mesothelioma, with their corresponding 90% Confidence Intervals, have been estimated for all sites. The interpretation of the study findings has been based on anamnestic information made available by the Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM), and completed thanks to knowledge derived from the international scientific literature. In men, mesothelioma incidence has shown excesses in 27/39 sites and defects in the remaining 12; in women, excesses have been reported in 20 sites, defects in 15, and no cases have been detected in the remaining 4 sites. The highest annual incidence rates have been observed in the sites characterized only by the presence of as-bestos-cement factories (Broni and Casale Monferrato): respectively, 98.0 and 68.6 per 100,000 per year in men, 72.1 and 45.8 in women. Besides these two sites, the highest rates have been observed in the sites with naval shipyards: 13.2 in men and 2.5 in women. Excesses of mesothelioma incidence have been confirmed (with respect to previous observations) in the sites of Broni, Casale Monferrato, Balangero, and in the coastal areas of Trieste, La Spezia, Venice, and Leghorn. Balangero has been the major European chrysotile quarry, while the other sites are characterized by the presence of naval shipyards with demonstrated use of asbestos before it was banned in 1992. An excess of mesothelioma incidence has also been confirmed in the site of Biancavilla, characterized by the presence of the fluoro-edenite fibrous amphibole, classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). An increased incidence of mesothelioma was also observed in the areas where no direct use of asbestos had previously been documented, like Cengio and Saliceto (chemical industry), Falconara on Sea (oil refinery), and Litorale Domizio Flegreo and Agro Aversano (a large area including multiple hazardous waste dumping sites). These findings show that a relevant proportion of Italian mesothelioma cases is concentrated in NPCSs. About 1,500 extra cases of mesothelioma have been estimated in the overall series of 39 sites (2000-2011), corresponding to 125 extra cases per year. The excess has concerned the sites with manufacture of asbestos-cement products, but also the areas with asbestos quarries, naval shipyards, illegal hazardous waste dumping sites with asbestos-containing materials, petrochemical industries, refineries and steel plants. In some sites, particularly Casale Monferrato and Broni, analytical epidemiological studies have shown the causal role of not only occupational, but also environmental exposures, with special reference to paving of gardens and courtyards with asbestos-cement industry by-products. The main novelty generated by the collaborative SENTIERI-ReNaM Project concerns the detection of significant mesothelioma excesses not only in sites where asbestos is explicitly reported as a source of contamination, but also in a number of areas defined "of national interest" for environmental cleanup due to other sources of pollution. This confirms that the range of economic activities and working and living environments affected by asbestos exposure is very wide and it is not restricted to the industrial sectors characterized by the direct use of this material.
