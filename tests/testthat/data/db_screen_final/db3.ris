AB  - Arguing for the importance of robust public participation and meaningful Tribal consultation to address the cumulative impacts of federal projects, we bridge interdisciplinary perspectives across law, public health, and Indigenous studies. We focus on openings in existing federal law to involve Tribes and publics more meaningfully in resource management planning, while recognizing the limits of this involvement when only the federal government dictates the terms of participation and analysis. We first discuss challenges and opportunities for addressing cumulative impacts and environmental justice through 2 US federal statutes: the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Focusing on a major federal planning process involving fracking in the Greater Chaco region of northwestern New Mexico, we examine how the Department of the Interior attempted Tribal consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also highlight local efforts to monitor Dine health and well-being. For Dine people, human health is inseparable from the health of the land. But in applying the primary legal tools for analyzing the effects of extraction across the Greater Chaco region, federal agencies fragment categories of impact that Dine people view holistically.

AB  - 'Health and Environment' is the nucleus of knowledge and practices surrounding the relations between society and nature, mediated by the mode of production and human labor, which help to understand the determination of the health-disease process of different social classes and groups. This paper discusses the challenges to build this field from the perspective of its Thematic Group of the Association of Collective Health. The three core themes of the 2nd Brazilian Symposium on Environmental Health are taken as the theoretical framework for analysis. A timeline of the group's trajectory, in its historical context, helps to identify the contemporary challenges. Among the main challenges identified, the challenge of building an interdisciplinary, intersectoral and participatory scientific practice, which could build knowledge and dialogue with social movements, is highlighted.

AB  - An improved understanding of traffic-related air pollutants is needed to estimate exposures and adverse health impacts in traffic corridors and near-road environments. In this study, concentrations of black carbon (BC), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10, ultrafine particles, and accumulation mode particles, AMP) were measured using a mobile air pollutant laboratory along nine transects across major roads in Detroit, MI in winter 2012. Repeated measurements were taken during rush-hour periods at sites in residential neighborhoods located 50-500 m from both sides of the road. Concentration gradients attributable to on-road emissions were estimated by accounting for traffic volume and mix, wind speed, wind direction, and background concentrations. BC, NO, NOx, and UFP had the strongest gradients, and elevated concentrations of NOx, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10, as well as decreased particle size, were found at the 50 m sites compared to background levels. Exponential models incorporating effects of road size, wind speed, and up- and downwind distance explained from 31 to 53% of the variability in concentration gradients for BC, NO, NOx, UFP and particle size. The expected concentration increments 50 m from the study roads were 17.0 ppb for NO,17.7 ppb for NOx, 2245 particles/cm(3) for UFP, and 0.24 mu g/m(3) for BC, and the expected distance to decrease increments by half was 89-129 m in the downwind direction, and 14-20 m in the upwind direction. While accounting for portion of the temporal and spatial variability across transects and measurement periods, these results highlight the influence of road-to-road differences and other locally-varying factors important in urban and industrial settings. The study demonstrates a methodology to quantify near-road concentrations and influences on these concentrations while accounting for temporal and spatial variability, and it provides information useful for estimating exposures of traffic-related air pollutants in urban environments.

AB  - An historical account of environmental transformations in India, with drivers of such changes, is presented in this chapter. The account starts from the period of the Indus Valley Civilization and ends in the situation in present-day India, especially the period of high rates of economic growth in the past two decades. The main driver for environmental change was growth in population caused by both in-migration and natural growth, while the main environmental change was deforestation for agriculture, and to a lesser extent for expanding human settlements. There have been numerous environmental struggles as a result. At a later stage, water systems were transformed to expand irrigation and water supplies. The chapter identifies two significant innovations based on and prompted by environmental struggles. The first innovation was the community-based resistance to commercial forest felling in the present-day Indian state of Uttarakhand where, in the early 1970s, local people opposed the practice of appointment of wealthy private contractors from faraway cities for felling of forest trees, mainly for large paper and pulp industries. Instead, the movement wanted community-based controlled felling to feed local timber-and resin-based small industries. In 1974 the common people of village Reni, especially women, took the innovative step of nonviolent obstruction to forest felling by a contractor. The second innovation described in the chapter is on the introduction of the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by the Supreme Court of India. This innovative step has significantly helped strengthening of environmental justice in India.

AB  - 'Environmental justice' refers to the human right to a healthy and safe environment, a fair share of natural resources, access to environmental information and participation in environmental decision-making. Some analysts have argued that environmental justice is undermined by the political economy of capitalism. This paper builds on this analysis by evaluating the environmental justice situation in Cuba, a country where there is little capitalist influence. Evidence is based on participant observation and interviews in Cuba, as well as secondary quantitative data. The research findings suggest that Cuba fares relatively well in terms of environmental justice, but still faces a number of challenges regarding the quality of its environment and some aspects of the environmental decision-making process. However, many of its ongoing problems can be attributed to global capitalist pressures.

AB  - American suburbs designed in the twentieth century to house a growing middle class are experiencing escalating poverty. Utilizing a mixed-method social epidemiology, this study finds high pedestrian risk in these communities, where a high poverty rate coincides with high levels of suburban sprawl. In declining suburbs, those without access to an automobile navigate a landscape centered upon the private automobile. Suggesting the term ` material mismatch' to describe cases where the configuration of the built environment is incongruent with the needs of a growing population of residents, the study makes a contribution to mobility studies, environmental justice research, and urban sociology.

AB  - "While the climate-migration nexus raises crucial questions of mobility and climate justice, it is commonly understood through simplistic narratives that reify a complex set of relations. The spectre of environmentally-induced exodus is recurrent in media, policy and activist circles, in spite of numerous studies that reveal the empirical flaws and noxious normative implications of such narratives. This article explores this insistence and the desire(s) for there to be a reified relation between climate and migration such insistence reveals. The article proceeds in three movements. First, it situates discourses on climate migration in relation to the crisis of humanism the Anthropocene signifies. Second, it operates a symptomatic reading of climate migration discourses, drawing on two understandings of symptom elaborated by Lacan - as 'return of the repressed' and as 'Sinthome'. Read as a symptom, the figure of the climate migrant/refugee appears as the return of fundamental contradictions that carve contemporary regimes of socioecological (re)production. Through the concept of 'Sinthome', discourses on climate migration can be read as (illusory) attempts to shore up for the waning consistence of modern forms of 'being human'. Finally, the article proposes a symptomatic reading of the Anthropocene itself, and elaborates on what the dissolution of this symptom/ Sinthome would entail."

AB  - An extensive body of research has been noted that many socially deprived communities tend to live in areas characterized by higher levels of outdoor air pollution. Whilst there is an expanding literature documenting this disproportionate distribution, most previous studies have taken place in the Global North, have focused with industrial or vehicle air pollution sources and have tend to ignore the complex interactions between exposures, public perceptions and social factors. In this paper, we investigate the social vulnerability to and risk perceptions of air pollution sourced from domestic heating in two Chilean cities with particularly high levels of PM2.5 during winter months. To this end, we integrate primary survey data, with geographically detailed estimates of air pollution exposures and area-level characteristics obtained from the Chilean Census. We first examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 exposures and air quality perceptions, and subsequently explore relationships between socio-demographic characteristics, air pollution exposure, and health concerns. Our results revel evident spatial patterns of dispersion, with some neighborhoods being more polluted than others. Age and percentage of roofs in poor condition in the participant's census tract are the best predictors of PM2.5 exposure. We find no correlation between perceived and real levels of contamination. Our multivariate analysis indicates that personal perceptions of air quality are significantly associated with age, gender, family structure, and heating behaviors. Such detailed depictions provide insights into potential meaningful strategies to improve air quality and highlight the need to incorporate measures to better protect older adults.

AB  - Background: We report on the challenges of obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) coverage for a community-based participatory research (CBPR) environmental justice project, which involved reporting biomonitoring and household exposure results to participants, and included lay participation in research. Methods: We draw on our experiences guiding a multi-partner CBPR project through university and state Institutional Review Board reviews, and other CBPR colleagues' written accounts and conference presentations and discussions. We also interviewed academics involved in CBPR to learn of their challenges with Institutional Review Boards. Results: We found that Institutional Review Boards are generally unfamiliar with CBPR, reluctant to oversee community partners, and resistant to ongoing researcher-participant interaction. Institutional Review Boards sometimes unintentionally violate the very principles of beneficence and justice which they are supposed to uphold. For example, some Institutional Review Boards refuse to allow report-back of individual data to participants, which contradicts the CBPR principles that guide a growing number of projects. This causes significant delays and may divert research and dissemination efforts. Our extensive education of our university Institutional Review Board convinced them to provide human subjects protection coverage for two community-based organizations in our partnership. Conclusions: IRBs and funders should develop clear, routine review guidelines that respect the unique qualities of CBPR, while researchers and community partners can educate IRB staff and board members about the objectives, ethical frameworks, and research methods of CBPR. These strategies can better protect research participants from the harm of unnecessary delays and exclusion from the research process, while facilitating the ethical communication of study results to participants and communities.

AB  - Articles from four California newspapers focusing on pesticide use and farm workers were content analyzed to track inclusion of pro- and anti-pesticide sources, along with neutral sources. The authors applied hegemony theory to news content and historical, socioeconomic, and demographic data. Results indicate that in all newspapers, "counter-hegemonic" anti-pesticide sources were the most-often quoted. Analysis suggests that newspapers, themselves part of the ruling hegemony, nevertheless do sometimes provide significant space for opposing voices on environmental justice issues, especially when the sources become professional challengers, such as the United Farm Workers Union, highly legitimized by their routine use in the press.

AB  - Background: Somerville, Massachusetts, an ethnically diverse, urban community northwest of Boston, presents opportunities and challenges for active living. With a dense street grid, well-maintained sidewalks, neighborhood parks, and existing Community Path, Somerville is very walkable. However, two major Surface arteries traverse and bisect neighborhoods, creating pedestrian safety and environmental justice issues. Intervention: Major goals included promoting increased collaboration and Communication among existing active-living efforts; managing the Community Path extension project; encouraging Portuguese-speaking adults to incorporate daily physical activity; leveraging existing urban planning work to establish secure, attractive walking/biking corridors; and embedding active-living messages in everyday life. Results: The Somerville Active Living by Design Partnership (ALbD) successfully created a robust task force that was integrated with citywide active-living efforts, secured resources to increase infrastructure and support for active living, including city-level coordinator positions, and changed decision-making practices that led to incorporation of pedestrian and bicycle transportation priorities into city planning and that influenced the extension of the Community Path. Lessons learned: Partnerships must employ sustainability planning early on, utilize skilled facilitative leaders to manage leadership transitions, and engage new partners. Identifying, cultivating, and celebrating champions, especially those with political power, are critical. Working closely with research partners leads to rich data sources for planning and evaluation. Changing the built environment is difficult; working toward smaller wins is realistic and achievable. Conclusions: The synergy of ALbD and other community interventions created a foundation for short-term Successes and accelerated political- cultural changes already underway with respect to active living.

AB  - Background: The study is aimed at assessing social inequities in the location of polluting industries in the Basque Country, and at exploring if the effect on mortality of living near air polluting industries is modified by economic deprivation. Methods: This is a cross-sectional ecological study that uses the census sections as analysis units. Mortality from all causes, lung cancer, respiratory diseases and ischaemic heart disease were studied. Ordinal logistic regression models were fitted to assess if proximity of census sections to polluting industries is associated with deprivation. Bayesian Poisson regression models were used to explore if the association between proximity to polluting industries and mortality is modified by socio-economic deprivation. Results: Proximity to a polluting industry and deprivation are positively associated, showing a clear gradient across deprivation quintiles. In women, the risk associated with proximity to metal-processing industries grows as the deprivation of the area increases in the case of total and lung cancer mortality. In men, the interaction terms between proximity and deprivation are positive for total, ischaemic heart disease mortality, with a credibility level approaching 90%. High levels of deprivation are associated with greater risk of mortality, excepting lung cancer in women. Conclusion: There is a higher proportion of more deprived census sections around polluting industries in the Basque Country. Risks of mortality associated with proximity to polluting industries tend to be higher in more deprived areas.

AB  - Are a country's environmental attitudes linked to its level of economic development? In recent decades, rapid industrialization and the use of cheaper but older production technologies have reduced environmental quality in less developed countries (LDCs). Moreover, these countries have been disproportionally affected by global pollution in that they suffer the effects while having emitted less than industrialized countries. To what extent are people in LDCs ready to make sacrifices to improve environmental conditions? International Social Survey Program 2010 data reveal that people in LDCs are less supportive of international agreements forcing their country to take necessary environmental measures than are citizens in the developed world. Moreover, they are more likely to think that wealthier countries should make more effort to protect the environment, and are less willing to make personal economic sacrifices or change their consumption behavior to accommodate environmental concerns. These results hold even after controlling for post-materialist values, political ideology, personal income, and several other demographic variables.

AB  - Background: While numerous studies have found socially disadvantaged groups such as minorities and low-income individuals to be disproportionately distributed with respect to various health hazards and pollution sources, previous research has not examined if people with disabilities reside near facilities where accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances are likely to occur. Objective: Using data from the 2011-2015 American Community Survey estimates and facilities submitting Risk Management Plans (RMPs) to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the distribution of proximity to RMP facilities is compared to the disability characteristics of the civilian noninstitutionalized population in Harris County, Texas. The goal is to determine whether neighborhoods containing a higher proportion of disabled individuals are located near RMP facilities, after controlling for relevant socio-demographic factors. Methods: Proximity to RMP facilities is calculated at the census tract level using a spatial enumeration methodology developed by the EPA. Statistical analyses are based on descriptive comparisons, bivariate correlations, and multivariate generalized estimating equations-a modeling technique appropriate for clustered data. Results: RMP facility proximity increases significantly as the percentage of overall disability, as well as the percentages for specific types of disability increase, after accounting for population density, racial/ ethnic composition, and socioeconomic status of neighborhoods. Disabled individuals with hearing and cognitive difficulties are particularly more likely to reside near RMP facilities. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the growing need to consider individuals with physical and mental disabilities in future research on environmental justice and health risk disparities, as well as evacuation planning for chemical accidents.

AB  - Articulations of climate justice were central to the diverse mobilisations that opposed the Copenhagen Climate Talks in December 2009. This paper contends that articulations of climate justice pointed to the emergence of three co-constitutive logics: antagonism, the common(s), and solidarity. Firstly, we argue that climate justice involves an antagonistic framing of climate politics that breaks with attempts to construct climate change as a post-political issue. Secondly, we suggest that climate justice involves the formation of pre-figurative political activity, expressed through acts of commoning. Thirdly, we contend that climate justice politics generates solidarities between differently located struggles and these solidarities have the potential to shift the terms of debate on climate change. Bringing these logics into conversation can develop the significance of climate justice for political practice and strategy. We conclude by considering what is at stake in different articulations of climate justice and tensions in emerging forms of climate politics.

AB  - As air quality sensors increasingly become commercially available, a deeper consideration of their usability and usefulness is needed to ensure effective application by the public. Much of the research related to sensors has focused on data quality and potential applications. While this information is important, a greater understanding of users' experience with sensors would provide complementary information. Under a U.S. EPA-funded Science to Achieve Results grant awarded to the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California, titled "Engage, Educate, and Empower California Communities on the Use and Applications of Low-Cost Air Monitoring Sensors", approximately 400 air quality sensors were deployed with 14 California communities. These communities received sensors and training, and they participated in workshops. Widely varying levels of sensor installation and engagement were observed across the 14 communities. However, despite differences between communities (in terms of participation, demographics, and socioeconomic factors), many participants offered similar feedback on the barriers to sensor use and strategies leading to successful sensor use. Here, we assess sensor use and participant feedback, as well as discuss the development of an educational toolkit titled "Community in Action: A Comprehensive Toolkit on Air Quality Sensors". This toolkit can be leveraged by future community and citizen science projects to develop networks designed to collect air quality information that can help reduce exposure to and the emissions of pollutants, leading to improved environmental and public health.

AB  - As a response to profoundly poor air quality and associated environmental justice concerns in the San Joaquin Valley region in California, the Tune In & Tune Up (TI&TU) program provides residents with free vehicle emissions testing and vouchers for smog repair. We used data on approximately 19,000 repaired TI&TU vehicles from 2012 to 2018, and several estimation techniques, to quantify a range of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions prevented as a result of the program. We then calculated resulting mortality impacts from reduced exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the form of secondary nitrates. After applying a novel smog repair emissions abatement depreciation function, we find that six years of operation of the TI&TU program has reduced NOx emissions by approximately 53-302 tons by the end of 2018. Using a concentration response function for ambient PM2.5, we found that between 0.055 and 0.31 premature deaths have also been avoided. We present multiple methods for assessing public health impacts, which can be used as guidance for evaluating similar transportation-based emission reduction programs.

AB  - As an emerging domain of risk research, nanotechnologies engender novel research questions, including how new technologies are encountered given different framing and contextual detail. Using data from a recent U.S. national survey of perceived risks (N = 1,100), risk versus benefit framings and the specific social positions from which people encounter or perceive new technologies are explored. Results indicate that vulnerability and attitudes toward environmental justice significantly influenced risk perceptions of nanotechnology as a broad class, while controlling for demographic and affective factors. Comparative analyses of different examples of nanotechnology applications demonstrated heightened ambivalence across acceptability when risk versus benefit information was provided with application descriptions (described in short vignettes as compared to the general category "nanotechnology," absent of risk or benefit information). The acceptability of these nano-specific vignettes varied significantly in only some cases given indexes of vulnerability and attitudes toward environmental justice. However, experimental narrative analyses, using longer, more comprehensive descriptive passages, show how assessments of risks and benefits are tied to the systematically manipulated psychometric qualities of the application (its invasiveness and controllability), risk messaging from scientists, and the social implications of the technology with regard to justice. The article concludes with discussion of these findings for risk perception research and public policy related to nanotechnology and possibly other emerging technologies.

AB  - Amid the surge in research on mobility and migration in the context of environmental change, little research has focused on the experiences of people for whom travel is cyclical and a part of daily, weekly, or seasonal life. For Inuit in Arctic North America, the land is the heart of cultural and community life. Disruption to time spent on the land is reported to impact the emotional health and well-being of individuals and communities. There is concern that environmental change is creating barriers to safe travel, constituting a creeping disaster. We systematically review and evaluate the literature for discussion of barriers to travel for Inuit in Arctic North America, using an approach from the field of disaster anthropology to identify root causes of constraints to mobility. We identify root causes of risk and barriers to time spent on the land. These emerge from historic and contemporary colonial policy and inequality, as opposed to environmental hazards per se, impacting people's mobility in profound ways and enacting a form of slow violence. These results suggest a need to understand the underlying processes and institutions that put people at risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The field of risk assessment has focused on protecting the health of individual people or populations of wildlife from single risks, mostly from chemical exposure. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began to address multiple risks to communities in the '' Framework for Cumulative Risk Assessment '' [EPA/630/PO2/00 1F. Washington DC:Risk Assessment Forum, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2003)]. Simultaneously, several reports concluded that some individuals and groups are more vulnerable to environmental risks than the general population. However, vulnerability has received little specific attention in the risk assessment literature. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to examine the issue of vulnerability in cumulative risk assessment and present a conceptual framework rather than a comprehensive review of the literature. In this article we consider similarities between ecologic and human communities and the factors that make communities vulnerable to environmental risks. DISCUSSION: The literature provides substantial evidence on single environmental factors and simple conditions that increase vulnerability or reduce resilience for humans and ecologic systems. This observation is especially true for individual people and populations of wildlife. Little research directly addresses the topic of vulnerability in cumulative risk situations, especially at the community level. The community level of organization has not been adequately considered as an end point in either human or ecologic risk assessment. Furthermore, current information on human risk does not completely explain the level of response in cumulative risk conditions. Ecologic risk situations are similarly more complex and unpredictable for cases of cumulative risk. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial conditions and responses are the principal missing element for humans. We propose a model for including psychologic and social factors as an integral component of cumulative risk assessment.

AB  - An investigation of road sediment in Gary, Indiana revealed high levels of various trace metals such as Zn, Mn, and Cr, often exceeding those of background reference concentrations as shown through geoaccumulation indices and contamination factors. The hazard index (HI) value for Mn in children was > 1 (1.7), suggesting possible long-term non-carcinogenic health risk. Mn HI for children is even higher for the five samples closest to a US Steel facility, with an HI of 2.8. Through SEM-EDS analysis, the prevalence of small particulates (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) containing potentially harmful elements such as Mn and Pb illustrate a health risk through direct inhalation or ingestion. The small nature of particulates in general may also pose an increased health risk for respiratory diseases such as asthma. Mn concentrations in the road sediment were particularly high, with 30 out of 32 samples exceeding 1800 ppm. Mn and V concentrations show a strong spatial trend of decreasing concentration away from a US Steel facility. These spatial trends along with correlation plots of the bulk chemistry suggest that industrial steel manufacturing, particularly US Steel in Gary, is a major contributing source of Mn and V. Fe and Cr show a moderate decrease in concentrations away from the US Steel facility, which suggests some sourcing from the steel facility when coupled with bulk chemistry plots. Zn and Cu do not show much evidence of sourcing from the US Steel facility, likely due to increased mixing from other sources. Further work constraining anthropogenic sources, the bioaccessible fraction of metals, and analysis of direct atmospheric particulates can help with remedial activity and risk assessment.

AB  - As accounting academics, we have a responsibility to act in the public interest as conscience, critic and counselor of society regarding economic, social and environmental justice. In fulfilling this responsibility, we are concerned with how accounting, accountants, and accountability regimes can facilitate democracy by serving the needs of pluralistic communities, giving particular attention to the various underserved constituencies. Informed by Flyvbjerg's (2001) notion of phronetic social science research that matters, we reviewed 353 articles published in Critical Perspectives on Accounting from 1990 to 2014 identifying the focal constituency(s), the injustice(s) addressed, the groups or institutions responsible for the injustice as well as the proposals for social and political praxis outlined in the studies. Our review indicates that generally the studies identify a somewhat focused, though salient and appropriate, set of economic, social and/or environmental injustices experienced by various constituencies, and to some extent, the studies consider the context and conditions that perpetuate the inequality and injustices. However, as the field matures, there is a need for more robust development of the social and political implications of critical accounting research and for articulating the ideas and implications as action programs. Further, our review suggests that several relevant constituencies such as non-human animals, children, future generations, developing nations, and gender and sex/uality minorities have received little or no attention in the current literature.

AB  - An appreciation of the psychological impacts of global climate change entails recognizing the complexity and multiple meanings associated with climate change; situating impacts within other social, technological, and ecological transitions; and recognizing mediators and moderators of impacts. This article describes three classes of psychological impacts: direct (e.g., acute or traumatic effects of extreme weather events and a changed environment); indirect (e.g., threats to emotional well-being based on observation of impacts and concern or uncertainty about future risks); and psychosocial (e.g., chronic social and community effects of heat, drought, migrations, and climate-related conflicts, and postdisaster adjustment). Responses include providing psychological interventions in the wake of acute impacts and reducing the vulnerabilities contributing to their severity; promoting emotional resiliency and empowerment in the context of indirect impacts; and acting at systems and policy levels to address broad psychosocial impacts. The challenge of climate change calls for increased ecological literacy, a widened ethical responsibility, investigations into a range of psychological and social adaptations, and an allocation of resources and training to improve psychologists' competency in addressing climate change-related impacts.

AB  - An increasing number of studies have sought to identify disparities or inequalities in the distribution of urban parks and green spaces. Results of these analyses have diverged considerably depending on the method used to assess accessibility. In this article, we revisit an increasingly popular technique, the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method, and modify it to better align with the ways in which parks are planned and intended to be used. In this respect, we develop a Variable-width Floating Catchment Area (VFCA) method that models park attractiveness as a function of its size and number of amenities. We further compare accessibility according to four modes of transportation: bicycling, driving, public transit, and walking. A case study on access to public parks in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, the U.S. is performed. In general, walking access to parks is found to be low throughout the county, access to larger regional parks is greatest for outlying suburban areas, and center city residents have access to a greater number of park amenities. Study results are compared to those obtained when using the original 2SFCA and indicate important differences in spatial accessibility patterns. Consequently, caution must be adopted when choosing a spatial access model and interpreting the resulting spatial patterns of accessibility. The parameters of the VFCA can easily be set to different values, making it a tool for scenario analyses. This study further improves our understanding regarding accessibility to public parks, which can help develop effective planning strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An estimated 11 million people in the US have home wells with unsafe levels of hazardous metals and nitrate. The national scope of the health risk from consuming this water has not been assessed as home wells are largely unregulated and data on well water treatment and consumption are lacking. Here, we assessed health risks from consumption of contaminated well water on the Crow Reservation by conducting a community-engaged, cumulative risk assessment. Well water testing, surveys and interviews were used to collect data on contaminant concentrations, water treatment methods, well water consumption, and well and septic system protection and maintenance practices. Additive Hazard Index calculations show that the water in more than 39% of wells is unsafe due to uranium, manganese, nitrate, zinc and/or arsenic. Most families' financial resources are limited, and 95% of participants do not employ water treatment technologies. Despite widespread high total dissolved solids, poor taste and odor, 80% of families consume their well water. Lack of environmental health literacy about well water safety, pre-existing health conditions and limited environmental enforcement also contribute to vulnerability. Ensuring access to safe drinking water and providing accompanying education are urgent public health priorities for Crow and other rural US families with low environmental health literacy and limited financial resources.

AB  - As an appointed member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), Ellerbrock meets with local stakeholders and participates in public hearings across the nation in which poor and minority communities suffer disproportionally from chemical exposure, pollution incidents and aesthetic degradation. In this paper, we begin by looking at what three core disciplines - economics, ecology and ecumenism - have in common. Often perceived today as philosophic enemies, the disciplines have common roots in the ancient Greek notion of a household - oikos. Integrating the roots of economics, ecology and ecumenism reveals a tri-partite household that must be managed in harmony for it to be sustainable. In light of violent conflicts (historical and current) over economic resources, political worldviews and religious values, ecumenism is a critical factor aimed at mutual understanding, respect and collaboration among diverse groups. Locally and globally, true peace is more than the absence of conflict/war. A key component of quality of life, Environmental Justice (EJ) is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for sustainable development.

AB  - An analysis of the overlap between tropical forest restoration, human populations, development and national policies for community forest ownership shows that 294.5 million people live within forest restoration opportunity land in the Global South. Forest restoration occupies centre stage in global conversations about carbon removal and biodiversity conservation, but recent research rarely acknowledges social dimensions or environmental justice implications related to its implementation. We find that 294.5 million people live on tropical forest restoration opportunity land in the Global South, including 12% of the total population in low-income countries. Forest landscape restoration that prioritizes local communities by affording them rights to manage and restore forests provides a promising option to align global agendas for climate mitigation, conservation, environmental justice and sustainable development.

AB  - Background: The ger (tent city) areas in Mongolia are a product of rapid urbanization and transitional economic development combine with lack of institutional, administrative and financial capacity of governments to cope with the pace. These areas have become traps for inequities in social and environmental services and the associated effects on human health. Disparities in childhood lead exposure in such communities are largely unexplored. Methods: We measured the concentrations of lead in blood of children, aged 4-7years, in Erdenet (Orkhon Province) and Darkhan (Darkhan-Uul Province), the second and third largest cities in Mongolia. A survey instrument was used to gather information on influencing factors on lead exposure and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was usedto assess a spectrum of behavioral problems among the children. Results: The mean blood lead level (BLL) of children in the two cities was found to be 3.82.6g/dL (range: <1.5-17.2g/dL) and 27.8% of the children had BLLs 5g/dL. Average BLL of children in Erdenet (a mining center) was significantly higher than that for children in Darkhan, and there was statistically significant difference between average BLL of children who live in ger district (4.2 +/- 2.8g/dL) compared to those of children in housing units within the city (3.2 +/- 2.4g/dL). In spite of the low values, BLLs was significantly associated with a number of effects on the spectrum of behavioral disorders, specifically with the scores for hyperactivity, conduct disorder and pro-social behavior. Conclusions: This study shows that childhood lead poisoning is common especially in ger communities of the urban areas of Mongolia. It contributes evidence showing that BLL low as 3.8g/dL can selectively activate some effects from a spectrum of likely behavioral disorders in children.

AB  - Among several viable explanations for the ubiquitous SES-health gradient is differential exposure to environmental risk. We document evidence of inverse relations between income and other indices of SES with environmental risk factors including hazardous wastes and other toxins, ambient and indoor air pollutants, water quality, ambient noise, residential crowding, housing quality, educational facilities, work environments, and neighborhood conditions. We then briefly over-view evidence that such exposures are inimical to health and well-being. We conclude with a discussion of the research and policy implications of environmental justice, arguing that a particularly salient feature of poverty for health consequences is exposure to multiple environmental risk factors.

AB  - Background: Socioeconomic variables are associated with mortality and morbidity in a variety of diseases at both the individual and neighborhood level. Investigating whether low socioeconomic status populations are exposed to higher air pollution has been an important objective for the scientific community during the last decade. The goal of this study was to analyze the associations between outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in an area of Asturias (Spain) and two socioeconomic indexes-one based on occupation and the other on educational level-at the census-tract level. Methods: A map of NO2 concentration was obtained from a land-use regression model. To obtain a census-tract average value, NO2 was estimated at the centroids of all 50 x 50 m grids within a census tract. Standard socioeconomic variables were used from the Census of Population and Housing 2001. We analyzed the association between NO2 concentration and socioeconomic indicators for the entire area and stratified for more urban and more rural areas. Results: A positive linear relationship was found between the levels of education and NO2 exposure in the urban area and the overall study area, but no association was found in the rural area. A positive association between socioeconomic index based upon occupation and NO2 concentration was found in urban areas; however, this association was reversed in the rural and overall study areas. Conclusions: The strength and direction of the association between socioeconomic status and NO2 concentration depended on the socioeconomic indicator used and the characteristics of the study area (urban, rural). More research is needed with different scenarios to clarify the uncertain relationship among socioeconomic indexes, particularly in non-urban areas, where little has been documented on this topic.

AB  - An outcome-based analysis using surface population models and logistic regression analysis shows that significant inequalities exist between the middle and working classes, and also between the middle classes and the inactive ( the unemployed and unclassifiable classes, not the retired), in risk factors associated with flood emergencies in all Environment Agency Regions of England and Wales except the Midlands region. This analysis demonstrates overall inequality is reproduced in both the fluvial and tidal flood plains, although that within the tidal flood plains is especially significant and more pronounced in some areas, especially, in the Eastern regions of England. The paper then discusses whether this inequality is unjust or discriminatory, and considers that further, more process-driven, analysis would be necessary to explore this issue, especially looking at neighbourhood generation processes with respect to migration into and out of areas.

Private well water in the United States is mostly unregulated by federal and state drinking water standards. It is the responsibility of the over 13 million U.S. households regularly depending on private wells for their water to ensure it is safe for drinking. There is a consistent graded association with health outcomes at all levels of socioeconomic status (SES) in the U.S. Differential exposure to environmental risk may be contributing to this persistent SES-health gradient. Environmental justice advocates cite overwhelming evidence that income and other SES measures are consistently inversely correlated with exposure to suboptimal environmental conditions including pollutants, toxins, and their impacts. Here we use private well household surveys from two states to investigate the association between SES and risks for arsenic exposure, examining the potentially cumulative effects of residential location, testing and treatment behavior, and psychological factors influencing behavior. We find that the distribution of natural arsenic hazard in the environment is socioeconomically random. There is no evidence that higher SES households are avoiding areas with arsenic or that lower SES groups are disproportionately residing in areas with arsenic. Instead, disparities in exposure arise from differing rates of protective action, primarily testing well water for arsenic, and secondly treating or avoiding contaminated water. We observe these SES disparities in behavior as well as in the psychological factors that are most favorable to these behaviors. Assessment of risk should not be limited to the spatial occurrence of arsenic alone. it is important that social vulnerability factors are incorporated into risk modeling and identifying priority areas for intervention, which should include strategies that specifically target socioeconomically vulnerable groups as well as all the conditions which cause these disparities in testing and treatment behavior.

AB  - An advantage of cap-and-trade programs over more prescriptive environmental regulation is that compliance flexibility and cost effectiveness can make more stringent emissions reductions politically feasible. However, when markets (versus regulators) determine where emissions occur, it becomes more difficult to assure that mandated emissions reductions are equitably achieved. We investigate these issues in the context of Southern California's RECLAIM program by matching facilities in RECLAIM with similar California facilities also in nonattainment areas. Our results indicate that average emissions fell 20 percent at RECLAIM facilities relative to our counterfactual. Furthermore, observed changes in emissions do not vary significantly with neighborhood demographic characteristics. (JEL H23, L51, Q53, Q58)

AB  - Background: The health-risk assessment paradigm is shifting from single stressor evaluation towards cumulative assessments of multiple stressors. Recent efforts to develop broad-scale public health hazard datasets provide an opportunity to develop and evaluate multiple exposure hazards in combination. Methods: We performed a multivariate study of the spatial relationship between 12 indicators of environmental hazard, 5 indicators of socioeconomic hardship, and 3 health outcomes. Indicators were obtained from CalEnviroScreen (version 3.0), a publicly available environmental justice screening tool developed by the State of California Environmental Protection Agency. The indicators were compared to the total rate of hospitalization for 14 ICD-9 disease categories (a measure of disease burden) at the zip code tabulation area population level. We performed principal component analysis to visualize and reduce the CalEnviroScreen data and spatial autoregression to evaluate associations with disease burden. Results: CalEnviroScreen was strongly associated with the first principal component (PC) from a principal component analysis (PCA) of all 20 variables (Spearman rho = 0.95). In a PCA of the 12 environmental variables, two PC axes explained 43% of variance, with the first axis indicating industrial activity and air pollution, and the second associated with ground-level ozone, drinking water contamination and PM2.5. Mass of pesticides used in agriculture was poorly or negatively correlated with all other environmental indicators, and with the CalEnviroScreen calculation method, suggesting a limited ability of the method to capture agricultural exposures. In a PCA of the 5 socioeconomic variables, the first PC explained 66% of variance, representing overall socioeconomic hardship. In simultaneous autoregressive models, the first environmental and socioeconomic PCs were both significantly associated with the disease burden measure, but more model variation was explained by the socioeconomic PCs. Conclusions: This study supports the use of CalEnviroScreen for its intended purpose of screening California regions for areas with high environmental exposure and population vulnerability. Study results further suggest a hypothesis that, compared to environmental pollutant exposure, socioeconomic status has greater impact on overall burden of disease.

AB  - An under-researched story is how large shareholders (e.g. Pension Funds) and investors (e.g. Export Credit Agencies) whose investments in fossil fuels may amount to trillions of dollars are implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and in particular leaving fossil fuels underground (LFFU). Hence, this paper addresses the question: What arguments are used by shareholders and investors in making their financial flows consistent with LFFU, and what do these arguments imply for: access to fulfilling needs; allocation of related resources, responsibilities and risks; and, the right to (sustainable) development? This paper identifies the different arguments used and clusters them into five investor/shareholder scenarios. It assesses these scenarios using the inclusive (access and allocation) development framework. We find that there is prima facie evidence that fossil fuels and associated infrastructure are doomed to become obsolete and hence stranded, which poses a series of risks for (potential) investors and various stakeholders. Three of the five identified scenarios indicate that Pension Funds and Export Credit Agencies may transfer their risks associated with fossil fuel resources, assets and/or related knowledge to developing countries justified by the latter's Right to Development. Such transfers have negative access and allocation impacts-creating, inter alia, a fossil fuel infrastructure and path dependency in the South and amounting to a de facto transfer of a carbon budget along with carbon dependency and related debt to the Global South.

AB  - Are urban waterways amenities, and if so, are there inequities in household access? While urban waterways represent a potential site for access to nature within the urban environment, there have been few studies on the accessibility and interactions with water features in particular, what we refer to as "blue spaces." This study drew on a sample of households in Northern Utah living in neighborhoods with a nearby river or canal to ask if local waterways provide positive impacts to households and if proximity to them increased the likelihood of households spending time at them and being familiar with them. We used multivariate regression to demonstrate that socio-structural and accessibility characteristics shape patterns of familiarity and use, and mediate the impacts of blue space characteristics on households. We found evidence supporting the idea that urban waterways are positive amenities for neighborhood quality of life. We also found that the farther away a household lived from the blue space, the less likely they were to be aware of or use the amenity. Surprisingly, we also found that while high socio-economic status (SES) and white respondents generally lived further from points of access to urban waterways, they reported higher familiarity and were more likely to spend time at them than lower SES and nonwhite Hispanic households. Results suggest that future research and community engagement related to urban blue spaces should be attentive to how social structure and the characteristics of the built environment mediate access to these amenities.

AB  - Background. Occupations undertaken in natural environments can positively impact physical and mental health, improve cognitive functioning, contribute spiritual and cultural benefits, and increase belonging, self-worth, and the meaningfulness of occupations. However, occupational opportunities in healthy natural spaces are inequitably distributed; and the deleterious effects of climate change and environmental degradation are borne disproportionately by socioeconomically disadvantaged people. Purposes. To highlight evidence that occupational engagement in nature is a determinant of health, foreground environmental injustices and identify some implications for occupational therapy. Key issues. Cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural research and critical environmental justice scholarship indicate that healthy nature is an inequitably distributed determinant of occupation, well-being, and human health. This merits critical attention from occupational therapy. Implications. By researching, identifying, and addressing occupational and health inequities arising from environmental degradation, climate change and inequitable access to health-promoting natural environments occupational therapists could contribute valuable, occupational perspectives to initiatives addressing human rights and environmental justice.

AB  - Background/Context: In recent years, scholars the world over in both the social sciences and humanities have reanimated the ancient idea of cosmopolitanism. They discern in the idea ways in which people today can respond creatively to rapid social, political, cultural, and economic transformations. Scholars in this burgeoning field have examined issues involving cultural hybridity, global citizenship, environmental justice, economic redistribution, and more. In the article, I examine from a philosophical perspective how a cosmopolitan-minded education can assist people in cultivating thoughtful receptivity to the new and reflective loyalty to the known. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Philosophical work has begun on possible relations between cosmopolitanism and education. However, there are virtually no published studies that deploy a systematic cosmopolitan frame of analysis in conjunction with qualitative or quantitative research. This article seeks to encourage such research by elucidating a distinctive conception of cosmopolitanism rooted in one of its long-standing strands. This strand is characterized as cosmopolitanism on the ground, and it features what has been called "philosophy as the art of living" and "actually existing cosmopolitanism." Research Design: The article is a philosophical investigation that builds an argument using the techniques of conceptual analysis, comparison, contrast, analogy, metaphor, illustration, and exegesis of texts. Conclusions/Recommendations: The long-standing strand of cosmopolitanism on the ground generates several key elements of a philosophy of cosmopolitan-minded education. These elements are (1) a recognition of the importance of local socialization as making possible education itself, (2) the recognition that a cosmopolitan outlook triggers a critical rather than idolatrous or negligent attitude toward tradition and custom, (3) the recognition that curriculum across all subjects can be understood as a cosmopolitan inheritance, and (4) the recognition that many teachers constitute an already existing cosmopolitan community and can build on their shared purposes to enhance educational practice the world over.

AB  - Background: The provision of green spaces is an important health promotion strategy to encourage physical activity and to improve population health. Green space provision has to be based on the principle of equity. This study investigated the presence of socioeconomic inequalities in geographic accessibility and quality of green spaces across Porto neighbourhoods ( Portugal). Methods: Accessibility was evaluated using a Geographic Information System and all the green spaces were audited using the Public Open Space Tool. Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficients and ordinal regression were used to test whether socioeconomic differences in green space quality and accessibility were statistically significant. Results: Although the majority of the neighbourhoods had an accessible green space, mean distance to green space increased with neighbourhood deprivation. Additionally, green spaces in the more deprived neighbourhoods presented significantly more safety concerns, signs of damage, lack of equipment to engage in active leisure activities, and had significantly less amenities such as seating, toilets, cafes, etc. Conclusions: Residents from low socioeconomic positions seem to suffer from a double jeopardy; they lack both individual and community resources. Our results have important planning implications and might contribute to understanding why deprived communities have lower physical activity levels and poorer health.

AB  - Are environmental services luxuries or necessities? Are low-income groups relatively more willing to pay for environmental improvements than high-income groups? The discussion on the shape of the environmental Kuznets curve and environmental justice call for analyses that approach these questions. Following a survey-based approach for modelling the demand for public goods, this paper provides estimates of income and price elasticities of demand for reduced marine eutrophication effects in the case of the Baltic Sea, using data from five Swedish contingent valuation studies. Point estimates indicate that reduced marine eutrophication effects can be classified as a necessity and an ordinary and price elastic service. Confidence intervals show however that the classification as a necessity is not statistically significant. Income elasticities of willingness to pay, not to be confused with income elasticities of demand, are estimated for a broad range of environmental services in Sweden. A basic finding is that income tends to influence willingness to pay positively and significantly. The elasticity estimates are in most cases greater than zero, but less than unity, indicating that the benefits of environmental improvements tend to be regressively distributed. In a cost-benefit analysis of a project suggesting environmental improvements, distributional concerns therefore call for an introduction of weights or at least a sensitivity analysis of how weighting would change decisions about the project's social profitability.

AB  - 'Urban re-generations' is written as an afterword to the special issue of Australian Geographer on 'The Politics of Urban Greening in Australian Cities'. The collection prompts a deep questioning of reparative and regenerative work associated with greening, green spaces and green infrastructures. The climate-driven 2019-2020 bushfire crisis and COVID-19 have amplified the visibility of the more-than-human connectivity of our cities and the deep underlying structures of social and environmental inequity underpinning a variety of urban green spaces and agendas. Inspired by the articles in this special issue, the afterword explores how we might call back the grammars and practices of regeneration from their service to the neo-liberal, settler-colonial city and instead nurture reparative de-colonial practices that aid in the collaborative work of re-composing, becoming into better relation with, and working in modes of situated historical and cultural difference, with green and just cities.

AB  - Around the turn of the century, myriad books and articles - from academics, journalists, organizational leaders and grassroots activists - explored the state of American environmentalism, outlining ideological antagonisms and tracing the contours of possible twenty-first century trajectories. In recent years, however, there have been few such analyses, and those that do exist continue to rely on the ideal types of the past. This article explores the shifting ideological contours of American environmentalism by (1) detailing how extant works categorize American environmental ideologies, and (2) employing discourse and content analysis of sixteen American environmental organizations to consider whether existing ideal-types capture the ideological variability driving contemporary environmental practice. It concludes by outlining six twenty-first century American environmental ideal-types: wilderness preservationism; liberal environmentalism; traditional environmental justice; techno-ecological optimism; socio-ecological progressivism; and socio-ecological radicalism. The article argues that the latter three ideological variants signal an ontological shift that cuts to the core of environmental practice.

AB  - Background: This study explores sociodemographic disparities in residential proximity to unconventional gas development (UGD) among pregnant women. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis using data from a retrospective birth cohort of 164,658 women with a live birth or fetal death from November 2010 to 2012 in the 24-county area comprising the Barnett Shale play, in North Texas. We considered both individual- and census tract-level indicators of sociodemographic status and computed Indexes of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to quantify relative neighborhood-level privilege/disadvantage. We used negative binomial regression to investigate the relation between these variables and the count of active UGD wells within 0.8 km of the home during gestation. We calculated count ratios (CR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe associations. Results: There were fewer wells located near homes of women of color living in low-income areas compared to non-Hispanic white women living in more privileged neighborhoods (ICE race/ethnicity + income: CR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.48-0.55). Conclusions: While these results highlight a potential disparity in residential proximity to UGD in the Barnett Shale, they do not provide evidence of an environmental justice (EJ) issue nor negate findings of environmental injustice in other regions.

AB  - Amid public health concerns over climate change, "precision public health" (PPH) is emerging in next generation approaches to practice. These novel methods promise to augment public health operations by using ever larger and more robust health datasets combined with new tools for collecting and analyzing data. Precision strategies to protecting the public health could more effectively or efficiently address the systemic threats of climate change, but may also propagate or exacerbate health disparities for the populations most vulnerable in a changing climate. How PPH interventions collect and aggregate data, decide what to measure, and analyze data pose potential issues around privacy, neglecting social determinants of health, and introducing algorithmic bias into climate responses. Adopting a health justice framework, guided by broader social and climate justice tenets, can reveal principles and policy actions which may guide more responsible implementation of PPH in climate responses.

AB  - (1) Background: Field monitoring data for addressing the disproportional burden of exposure to soil contamination in communities of minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) are sparse. This study aims to examine the association between soil heavy metal levels, SES, and racial composition. (2) Methods: A total of 423 soil samples were collected in the urban areas of eight cities across six Southern states in the U.S., in 2015. Samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for eight heavy metals. The association was examined with mixed models with the log-transformed metal concentrations as the dependent variables and rankings of low-income or minority percentages as the explanatory variables. (3) Results: Model results showed that soil metal concentrations were significantly associated with rankings of poverty and minority percentages. The cadmium concentration significantly increased by 4.7% (p-value < 0.01), for every 10 percentiles of increase in poverty rank. For every 10 percentiles of increase in minority rank, the soil concentrations were significantly up (p-values < 0.01) for arsenic (13.5%), cadmium (5.5%), and lead (10.6%). Minority rank had significant direct effects on both arsenic and lead. (4) Conclusions: The findings confirmed elevated heavy metal contamination in urban soil in low-income and/or predominantly minority communities.

AB  - BackgroundInclusion of environmental health (EH) in medical education serves as a catalyst for preparing future physicians to address issues as complex as climate change and health, water pollution and lead contamination. However, previous research has found EH education to be largely lacking in U.S. medical education, putting future physicians at risk of not having the expertise to address patients' environmental illnesses, nor speak to prevention.MethodsEnvironmental health (EH) knowledge and skills were incorporated into the first-year medical school curriculum at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine (Nutley, New Jersey), via a two-hour interactive large group learning module with follow up activities. Students completed the Environmental Health in Med School (EHMS) survey before and after the year 1 EH module. This survey evaluates medical students' attitudes, awareness and professionalism regarding environmental health. In year 2, students completed the Environmental Health Survey II, which measured students' perceptions of preparedness to discuss EH with future patients. The research team created both surveys based upon learning objectives that broadly aligned with the Institute of Medicine six competency-based environmental health learning objectives.Results36year 1 students completed both the pre and post EHMS surveys. McNemar's test was used for paired comparisons. Results identified no statistically significant changes from pre to post surveys, identifying a dramatic ceiling.When comparing year 2, EHS II pre-survey (n=84) and post-survey (n=79) responses, a statistically significant positive change in students' self-reported sense of preparedness to discuss environmental health with their patients following the curriculum intervention was noted.ConclusionsOur conclusion for the EHMS in Year 1 was that the current generation of medical students at this school is already extremely aware of and concerned about the impact of environmental issues on health.Through the EHS II in Year 2, we found that the six-week environmental health module combining didactic and experiential elements significantly increased medical students' self-reported sense of preparedness to discuss environmental health issues, including climate change, with their patients.

AB  - Background/Methods: The aim of workpackage 5 'Environmental exposures and children's health: impact of socioeconomic factors' in the EU-funded network PINCHE (Policy Interpretation Network on Children's Health and Environment) was to review and interpret the current knowledge of social inequalities in environmental exposures and children's health. Socioeconomic factors may impact on children's environmental health in two ways: 1) environmental exposures may differ according to socioeconomic status; 2) given a certain level of harmful environmental exposure, socioeconomic factors may modify the health effects by influencing the susceptibility characteristics of children. Results: There is a lack of information to evaluate and quantify the effect of socioeconomic factors on environmental exposures and children's health in Europe. In most circumstances there seems to be an inverse social gradient with increased burden concerning exposures and health outcomes in children of lower social status. Conclusions: There is a need to improve research on social inequalities in children's health and environment. Because of the complexity, integrated approaches and a combination of different intervention measures and policies are necessary to reduce environmental exposure and adverse health effects in children. Paediatricians may contribute to improvement of children's environmental health by risk communication and health advocacy at community and governmental level.

AB  - An analysis of toxic release inventories (TRI) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-regulated facilities in Buffalo, NY, fails to show evidence of environmental racism. Environmental racism is the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on people of color communities (Bryant 1995, 6). The data do indicate some evidence of environmental classism, the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on lower income populations. The absence of environmental racism can be understood as the product of historical residential and labor-market segregation that excluded African Americans from residing in industrialized sections of the city. Institutionalized racism, while acting as a barrier to upward social mobility, has had the effect of insulating large portions of Buffalo's African American population from disproportionate exposure to ecological hazards.

AB  - As an approach to development, many see capitalism as reaching across an enormous range of scholarly domains and political interests. For some time geographers and others have begun to conceptualize capitalism as less of a system of intrinsic economic logic and more a collection of social and discursive relationships. By bringing capitalism into the "discursive world" these commentators and others have provided the theoretical ground for an exploration of alternative economic forms, especially those that are more socially and ecologically just. This paper makes an argument for putting sustainable development through the same theoretical scrutiny. Drawing on examples from the US we recruit the concept of "actually existing sustainabilities" from Altvater's concept "actually existing socialisms" as an entry point to this conversation. Our purpose is to show that the potential for sustainability in the US exists in current local policies and practices if we rethink how we frame it. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - "Residents Against Dirty Energy" (RADE) are a community-led energy activist group in Bristol city, UK. Since their inception, they have effectively lobbied the city council for the deployment of battery storage units in place of diesel generators in Lockleaze, north Bristol. As a result, Lockleaze now hosts battery storage facilities with 15MW of storage capacity able to store excess energy from the grid. Drawing on a focus group (n = 8) with local energy actors in Bristol and in-depth interviews (n = 2) with RADE, alongside document analysis of key secondary data sources, the paper uses three tenets of energy justice (distributional, recognition and procedural justice) to shed light on the role of local energy activism in shaping low-carbon energy infrastructures. The qualitative data reveals RADE's efforts to ensure that local communities are closely involved in energy decision-making, to ensure that the siting of new energy technologies does not burden marginalised communities. However, questions around distributional-economic benefits and ownership are secondary to RADE; their primary concern is with the improvement of local air quality and reducing harm to the local population and environment. These issues connect strongly to Bristol's divided landscape, underpinned by an unequal geography of socio-economic division and racial inequality. As such, the paper sees the further integration of "spatial justice" as a core tenet of energy justice as necessary to enhancing its explanatory power, concluding with a call for scholars and policymakers to further consider the visions and efforts of local and civil society energy activists in shaping just transitions.

AB  - Among the common mandates of agency guidelines implementing Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice ipl Minority Populations and Lon-Income Populations, is the determination of whether the subject action or project will cause disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations. This determination is often troublesome because it requires the analyst to know or define disproportionate impacts. A method is provided for defining disproportionate within the context of an environmental justice evaluation that was conducted for the Wilmington Bypass environmental impact statement. In response to strong local opposition to one of the alignment alternatives of the Wilmington Bypass and to address the perception that this community's residents were not involved in the planning process, the Wilmington Bypass public involvement program was augmented to include a citizens' informational workshop, project development meetings, and community liaison meetings. A brief history is provided of the Wilmington Bypass project, highlighting the public involvement surrounding the environmental justice evaluation. Discussions of the scoping process and delineation of the study area are followed by discussions of the reference population development for the minority and low-income populations. Particular emphasis is given to the use of available census demographic and socioeconomic data and graphical display of these data with the use of a geographic information system. Impact evaluations and mitigative responses for issues determined relevant for the environmental justice analysis conclude the discussion. Conclusions and recommendations for further study are provided.

AB  - BackgroundThroughout the United States, low-wage, minority workers are disproportionately affected by occupational illnesses and injuries. Chronic exposure to hazardous chemicals at work can lead to serious illnesses, contributing to health inequities. In this article, we expand on theories of 'responsibilization' in an occupational health context to reveal how responsibilities for workplace chemical exposures are negotiated by workers and owners in Latinx-owned small businesses.MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with a total of 22 workers and owners in auto repair shops and beauty salons - two high-risk industries - in Southern Metropolitan Tucson. Participants were asked about their insights into workplace chemical exposures and health. A qualitative analysis team with representation from all study partner organizations collectively coded and reviewed the interview data in QSR International's NVivo 11 and identified overarching themes across the interviews.ResultsWe identified three primary themes: 1) ambivalence toward risks in the workplace; 2) shifting responsibilities for exposure protection at work; and 3) reflections on the system behind chemical exposure risks. Participants discussed the complexities that small businesses face in reducing chemical exposures.ConclusionsThrough our analysis of the interviews, we examine how neoliberal occupational and environmental policies funnel responsibility for controlling chemical exposures down to individuals in small businesses with limited resources, obscuring the power structures that maintain environmental health injustices. We conclude with a call for upstream policy changes that more effectively regulate and hold accountable the manufacturers of chemical products used daily by small business workers.

AB  - Background: Sprawl has been named as one of the critical reasons for the latest social problems in many parts of the world. This is particularly true for developing countries, as their national status largely depends on economic stability and interacts with the rise and decline of major cities. This study focuses on a detailed notion on environmental impact of physical expansion and answers how to specifically estimate the ecological impact of sprawl using the GIS and ecological valuation method. Especially, South Korean cities are examined to identify how development-oriented growth would affect natural stock and the ecology as a whole. Results: By implementing land cover datasets and an estimation method, value transfer, the authors examine the economic losses of Korean ecological stock between 1980 and 2000. Since 1980, the society has gained a significant amount of growth in its national economics. Specifically, GDP has increased from about $40 billion to $640 billion. However, due to its rapid growth, the entire natural stock has lost about 5% of its total features, using the median economic values. If calculated with the maximum values, it is about a 7% decrease. The results indicate that $2076/person for environmental opportunity costs is estimated as a consequence of rapid urbanization. Conclusions: If we had estimated the ecological consumptions of rapid growth from the beginning and considered $2076/person for environmental opportunity costs, then the development patterns and other associated urban planning agendas would have shifted accordingly to increase the overall sustainability. Like most developing cities in the world, major cities in South Korea and the central government concentrated its main strategy on economic growth. Doing so stimulated national economy and made it possible to level up the quality of life. If this quality of life needs to be sustained for a long term, then we should focus on our usage of ecological features, as their characteristics are completely different from man-made resources.

AB  - 1. A lack of recent data on the presence of sawfishes throughout West Africa inhibits the development of conservation strategies for these endangered elasmobranchs. 2. Short interviews were conducted with 32 fishermen around Lake Piso, Liberia, over three days to assess whether this region might still support a population of sawfishes. 3. Just over half of all interviewees recognized the image of a sawfish and had seen at least one in their lifetime. 4. No respondent claimed to have frequently caught or observed sawfishes in the past, and few fishermen appeared to know if sawfishes were even edible. 5. Seven fishermen stated that they had seen or caught a sawfish within the last five years. 6. The cultural importance attributed to sawfishes in other parts of West Africa was not apparent among the interviewees. 7. These findings suggest that if sawfishes are still present in Lake Piso, they are rare and local ecological knowledge of these fishes is declining. Copyright # 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Applying Risman's approach to Argentina's soy model, six causal mechanisms at the institutional, individual, and interactional levels can be identified that serve either to maintain or to challenge the status quo: (1) resource distribution, (2) ideology, (3) identity work, (4) cognitive bias, (5) status expectations, and (6) state paternalism.

AB  - An environmental justice (EJ) analysis shows that adoption of low-carbon energy sources in the year 2050 reduces the race/ethnicity disparity in air pollution exposure in California by as much as 20% for PM2.5 mass and by as much as 40% for PM0.1 mass. An ensemble of six different energy scenarios constructed using the energy-economic optimization model CA-TIMES were evaluated in future years. Criteria pollutant emissions were developed for each energy scenario using the CA-REMARQUE model using 4 km spatial resolution over four major geographic areas in California: the greater San Francisco Bay Area including Sacramento (SFBA & SAC), the San Joaquin Valley (SJV), Los Angeles (LA), and San Diego (SD). The Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model was used to predict future meteorology fields by downscaling two different climate scenario (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) generated by two different GCMs (the Community Climate System Model and the Canadian Earth Systems Model). Simulations were performed over 32 weeks randomly selected during the 10 year window from the year 2046 to 2055 to build up a long-term average in the presence of ENSO variability. The trends associated with low-carbon energy adoption were relatively stable across the ensemble of locations and scenarios. Deeper reductions in the carbon intensity of energy sources progressively reduced exposure to PM2.5 mass and PM0.1 mass for all California residents. The greater adoption of low-carbon fuels also reduced the racial disparity in the PM exposure. The three energy scenarios that achieved an ~80% reduction in GHG emissions relative to 1990 levels simultaneously produced the greatest reduction in PM exposure for all California residents and the greatest reduction in the racial disparity of that exposure. These findings suggest that the adoption of low carbon energy can improve public health and reduce racial disparities through an improvement in air quality.

AB  - Amid increasing recognition of the importance of the environmental factor in understanding poverty and development, this article coins the term "environmental poverty" to refer to the lack of the healthy environment needed for society's survival and development as a direct result of human-induced environmental degradation. A decomposed environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) demonstrates that places (such as countries, counties, or cities) following the "grow first, clean up later" approach (or the first half of the EKC) may obtain economic gains accompanied by extreme environmental sacrifice, excessive social injustice, and income and environmental inequalities. The same place may include communities whose curves differ in shape. Some communities may prosper at the expense of other communities, which may fall into environmental poverty and eventually irreversible environmental degradation and economic failure. Places following alternatives or "flat EKCs" may be slow in getting out of economic poverty, but enjoy a healthier environment, equality in income and environmental quality, and social justice. Countries, especially developing countries, should aspire to sustainable alternatives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change will disproportionately affect equatorial regions and closely adjacent areas, referred to here as the Fateful Ellipse. The vulnerability of these regions is exacerbated by a lack of capital for adaptive measures against the impacts of climate change. The increasing transference of capital from governmental control to private hands, and the increasing concentration of such capital into the hands of fewer individuals raises further concerns about capacity to mitigate or adapt to climate change. In addition, conflicts arise regarding the choice of climate change solutions. Ironically, the people of the Fateful Ellipse, who are most vulnerable to climate change, produce the lowest amount of carbon per capita. As a result of the colonial enterprise, including slavery, they also paid a heavy price toward the economic ascendency of Europe and North America and the Industrial Revolution that fueled the rise in greenhouse gas production. The discipline of geography itself owes some measure of its development and ascendency to colonialism and the exploitation of the Fateful Ellipse. As geographers we have the capacity, and a special responsibility, to contribute to the development of climate change solutions and global environmental justice.

AB  - Amid climate change and public health concerns, world economies are seeking to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution from transportation. Population growth in cities worldwide will further increase demand for clean and affordable transportation. We propose a city-specific environmental justice mapping index, inspired by a similar index used in California, that highlights promising areas for clean transportation interventions in Greater Mexico City to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and local pollution. This novel approach leverages highly spatially resolved population, pollution, and transportation data. The proposed index score is designed as an open source, updateable point of orientation for decisionmakers as they consider investment in transportation electrification from the standpoint of overlapping atmospheric pollution and social vulnerability.

AB  - Background: The scientific evidence on the health effects of waste-related exposure is not conclusive. Differential exposure to waste by socio-economic status (SES) is often documented, but the interplay between environmental and social factors, crucial for policy making, is not well known. This review aims at investigating the role of health inequalities and inequities in waste management. Methods: Grey and peer-reviewed literature, published after 1983, was reviewed from Europe and the USA. Results: Available data provide consistent indications that waste facilities are often disproportionally more located in areas with more deprived residents, or from ethnical minorities. This applies to waste incinerators, landfills, hazardous waste sites, legal and illegal. In studies considering health effects (mainly from Europe), risks are estimated with standardization for SES. Such standardization almost always decreases risk estimates for several cancers and reproductive outcomes. However, effect modification is not investigated in these studies. Conclusions: The patterns of association between waste-related environmental pressures and SES suggest that some of the observed inequalities in exposure and health represent a case of environmental injustice as they are the result of social processes and may be prevented, at least partly. Disentangling the possible health effects remains difficult, due to limitations in the methodology. It seems important to investigate if disadvantaged people are more vulnerable, i.e. risks differ in different social groups living in the same area. Notwithstanding these open questions, public health officers and decision makers should identify waste management policies to minimize their potential health impacts and their unequal distribution.

AB  - (1) Background: exposure to heavy metals is associated with adverse health effects and disproportionately impacts low-income communities and communities of color. We carried out a community-based participatory research study to examine the distribution of heavy metal concentrations in the soil and social vulnerabilities to soil heavy metal exposures across Census tracts in Santa Ana, CA. (2) Methods: soil samples (n = 1528) of eight heavy metals including lead (Pb), arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn) were collected in 2018 across Santa Ana, CA, at a high spatial resolution and analyzed using XRF analysis. Metal concentrations were mapped out and American Community Survey data was utilized to assess metals throughout Census tracts in terms of social and economic variables. Risk assessment was conducted to evaluate carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk. (3) Results: concentrations of soil metals varied according to landuse type and socioeconomic factors. Census tracts where the median household income was under $50 000 had 390%, 92.9%, 56.6%, and 54.3% higher Pb, Zn, Cd, and As concentrations compared to high-income counterparts. All Census tracts in Santa Ana showed hazard index >1, implying the potential for non-carcinogenic health effects, and nearly all Census tracts showed a cancer risk above 10(-4), implying a greater than acceptable risk. Risk was predominantly driven by childhood exposure. (4) Conclusions: findings inform initiatives related to environmental justice and highlight subpopulations at elevated risk of heavy metal exposure, in turn underscoring the need for community-driven recommendations for policies and other actions to remediate soil contamination and protect the health of residents.

AB  - Anthropogenic lead (Pb) is ubiquitous in urban soils given its widespread deposition over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries from a range of point- and non-point sources, including industrial waste and pollution, leaded paint, and automobile exhaust. While soil scientists and urban ecologists have documented soil Pb contamination in cities around the world, such analyses usually focus on proximal mechanisms but rarely consider more distal factors, notably the social processes mediating Pb accumulation in particular places. In this paper, I articulate a critical physical geography of urban soil Pb contamination that considers the dialectical co-production of soil processes and social processes. Using soil Pb contamination in the flatlands of Oakland, California as an empirical case, I integrate conventional quantitative geochemical mapping with theory and qualitative methods regularly employed in urban political ecology to explain the various spatio-temporal processes that bifurcated the city into flatlands and hills, a topography that is as much social as it is physical, and one that is fundamental to differentiated soil Pb concentrations and their disproportionate impact on low-income people of color. I demonstrate how understanding soil contamination through the lens of social metabolism - with particular attention to the materialitY of the socio-natural hybrids emerging from processes of capitalist urbanization - can complement conventional analyses, while contributing to a "material politics of place" to support struggles for environmental justice.

AB  - Architectural education offers students practice with complex problem-solving, most often separate from the public they will eventually serve. Design education that addresses real clients and real world concerns such as renewable energy and resources, social equity and environmental justice, and economic feasibility demands the skills of coordination, communication, vision, and leadership different: from conventional architectural education. This paper outlines an innovative university curriculum that moves in the direction of educating architects as community leaders based on sustainable design and the concept of community in every aspect of the teaching model. Specifically, the leaching model creates an interactive group dynamic in the design studio based on cooperation and sharing, engages students in real world experiences so they can develop as community leaders, and, identifies a knowledge base and design methodology (including computer technology) to fill the information gap created by an emerging field.

AB  - Arguments are advanced for two ways in which we can avoid the reckless endangerment of future people in the governance of solar radiation management (SRM) research, which could happen through lock-in to SRM deployment from research. SRM research is at an early stage, one at which the mechanisms of lock-in could start to operate. However, lock-in fit to endanger future people could be slowed or stopped through targeted governance. Governance of SRM research that does not include provisions to detect, slow, or stop lock-in fails the test of an intergenerationally adequate precautionary principle, and research governed without these provisions cannot itself be justified as a precaution against the impacts of climate change.

AB  - Application of Executive Order 12898 to risk assessment of highway or rail transport of hazardous materials has proven difficult; in general, the location and conditions affecting the propagation of a plume of hazardous material released in a potential accident are unknown. Therefore, analyses have only been possible in a geographically broad or approximate manner. The advent of geographic information systems and development of software enhancements at Sandia National Laboratories have made kilometer-by-kilometer analysis of populations tallied by U.S. Census blocks along entire routes practicable. Tabulations of total or racially/ethnically distinct populations close to a route, its alternatives, or the broader surrounding area, can then be compared and differences evaluated statistically. This article presents methods of comparing populations and their racial/ethnic compositions using simple tabulations, histograms, and chi-square tests for statistical significance of differences found. Two examples of these methods are presented: comparison of two routes and comparison of a route with its surroundings.

AB  - Background: Socioeconomically disadvantaged populations often have higher exposures to particulate air pollution, which can be expected to contribute to differentials in life expectancy. We examined socioeconomic differentials in exposure and air pollution-related mortality relating to larger scale (5 km resolution) variations in background concentrations of selected pollutants across England. Methods: Ozone and particulate matter (sub-divided into PM10, PM2.5, PM2.5-10, primary, nitrate and sulphate PM2.5) were simulated at 5 km horizontal resolution using an atmospheric chemistry transport model (EMEP4UK). Annual mean concentrations of these pollutants were assigned to all 1,202,578 residential postcodes in England, which were classified by urban-rural status and socioeconomic deprivation based on the income and employment domains of the 2010 English Index of Multiple Deprivation for the Lower-level Super Output Area of residence. We used life table methods to estimate PM2.5-attributable life years (LYs) lost in both relative and absolute terms. Results: Concentrations of the most particulate fractions, but not of nitrate PM2.5 or ozone, were modestly higher in areas of greater socioeconomic deprivation. Relationships between pollution level and socioeconomic deprivation were non-linear and varied by urban-rural status. The pattern of PM2.5 concentrations made only a small contribution to the steep socioeconomic gradient in LYs lost due to PM2.5 per 10(3) population, which primarily was driven by the steep socioeconomic gradient in underlying mortality rates. In rural areas, the absolute burden of air pollution-related LYs lost was lowest in the most deprived deciles. Conclusions: Air pollution shows modest socioeconomic patterning at 5 km resolution in England, but absolute attributable mortality burdens are strongly related to area-level deprivation because of underlying mortality rates. Measures that cause a general reduction in background concentrations of air pollution may modestly help narrow socioeconomic differences in health.

AB  - Background: Traffic and industrial emissions are associated with increased pediatric asthma morbidity. However, few studies have examined the influence of city industrial zoning on pediatric asthma outcomes among minoritized communities with limited access to air monitoring. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis of 39,974 school-aged students in Santa Ana, CA, we investigated the effect of proximity to areas zoned for industrial use on pediatric asthma prevalence, physical fitness, school attendance, and standardized test scores. Results: The study population was 80.6% Hispanic, with 88.2% qualifying for free/reduced lunch. Compared to students living more than 1 km away from industrial zones, those living within 0.5 km had greater odds of having asthma (adjusted OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.34, p < 0.001). Among children with asthma, those living between 0.5-1.0 km had greater odds of being overweight or obese (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.00, 2.15, p = 0.047). Industrial zone proximity was not significantly associated with worse fitness and academic outcomes for students with asthma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that industrial zone proximity is associated with increased pediatric asthma in a predominantly Latino community in Southern California.

AB  - An odor of unknown origin described as a tar or asphalt smell has become unbearable for many of Globeville, CO, residents over the past few years. Residents report during odor events burning eyes and throat, headaches, skin irritation, and problems sleeping. This study was undertaken to identify the potential sources of the odor and the concentrations of air pollutants making up the odor by conducting meteorological correlations and sampling for a panel of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur gases, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the neighborhood and near suspected sources. Wind speed and direction data collected every 1 min in the neighborhood indicate that when the odor is noticed, the community is directly downwind of a wood preservation facility and an asphalt roofing facility. Air samples collected during high-intensity odor events have shown concentrations of methylene chloride, hexane, toluene, naphthalene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, each at least two times higher than background concentrations. Naphthalene and the other PAHs are known pollutants emitted from wood treatment processes, and are known to have a coal tar odor. Naphthalene was present in a sample collected directly adjacent to the Koppers facility and was not present in any background samples. Single-compound odor and health thresholds, however, were never surpassed. Given the technical and regulatory challenges of sampling odors and controlling emissions, it is recommended that Globeville residents and neighboring industry pursue a good neighbor policy to solve the odor issue. Specific offending industrial processes could be identified for which there exist cost-effective control technologies that would reduce exposure to odors and air toxics in Globeville.Implications: Meteorological correlations and samples of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur gases, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the Globeville, CO, neighborhood and near suspected sources during odor events indicate potential industrial sources of a transient and noxious odor. Legislative approaches have proven unfruitful and no health or odor thresholds were typically violated. New approaches are warranted to address odor mixture effects in neighborhoods near industrial facilities.

AB  - Around the world, many urban districts and some entire cities are dominated by vacant and abandoned property. Former uses of these properties range from heavy industry to residential neighborhoods, and each bears many potential legacies of past uses, including: introduction of contaminants that may threaten the health of humans and other species, engineering of land and infrastructure that may undermine hydrological ecosystem services, and introduction of species including invasives. While the ecological functions that characterize vacant urban lands have been only partially investigated, the legacies associated with their past uses are known to affect ecosystem services. In addition, changed industries, weakened economies, arcane financial systems, population migration, and aging resident populations have left many people living in the midst of this vacancy, with clear implications for human health and safety. Since market demand is weak in highly vacant districts, social capital may be particularly important to protecting quality of life and ecosystem services. New design and planning approaches should be informed by urban ecological knowledge that is synthesized with social and cultural understanding of residents' perceptions and values. Interest in urban agriculture, green infrastructure, and open space planning for vacant urban lands is burgeoning. However, without adequate knowledge of highly vacant districts as socio-ecological systems, design and planning may have unintended consequences for human health, water quality, adaptation to climate change, and a panoply of other ecosystem services. Research questions and design and planning applications require a transdisciplinary approach to address highly vacant urban districts with legitimacy and relevance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Analyses of ecological regime shifts primarily focus on abrupt, long-term and significant changes that trigger fundamental reorganisation in ecosystem structure and function. There remains limited empirical work on the relationship between regime shifts and social inequities, power imbalances, and social and environmental injustices. Inadequate attention to this social context restricts our ability to predict and avert impending regime shifts, or to effectively navigate where thresholds have been crossed. In this paper, we offer an initial empirical assessment of politics and power in two coastal lagoons in India and Vietnam experiencing abrupt change. We adopt a realist view of power to: (1) assess the social relations structuring human-environment interactions in both lagoons; (2) characterise the dominant framings and narratives that influence if and how regime shifts are understood; (3) consider who wins and loses if and when regime shifts and other forms of rapid environmental change take place; and (4) reflect on the implications of power and politics for the governance of regime shifts in linked human-ocean settings.

AB  - An ecological and humane urbanism is required to combat resource degradation and socio-economic polarisation. UN-Habitat's New Urban Agenda calls for a paradigm shift to 'leave no one, no place and no ecology behind' through sustainable development. However, this article argues that a 'sustainability fix', while necessary, is insufficient to counter the hegemonic growth-orientated culture and it is important to re-embed economic activities in ethical socio-ecological relationships for people and place well-being. These require critical scholarship to reproblematise issues and present prescriptive approaches for resolving them. Reproblematisation of Hong Kong's alleged land scarcity problem reveals a property-dominant urban-biased political economy that sustains a high land price policy through suppressing development of massive rural land resources, resulting in ecological and socio-spatial disparities. Reimagining the development of rural Hong Kong based on the principles of nature conservation and place-making for conviviality and human flourishing could be a potential pathway towards a transformative urbanism.

AB  - Background: Stark racial disparities in disease incidence among American women remain a persistent public health challenge. These disparities likely result from complex interactions between genetic, social, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors. The influence of environmental risk factors, such as chemical exposure, however, may be substantial and is poorly understood. Objectives: We quantitatively evaluated chemical-exposure disparities by race/ethnicity, life stage, and time in United States (US) women (n = 38,080) by using biomarker data for 143 chemicals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2014. Methods: We applied a series of survey-weighted, generalized linear models using data from the entire NHANES women population along with cycle and age-group stratified subpopulations. The outcome was chemical biomarker concentration, and the main predictor was race/ethnicity with adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, smoking habits, and NHANES cycle. Results: Compared to non-Hispanic White women, the highest disparities were observed for non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, Other Hispanic, and Other Race/Multi-Racial women with higher levels of pesticides and their metabolites, including 2,5-dichlorophenol, o,p'-DDE, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, and 2,4-dichlorophenol, along with personal care and consumer product compounds, including parabens and monoethyl phthalate, as well as several metals, such as mercury and arsenic. Moreover, for Mexican American, Other Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black women, there were several exposure disparities that persisted across age groups, such as higher 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol concentrations. Exposure levels for methyl and propyl parabens, however, were the highest in non-Hispanic black compared to non-Hispanic white children with average differences exceeding 4-fold. Exposure disparities for methyl and propyl parabens are increasing over time in Other Race/Multi-Racial women while fluctuating for non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, and Other Hispanic. Cotinine levels are among the highest in Non-Hispanic White women compared to Mexican American and Other Hispanic women with disparities plateauing and increasing, respectively. Discussion: We systematically evaluated differences in chemical exposures across women of various race/ethnic groups and across age groups and time. Our findings could help inform chemical prioritization in designing epidemiological and toxicological studies. In addition, they could help guide public health interventions to reduce environmental and health disparities across populations.

AB  - Background: We have previously examined the associations between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure, birth weight and gestational age in individuals exposed to PFOA-contaminated residential drinking water from the Little Hocking Water Association (LHWA). In this investigation, we expand the scope of our analysis to examine the associations between PFOA, congenital anomalies, labor and delivery complications and maternal risk factors. Objectives: To compare the likelihood of congenital anomalies, labor and delivery complications and maternal risk factors in neonates and their mothers residing in zip codes with public water service provided completely, partially or not at all by the LHWA. Methods: Logistic regression analyses were performed on singleton neonatal birth outcome data supplied by the Ohio Department of Health to examine the associations between LHWA water service category and the outcomes of interest. When possible, models were adjusted for maternal age, preterm birth, neonatal sex, race, maternal education, alcohol use, tobacco use and diabetic status. Results: Increased PFOA exposure, as assessed by water service category, was not associated with an overall increase in the likelihood of congenital anomalies or any specific diagnosis (adjusted OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.34-3.3). The overall likelihood of labor and delivery complications was significantly lower among mothers with water service provided by the LHWA, as compared to mothers not serviced by the LHWA (adjusted OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.92). A significant increase in the likelihood of anemia (crude OR: 11, 95% CI: 1.8-64) and dysfunctional labor (crude OR: 5.3, 95% CI: 1.2-24) was noted for mothers residing within zip codes serviced by the LHWA, but the number of reported cases was very small. Conclusion: At the levels measured in the LHWA, we conclude that PFOA is not associated with increased risk of congenital anomalies, most labor and delivery complications and maternal risk factors. Additional research is required to assess the observed associations between PFOA, anemia and dysfunctional labor. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - "Biological invasions" are now recognized as the cause of significant ecological and economic damage. They also raise a series of less visible social issues. Management of invasive species is often a political process raising questions such as who decides which organisms are to be managed, and who benefits or is affected by different management techniques. In a rural region of northern California, the proposed use of herbicides on spotted knapweed sparked an intense social controversy. This research uses participant observation, interviews, and archival material to understand how members of the Karuk Tribe of California, the non-Indian community, and the U.S. Forest Service developed different perceptions of safety and risk regarding herbicide use. I describe interconnected factors that frame the interpretation of risk: institutional trust, proximity to exposure, gender, and race. Gender and race, in turn, form the basis of anti-herbicide mobilization. The larger sociological question highlighted is, who pays the price for species invasions? Use of herbicides on invasive species is increasing. Many people who face increased exposure to herbicides are members of racial minority groups. When the poor or racial minorities face disproportionate exposure, differences in risk perception become matters of environmental justice. This paper discusses the broader social implications of differences in risk perception among communities and land managers.

AB  - Background/objective Lack of access to resources such as medical facilities and grocery stores is related to poor health outcomes and inequities, particularly in an environmental justice framework. There can be substantial differences in quantifying "access" to such resources, depending on the geospatial method used to generate distance estimates. Methods We compared three methods for calculating distance to the nearest grocery store to illustrate differential access at the census block-group level in the Atlanta metropolitan area, including: Euclidean distance estimation, service areas incorporating roadways and other factors, and cost distance for every point on the map. Results We found notable differences in access across the three estimation techniques, implying a high potential for exposure misclassification by estimation method. There was a lack of nuanced exposure in the highest- and lowest-access areas using the Euclidean distance method. We found an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.69 (0.65, 0.73), indicating moderate agreement between estimation methods. Significance As compared with Euclidean distance, service areas and cost distance may represent a more meaningful characterization of "access" to resources. Each method has tradeoffs in computational resources required versus potential improvement in exposure classification. Careful consideration of the method used for determining "access" will reduce subsequent misclassifications.

AB  - Background: Social inequities affecting minority populations after Hurricane Katrina led to an expansion of environmental justice literature. In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey rainfall was estimated as a 3000- to 20,000-year flood event, further affecting minority populations with disproportionate stroke prevalence. The Stomp Out Stroke initiative leveraged multimedia engagement, creating a patient-centered cerebrovascular health intervention. Objective: This study aims to address social inequities in cerebrovascular health through the identification of race- or ethnicity-specific health needs and the provision of in-person stroke prevention screening during two community events (May 2018 and May 2019). Methods: Stomp Out Stroke recruitment took place through internet-based channels (websites and social networking). Exclusively through web registration, Stomp Out Stroke participants (aged >18 years) detailed sociodemographic characteristics, family history of stroke, and stroke survivorship. Participant health interests were compared by race or ethnicity using Kmskal-Wallis or chi-square test at an alpha=.05. A Bonferroni-corrected P value of .0083 was used for multiple comparisons. Results: Stomp Out Stroke registrants (N=1401) were 70% (973/1390) female (median age 45 years) and largely self-identified as members of minority groups: 32.05% (449/1401) Hispanic, 25.62% (359/1401) African American, 13.63% (191/1401) Asian compared with 23.63% (331/1401) non-Hispanic White. Stroke survivors comprised 11.55% (155/1401) of our population. A total of 124 stroke caregivers participated. Approximately 36.81% (493/1339) of participants had a family history of stroke. African American participants were most likely to have Medicare or Medicaid insurance (84/341, 24.6%), whereas Hispanic participants were most likely to be uninsured (127/435, 29.2%). Hispanic participants were more likely than non-Hispanic White participants to obtain health screenings (282/449, 62.8% vs 175/331, 52.9%; P=.03). Asian (105/191, 54.9%) and African American (201/359, 55.9%) participants were more likely to request stroke education than non-Hispanic White (138/331, 41.6%) or Hispanic participants (193/449, 42.9%). African American participants were more likely to seek overall health education than non-Hispanic White participants (166/359, 46.2% vs 108/331, 32.6%; P=.002). Non-Hispanic White participants (48/331, 14.5%) were less likely to speak to health care providers than African American (91/359, 25.3%) or Asian participants (54/191, 28.3%). During the 2018 and 2019 events, 2774 health screenings were completed across 12 hours, averaging four health screenings per minute. These included blood pressure (1031/2774, 37.16%), stroke risk assessment (496/2774, 17.88%), bone density (426/2774, 15.35%), carotid ultrasound (380/2774, 13.69%), BMI (182/2774, 6.56%), serum lipids (157/2774, 5.65%), and hemoglobin A(1c) (102/2774, 3.67%). Twenty multimedia placements using the Stomp Out Stroke webpage, social media, #stompoutstroke, television, iQ radio, and web-based news reached approximately 849,731 people in the Houston area. Conclusions: Using a combination of internet-based recruitment, registration, and in-person assessments, Stomp Out Stroke identified race- or ethnicity-specific health care needs and provided appropriate screenings to minority populations at increased risk of urban flooding and stroke. This protocol can be replicated in Southern US Stroke Belt cities with similar flood risks.

But, properly conceived, they simply provide answers to different questions, concerning moral standing and intrinsic value, respectively. The two views together constitute an environmental ethic that combines environmental justice and environmental care. I show that this approach is not only consistent but defensible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) addresses uncontrolled and abandoned hazardous waste sites throughout the country. Sites that are perceived to be a significant threat to both surrounding populations and the environment can be placed on the U.S. EPA Superfund list and qualify for federal cleanup funds. The equitability of the Superfund program has been questioned; the representation of minority and low-income populations in this cleanup program is lower than would be expected. Thus, minorities and low-income populations may not be benefiting proportionately from this environmental cleanup program. In 1994 President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 requiring that the U.S. EPA and other federal agencies implement environmental justice policies. These policies were to specifically address the disproportionate environmental effects of federal programs and policies on minority and low-income populations. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: I use event history analysis to evaluate the impact of Executive Order 12898 on the equitability of the Superfund program. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that despite environmental justice legislation, Superfund site listings in minority and poor areas are even less likely for sites discovered since the 1994 Executive Order. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that Executive Order 12898 for environmental justice has not increased the equitability of the Superfund program.

AB  - Archetypes are increasingly used as a methodological approach to understand recurrent patterns in variables and processes that shape the sustainability of social-ecological systems. The rapid growth and diversification of archetype analyses has generated variations, inconsistencies, and confusion about the meanings, potential, and limitations of archetypes. Based on a systematic review, a survey, and a workshop series, we provide a consolidated perspective on the core features and diverse meanings of archetype analysis in sustainability research, the motivations behind it, and its policy relevance. We identify three core features of archetype analysis: recurrent patterns, multiple models, and intermediate abstraction. Two gradients help to apprehend the variety of meanings of archetype analysis that sustainability researchers have developed: (1) understanding archetypes as building blocks or as case typologies and (2) using archetypes for pattern recognition, diagnosis, or scenario development. We demonstrate how archetype analysis has been used to synthesize results from case studies, bridge the gap between global narratives and local realities, foster methodological interplay, and transfer knowledge about sustainability strategies across cases. We also critically examine the potential and limitations of archetype analysis in supporting evidence-based policy making through context-sensitive generalizations with case-level empirical validity. Finally, we identify future priorities, with a view to leveraging the full potential of archetype analysis for supporting sustainable development.

AB  - Background: The health-care community has a responsibility to address the environmental impact of delivering health-care services. Educational programmes present ideal fora to confer 'environmental competencies' to future health system leaders, managers, practitioners and researchers. The aim of this review is to synthesise the literature on health-care competencies, education and training of relevance to issues of environmental sustainability and climate change in the health sector. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English language articles on environmental competencies in healthcare in the MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and ProQuest databases published from inception to April 2019. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to synthesise the findings and develop a typology of environmental competencies. Results: Of the 902 unique citations, we identified 23 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Environmental competencies that align with general management skills were most frequent (40%), followed by research skills (37%). Three competencies specific to the environment (22%) were identified: resource stewardship (n = 16), systems thinking (n = 14) and social and environmental justice (n = 7). The majority of work was identified in nursing, medicine and public health. Competencies were most commonly embedded in existing curricula or offered as new courses or workshops. Conclusion: Incorporating environmental competencies into education programmes will serve to raise awareness of, and advance the significance of, the health sector's impact on climate change and environmental sustainability. Our findings that environmental competencies align with previously validated health-care competencies support the perspective that these competencies represent essential knowledge and skills for the health-care workforce.

AB  - An increasing number of people around the world are directly involved in the financing and work of energy production through practices such as decentralized generation, re-scaled resource extraction, and energy localization. Many of these new energy producers are farmers seeking to diversify their income streams - raising questions about land-use, labour, and livelihoods that cut across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Such complex, multiscalar dynamics push at the boundaries of contemporary energy research and require researchers to engage in the ongoing development of critical and holistic analytical approaches. Contributing to those efforts, and reporting on solar initiatives including the state-led Power Farmers program in northern India - a country where 'solar farming' occupies a central position in national energy policy - this article calls for energy research to apply insights from three related fields of action and analysis: food sovereignty, eco-swaraj (or Radical Ecological Democracy), and critical environmental justice. Scrutinizing interrelated issues of power and autonomy, inequality, and ecological regeneration, the three fields offer vital tools for future research on new energy producers and for social struggles that confront emergent energy justice concerns.

AB  - Background: The waterfront in the South Bronx in New York City is used industrially and harbors the Harlem River Yards (HRY). The HRY borders an environmental justice area, which includes a mixed-use area that is separated from a densely populated residential area by interstates. Recently, development of the HRY has expanded including the 2018 opening of a large online store warehouse.Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate trends in traffic congestion nearby the HRY between 2017 and 2019.Methods: We analyzed one-hourly time series of crowd-sensed traffic congestion maps, both at the neighborhood scale and the road stretch level. Traffic radar measurements at two locations did not indicate bias in the crowdsensed data over the study period, i.e., changed mappings between vehicle speed and the reported congestion.Results: In the mixed-use areas, traffic congestion increased significantly during all hours of the day, with greatest increases at night and in the morning. Congestion increased close to the entrances of the HRY and along routes used by pedestrians and bicyclists to access a nearby recreational area. In the residential area, congestion increased significantly from midnight to morning and was unchanged for the remainder of the day. On the interstates, congestion decreased during the daytime but increased at night.Conclusions: Neighborhood-scale traffic congestion increased in mixed-use and residential areas in an environmental justice community. Our methods can be applied globally as long as crowd-sensed traffic data can be acquired. The data enable communities to advocate for mitigating measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two devastating hurricanes ripped across the Gulf Coast of the United States daring 2005. The effects of Hurricane Katrina were especially severe: The human and environmental health impacts on New Orleans, Louisiana, and other Gulf Coast communities will be felt for decades to come. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates that Katrina's destruction disrupted the lives of roughly 650,000 Americans. Over 1,300 people died. The projected economic costs for recovery and reconstruction are likely to exceed $125 billion. OBJECTIVES: The NIEHS (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences) Portal aims to provide decision makers with the data, information, and the tools they need to a) monitor human and environmental health impacts of disasters; b) assess and reduce human exposures to contaminants; and c) develop science-based remediation, rebuilding, and repopulation strategies.. METHODS: The NIEHS Portal combines advances in geographic information systems (GIS), data mining/integration, and visualization technologies through new forms of grid-based (distributed, web-accessible) cyberinfirastructure. RESULTS: The scale and complexity of the problems presented by Hurricane Katrina made it evident that no stakeholder alone could tackle them and that there is a need for greater collaboration. The NIEHS Portal provides a collaboration-enabling, information-laden base necessary to respond to environmental health concerns in the Gulf Coast region while advancing integrative multidisciplinary research. CONCLUSIONS: The NIEHS Portal is poised to serve as a national resource to track environmental hazards following natural and man-made disasters, focus medical and environmental response and recovery resources in areas of greatest need, and function as a test bed for technologies that will help advance environmental health sciences research into the modern scientific and computing era.

AB  - BALANCING POWER AMONG ACADEMIC AND community partners, addressing community-identified needs, and strengthening community capacity are ethical values unique to community-based participatory research (CBPR). Negotiation of these values in one CBPR environmental justice project was evaluated to advance the environmental and occupational health of a Hispanic agricultural community in central Washington State. Data were collected through document review and participant observation. Applied conversation and discourse analysis were used to interpret the data. Within the organization, farmworkers primarily served an advisory role. Facilitation style influenced how participants negotiated environmental justice. Research goals were advanced in the project, but no direct actions were taken to improve farmworker health. Implementing CBPR's ethical values requires a willingness to confront institutional and interpersonal challenges, and offers a vision of research that builds knowledge and strengthens communities.

AB  - 1. The cultural ecosystem services (CES) construct has evolved to accommodate multiple worldviews, knowledge systems and conceptualizations of nature and values, including relational and mental health values. 2. Cultural ecosystem services research and practice has mostly focused on cognitive ways of constructing and expressing intangible values of, and relationships with, nature. But our non-material relationships with nature are not exclusively cognitive: sensory and affective processes are fundamental to how we build, enact and experience these relationships. 3. Building on the core ideas of relational values, embodied experiences and connectedness with nature, we present a simple framework to explore the sensory, affective and cognitive dimensions of human-nature interactions, as well as the settings and activities that frame them. 4.We demonstrate its use in a case study in the Peruvian Andes, where we applied an inductive, exploratory approach to elicit personal imageries and imaginings related to nature, place and recreation. The narratives shared were rich with symbolism and personal sensory experiences, emotions and memories, which the interviewees linked with general assertions about people, place and nature. 5. We discuss the usefulness of such a perspective for CES research, and for human well-being, environmental justice and landscape management.

AB  - An examination is made of data sources and analytical methods available to metropolitan transportation planners for use in technical activities related to environmental justice and Title VI discrimination analyses. The focus is on data and methods employed by the metropolitan planning organization for the San Francisco Bay Area. An initial technical activity is the preparation of a geographic and demographic profile of the region with respect to low-income, minority, elderly, and disabled persons. Difficulties associated with long-range forecasting of these variables at the small area (county) level and very small area (travel analysis zones, neighborhoods) level are discussed. Citizens advisory groups are needed to provide early guidance for this technical activity and to appreciate the uncertainties associated with the data and methods. Transportation analysis procedures to analyze changes in accessibility between alternatives in the long-range regional transportation plan are outlined. These methods map out changes in accessibility to evaluate impacts on transportation disadvantaged versus nondisadvantaged neighborhoods. Future data sources, including Census 2000 and the American Community Survey (ACS), are discussed. The ACS data, in particular, may prove highly beneficial in describing changing socioeconomic patterns within a metropolitan area.

AB  - Background: The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) population is heterogeneous and rapidly growing in the United States, with a high proportion concentrated in California. Although traditionally assumed to have lower rates of breast cancer than non-Hispanic white women, recent studies have suggested considerable variation in incidence by AAPI ethnic group, with rates in some exceeding those in non-Hispanic whites. The potential role of environmental toxicants has not been well explored and may provide insights into these patterns. Methods: We created an exposure potential index (EPI) score for 24 hazardous air pollutants modeled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment considered to be mammary gland carcinogens, and compared values at the census tract level for "geographically concentrated" AAPI groups throughout the State. "Geographically concentrated" populations were defined as census tracts with at least 100 individuals from a specified racial/ethnic population as enumerated by the 2000 Census. Results: Although EPI scores differed little between census tracts with aggregated AAPI (mean EPI = 0.53) and non-Hispanic white women (mean EPI = 0.63), there was substantial variation between tracts for disaggregated AAPI groups, with notably higher EPI scores for tracts enumerated for Korean or Japanese women (mean EPI of 0.78 and 0.77, respectively) compared with other AAPI groups. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of disaggregating data for the heterogeneous AAPI population to identify differences in potential environmental exposures across groups. Impact: Future cancer etiology studies should examine environmental exposure differences within and across groups for the diverse AAPI population. (C)2014 AACR.

AB  - Background: The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) provides air quality and health information such that the public can implement health protective behaviours (reducing and/or rescheduling outdoor activity) and decrease exposure to outdoor air pollution. The AQHI's health messages account for increased risk associated with "at risk" populations (i.e. young children, elderly and those with pre-existing respiratory and/or cardiovascular conditions) who rely on health care and service providers for guidance. Using Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory, our objective with respect to health care and service providers and their respective "at risk" populations was to explore: 1) level of AQHI knowledge; 2) factors influencing AQHI adoption and; 3) strategies that may increase uptake of AQHI, according to city divisions and socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews with health care (Registered Nurses and Certified Respiratory Educators) and service providers (Registered Early Childhood Educators) and focus groups with their respective "at risk" populations explored barriers and facilitators to AQHI adoption. Participants were selected using purposive sampling. Each transcript was analyzed using an Interpretive Description approach to identify themes. Analyses were informed by Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. Results: Fifty participants (6 health care and service providers, 16 parents, 13 elderly, 15 people with existing respiratory conditions) contributed to this study. AQHI knowledge, AQHI characteristics and perceptions of air quality and health influenced AQHI adoption. AQHI knowledge centred on numerical reliance and health protective intent but varied with SES. More emphasis on AQHI relevance with respect to health benefits was required to stress relative advantage over other indices and reduce index confusion. AQHI reporting at a neighbourhood scale was recognized as addressing geographic variability and uncertainty in perceived versus measured air quality impacting health. Participants predominantly expressed that they relied on sensory cues (i.e. feel, sight, taste) to determine when to implement health protective behaviours. Time constraints were identified as barriers; whereas local media reporting and wearable devices were identified as facilitators to AQHI adoption. Conclusion: Increasing knowledge, emphasizing relevance, and reporting AQHI information at a neighbourhood scale via local media sources and wearable devices may facilitate AQHI adoption while accounting for SES differences.

AB  - Balancing agendas for climate mitigation and environmental justice continues to be one of the key challenges in climate change governance mechanisms, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). In this paper we apply the three-dimensional environmental justice framework as a lens to examine the REDD+ process in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) and the REDD+ social safeguards. We focus particularly on challenges to justice faced by marginalized communities living in forest frontier areas under an authoritarian regime. Drawing on policy analysis and open-ended interviews across different policy levels, we explore procedural, distributional, and recognitional justice across the REDD+ policy levels in Laos. We find that REDD+ social safeguards have been applied by both donors and state actors in ways that facilitate external control. We underscore how authoritarian regime control over civil society and ethnic minority groups thwarts justice. We also highlight how this political culture and lack of inclusiveness are used by donors and project managers to implement their projects with little political debate. Further obstacles to justice relate to limitations inherent in the REDD+ instrument, including tight schedules for dealing with highly sensitive socio-political issues under social safeguards. These findings echo other research but go further in questioning the adequacy of safeguards to promote justice under a nationally driven REDD+. We highlight the importance of recognition and political context, including aspects such as power relations, self-determination and self-governance of traditional or customary structures, in shaping justice outcomes.

AB  - As a discipline of crisis and care, environmental communication needs to address questions of environmental justice. This article argues that the most appropriate approach to studying environmental justice communication is engaged scholarship, in which academics collaborate with community partners, advocates, and others to conduct research. The article reviews prior engaged communication scholarship on environmental justice, and proposes four streams of future research, focused on news and information, deliberation and participation, campaigns and movements, and education and literacy.

AB  - BackgroundPoor air quality is the one of the biggest causes of early death and illness across the lifespan. In the UK, 28 local authorities with illegal pollution levels have been mandated by the Government to develop plans to rapidly reduce pollution to legal limits. These plans include consideration of implementing one of four of charging 'Clean Air Zone' (CAZ) classes in areas of high pollution which would charge older polluting vehicles a daily charge to enter. While this offers a potential to improve air quality, the extent to which CAZ might impact (for example, economically) on socio-economically deprived groups and local businesses is unclear.AimsTo explore the acceptability and perceived unintended consequences of a CAZ and other initiatives to improve air quality with seldom-heard communities living in deprived, multi-ethnic areas within the city of Bradford, UK.MethodsTen semi-structured focus groups were conducted with people who live in areas of high pollution and deprivation. A total of 87 people participated from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds with the majority of Pakistani origin. Recorded data were transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis.FindingsAs poor air quality was not always visible it was seen as a hidden issue by many, and not prioritised over other more visible environmental issues (e.g. fly-tipping, littering). There was resistance to proposals which included charging private vehicles. Many felt that low-income families did not have the resources to purchase compliant vehicles or pay daily charges, placing a disproportionate burden on them. It was also felt that low-income taxi drivers would be disproportionately affected financially by proposals. Public transport infrastructure was felt to be inadequate. Other traffic management or emission reduction activities were also explored. Views towards these initiatives were more positive if they did not directly affect individuals financially.ConclusionAir quality initiatives such as CAZs were felt to be likely to financially disadvantage communities already living in socio-economic and environmental poverty. Policy makers need to carefully consider appropriate mitigation strategies to ensure that health and economic inequalities are not increased by implementation of CAZ. Given air quality is low priority for some groups, careful engagement and communication will be required to increase acceptance interventions such as CAZs.

AB  - 3D-grid-based chemical transport models, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system, have been widely used for predicting concentrations of ambient air pollutants. However, typical horizontal resolutions of nationwide CMAQ simulations (12 X 12 km(2)) cannot capture local-scale gradients for accurately assessing human exposures and environmental justice disparities. In this study, a Bayesian ensemble machine learning (BEML) framework, which integrates 13 learning algorithms, was developed for downscaling CMAQ estimates of ozone daily maximum 8 h averages to the census tract level, across the contiguous US, and was demonstrated for 2011. Three-stage hyper-parameter tuning and targeted validations were designed to ensure the ensemble model's ability to interpolate, extrapolate, and capture concentration peaks. The Shapley value metric from coalitional game theory was applied to interpret the drivers of subgrid gradients. The flexibility (transferability) of the 2011-trained BEML model was further tested by evaluating its ability to estimate fine-scale concentrations for other years (2012-2017) without retraining. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the BEML approach to strictly "data-limited" situations, the model was applied to downscale CMAQ outputs for a future-year scenario-based simulation that considers effects of variations in meteorology associated with climate change.

AB  - Background: Studies have demonstrated a relationship between segregation and level of education, occupational opportunities, and risk behaviors, yet a paucity of research has elucidated the association between racial residential segregation, socioeconomic deprivation, and lifetime cancer risk. Objectives: We examined estimated lifetime cancer risk from air toxics by racial composition, segregation, and deprivation in census tracts in Metropolitan Charleston. Methods: Segregation indices were used to measure the distribution of groups of people from different races within neighborhoods. The Townsend Index was used to measure economic deprivation in the study area. Poisson multivariate regressions were applied to assess the association of lifetime cancer risk with segregation indices and Townsend Index along with several sociodemographic measures. Results: Lifetime cancer risk from all pollution sources was 28 persons/million for half of the census tracts in Metropolitan Charleston. Isolation Index and Townsend Index both showed significant correlation with lifetime cancer risk from different sources. This significance still holds after adjusting for other sociodemographic measures in a Poisson regression, and these two indices have stronger effect on lifetime cancer risk compared to the effects of sociodemographic measures. Conclusions: We found that material deprivation, measured by the Townsend Index and segregation measured by the Isolation index, introduced high impact on lifetime cancer risk by air toxics at the census tract level.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for the infrastructures that support many of society's functions. Transportation, security, energy, education, the workplace, the government have all incorporated AI into their infrastructures for enhancement and/or protection. In this paper, we argue that not only is AI seen as a tool for augmenting existing infrastructures, but AI itself is becoming an infrastructure that many services of today and tomorrow will depend upon. Considering the vast environmental consequences associated with the development and use of AI, of which the world is only starting to learn, the necessity of addressing AI alongside the concept of infrastructure points toward the phenomenon of carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in refers to society's constrained ability to reduce carbon emissions technologically, economically, politically, and socially. These constraints are due to the inherent inertia created by entrenched technological, institutional, and behavioral norms. That is, the drive for AI adoption in virtually every sector of society will create dependencies and interdependencies from which it will be hard to escape. The crux of this paper boils down to this: in conceptualizing AI as infrastructure we can recognize the risk of lock-in, not just carbon lock-in but lock-in as it relates to all the physical needs to achieve the infrastructure of AI. This does not exclude the possibility of solutions arising with the rise of these technologies; however, given these points, it is of the utmost importance that we ask inconvenient questions regarding these environmental costs before becoming locked into this new AI infrastructure.

AB  - As a central component of the smart city, sensor infrastructures locate and measure a wide range of variables in order to characterise the urban environment. Perhaps the most visible expression of the smart city, sensor deployment is a key equity concern. As new sensor technologies and Big Data interact with social processes, they have the potential to reproduce well-documented spatial injustices. Contrary to promises of providing new knowledge and data for cities, they can also create new gaps in understanding about specific urban populations that fall into the interstices of data collection - sensor deserts. Building on emerging data justice debates, specifically considering distributional, recognition, and procedural forms of injustice, we conceptualise and analyse sensor deserts through two case studies, Newcastle's Urban Observatory (UK) and Chicago's Array of Things (USA). Open sensor locations are integrated with small-area, socio-economic data to evidence the demographic configuration and spatialities of sensor deserts across each city. We illustrate how the structural processes via which inequality is reinforced by smart agendas manifest as uneven social and spatial outcomes. In doing so, the paper opens up a new conceptual space in which to consider what it means (not) to count in the smart city, bringing a demographic perspective to critical debates about smart urbanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The urban exposome is the set of environmental factors that arc experienced in the outdoor urban environment and that may influence child development. OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to describe the urban exposome among European pregnant women and understand its socioeconomic determinants. METHODS: Using geographic information systems, remote sensing and spatio-temporal modeling we estimated exposure during pregnancy to 28 environmental indicators in almost 30,000 women from six population-based birth cohorts, in nine urban areas from across Europe. Exposures included meteorological factors, air pollutants, traffic noise, traffic indicators, natural space, the built environment, public transport, facilities, and walkability. Socioeconomic position (SEP), assessed at both the area and individual level, was related to the exposome through an exposome-wide association study and principal component (PC) analysis. RESULTS: Mean standard deviation (SD) NO, levels ranged from 13.6 +/- 5.1 mu g/m(3) (in Heraklion, Crete) to 43.2 +/- 11 mu g/m(3) (in Sabaclell, Spain), mean +/- SD walkability score ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.04 (Kaunas, Lithuania) to 0.32 +/- 0.07 (Valencia, Spain) and mean +/- SD Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ranged from 0.21 +/- 0.05 in Heraklion to 0.51 +/- 0.1 in Oslo, Norway. Four PCs explained more than half of variation in the urban exposome. There was considerable heterogeneity in social patterning of the urban exposome across cities. For example, high-SEP (based on family education) women lived in greener, less noisy, and less polluted areas in Bradford, UK (0.39 higher PC1 score, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.47), hut the reverse was observed in Oslo (-0.57 PC1 score, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.41). For most cities, effects were stronger when SEP was assessed at the area level: In Bradford, women living in high SEP areas had a 1.34 higher average PC1 score (95% CI: 1.21, 1.48). CONCLUSIONS: The urban exposome showed considerable variability across Europe. Pregnant women of low SEP were exposed to higher levels of environmental hazards in some cities, but not others, which may contribute to inequities in child health and development.

AB  - Background. Many scholars have examined Indigenous food security and sovereignty yet the topic still represents a small share of environmental justice scholarship. Therefore, we completed a case study of the environmental justice challenges concerning food security faced by the Indigenous communities of Peru's Loreto region. Methods. During 2019, we conducted fieldwork in 64 Indigenous communities of Kukama Kukamiria and Urarina in the Amazon rainforests of Loreto, Peru. Based on a semi-stratified sample and snowball sampling method, we combined participant observation with 139 interviews focused on feeding habits, production and availability, access, utilization, food stability, and perception of food insecurity with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) method. Results. Analyzing these themes led to worrisome assessments of the food insecurity and institutional limits of Indigenous communities. Because of their geographic location, these communities experience a degraded and unhealthy environment with water and food contaminated by hydrocarbon extraction activity. Furthermore, Peru's policy of food and nutrition security has public management deficiencies especially in the Loreto region. Thus, many of the efforts adopted remain ineffective. Conclusion. Indigenous communities that live following ancestral culture often lack resources to change their diets. Thus, they frequently suffer the most following the contamination of an environment with which they experience an interdependent relation.

AB  - Background: Variations in air pollution exposure within a community may be associated with asthma prevalence. However, studies conducted to date have produced inconsistent results, possibly due to errors in measurement of the exposures. Methods: A standardized asthma survey was administered to children in grades one and eight in Hamilton, Canada, in 1994-95 (N similar to 1467). Exposure to air pollution was estimated in four ways: (1) distance from roadways; (2) interpolated surfaces for ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrous oxides from seven to nine governmental monitoring stations; (3) a kriged nitrogen dioxide (NO2) surface based on a network of 100 passive NO2 monitors; and (4) a land use regression (LUR) model derived from the same monitoring network. Logistic regressions were used to test associations between asthma and air pollution, controlling for variables including neighbourhood income, dwelling value, state of housing, a deprivation index and smoking. Results: There were no significant associations between any of the exposure estimates and asthma in the whole population, but large effects were detected the subgroup of children without hayfever (predominately in girls). The most robust effects were observed for the association of asthma without hayfever and NO2LUR OR = 1.86 (95% CI, 1.59-2.16) in all girls and OR = 2.98 (95% CI, 0.98-9.06) for older girls, over an interquartile range increase and controlling for confounders. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that traffic-related pollutants, such as NO2, are associated with asthma without overt evidence of other atopic disorders among female children living in a medium-sized Canadian city. The effects were sensitive to the method of exposure estimation. More refined exposure models produced the most robust associations.

AB  - BackgroundLow-income and minority communities often face disproportionately high pollutant exposures. The lead crisis in Flint, Michigan, has sparked concern about broader socioeconomic disparities in exposures to drinking water contaminants. Nitrate is commonly found in drinking water, especially in agricultural regions, and epidemiological evidence suggests elevated risk of cancer and birth defects at levels below U.S. EPA's drinking water standard (10mg/L NO3-N). However, there have been no nationwide assessments of socioeconomic disparities in exposures to nitrate or other contaminants in U.S. drinking water. The goals of this study are to identify determinants of nitrate concentrations in U.S. community water systems (CWSs) and to evaluate disparities related to wealth or race/ethnicity.MethodsWe compiled nitrate data from 39,466U.S. CWSs for 2010-2014. We used EPA's Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS)to compile CWS characteristics and linked this information with both city- and county-level demographic data gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau. After applying multiple imputation methods to address censored nitrate concentration data, we conducted mixed-effects multivariable regression analyses at national and regional scales.Results5.6 million Americans are served by a CWS that had an average nitrate concentration5mg/L NO3-N between 2010 and 2014. Extent of agricultural land use and reliance on groundwater sources were significantly associated with nitrate. The percent of Hispanic residents served by each system was significantly associated with nitrate even after accounting for county-level cropland and livestock production, and CWSs in the top quartile of percent Hispanic residents exceeded 5mg/L nearly three times as often as CWSs serving the lowest quartile. By contrast, the percent of residents living in poverty and percent African American residents were both inversely associated with nitrate.ConclusionsEpidemiological evidence for health effects associated with drinking water above 5mg/L NO3-N raises concerns about increased risk for the 5.6 million Americans served by public water supplies with average nitrate concentrations above this level. The associations we observed between nitrate concentrations and proportions of Hispanic residents support the need for improved efforts to assist vulnerable communities in addressing contamination and protecting source waters. Future studies can extend our methods to evaluate disparities in exposures to other contaminants and links to health effects.

AB  - Background: The environmental justice framework states that besides environmental burdens also resources may be social unequally distributed both on the individual and on the neighbourhood level. This ecological study investigated whether neighbourhood socioeconomic position (SEP) was associated with neighbourhood public green space availability in a large German city with more than 1 million inhabitants. Methods: Two different measures were defined for green space availability. Firstly, percentage of green space within neighbourhoods was calculated with the additional consideration of various buffers around the boundaries. Secondly, percentage of green space was calculated based on various radii around the neighbourhood centroid. An index of neighbourhood SEP was calculated with principal component analysis. Log-gamma regression from the group of generalized linear models was applied in order to consider the non-normal distribution of the response variable. All models were adjusted for population density. Results: Low neighbourhood SEP was associated with decreasing neighbourhood green space availability including 200 m up to 1000 m buffers around the neighbourhood boundaries. Low neighbourhood SEP was also associated with decreasing green space availability based on catchment areas measured from neighbourhood centroids with different radii (1000m up to 3000 m). With an increasing radius the strength of the associations decreased. Conclusions: Social unequally distributed green space may amplify environmental health inequalities in an urban context. Thus, the identification of vulnerable neighbourhoods and population groups plays an important role for epidemiological research and healthy city planning. As a methodical aspect, log-gamma regression offers an adequate parametric modelling strategy for positively distributed environmental variables. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - An important goal of regional development in the Brazilian Amazon was to enhance social welfare and alleviate dire poverty in other parts of the country by providing land to the poor. Nevertheless, both poverty and landlessness have persisted despite development policies that distributed billions of dollars on highway construction, loans, and outright subsidies. Inequitable land distribution has been held as a prime factor in land conflict across the country. Although episodes of conflict over land are common in Brazilian history, this paper focuses on agrarian issues that arose with the opening of the Amazon frontier in the 1970s. The paper presents a political economy approach that considers the role of hierarchical forces interacting across spatial scales, in creating conditions ripe for land conflict at the local level. The premise is that the Brazilian government, intending to bring about economic and social development, promoted contradictory strategies creating land scarcity. These strategies led to expansion of large ranching operations, creation of conservation units, and demarcation of indigenous reserves, which constrained the pool of land available for small farmer settlement. Empirical analysis employing regression and spatial statistics is used to test the proposed model, advancing previous efforts by applying spatial regression, incorporating improved indicators of conflict and explanatory variables generated by a Geographic Information System (GIS). The findings provide support for some elements of the argument, demonstrating statistically significant relationships between land conflict and land concentration, cattle ranching, and road construction. Finally, a case study analysis of a county in the heart of the land conflict zone is provided, illustrating the interaction of scalar forces, and the articulation of land conflict at the local level.

AB  - 'Nature-Based Integration' (NBI) has been proposed as a solution to two prominent issues in contemporary Nordic societies: increasing separation from nature among 'modern' societies; and the need to 'integrate' groups of diverse newcomers. This article examines NBI activities in orebro County, central Sweden, exploring how these practices seek to bring immigrants into a shared Swedish experiential landscape that forms part of the work of ordering Sweden as a community. These activities form part of an ordering project, within which 'Swedes' and 'newcomers' are situated, drawing on extant nationalist orderings. Likewise, it represents part of an effort to enact a sustainable Sweden in an international world. Drawing on research on environmental racism and (in)justice, this article homes in on the norms implicit and explicit to this ordering. It then discusses the implications of this, highlighting (arguably unavoidable) coercive elements. Furthermore, the long history of outdoor lifestyle as a pillar of Swedish nationalism and the embracing of such activities by the Swedish far right highlight that nature may also become a site of conflict as much as conciliation. Finally, the article considers the types of environmental action arising from the NBI orderings and the likelihood of meaningful environmental change.

AB  - An almost inexhaustible number of conceptual approaches has arisen in the past few decades to seek to explain the interlinked phenomena of energy transitions, low-carbon transitions, or sociotechnical change. With an eye for theoretical synthesis, this study asks: What do three particular epistemic communities-those concerning innovation, practices, and justice-say about energy transitions? What does this literature reveal about the injustices and inequalities of energy transitions? Finally, what can we learn by integrating aspects of this literature? The study answers these questions by drawing from responsible research and innovation, social practice theory, and energy justice approaches. Essentially the first is about the design of technology, the second how it is used, the third the broader societal and global implications. Taken together, the study offers an integrative framework capable of analyzing transitions from their "cradle" of design to their "life" of use to their "grave" of aftereffects. It explores the extent to which the three perspectives can be integrated into a meta-theoretical framework. This integrative framework is then applied to four diverse case studies: French nuclear power, Greek wind energy, Papua New Guinean solar energy, and Estonian oil shale.

AB  - Background. Asthma and overweight are epidemic in urban children but the relationship between these conditions is not fully understood. This study presents demographic and risk profiles of comorbidity for overweight asthmatic children, characterizes morbidity by comparing health outcomes among overweight asthmatics and healthy weight asthmatics, and examines socioeconomic factors associated with comorbidity. Objective. To construct a demographic profile of overweight asthmatic children in an urban setting and identify factors that contribute to prevalence. Method. Cross-sectional study of 5250 children in New York City public elementary schools using a parent-report questionnaire on body mass index, socioeconomic status, asthma, and asthma-related outcomes. Results. Prevalence of overweight (body mass index >= 85th percentile for age and gender) was 50.9%. The prevalence of overweight and ever being diagnosed with asthma was 10.9%. The prevalence of overweight with current asthma was 6.2%. Overweight current asthmatics had more night symptoms, missed school days, and asthma medication use than healthy weight asthmatics. Almost 50% of overweight current asthmatic children reported emergency department visits for asthma compared with 30% of healthy weight asthmatics. Comorbidity was most prevalent among males, Latinos, and children in low-income households, with the highest prevalence among Puerto Ricans. In multivariate analysis stratified by gender, the most significant factors associated with comorbidity among girls were low income and minority race/ethnicity, while among boys significant factors were parental education and parental history of asthma. Interestingly, there were few underweight children (7.8%) but they had high prevalence of asthma (13.8%). Conclusions. The comorbidity of overweight and asthma has a large impact on urban populations, causing greater disease burden than asthma alone. Overweight asthmatics show more uncontrolled asthma, evidenced by emergency department visits, quick-relief medication use, and days with asthma symptoms. The relationship between socioeconomic factors and the asthma-obesity comorbidity may vary by gender and requires further study to identify successful interventions to reduce disease in children.

Relatively little is known regarding inequalities in personal exposure to air pollution or transport-related noise. Objectives: Our objectives were to quantify socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in London in 1) air pollution exposure at residence compared to personal exposure; and 2) transport-related noise at residence from different sources. Methods: We used individual-level data from the London Travel Demand Survey (n = 45,079) between 2006 and 2010. We modeled residential (CMAQ-urban) and personal (London Hybrid Exposure Model) particulate matter < 2.5 mu m and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), road-traffic noise at residence (TRANEX) and identified those within 50 dB noise contours of railways and Heathrow airport. We analyzed relationships between household income, area-level income deprivation and ethnicity with air and noise pollution using quantile and logistic regression. Results: We observed inverse patterns in inequalities in air pollution when estimated at residence versus personal exposure with respect to household income (categorical, 8 groups). Compared to the lowest income group (< 10,000) pound, the highest group (> 75,000) pound had lower residential NO2 (-1.3 (95% CI -2.1, -0.6) mu g/m(3) in the 95th exposure quantile) but higher personal NO2 exposure (1.9 (95% CI 1.6, 2.3) mu g/m(3) in the 95th quantile), which was driven largely by transport mode and duration. Inequalities in residential exposure to NO2 with respect to area-level deprivation were larger at lower exposure quantiles (e.g. estimate for NO2 5.1 (95% CI 4.6, 5.5) at quantile 0.15 versus 1.9 (95% CI 1.1, 2.6) at quantile 0.95), reflecting low-deprivation, high residential NO2 areas in the city centre. Air pollution exposure at residence consistently overestimated personal exposure; this overestimation varied with age, household income, and area-level income deprivation. Inequalities in road traffic noise were generally small. In logistic regression models, the odds of living within a 50 dB contour of aircraft noise were highest in individuals with the highest household income, white ethnicity, and with the lowest area-level income deprivation. Odds of living within a 50 dB contour of rail noise were 19% (95% CI 3, 37) higher for black compared to white individuals. Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequalities in air pollution exposure were different for modeled residential versus personal exposure, which has important implications for environmental justice and confounding in epidemiology studies. Exposure misclassification was dependent on several factors related to health, a potential source of bias in epidemiological studies. Quantile regression revealed that socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in air pollution are often not uniform across the exposure distribution.

AB  - "One man, one vote" is the core idea of modern democracy. It is a slogan that has been used in many parts of the world, and in many public campaigns for universal suffrage. It became particularly prevalent during the period of emerging parliamentarism, and later during the phase of decolonisation and the global struggles for national sovereignty. Today, while modern societies are being challenged by non sustainable developments, the concept of knowledge democracy is emerging. This concept emphasises direct, participative forms of coping with challenges of increasing knowledge production and of applying this knowledge to solve problems of very long term and fundamental characteristics. With this, the slogan "one man, one vote" gets a new connotation and gains renewed relevance for societies in dealing with their debt to the future. In this chapter we will argue that it will even expand its relevance if combined with the fundamental idea of environmental justice as expressed by the idea of "one man, one vote, one carbon footprint", and that this also requires that the debate on sustainable development will be better informed.

AB  - As activists move from alternative media platforms to commercial social media platforms, they face increasing challenges in protecting their online security and privacy. While government surveillance of activists is well-documented in scholarly research and the media, corporate surveillance of activists remains under-researched. This article examines BP's surveillance of activists who criticise the company's corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme as greenwashing'. In this way, it goes beyond corporations' uses of big data and instead explores how they monitor and discuss strategies for responding to the activities of individual activists in social media. It shows that while social media afford an unprecedented level of visibility for activists, it comes with the risk of being monitored by corporations. Theoretically, it draws on conceptions of visibility in social sciences and media studies as well as literature on activism and political participation in media studies. Empirically, it draws on files from BP on specific civil society individuals obtained through Subject Access Requests under the UK Data Protection Act 1998 as well as press responses from BP.

AB  - 'Urban sustainability' currently receives widespread and generally enthusiastic endorsement, yet concerns are emerging that recent expressions of the concept may actually be working against the city and its residents. Based on research in Christchurch, New Zealand (one of the most urbanised countries in the world), it is argued that the assimilation of social, economic and bio-physical environmental elements that gave the idea much of its original legitimacy has been reduced to a minimalist set of material and discursive 'eco-friendly' denominators. As a result, only occasional glimpses of the city and its human inhabitants are caught in attempts to operationalise sustainability in urban areas. The effect is that cities, in New Zealand at least, are less liveable and less likeable than they should be. It is suggested that there is a real need to re-urbanise and rehumanise the urban sustainability agenda as a means of realising its integrative and transformative potential.

AB  - An innovative human exposure research project is examining environmental exposure by measuring contaminants in selected environmental justice communities. The project is developing the research infrastructure of the NCCU Environmental Science Program and outreach tools for environmental justice communities. The project will begin by selecting a minority and/or economically disadvantaged community that may be impacted by environmental hazards and then assessing the environmental exposures in the minority community. A long-range goal of the project is to develop and validate community-level exposure scenarios that can be adapted to other similar communities. The study community selected for this project must have some data available to anticipate exposure scenarios, have existing community groups or infrastructures to help to provide input and feedback to the researchers, and have sufficient population for recruitment of participants. The study will provide opportunities for state and local partnerships and maximize faculty and student involvement. The study is a complement of physical science and engineering approaches with social science methodologies that are leading to a non-traditional risk assessment and management process.

AB  - As a reaction to resource scarcity and a growing conscience for environmental justice, closing product loops and thus eliminating land-filling or other product-dead ends where possible becomes a task that many disciplines work on solving today. The most influential among those disciplines are the ones that mainly determine product lives, namely product design, business model, supply chain and the technology infrastructure. Following the idea that the most influential phase determining product lives is product development and furthermore acknowledging that the way a product is developed is defined in the requirements given to the product development team, this paper describes two case studies where product requirements were analyzed concerning their closed-loop-thinking and the representation of the aforementioned disciplines using qualitative data analysis. This proceeding adds a new perspective to product development analyses by examining the actual requirements, that are the formal representation of all product development instructions.

AB  - "Sustainability" features in numerous discourses, each of which frames the issue according to its particular worldview(s). Thus there is no singular sustainability conception, but multiple sustainabilities that compete with one another for prominence in various realms. This article presents a framework to assist students in navigating this discursive maze. The framework is drawn from the environmental justice literature, and it is used by the author to challenge undergraduates to view sustainability as a competitive political space in which claims reflect the normative values of their framers. The pedagogical utility of the framework is highlighted through an example classroom application.

AB  - Anecdotal evidence from the 17-county Black Belt region of Alabama has suggested that safe-water access may be limited by piped water infrastructure problems and private well contamination, possibly resulting in degradation of water quality and therefore elevated risk of waterborne disease. On-site sanitation access is limited as well since existing approved technology options suitable for the poorly draining soils that predominate in this area are too costly for many households. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 305 households to examine (i) drinking water quality at the household level (private wells and county public supply), (ii) possible associations between water infrastructure characteristics and drinking water quality, (iii) availability of on-site sanitation, and (iv) risk of Highly Credible Gastrointestinal Illness (HCGI). Participating households completed one survey on water use, basic demographics, health, water system performance, and on-site sanitation and submitted one drinking water sample for analysis of fecal coliform (FC), turbidity, pH, and total and free chlorine. Approximately 8 % of public water system samples and 20 % of private well water samples were positive for FC, with 33 % of piped water supply samples lacking detectable free chlorine. We found a significant increase (OR 4.0, 95 % CI 1.3-14) in HCGI risk for individuals whose drinking water sample was positive for FC. Sanitation access was not universal, with 18 % of households lacking any means of on-site wastewater disposal. Results from this study suggest that safe-water access and on-site sanitation options may be limited in this area. Residents may be subject to increased risk of water and sanitation-related illness.

AB  - Background: Surrounded by landfills, and toxic and hazardous facilities, Altgeld Gardens is located in a " toxic doughnut". With high rates of environmentally-related conditions, residents have called for a community-based environmental health assessment to improve overall health in their community. The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes and beliefs of environmental health risks of Altgeld's residents which would assist community organizing efforts and provide the groundwork for a community-based environmental health assessment. Methods: A questionnaire was designed and administered to 42 Altgeld residents who also participated in focus groups to assess their perceptions of environmental health risks. Results: All participants were Altgeld residents for at least two years and were fairly representative of the broader community. Physical and social hazards were primarily identified as posing risks to participants' family and the broader community. Physical hazards included the dumping of hazardous waste and landfills; social hazards were crime and drugs. Conclusions: These findings have been useful in community organizing efforts and in program planning for local community-based organizations and public health agencies. The results have also been used to prioritize health and environmental risk issues impacting the community.

AB  - An equity-mapping analysis of access to park space enjoyed by children and youth in Los Angeles (LA), and by residents according to their race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status finds that low-income and concentrated poverty areas as well as neighborhoods dominated by Latinos, African Americans, and Asian-Pacific Islanders, have dramatically lower levels of access to park resources than White-dominated areas of the city. Further, a mapping of park-bond funding allocations by location reveals that funding patterns often exacerbate rather than ameliorate existing inequalities in park and open-space resource distributions. Given the lack of large parcels for park acquisition, these results indicate that creative strategies for providing open space-such as utilizing vacant lots, alleys, underutilized school sites, public or utility-owned property, unnecessarily wide streets, and abandoned riverbeds-will be required in the city's older neighborhoods to redress existing inequities in access to parks.

AB  - An important component of urban aerosol, diesel soot is a known respiratory irritant and contains mutagenic and carcinogenic organic compounds. To estimate Student exposures to soot emitted from public diesel buses during commutes to city high schools, a portion of the Baltimore municipal fuel supply was tagged with an iridium tracer and exposure was monitored during commutes with personal aerosol monitors as a part of an Environmental Justice Project. A total of 63.2 g of Ir as iridium(III)-2,4-pentanedionate were used to induce a concentration of 48.5 pg Ir l(-1) of fuel. Twenty samples were collected over 10 days while four students commuted on regularly scheduled buses and a fifth student commuted by private car. Individual samples integrated from 1 to 4 round trips. Iridium analyses were performed instrumentally after neutron activation with a detection limit (DL) of about 503 fg. For students commuting by bus and following protocols, Ir tracer concentrations ranged from 53 +/- 38 to > 1980 +/- 49 fg m(-3) Concentrations up to 3530 +/- 220 fg m(-3) were observed for student # 5, who sampled only when boarding and disembarking. Exposure were greatest for students commuting through the heavily trafficked central business district. Corresponding estimates of exposures to soot emitted from municipal buses ranged from less than or equal to 3 to 82 ng soot m(-3) (less than or equal to 145 ng m(-3) for student # 5), i.e. well below the exposure level of 2-10 mu g m(-3) total C from all sources, including the more than 30,000 diesel trucks which,ass through the city's major toll facilities each day. Ir was undetectable in samples collected by the student commuting by car when its windows were closed, but comparable to those of the other students when commutes were made with windows open. The Ir tracer DL corresponds to about 21 ng soot, about half of which is carbon. This is far below the 230 ng reported for analysis by a highly sensitive thermal-optical technique.

AB  - An urban ecological recreational space (UERS), which connects the natural environment with urban residents, is an important guarantee for developing a livable city and improving the well-being of residents. However, there is a serious imbalance between the supply of UERSs and the demand of residents in many big, rapidly developing cities. Previous studies usually used indicators such as scale or quantity to measure the supply level of UERS enjoyed by residents, ignoring its own quality differences. Therefore, taking the urban development area of Wuhan as the research object, we measured the quality of UERS from four dimensions using the entropy method and designed a method to measure the supply service level under the hierarchical travel threshold to analyze the supply level of UERSs based on a community unit. Finally, combined with the demand characteristics of different groups, the matching relationship between supply and demand of UERSs in each community is quantitatively analyzed. The results show the following: (1) The quality of UERS in urban development area of Wuhan varies greatly and its distribution is extremely uneven. (2) The level of supply services and the demand level vary greatly, and the overall performance has a trend of decreasing from the city center to the periphery. (3) The overall matching relationship between supply and demand of UERS is not ideal, and more than half of the communities are in supply deficit or without services. Our study provides a novel perspective on quantifying the supply-demand relationship of UERS. It can more accurately guide decision-makers and planners in determining areas with mismatches between the supply and demand of UERSs and in making targeted layouts of UERSs and relevant policies.

AB  - As a self-reporting data source, the 311 non-emergency service reflects the residents' concerns on various environmental complaints, including noise. This study explores the nexus between noise complaints extracted from this data source and the transportation-related inequality that reflects a wide range of socio-demographic cohorts associated with it in Dallas, Texas. Noise constitutes an inevitable fact of life-especially in denser urban areas, that as this paper reports, reflects social injustice. Drawing from multiple socio-demographic and transportation indicators, this study conducts multiple statistical and spatial analyses in the selected case studies. The findings further identify the explanatory variables relative to noise complaints and their inequality implications. The results confirm that transportation-related factors affect inequality while also operating within specific socio-demographic patterns. The study gleans lessons for transportation and urban planners, policymakers, and local authorities.

AB  - Hydropower is the largest source of renewable electricity in the world, but despite being a mature and clean energy technology it has also been the subject of ecological and social conflict. Literature suggests that the social acceptance of renewable energy can be increased by respecting procedural justice (fair, participatory planning processes) and distributional justice (fairly allocating costs and benefits). However, empirical evidence about how justice considerations are related to the expansion of hydropower is scarce, pre-existing studies being mostly qualitative in nature. We contribute to filling the gap in the current literature by describing in this paper how choice experiments with 1004 Swiss residents were undertaken to explore the influence of procedural and distributional justice on acceptance, relative to other attributes of hydropower projects. We find that while considerations about justice do play a role in decisions to accept, respondents in Switzerland care most about ecological impacts, and secondly about local ownership.

AB  - Green infrastructure designed to address urban drainage and water quality issues is often deployed without full knowledge of potential unintended social, ecological, and human health consequences. Though understood in their respective fields of study, these diverse impacts are seldom discussed together in a format understood by a broader audience. This paper takes a first step in addressing that gap by exploring tradeoffs associated with green infrastructure practices that manage urban stormwater including urban trees, stormwater ponds, filtration, infiltration, rain gardens, and green roofs. Each green infrastructure practice type performs best under specific conditions and when targeting specific goals, but regular inspections, maintenance, and monitoring are necessary for any green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) practice to succeed. We review how each of the above practices is intended to function and how they could malfunction in order to improve how green stormwater infrastructure is designed, constructed, monitored, and maintained. Our proposed decision-making framework, using both biophysical (biological and physical) science and social science, could lead to GSI projects that are effective, cost efficient, and just.

AB  - Hundreds of human rights and environmental cases against corporations have been launched in countries around the world in the past two decades. This body of counter corporate litigation-legal actions that involve attempts to enforce legal or normative standards against business entities-forms a significant part of the legal struggles shaping the transition to a sustainable economy. However, the question remains-how does litigation against companies fit with the larger patterns of reform? In this paper, I draw on a taxonomy of sustainability litigation to describe three functions of counter corporate litigation: remedy, the search for justice through legal action; regulation, the enforcement of legal standards through the courts; and repression, the proscription of predatory business models. I argue that research into counter corporate litigation helps to illuminate the priorities for legal reform, including the integration of human rights and the environment into legal instruments governing corporate activities, transnational approaches to corporate accountability, and a willingness to challenge unsustainable business models.

AB  - How can politics be articulated or at least imagined by ill, impoverished and abandoned communities? This article documents how care is invoked by activist groups and local citizens in their search for ethical recognition and environmental justice in Puchuncavi, Chile. The authors argue that in a context of prolonged and systematic harm, care emerges as a way to render their suffering understandable, knowable and actionable, and thus as a mode of intervention that instantiates politics in different spaces and at several scales. At the interfaces of feminist science studies, environmental sociology and political theory, this article examines how care acts as a grammar to enunciate problems and make connections deemed irrelevant by expert apparatuses. Specifically, the authors ethnographically track the capacity of care practices to create therapeutic spaces of affective endurance and healing, and to produce new forms of sensual and ecological knowledge about beings, things and relations. These different modes of caring and being cared for, it is suggested, underline the capacity of care for the politicization of harm and suffering: to re-arrange what is visibilized, valued and problematized in the face of intractable environmental crises - a crucial objective for collectives removed from every form of politics. Care, as it is articulated here, is not a coherent and predefined programme, but a fluid and adaptable ethico-political set of practices and potentialities always concerning specific individuals facing specific problems in specific circumstances. If care is to be mobilized to craft more response-able policy, researchers should think more thoroughly about these multiple configurations of care, and the disparate ways in which they can contribute (or not) to invoke new styles and formats, new sensitivities and possibilities for policy-making.

AB  - Hybrid (or multi-actor) governance has been identified as a key opportunity for upscaling urban nature-based solutions (referred to as urban NBS), representing a demand-driven and cost-effective realization of urban green infrastructure. However it is unclear how such hybrid governance affects the justice outcomes of urban NBS. Through six in-depth cases of urban NBS we show that hybrid governance can lead to both improvements and deterioration of distributional, procedural and recognition justice, depending on the hybrid governance choices. By exploring the tensions between these justice impacts we formulate three main policy implications for hybrid governance settings: the need for transparent decision-making on the distribution of costs and benefits; safeguarding public control over the urban NBS and the use of scientific expertise in combination with bottom-up consultation procedures to recognize both current and future voices.

AB  - Green energy has become a term that heralds efforts of environmental conservation and protection worldwide; however, much of it is marred with questions of what it means to be green. More precisely, it has become a question of Green for whom? While many of the impacts of supposed green energy projects are local in their reach, some may be more regional in their scope, such as hydroelectric power. Hydroelectric power generation negatively impacts the environment and people who rely on the environment for sustenance, such as, Indigenous peoples of northern Canada. Taking into account their position with respect to the areas impacted by these green projects, many Indigenous peoples have voiced their concerns and doubts concerning green energy, which is purported to be a mode of energy production that champions the environment. The Kabinakagami River Waterpower Project serves as a case study for both the potential effects of the project and the different views associated with these endeavors. If nothing else, the accounts and testimonies found within shall stand as a testament to the hubris of calling an energy project green without properly assessing and considering the impacts. While these statements relate to the case presented, they also carry significance in the wider world due to the numerous Indigenous communities around the world that are having their spaces slowly being encroached upon in the name of sustainable growth, or green energy. This will especially be true in the post-COVID-19 period where green energy and a green economy are being touted as a way towards state and worldwide recovery.

AB  - Globally, environmental overexploitation and degradation constitute both threats to human development and sources of tension and conflicts. In Nigeria, the degradation of the Niger Delta environment by oil production has exacerbated long-standing grievances among communities competing for scarce resources. This article seeks to examine the theoretical and existential explanations for the mobilisation by groups from Nigeria's oil-producing communities to pursue armed struggle in engaging with the Nigerian state and multinational oil companies. Using 10 focus groups with 85 participants, the author tests the argument that violent conflicts in the Niger Delta are related to the negative pressures placed on the environment and communities by pollution of land and water resources by oil production. These pressures expose the population of the area to poverty, hunger, malnutrition, anxiety, distrust and violence. The ensuing widening inequalities have spawned simmering grievances, a survivalist culture and a politics of ethnic mobilisation.

AB  - Here we propose a framework for considering the justice issues of industrial cluster decarbonisation, a pressing challenge confronting many industrialised economies. Industrial clusters are large, multi-point source emitters, users of energy and employers of regional and national significance. In the UK, establishing low carbon industrial clusters is one of several grand challenges of industrial strategy. Theorising the just transition of industrial clusters requires concepts from multiple literatures. We abstract relevant themes from the intersections of the literatures of just transitions, innovation studies and sociotechnical transitions, and public participation in spatial planning, and illustrate their empirical relevance. The broad themes of our framework are (i) politics, space and institutions, with sub-themes of justice, democracy, financialization; (ii) new processes and procedures, with sub -themes of legal recognition of public concerns, community-based planning, community capacity enhancement and life cycle impact assessment; and (iii) correlates of acceptance and resistance, with sub-themes of envi-ronmental values, perceived loss of amenity, pre-existing politics, perceptions of just process and trust in the developer. The framework is intended to both guide the design of just transition processes ex-ante and evaluate these post-hoc.

AB  - Healthcare organizations are increasingly examining the impacts of their facilities and operations on the natural environment, their workers, and the broader community, but the ecological impacts of specific healthcare services provided within these institutions have not been assessed. This paper provides a qualitative assessment of healthcare practices that takes into account the life-cycle impacts of a variety of materials used in typical medical care. We conducted an ethnographic study of three medical inpatient units: a conventional cancer ward, palliative care unit, and a hospice center. Participant observations (73 participants) of healthcare and support staff including physicians, nurses, housekeepers, and administrators were made to inventory materials and document practices used in patient care. Semi-structured interviews provided insight into common practices. We identified three major domains that highlight the cumulative environmental, occupational health, and public health impacts of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used at our research sites: (1) medical supply procurement; (2) generation, handling, and disposal of medical waste; and (3) pharmaceutical handling and disposal. Impacts discovered through ethnographic inquiry included occupational exposures to chemotherapy and infectious waste, and public health exposures to pharmaceutical waste. This study provides new insight into the environmental, occupational, and public health impacts resulting from medical practices. In many cases, the lack of clear guidance and regulations regarding environmental impacts contributed to elevated harms to the natural environment, workers, and the broader community.

AB  - How do peasants assert food justice and sovereignty in Eastern Europe? How do their food practices connect with broader political conflicts and movements? Most scholarship on food and agriculture in this region describes small-scale farming as a 'quiet' -apolitical and unpurposeful -contribution to sustainability. This paper aims to expand the 'quiet sustainability' thesis by theoretically building on food justice and sovereignty theories. Since sustainability cannot be achieved without confronting the structures that reproduce oppression, food sovereignty - as the right of people to define their own agro-food systems - should be seen as a precondition for both greater justice and sustainability. Drawing on the case of a peasant association from Romania, Eco Ruralis, member of the European Coordination Via Campesina, we argue that peasants are not just 'quietly' contributing to sustainability but rather have been historically and systemically silenced and marginalized by various regimes of power. As testimonies show, such alternative practices are continuously devalued, threatened and marginalized but peasants also seek to re-politicize food. We posit that a movement for food justice and sovereignty is emerging in former socialist Eastern Europe, characterized by embeddedness within transnational movements against extractivism and efforts to reclaim the dignity of being a peasant.

AB  - Improving energy performance of the housing stock continues to be an important undertaking in the energy transition of many EU member states. However, tendencies of low-income households generally living in buildings with low energy performance pose a challenge for this transition, and cases of 'renoviction' and 'green gentrification' are becoming more and more noticed in the scientific community. More so, questions regarding the distributive justice of costs and burdens in the energy transition of the housing stock have been raised. In this paper, we approach this problem from a perspective of energy performance metrics. Although energy performance (kWh/m(2), year) is generally lower in buildings inhabited by low-income households, residential density-and thus building utilisation-tends to be higher. By measuring per capita energy use instead of area normalised energy use, we investigate if a high residential density can offset a low energy performance and change the perception of which buildings are considered energy inefficient and which are not. Results showed that by measuring per capita energy use instead of area-normalised energy use, energy inefficient buildings were found in high-income city centres instead of in low-income suburbs of Swedish cities. Moreover, there has been an unjust distribution of the imposition of the energy transition over the past decade where the residents with the initially lowest per capita energy use have carried a disproportionately high share of the energy savings. This suggests that a change of energy performance metrics could offer an approach for a more socially just and sustainable energy transition of the housing stock.

Using insights about the connections between institutions of human oppression and the domination of the natural environment, as well as insights into nondistributive justice, I argue for a nondistributive model to supple ment, complement, and in some cases preempt the distributive model. I conclude with a discussion of eight features of such a nondistributive conception of justice.

AB  - Human health is known to be affected by the physical environment. Various environmental influences have been identified to benefit or challenge people's physical condition. Their heterogeneous distribution in space results in unequal burdens depending on the place of living. In addition, since societal groups tend to also show patterns of segregation, this leads to unequal exposures depending on social status. In this context, environmental justice research examines how certain social groups are more affected by such exposures. Yet, analyses of this per se spatial phenomenon are oftentimes criticized for using "essentially aspatial" data or methods which neglect local spatial patterns by aggregating environmental conditions over large areas. Recent technological and methodological developments in satellite remote sensing have proven to provide highly detailed information on environmental conditions. This narrative review therefore discusses known influences of the urban environment on human health and presents spatial data and applications for analyzing these influences. Furthermore, it is discussed how geographic data are used in general and in the interdisciplinary research field of environmental justice in particular. These considerations include the modifiable areal unit problem and ecological fallacy. In this review we argue that modern earth observation data can represent an important data source for research on environmental justice and health. Especially due to their high level of spatial detail and the provided large-area coverage, they allow for spatially continuous description of environmental characteristics. As a future perspective, ongoing earth observation missions, as well as processing architectures, ensure data availability and applicability of 'big earth data' for future environmental justice analyses.

AB  - Green spaces are one important indicator of urban quality of life. Yet urban green space research is often carried out in industrialized nations, with relatively little known about green space use and preferences in rapidly urbanizing cities in developing countries. With high levels of urbanization and widening inequalities in many Latin American cities, it is necessary to evaluate green space situated within cultural and geographical contexts. In this study, green space usability was explored by examining preferences, perceptions, and access barriers of parks and urban green space using on-site individual semi-structured interviews and systematic observations of behavior among a purposive sample of urban residents. We sought to determine whether certain sectors of the urban population have access to green space in close proximity of their homes and localized patterns of use in (municipal) urban parks and neighborhood parks. The revitalization and construction of urban parks in the last decade in Santa Cruz, Bolivia was found to reduce access barriers for residents by providing more desirable and safer public spaces for leisure and recreation. However, gender disparities were found in terms of usage and we document unequal distribution of larger and more desirable green spaces throughout sectors of the city, so that not all urban residents are experiencing such benefits. Results highlight the potential importance of designing green spaces to serve as equalizers in urban areas characterized by social and spatial inequalities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - How green spaces in cities benefit urban residents depends critically on the interaction between biophysical and socio-economic factors. Urban ecosystem services are affected by both ecosystem characteristics and the social and economic attributes of city dwellers. Yet, there remains little synthesis of the interactions between ecosystem services, urban green spaces, and socio-economic factors. Articulating these linkages is key to their incorporation into ecosystem service planning and management in cities and to ensuring equitable outcomes for city inhabitants. We present a conceptual model of these linkages, describe three major interaction pathways, and explore how to operationalize the model. First, socio-economic factors shape the quantity and quality of green spaces and their ability to supply services by influencing management and planning decisions. Second, variation in socio-economic factors across a city alters people's desires and needs and thus demands for different ecosystem services. Third, socio-economic factors alter the type and amount of benefit for human wellbeing that a service provides. Integrating these concepts into green space policy, planning, and management would be a considerable improvement on 'standards-based' urban green space planning. We highlight the implications of this for facilitating tailored planning solutions to improve ecosystem service benefits across the socio-economic spectrum in cities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Green stormwater infrastructure has been demonstrated as an innovative water resources management approach that addresses multiple challenges facing urban environments. However, there is little consensus on what policy strategies can be used to best incentivize green infrastructure adoption by private landowners. Game theory, an analysis framework that has historically been under-utilized within the context of stormwater management, is uniquely suited to address this policy question. We used a cooperative game theory framework to investigate the potential impacts of different policy strategies used to incentivize green infrastructure installation. The results indicate that municipal regulation leads to the greatest reduction in pollutant loading. However, the choice of the "best" regulatory approach will depend on a variety of different factors including politics and financial considerations. Large, downstream agents have a disproportionate share of bargaining power. Results also reveal that policy impacts are highly dependent on agents' spatial position within the stormwater network, leading to important questions of social equity and environmental justice.

AB  - I argue environmental disasters are an inevitable outcome of the underdevelopment of Western philosophy. Human induced environmental disasters are unfortunate, an unintended consequence of focusing on economic maximization in a culture without comprehensive, clearly accepted, and operationalized frameworks for environmental and intergenerational justice. However, they are of no surprise to Indigenous Peoples relegated to margins of political influence. Grounding this claim, I examine the New Zealand High Court case Greenpeace and Te Whanau-a-Apanui vs the Minister for Energy. Case documents afford comparisons between the complex philosophic, legal, and cultural framework of Maori, that protect human and nonhuman from human-induced environmental disaster, and the dominant Anglo framings. I observe a philosophical deficit underpinning the legal and political system of Aotearoa that impedes environmental intergenerational justice. These philosophic foundations, intentionally or not, promote environmental disaster and - nationally and internationally - claim a dominant position over Indigenous systems.

AB  - Green space within residential areas is an important part of urban green space. However, in the past, these areas have not been completely open to the public and are only available to residents of the community within gated fences. At present, China has proposed to gradually open these closed communities, but quantitative assessment of the impacts of implementation on equity of green accessibility has not been explored. This paper selected Wuhan as a research case and used a Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment (2SFCA) and genetic algorithm to analyze and simulate whether the opened community policy would improve the equity of green accessibility, and how to best implement it. The main conclusions were: 1) The average green accessibility of the community within 1 km, 2.5 km, 5 km, and 10 km increased from 76.08, 75.50, 85.01, and 64.28 in the closed state to 102.43, 103.83, 114.39, and 94.87 in the fully open state; 2) After opening the gates, green equity was lower than before within the 1 km and 2.5 km thresholds, while opening the gates at distance thresholds over 3.6 km, green equity was promoted; 3) After optimization by the genetic algorithm, Gini coefficients for green equity were 0.39 and 0.28 within the 1 km and 2.5 km thresholds, and equity clearly increased compared to full community closure or full opening. This study quantified the spatial relationship between residents and green space and can be used to improve equitable spatial allocation of urban green space. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Green spaces provide urban residents with numerous environmental and social benefits and are regarded as a fundamental part of sustainable urban development. However, the spatial distribution of green spaces is uneven in most cities and urban regions, which has been considered as an issue of environmental injustice. We present a study in which the spatial variation of green space equity and its relationship with socioeconomic variables were analyzed across different municipalities in the region of Munich, southern Germany. The Gini coefficient was applied as an indicator of green space equity and its relationship with socioeconomic variables was explored by using a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. Moreover, the impacts of different urban dynamic scenarios on green space equity were comparatively assessed at both the regional and sub-regional zone levels by incorporating a multiple urban dynamic scenario modeling approach. The results indicate that the relationships between green space equity and socioeconomic variables are not always consistently significant over space and the coefficients of GWR reflect great spatial heterogeneity indicating the relationships are locality-specific. At both levels, a higher housing demand scenario tends to increase the spatial inequality of green space distribution. Polycentric urban spatial structure scenarios are found less limiting than monocentric ones in terms of green space equity at the regional scale. Among different urban growth form scenarios ("sprawl", "compact sprawl" or "compact"), "compact" growth is most favorable at both levels in terms of green space equity. However, the other two growth form scenarios perform differently in each sub-regional zone. Therefore, the physical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across space should be considered thoroughly in the process of developing policies for urban development that effectively safeguard access to sufficient green space. This implication is not only crucial for this study region but also of great significance for other urban regions which aim to achieve successful green space planning.

AB  - Identifying the geographic units with restricted access to intra-urban parks has become a hot issue in transport studies. Previous literature has examined the social inequalities of park accessibility under the Western context; however, the issue has seldomly investigated against the non-Western background, especially in China. Using a case of Shenzhen (China), this paper examines the accessibility to parks of three quality levels (official standard) under four transport modes (public transit, walking, bicycle, and private car). In particular, the daily travel time from each community (8117) to each park (625) was harvested from the Baidu Map during 18:30-20:30 in July 2016. We further, based on the travel time calculations, develop four baseline indicators (the weighted average, the minimum, the maximum, and the standard deviation travel time) and three tolerance indicators of park accessibility (weighted average travel time within visit tolerance thresholds, standard deviation travel time within visit tolerance thresholds, and number of parks within visit tolerance thresholds) to measure park accessibility for each community. Results show that the seven accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the quantified accessibility varies greatly with park quality levels and transport modes. Communities present greater variations in accessibility to the first quality level and second quality level parks via walking and public transit. In addition, hierarchical regression is utilized to quantify the relationships between park accessibility and sociodemographic characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). It is found that the associations are subjected to park quality, transport modes, and geographic levels. In particular, we discover significant social inequalities in park accessibility under the mode of public transit, walking, and bicycle. Our study should provide some new insights into accessibility research and advance the understanding of unequal park provision in developing countries.

AB  - Healthcare workers face difficult working conditions, particularly where HIV and tuberculosis add to under-staffing. Questionnaires, workplace assessments, and discussion groups were conducted at a regional hospital in South Africa to obtain baseline data and input from the workforce in designing interventions. Findings highlighted weaknesses in knowledge, for example regarding the use of N95 respirators and safe handling of sharps, and suggested the need for improved training. Access to supplies and personal protective equipment was the major reported reason for failure to follow proper procedures; this was confirmed by workplace assessments. Discussion groups highlighted the important role for worker Health and Safety Committees (HSC), including in combating stigma and encouraging reporting. Interest in data to support decision-snaking resulted in development of the Occupational Health and Safety Information System (OHASIS); further training of HSCs is still needed. Multi-stakeholder international collaboration aimed at building HSC capacity is well-received.

AB  - Human well-being is often an overarching goal in environmental decision-making, yet assessments are often limited to economic, health, or ecological endpoints that are more tangible to measure. Composite indices provide a comprehensive approach to measuring well-being in terms of multi-dimensional components, such as living standards, health, education, safety, and culture. For example, the Human Well-Being Index (HWBI) framework, initially developed for the U.S. fifty states, was recently applied to quantify human well-being for Puerto Rico. However, the paucity of data at spatial scales finer than state or county levels, particularly for social metrics, poses a major limitation to quantifying well-being at neighborhood-scales relevant to decision-making. Here we demonstrate a spatial interpolation method to fill in missing fine-scale data where coarser-scale data is available. Downscaling from municipio (i.e., county-equivalent) to census-tract revealed a greater range of variability in well-being scores across Puerto Rico, in particular, a larger proportion of low well-being scores. Furthermore, while some components of wellbeing (e.g., Education, Health, Leisure Time, Safety and Security, Social Cohesion) showed consistent improvement over time from 2000 to 2017 across Puerto Rico, others (e.g., Connection to Nature, Cultural Fulfillment, Living Standards) were variable among census tracts, increasing for some but declining for others. We use a case study in the San Juan Bay estuary watershed to illustrate how approaches to quantify baseline levels of well-being can be used to explore potential impacts of management actions on communities, including to identify environmental justice inequalities among neighborhoods. Spatial clustering analysis was used to identify statistically significant cold or hot spots in well-being. This study demonstrates how indicators of well-being, coupled with interpolation methods to overcome limitations of data availability, can help to monitor long-term changes over time and to better communicate the potential value of ecosystem restoration or resource management.

AB  - Health social movements address several issues: (a) access to, or provision of, health care services; (b) disease, illness experience, disability and contested illness; and/or (c) health inequality and inequity based on race, ethnicity, gender, class and/or sexuality. These movements have challenged a variety of authority structures in society, resulting in massive changes in the health care system. While many other social movements challenge medical authority, a rapidly growing type of health social movement, "embodied health movements" (EHMs), challenge both medical and scientific authority. Embodied health movements do this in three ways: (1) they make the body central to social movements, especially with regard to the embodied experience of people with the disease; (2) they typically include challenges to existing medical/scientific knowledge and practice; and (3) they often involve activists collaborating with scientists and health professionals in pursuing treatment, prevention, research, and expanded funding. We present a conceptual framework for understanding embodied health movements as simultaneously challenging authority structures and allying with them, and offer the environmental breast cancer movement as an exemplar case.

AB  - Growing evidence links adolescent exposures to cancer risk later in life, particularly for common cancers like breast. The adolescent time period is also important for cancer risk reduction as many individual lifestyle behaviors are initiated including smoking and alcohol use. We developed a cancer risk-reduction educational tool tailored for adolescents that focused on five modifiable cancer risk factors. To contextualize risk factors in adolescents' social and physical environments, the intervention also focused on structural barriers to individual- and community-level change, with an emphasis on environmental justice or the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. The educational tool consisted of a 50-min module that included an introduction to cancer biology including genetic susceptibility and environmental interactions, cancer burden in the local community, and risk reduction strategies. The module also included an interactive activity in which adolescent students identify cancer risk factors and brainstorm strategies for risk reduction at both the individual and community level. We administered the module to 12 classes of over 280 high school and college students in New York City. Cancer risk reduction strategies identified by the students included family- or peer-level strategies such as team physical activity and community-level action including improving parks and taxing sugary foods. We developed a novel and interactive cancer risk-reduction education tool focused on multiple cancers that can be adopted by other communities and educational institutions.

AB  - Green space exposure is beneficial to the physical and mental health of community residents, but the spatial distribution of green space is inequitable. Due to data availability, green equality or justice studies typically use administrative units as contextual areas to evaluate green spaces exposure, which is macro-scale and may lead to biased estimates as it ignores fine-scale green spaces (e.g., community gardens, lawns), that community residents are more frequently exposed to. In this study, we used the community as the unit of analysis, considered the green exposure of community residents in their daily social and physical activities, obtained data on three types of green spaces including fine-scale green spaces in the communities, surrounding large-scale parks and streetscape images. We propose a series of metrics for assessing community green equity, including a total of 11 metrics in three major categories of morphology, visibility and accessibility and applied them to 4544 communities in Beijing urban area. Through spatial visualization, spatial clustering, radar plots, and correlation analysis, we comprehensively analyzed the equity of green space at the community scale, identified the cold and hot spots of homogeneity, and then analyzed the equity of green space among regions under the urbanization process. The measurement results of these metrics showed that there are large differences and complementarities between different categories of metrics, but similarities exist between metrics of the same category. The proposed methodology represents the development of a green space evaluation system that can be used by decision makers and urban green designers to create and maintain more equitable community green spaces. In addition, the large-scale, comprehensive and fine-scale green space measurement of this study can be combined with other studies such as public health and environmental pollution in the future to obtain more comprehensive conclusions and better guide the construction and regeneration of green spaces.

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) provides a suite of ecosystem services that are widely recognized as critical to health, well-being, and sustainability on an urbanizing planet. However, the distribution of GI across urban landscapes is frequently uneven, resulting in unequal delivery of these services to low-income residents or those belonging to underserved racial/ethnic identities. While GI distribution has been identified as unequal across municipalities, we investigated whether this was true in public schoolyards within and among urban school districts. We examined schoolyards in four metropolitan areas of diverse socio-economic and demographic compositions in North Carolina, USA to determine if they provided equal exposure to GI, then compared whether this was true of the broader urban landscape. We first classified the land cover of elementary schoolyards and their neighborhoods, then used bivariate and multivariate approaches to analyze the relationships between GI (i.e. tree canopy cover and total GI) and the socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity of the schools and surrounding neighborhoods, respectively. We found that the extent of tree canopy cover and total GI in schoolyards was unrelated to the socioeconomic status and the race/ethnicity of students across the four school districts. In contrast, neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status and larger populations of underserved race/ethnicity residents had less tree canopy cover and total GI. Although total GI was more evenly distributed in schoolyards, the extent of tree canopy cover and total GI in schoolyards was lower than that in the neighborhoods. This suggests opportunities for school districts to expand GI in schoolyards, leveraging their potential to increase ecosystem services to all children, from increased educational opportunities to improved mental, physical, and environmental wellbeing.

AB  - Human-induced climate change is bringing warmer conditions to the Southwestern United States. More extreme urban heat island (UHI) effects are not distributed equally, and often impact socioeconomically vulnerable populations the most. This study aims to quantify how land surface temperature (LST) changes with increasing green vegetation landscapes, identify disparities in urban warming exposure, and provide a method for developing evidence-based mitigation options. ECOSTRESS LST products, detailed land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and socioeconomic variables were used to facilitate the analysis. We examined the relationship between LST and the fractions of LULC and socioeconomic factors in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. A machine learning approach (Random Forest) was used to model LST changes by taking the LULC fractions (scenario-based approaches) as the explanatory variables. We found that vegetation features-trees, grass, and shrubs-were the most important factors mitigating UHI effects during the summer daytime. Trees tended to lower surface temperature more effectively, whereas we observed elevated daytime LST most often near roads. Meanwhile, higher summer daytime temperatures were observed on land with unmanaged soil compared to the built environment. We found that affluent neighborhoods experienced lower temperatures, while low-income communities experienced higher temperatures. Scenario analyses suggest that replacing 50% of unmanaged soil with trees could reduce average summer daytime temperatures by 1.97 degrees C if the intervention was implemented across all of Phoenix and by 1.43 degrees C if implemented within the urban core only. We suggest that native trees requiring little to no additional water other than rainfall should be considered. We quantify mitigation options for urban warming effect under vegetation management interventions, and our results provide some vital insight into existing disparities in UHI impacts. Future UHI mitigation strategies seriously need to consider low-income communities to improve environmental justice. These can be used to guide the development of sustainable and equitable policies for vegetation management to mitigate heat exposure impacts on communities.

AB  - Greenspace can alleviate many of the negative effects of urbanization and help enhance human well-being yet, in most cities in the world, greenspace is inequitably distributed. In western societies, wealthy white neighborhoods typically have more access to greenspace, constituting an environmental and social justice issue. Although scholars from multiple disciplines and academic domains study questions of justice in greenspace, the scholarship remains fragmented. The purpose of this qualitative review is to explore the diverse disciplinary approaches to justice in urban greenspace to identify patterns and trends in how justice is conceptualized and realized. We analyze a set of case studies across multiple disciplines using a sample of 21 peer-reviewed articles following the framework set out by Bulkeley and colleagues that conceptualizes justice according to recognition, distribution, procedures, rights, and responsibilities. Our results suggest that the various solutions proposed in the diverse streams of scholarship often call for solutions that transcend individual disciplinary boundaries. This finding supports the need for collaborative and cross-disciplinary work to effectively address injustice in urban greenspace. In an effort to integrate findings, we identify five main objectives that need to be addressed by scholars, built environment practitioners, and policymakers, which include: (1) appropriate funding mechanisms for long-term maintenance; (2) recognition of safety concerns; (3) connectivity of greenspace; (4) multifunctionality in greenspace design; and (5) community engagement.

AB  - In the 20 years since a president committed federal government agencies to achieving environmental justice (EJ), states have been at the forefront of policy development. But states have varied in the nature and extent of their EJ efforts. We use Guttman Scaling to measure state EJ effort and test hypotheses regarding the relative importance of problem severity, politics, and administrative variables to variation in state policy development. Our analysis offers a novel characterization of state policy intensity and demonstrates its scalability. Income-based problem severity, environmental group membership, and nonwhite populations were important predictors of state EJ policy intensity during our study period. The political geography of EJ policy also displayed a distinctive southern pattern and the EJ policy intensity model contrasted significantly with a model of environmental policy innovation. The findings suggest that state EJ politics are more indicative of redistributive policy than regulatory.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) include all the landscape's ecological components that have a function in the natural or urban ecosystem. Memorial Parking Trees (MPTs) are a new variant of a nature-based solution composed of a bioswale and a street tree allocated in the road, occupying a space that is sub-utilised by parked cars. This infill green practice can maximise the use of street trees in secondary streets and have multiple benefits in our communities. Using GIS mapping and methodology can support implementation in vulnerable neighbourhoods. In this research, we based vulnerability assessments for London, Rio de Janeiro, and Los Angeles on the following three indicators: extreme temperature, air quality, and flood-prone areas. Evidence is emerging that disadvantaged populations may live at higher risks of exposure to environmental hazards. The income and healthcare accessibility of neighbourhoods are the two indicators that will help us target these communities for a better and faster decision-making process. The contrast between the results and the 15-min city concept supports our detecting and prioritising neighbourhoods for MPTS implementation, among other NbS solutions integrated into a more inclusive and sustainable urban design.

AB  - Objectives. The indoor environment has not been fully incorporated into the environmental justice dialogue. To inform strategies to reduce disparities, we developed a framework to identify the individual and place-based drivers of indoor environment quality. Methods. We reviewed empirical evidence of socioeconomic disparities in indoor exposures and key determinants of these exposures for air pollutants, lead, allergens, and semivolatile organic compounds. We also used an indoor air quality model applied to multifamily housing to illustrate how nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) vary as a function of factors known to be influenced by socioeconomic status. Results. Indoor concentrations of multiple pollutants are elevated in low-socioeconomic status households. Differences in these exposures are driven by the combined influences of indoor sources, outdoor sources, physical structures, and residential activity patterns. Simulation models confirmed indoor sources' importance in determining indoor NO(2) and PM(2.5) exposures and showed the influence of household-specific determinants. Conclusions. Both theoretical models and empirical evidence emphasized that disparities in indoor environmental exposure can be significant. Understanding key determinants of multiple indoor exposures can aid in developing policies to reduce these disparities. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:S238-S245. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300119)

AB  - In the United States of America, 2.2 million people are incarcerated in public and private facilities and over 700,000 are released yearly back to their home communities. Almost half are rearrested within a year. These problems have been excluded from mainstream sustainability narratives, despite their serious implications for sustainability. This paper addresses how the criminal justice, prison-industrial complex and foster care systems negatively impact these communities and families. To comprehend the system links, a sustainability lens is used to examine and address interlinking system impacts obstructing achievement of sustainability and the necessary community characteristics for building sustainable communities. Communities characterized by environmental degradation, economic despair and social dysfunction are trapped in unsustainability. Therefore, a system-of-communities framework is proposed which examines the circumstances that bring about prison cycling which devastates family and community cohesion and social networking, also negatively affecting the ability of other communities to become truly sustainable. We contend that a fully integrated social, economic and environmental approach to a major, complex, persistent problem as it relates to poor, marginalized communities faced with mass incarceration and recidivism can begin creating sustainable conditions. Further, we articulate ways sustainability narratives could be changed to engage with core challenges impeding these communities.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the calculation of personal air pollution exposure during trips made by active transportation using activity patterns without personal monitors. We calculate exposure as the inhaled dose of particulate matter 2.5 mu g or smaller. Two modes of active transportation are compared, and they include cycling and walking. Ambient conditions are calculated by combining mobile and stationary monitoring data in an artificial neural network space-time model. The model uses a land use regression framework and has a prediction accuracy of R-2 = 0.78. Exposure is calculated at 10 m or shorter intervals during the trips using inhalation rates associated with both modes. The trips are children's routes between home and school. The average dose during morning cycling trips was 2,17 mu g, during morning walking trips was 3.19 mu z, during afternoon cycling trips was 2.19 mu g and during afternoon walking trips was 3.23 mu g. The cycling trip dose was significantly lower than the walking trip dose. The air pollution exposure during walking or cycling trips could not be strongly predicted by either the school or household ambient conditions, either individually or in combination. Multiple linear regression models regressing both the household and school ambient conditions against the dose were only able to account for, at most, six percent of the variance in the exposure. This paper demonstrates that incorporating activity patterns when calculating exposure can improve the estimate of exposure compared to its calculation from ambient conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Natural resource managers of federal lands in the USA are often tasked with various forms of social and economic impact analysis. Federal agencies in the USA also have a mandate to analyze the potential environmental justice consequences of their activities. Relatively little is known about the environmental justice impacts of natural resource management in rural areas. Quantitative environmental justice analyses have so far heavily favored urban populations, in part owing to the difficulty of quantitative analysis of rural U.S. Census data. We developed a spatial method for integrating rural U.S. Census data with natural resource management data to address this gap. The method learns from methodological advances in overcoming the spatial limitations of Census data, but prioritizes a simple, efficient technique that is applicable not only for identifying potential environmental justice problems, but also to a potentially broad spectrum of natural resource management activities and spatial scales. We pilot test the method by analyzing the hazardous fuels reduction activities of two national forests in central Oregon, USA. We find no evidence of systematic environmental justice issues on either forest, but identify local areas that warrant additional investigation.

AB  - Moral foundations theory argues that moral reasoning is widely observed and fundamental to the legitimacy of relevant governance and policy interventions. A new analytical framework to examine and test how moral reasoning underpins and legitimizes governance and practice on adaptation to climate change risks is proposed. It develops a typology of eight categories of vulnerability-based and system-based moral reasoning that pertain to the dilemmas around adaptation and examines the prevalence of these moral categories in public discourse about specific adaptation issues. The framework is tested using data on climate change impact, adaptation, and societal responsibility, drawn from 14 focus groups comprising 148 participants across the UK. Participants consistently use moral reasoning to explain their views on climate adaptation; these include both vulnerability-based and system-based framings. These findings explain public responses to adaptation options and governance, and have implications for the direction of adaptation policy, including understanding which types of reasoning support politically legitimate interventions.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a well-studied environmental contaminant that has many negative health effects, especially for children. Both racial/ethnic and income disparities have been documented with respect to exposure to Pb in soils. The objectives of this study were to assess whether soil Pb concentrations in rural and urban areas of South Carolina USA, previously identified as having clusters of intellectual disabilities (ID) in children, were positively associated with populations of minority and low-income individuals and children (<= 6 years of age). Surface soils from two rural and two urban areas with identified clusters of ID were analyzed for Pb and concentrations were spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighted analysis. Population race/ethnicity and income-to-poverty ratio (ITPR) from United States Census 2000 block group data were aerially interpolated by block group within each area. Urban areas had significantly higher concentrations of Pb than rural areas. Significant positive associations between black, non-Hispanic Latino, individuals and children <= 6 years of age and mean estimated Pb concentrations were observed in both urban (r = 0.38, p = 0.0007) and rural (r = 0.53, p = 0.04) areas. Significant positive associations also were observed between individuals and children with an ITPR < 1.00 and Pb concentrations, though primarily in urban areas. Racial/ethnic minorities and low ITPR individuals, including children, may be at elevated risk for exposure to Pb in soils.

AB  - Non-human animals serve as sentinels for numerous issues affecting humans, including exposure to toxic heavy metals like lead. Lead plays a role in perpetuating cycles of poverty in low-income communities due to the inequitable distributions of indoor health risks from lower-quality housing and outdoor health risks from industry and polluters, compounded by inequitable distributions of heath care and education. In this pilot study, we explore the potential for studying lead in low-income populations by partnering with nonprofit veterinary outreach programs. We investigate the lead concentration in fur samples of 85 domestic cats (Felis catus) presented to a high-volume spay/neuter clinic and report a mean of 0.723 mu g of lead per gram of fur. This study reveals new information about lead exposure in cats in the USA, including that females had greater lead exposure than males, lead exposure increased with increasing amount of access to the outdoors, and lead exposure increased in cats with decreased body condition. We propose that pet, feral, and free-roaming cats presented to high-volume spay/neuter clinics could serve as a source of data about lead exposure in disadvantaged communities where these clinics already operate. Such a non-invasive surveillance system using inert, unobtrusively obtained samples could be deployed to detect highly exposed cats, prompting to follow up contact to a cat's caretakers to recommend seeking lead testing for themselves, their families, and their neighbors.

AB  - In the field of education, the concept of environment and sustainable education, and the use of some terms in this field, have developed since their beginning. The United Nations Agenda 2030 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) gives some clues about and opportunities to reflect upon which concepts and directions to take in the field of education towards promoting sustainability. This paper addresses the issue of the currently fragmented concepts in relation to environmental and sustainability education, and proposes a more comprehensive vision to better advance the path towards education and sustainability. This paper: (1) addresses the main historical milestones in the construction of the concept of environmental education and education for sustainable development; (2) analyzes the issue of which direction we should take within the framework of education in the era of the SDG Agenda 2030, taking emerging concepts such as learning for sustainability and sustainable education as references; and (3) proposes a holistic approach, described as education based on values. We conclude that a new integrative approach inspired by the education based on values concept, and integrating other concepts, will help to better conceptualize sustainability in education, as explained in the proposed model.

AB  - In the US, there are two primary environmental justice arenas. One is the activism, which draws on the skills of a wide range of community, academic and professional actors. This partnership draws on the Civil Rights Movement and organises through the internet. The other arena is the courtroom where environmental justice lawyers try to prove 'racial intent'. In the UK, there is an emerging call for environmental justice, but there is no comparable Civil Rights movement, just a well-organised if very unrepresentative environmental movement. However, in the UK, it is possible to discern at least three 'constructions' of environmental (in)justice: access to the countryside amongst those from ethnic minority groups; Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland's 'Pollution Injustice' campaign and Friends of the Earth Scotland's 'Campaign for Environmental Justice'. In the absence of a UK Civil Rights framework, there are indications that environmental and sustainability policy discourses are beginning to be re-framed around notions of justice, rights and equity. This is beginning to form a platform around which an embryonic environmental justice network is mobilising.

AB  - Many megacities in the Global South have developed without any systematically regularized modernization processes. Therefore, urbanization is accompanied by the inappropriate level of economic and social opportunities. This macro-structural constraint of urbanization contributes to frame the patterns and features of many location-based poverty and inequality. Dhaka followed the similar trajectory of development without creating substantial opportunities for its underclass, poor, and marginalized citizens. This unequal pattern of development influences the disproportionate environmental burdens of the marginalized people, who have little or no voice in the urban decision-making process. People experience unequal environmental inequality through their differential exposures to poor housing and/or living conditions, along with a lack of access to safe drinking water, sewage, adequate waste disposal systems, and so on. In this context of urban injustice, this environmental justice movement (EJM) is an evidence of demanding basic rights among the unprivileged citizens. To some extent, this is a response to the state's structural failure to provide urban environmental services (and social justice) to majority of its poor citizens. Evidence suggests that in context of fragile democracy, an EJM can generate opportunities for progressive urban politics as well as contribute to redistributive development opportunities for its poor and marginalized citizens. Most megacities in the Global South inherit urban governance from their colonial heritages, which were often criticized for its citizen-detached and top-down nature. Dhaka is not an exception in this context. In the present socio-political condition, even though the environmental movement is not very welcomed by the government - more particularly from the ruling political party - it can have tremendous implications on redistributive urban politics. This chapter focuses on Dhaka, which is currently one of the world's largest megacities in the Global South. This chapter highlights the local patterns and process of the unequal environmental burdens and the subsequent mobilization, demanding environmental justice in that process, as well as how that movement contributes to redistributive urban politics. The discussions of this chapter also have the implications on public policy discourse focusing on environmental rights, movements, and citizens-centered politics in the megacities of the Global South, with renewed relationships between the state and its citizens.

AB  - Nigeria's Land Use Act, promulgated in 1978, is perhaps the most controversial legislation in the country. The Act, originally promulgated as a decree and annexed to the country's constitution, was ostensibly made to nationalize landholding in the country. However, the peculiar impact of the Act on the inhabitants of the Niger Delta region that hosts upstream activities of the oil industry has led to assertions that the Act was made specifically to deprive those inhabitants of the right to participate actively in the oil industry. This article examines the impact of the Act on the right of inhabitants to access justice. It argues that the Act obstructs their rights to environmental justice and is a fundamental cause of the violent conflicts that pervade the region.

AB  - In their theory of social constructions of target populations, Schneider and Ingram argue that in degenerative policy systems policy designs and policy outcomes will disproportionately benefit those socially constructed as Advantaged and disproportionately harm those socially constructed as Deviants (1997). Though heretofore unexamined, an implication of Schneider and Ingram's model presented in Policy Design for Democracy (1997) is that the effects of policy with widespread outcomes should be rankable with respect to targets' social constructions, with Advantaged receiving less than Contenders who receive less than Dependents who receive less than Deviants of bad outcomes, and vice versa for good outcomes. Air pollution policies affect members of all four types of socially constructed groups, air pollution is well known to have social justice components, and air pollution is of particular interest because of its seeming universal application. So we performed an empirical, quantitative analysis of this rank-order hypothesis using data on air pollution in cities in California's Central Valley. The analysis finds evidence that social constructions of subpopulations in Central Valley cities help to explain the incidence of air pollution in the hypothesized rank-order way. The results provide new evidence of the value of the Schneider and Ingram (Policy design for democracy. University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, 1997) model in the area of outcomes, and new evidence regarding the social justice of seemingly universal policies.

AB  - In this paper, a model for the distribution of the Global Carbon Budget between the countries of the world is presented. The model is based on the criteria of equity while also taking into account the different historical responsibilities. The Global Carbon Budget corresponds to the quantity of carbon dioxide emissions that can still be released into the atmosphere while maintaining the increase in the average earth surface temperature below 2 A degrees C, and it is therefore compatible with the long-term objective defined in the Paris Agreement. The results of applying the model are shown both for the 15 emitters that currently top the ranking for world emissions as well as for the other countries, which are grouped together in three main groups: Other African, Other Latin American and Caribbean, and the Rest of the World. Mitigation curves compatible with the carbon budget allocated to the different countries are presented. When comparing each emitter's historical emissions for the period 1971-2010 with the proposed distribution for the period 2011-2050 obtained using the model, it can be seen that developed countries must face the future with a greatly reduced carbon budget, whereas developing countries can make use of a carbon budget that is higher than their cumulative historical emissions. Finally, there is a discussion about how a model with these characteristics could be useful when implementing the Paris Agreement.

There is growing ethnographic research into the ways people organize themselves and take action to protect their families and communities from toxins while demanding accountability from polluting industries and the state. When students encounter this literature in university curricula and when service-learning projects are part of coursework, the experiences they gain can inform their personal lives long after the semester ends. Five anthropologists share experiences teaching environmental justice ethnography courses. Their pedagogy addresses critical questions of ethical research and student positionality.

AB  - My color photography is a theater of psychological and physical transformations that reveal a luminescent excess. This excess combines both the civilized and the animalistic. For my photography series the Gestation Project I choreographed groups of ten to thirty naked pregnant women in San Francisco public spaces such as the zoo, hair salons, bookstores, nightclubs, boxing rings, and empty auditoriums. The women's pregnant bodies in community render the private explicitly public. While exploring the erasure of public spaces and our potential for reimagining our collective future, my article conjures the fertility of environmental justice within the commons. Juxtaposing bodies / body fragments with organic and synthetic materials and environments, I play with the illusory distinctions between "them" and "us." By recognizing how vulnerability can engender a humane global culture, ecofeminist strategies for living our principles without self-censorship, we can hold ourselves accountable as the fear of perceived difference becomes more urgent in our technoeuphoric media-saturated age. A cross-cultural, interspecies approach to climate-crisis mitigation integrates individual, community, and infrastructural change. From this visceral commitment, we can cultivate regenerative economic tools for biocultural transformation, integrating rather than competing with our natural environment or isolating ourselves from it.

AB  - In the Pacific Northwest, residents are mobilizing to prevent the coastal export of fossil fuels and protect unique ecosystems and place-based communities. This paper examines the diverse groups, largely from the Bellingham area, and how they succeeded in blocking construction of what was to be the largest coal-shipping port in North America, the Gateway Pacific Terminal (GPT). Tribes, environmental organizations, faith-based groups, and other citizen groups used a multitude of approaches to prevent development, both independently and in concert. This paper reviews the various ways in which the groups collaborated and supported one another to resist the neoliberalization of the coast and support local sovereignty, unique ecosystems, and place-based communities. Groups like Power Past Coal, Protect Whatcom, and Coal-Free Bellingham fought for important and protective changes and evidenced communitywide political support, but the sovereign rights of the Lummi Nation were the legal bar to constructing the coal terminal.

AB  - In the modern era, population and economic growth have accelerated urban sprawl in Saudi Arabia. This has placed tremendous pressure on the country's natural resources, including water, energy, and raw materials. Hence, the conventional means of expanding the built environment is no longer appropriate, as it has been found to be one of major causes of climate change and global warming. In the early 1970s, the principles of sustainable development emerged in developed countries, in order to remedy this global issue. During this period, Saudi Arabia experienced dramatic development in all of its industries, but the principles of sustainable development were, to a large degree, overlooked. However, there is now an ambitious Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia, one of the purposes of which is to promote greater sustainability in the country. This study seeks to assist decision makers to identify the challenges and opportunities of the current Saudi practices of city design, and their related operational aspects, and to enable the adoption of effective measures for implementing sustainable development principles. Employing an ethnographic research methodology, the fieldwork concerned includes a public perception survey, followed by a site inspection, in order to develop an insider's view of the current level of sustainable practice in the city of Najran. A public survey is distributed to well-informed citizens, with the goal of obtaining their insights, and to assess their willingness to embrace green city practices. This is followed by a site inspection visit that seeks to obtain in-depth information regarding site design and operational practices. A checklist of sustainable criteria is adapted from well-known systems. The major outcomes of the study reveal that many challenges are encountered the application of green city principles. The paper offers effective approaches and strategic actions for overcoming these challenges.

AB  - Local governments around the world are formulating different ways to address climate change. However, the compounding and overlapping vulnerabilities of historically marginalized residents are commonly tackled in a fragmented manner by conventional adaptation approaches, even when justice is presented as an overarching goal of these plans. In response, we propose an intersectional pivot in climate adaptation research and practice to analyze the interconnected forms of social-environmental injustices that drive vulnerabilities in cities, paving the way for more concrete and integrated strategies of just urban adaptation and transformation. This paper brings together narrative and analytical review methodologies to inform a new conceptual framework that highlights the need to (1) tackle underlying reinforcers of racial and gender inequalities; (2) redress drivers of differential vulnerabilities; (3) take politics and ethics of care seriously; (4) adopt place-based and place-making approaches; and (5) promote cross-identity forms of activism and community resilience building. We illustrate the framework with examples of ongoing projects in Barcelona, Spain, which is an early adopter of intersectional thinking and justice-driven principles in climate action. Although many initiatives are in a pilot phase and do not all exclusively focus on climate adaptation, experiences from Barcelona do provide illustrative directionality for innovative and integrated approaches that can address multiple and intersecting social-environmental inequities.

AB  - Marine sacrificial zones are planned areas dedicated to the toxic violence of carbo-chemical port development around the world. In the marine environment in Chile, repeated fisher led new social movements have been raised regarding the need to create laws controlling marine pollution from combined coal power station/extraction complexes and realise participatory blue epistemic justice. A series of case studies from across Chile demonstrate the importance of integrating fisher observations of contamination. Interviews and participatory GIS shows how fisher communities LEK observations can be integrated from Quintero, Mejillones and Coronel, which help generalise about the participatory solutions to the impacts of other coastal industrial complexes. The social protests of 2020-2021 opened up a new space for environmental rights through a successful campaign for a new Chilean constitution, the importance of which is shown by the politization of the violence of these sacrificial zones locally and globally. Differently to the creation of the constitution by the neoliberal dictatorship, the participatory space afforded by a people's constitution through a plebiscite means that environmental justice concerns can be implemented in concrete form.

AB  - In recent years, "urban greening" has become a new keyword in urban policy and practice, used to describe a proliferation of urban quality of life and environmental sustainability initiatives including street trees, public parks, greenways, farmers' markets, green roofs, and LEED certification in design. The emerging critical literature on urban greening has highlighted important ways green's social and economic added value affects the political economy of contemporary greening and produces inequalities in access to real or perceived environmental goods. However, such research has only infrequently asked why and under what conditions naturalized understandings of green as "good" make it possible for such initiatives to add value in the first place. As a result, it offers only partial explanations of why green has the effects it has-for instance, increasing property values-and only very rarely questions the fundamental "good" of nature itself. I argue that integrating insights on green's naturalized social and economic value from a growing body of social-theoretical work across geography and the social sciences can complement political economic explanations for greening and provide new vantage points for critique.

AB  - In recent years, local activists in the Global North and South have been organizing to improve degraded and abandoned spaces in marginalized neighborhoods by creating parks, playgrounds, urban farms, or community gardens. This paper integrates existing knowledge on urban place attachment and sense of community with scholarship on environmental justice in order to understand the role of place attachment in environmental mobilization in distressed neighborhoods across political systems and urbanization contexts. It examines the different forms of connections that activists develop and express toward neighborhoods with long-time substandard environmental conditions and how their experience of the neighborhood shapes their engagement in environmental revitalization projects. This comparison of three neighborhoods in Barcelona, Boston, and Havana shows that activists in all three places intend for their environmental endeavors to express grief at the loss of community, fears of erasure, and emotional connection and feelings of responsibility to place. To address environmental trauma, they aim to construct nurturing, soothing, safe havens, recreate rootedness, and remake place for residents. De Trauma Ambiental a Refugio Seguro: Apego al Lugar y Transformacion Espacial en Tres Barrios Marginales en Barcelona, Boston y La Habana(Isabelle Anguelovski) Resumen En anos recientes, activistas locales en el norte y sur globales se han ido organizando para mejorar espacios degradados y abandonados en barrios marginales creando parques, zonas recreativas, granjas urbanas o parques comunales. Este articulo integra el conocimiento existente sobre apego al lugar y sentido de comunidad con trabajo academico sobre justicia ambiental para entender el rol del apego al lugar en la movilizacion ambiental en barrios con esta problematica a traves de sistemas politicos y contextos de urbanizacion. Se examina las formas distintas de conexion que los activistas desarrollan y expresan hacia barrios con condiciones ambientales desfavorables de larga data y en como sus experiencias del barrio moldean su compromiso con proyectos de rehabilitacion ambiental. Esta comparacion de tres barrios en Barcelona, Boston y La Habana muestra que los activistas en estos tres lugares buscan, a traves de sus actividades ambientales, expresar nostalgia por la perdida de la comunidad. Para enfrentar el trauma ambiental, ellos buscan construir refugios seguros educativos y calmantes que buscan recrear el enraizamiento y transformar los lugares para los residentes.

AB  - Over the past two decades community activists in distressed urban neighborhoods have been organizing to improve environmental quality and livability for residents through parks, playgrounds, gardens, farms, or sports facilities, and this across political systems and contexts of urbanization. To date, however, limited research has been conducted on the development and intricacies of neighborhood activism for long-term environmental justice in marginalized neighborhoods, and little work has been done in a comparative manner and through a place-based approach. Through three historically marginalized neighborhoods in Boston, Barcelona, and Havana, I analyze how internal dynamics and external contexts shape community organization towards improved environmental quality and livability, and how mobilization unfolds over time and space. Findings reveal that activists tend to resort to similar tactical choices to achieve their objectives, including broad and flexible coalitions, and what I call bottom-to-bottom networks encompassing three forms of activism: street activism, technical activism, and funder activism.

AB  - Local activists engaged in contemporary environmental justice struggles not only fight against traditional forms of hazardous locally unwanted land uses (LULUs), they also organize to make their neighborhoods livable and green. However, urban environmental justice activism is at a crossroads: as marginalized neighborhoods become revitalized, outside investors start to value them again and they themselves invest in green amenities. Yet vulnerable residents are now raising concerns about the risk of displacement from their neighborhoods in consequence of environmental gentrification processes. Their fear is linked to environmental amenities such as new parks or remodeled waterfronts, as well as (most recently) healthy food stores. Using the case of a conflict around a new Whole Foods supermarket in Boston, MA, I examine how food venues and stores labeled as healthy and natural can create socio-spatial inequality together with privilege, exclusion and displacement in racially diverse neighborhoods. I analyze how high-end supermarket chains target inner-city neighborhoods for their growth and profit potential, and demonstrate that their arrival contributes to what I call supermarket greenlining'. This greenlining illustrates the process of food gentrification, and the manipulation of health and sustainability discourses about food by healthy and natural food investors and their supporters. The opening of high-end supermarkets thus converts such stores into new LULUs for historically marginalized groups.

AB  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been at the forefront of securing environmental justice for the people of Nigeria's Niger Delta suffering the effects of pollution arising from petroleum exploitation. Standing constraints have, however, limited NGOs' abilities to access the courts to prevent or remedy pollution. This article analyses the recent decision of Nigeria's Supreme Court in Center for Oil Pollution Watch v Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). It finds that environmental NGOs, previously unable to institute action under existing public interest litigation procedures, can now institute action in their own rights to prevent or remedy environmental pollution in Nigeria.

AB  - Information-based regulations (IBRs) are founded on the theoretical premise that public participation in accomplishing policy goals is empowered by open access to information. Since its inception in 1988, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) has provided the framework and regulatory impetus for the compilation and distribution of data on toxic releases associated with industrial development, following the tenets of IBR. As TRI emissions are reputed to disproportionately affect low-income communities, we investigated how demographic characteristics are related to change in TRI emissions and toxicity risks between 1989 and 2002, and we sought to identify factors that predict these changes. We used local indicators of spatial association (LISA) maps and spatial regression techniques to study risk disparity in the Los Angeles urban area. We also surveyed 203 individuals in eight communities in the same region to measure the levels of awareness of TRI, attitudes towards air pollution, and general environmental risk. We discovered, through spatial lag models, that changes in gross and toxic emissions are related to community ethnic composition, poverty level, home ownership, and base 1989 emissions (R-square = 0.034-0.083). We generated a structural equation model to explain the determinants of social empowerment to act on the basis of environmental information. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis (HCFA) supports the theoretical model that individual empowerment is predicted by risk perception, worry, and awareness (Chi-square = 63.315, p = 0.022, df = 42). This study provides strong evidence that spatiotemporal changes in regional-scale environmental risks are influenced by individual-scale empowerment mediated by IBRs.

AB  - In recent decades there have been dramatic declines in industrial air toxins. However, there has yet to be a national study investigating if the drop has mitigated the unequal exposure to industrial toxins by race and social class. This paper addresses this by developing a unique dataset of air pollution exposure estimates, by aggregating the annual fall-out location of 415 air toxins, from 17,604 facilities, for the years 1995 to 2004 up to census block groups (N = 216,159/year). These annual estimates of exposure were matched with census data to calculate trends in exposure for different racial and socioeconomic groups. Results show that exposure to air toxins has decreased for everyone, but African-Americans are consistently more exposed than Whites and Hispanics and socioeconomic status is not as protective for African-Americans. These results by race were further explored using spatially specified multilevel models which examine trends over time and across institutional boundaries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Engaging citizens and communities is considered a central element and a good practice in coastal management. However, individuals still demonstrate a general disengagement with coastal risks. To understand the factors that underlie the citizens' engagement in coastal risks processes and to implement evidence-based strategies aimed at enhancing public participation in coastal management, is pivotal to the success of coastal adaptation. Goals: Therefore, this study sought to develop and validate an assessment tool aiming at measuring individuals' engagement in coastal adaptation processes and their underlying factors. Methods: A cross-sectional and 2-phase research was implemented to analyze the psychometric properties of the CoastADAPT scale. The Phase 1 study (N = 491) determined the CoastADAPT scale's factorial structure, through Exploratory Factor Analysis; its reliability, through internal consistency and test-retest reliability; and construct validity, through convergent and divergent validity. The Phase 2 study (N = 207) confirmed the CoastADAPT scale's factorial structure, through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results: Analyses indicated that the CoastADAPT scale showed good psychometric properties and a 3-factor structure consisting of the following domains: Experiential Processing (Affective component), Risk Awareness (Cognitive component) and Environmental Justice (Social value orientation component). Conclusions: The CoastADAPT scale is a reliable and valid measure of citizens' engagement in coastal risk adaptation processes. It may be a useful tool to facilitate the development of strategies to overcome individuals' disengagement with coastal management and to provide a deeper understanding of the predictors of individuals' engagement in coastal risk processes.

AB  - In a recent article, Bernice Lott suggests that modern psychology has failed to investigate in any systematic fashion existing beliefs and attitudes surrounding socialism. While there is much to commend in Lott's analysis, her support for a social democratic version of socialism tends to obscure the more revolutionary potentials of socialist practice. To adequately address social and environmental justice, I argue that the trajectory of psychological research and practice must be brought into alignment with a socialism that is committed to interrogating and ultimately destabilizing the capitalist mode of production.

AB  - Measures of corporate environmental justice performance can be a valuable tool in efforts to promote corporate social responsibility and to document systematic patterns of environmental injustice. This paper develops such a measure based on the extent to which toxic air emissions from industrial facilities disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities and those on low incomes. Applying the measure to 100 major corporate air polluters in the United States, we find wide variation in the extent of disproportional exposures. In 54 cases, minorities, who represent 31.8% of the US population, bear excess burden; in 15 of these cases, the minority share exceeds half of the total human health impacts from the firm's industrial air pollution. In 66 cases, poor people, who represent 12.8% of the US population, bear excess burden. Copyright c 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Objectives. The study examines spatial variation in exposure to toxic air pollution from industrial facilities in urban areas of the United States in relation to the local distribution of the pollution burden. Methods. We conducted between-and within-city analysis of geographic microdata from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators project and data from the 2000 U. S. Census. Results. Average exposure in an urban area is positively correlated with the extent of racial and ethnic disparity in the distribution of the exposure burden. Average exposures also tend to be higher for all population subgroups, including whites, in urban areas with higher minority pollution-exposure discrepancies. Conclusions. The correlations could arise from causal linkages in either or both directions: the ability to displace pollution onto minorities may lower the effective cost of pollution for industrial firms; and higher average pollution burdens may induce whites to invest more political capital in efforts to influence firms' siting decisions. The analysis suggests that improvement in environmental justice could benefit not only minorities but also whites.

AB  - Polluting facilities and hazardous sites are often concentrated in low-income communities of color already facing additional stressors to their health. The influence of socioeconomic status is not considered in traditional models of risk assessment. We describe a pilot study of a screening method that considers both pollution burden and population characteristics in assessing the potential for cumulative impacts. The goal is to identify communities that warrant further attention and to thereby provide actionable guidance to decision-and policy-makers in achieving environmental justice. The method uses indicators related to five components to develop a relative cumulative impact score for use in comparing communities: exposures, public health effects, environmental effects, sensitive populations and socioeconomic factors. Here, we describe several methodological considerations in combining disparate data sources and report on the results of sensitivity analyses meant to guide future improvements in cumulative impact assessments. We discuss criteria for the selection of appropriate indicators, correlations between them, and consider data quality and the influence of choices regarding model structure. We conclude that the results of this model are largely robust to changes in model structure.

AB  - Many people now agree that the global climate is changing and that human activities are a contributing factor, but disagree about who is responsible and what should be done. Some citizens are turning to the courts to resolve climate-related disputes. Climate litigation cases help to illuminate many of the legal, ethical, scientific, economic, social, and other complexities of climate change. These cases will decide rights and responsibilities, how uncertainties should be managed, and who should make societal decisions about climate change. The cases tell stories about climate causes and impacts, and identify potential winners and losers of both climate change and various policy alternatives. Climate litigation allows examination of ethical and social issues within the factual context of a legal case. These cases also illuminate the role of American courts in educating the public, stimulating debate, and setting or clarifying climate policy.

AB  - Palm oil is an important commodity contributing to livelihoods of many communities, GDP of governments and the achievement of several sustainable development goals (SDG) including no poverty, zero hunger, and decent work and economic growth. However, its cultivation and continuous expansion due to high and increasing demand has led to many negative effects and subsequent calls to make production sustainable. To this end, information is needed to understand the negative and positive impacts on both the environment and human wellbeing to respond appropriately. Sustainability in palm oil trade entails having a global supply chain based on environmentally friendly and socially acceptable production and sourcing. Much has been done in understanding and responding to impacts on the environment but not so much on social impacts partly due to a lack of information. The direct (socio-economic) and indirect (through ecosystem services) impacts of palm oil trade were reviewed using peer-reviewed literature and the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJA). Our results show that most of the 57 case studies were conducted in Indonesia and Malaysia where 85% of global production of palm oil occurs. The results show both negative (109) and positive (99) direct impacts on humans. Indirect impacts through ecosystems services were predominantly negative (116) as were the direct negative impacts. The most frequently studied direct negative impacts were conflicts (25%), housing conditions (18%) and land grabbing (16%) while the most frequently studied direct positive impacts were income generation (33%) and employment (19%). Ongoing initiatives to make the palm oil sector sustainable such as the RSPO are focused on the environment but need to pay more attention to (related) social impacts. To make palm oil production sustainable and to meet SDGs such as ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing as well as responsible consumption and production, negative social impacts of palm oil trade need to be addressed.

This study evaluates associations between policy-relevant plan attributes, sociodemographic factors, and PA in North Carolina. Results suggest that land use plans that included non-automobile transportation improvements and more comprehensive policies to guide development were positively associated with both leisure and transportation-related PA. However, residents of counties with lower-income levels and higher proportions of non-white residents were less likely to have attributes supportive of PA included in their plans. Implications for transdisciplinary collaboration with respect to reducing health disparities are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, environmental justice is considered from an interdisciplinary and integrative perspective that combines theories and studies in geography, environmental policy and planning with a justice psychology approach. This opens up an integrated view, which takes into account both societal and individual aspects of the perception and evaluation of environmental justice. In this sense, notions of environmental justice(s) are seen as the result of discursive processes, historical contexts and a social localization and standardization that is shaped by both cognitive evaluation processes and emotions. Additionally, environmental justice in participation processes is considered in the context of environmental and sustainability policy and its implementation, first summarising the points of criticism of participation processes and then discussing environmental justice as an aspect of participation practice. From this, some key points for a more justice-sensitive design of participation processes in the context of environmental and sustainability policies and programmes (e.g. adaptation to climate change, urban planning, energy system transformation) are derived. This interdisciplinary analysis shows that there is not 'one' environmental justice, but a multitude of ideas and evaluations based on different concepts and perceptions.

AB  - Past environmental justice (EJ) research concludes that exposure to environmental hazards is greater in minority communities than in majority communities. Most EJ studies that suggest disproportionate environmental hazards exposure in predominantly minority communities are based upon United States Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory (USEPA TRI) data, which does not take into account multitudes of Small Quantity Generators (SQGs) whose combined capacity for emissions is more than what a TRI facility emits. Furthermore TRI facility emissions are contained and constrained by emission capture devices such as after burners, bag house filters, etc and permit conditions while Small Quantity Generators (SQGs) have no such legal requirements. This study looks into the air contaminants that are being monitored as a part of the regulatory requirement to what is actually being emitted. In the Maricopa County Monitoring District, the air contaminants monitored are typically the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)-criteria pollutants; however what is being emitted by the different entities are a lot more than just the NAAQS criteria pollutants. At the present time what is being monitored is inadequate and incomplete, moreover the myriad of chemicals emitted unfettered has individual and synergistic community-wide health effects that is currently un-monitored and unknown. This research paper is important in two fundamental ways, one, it places emphasis on the problem of environmental justice in the context of society of today. Second, it explores the possibility of setting standards in such a way that an individual community can decide how much contaminant emissions (air) they are willing to accept in terms of chemicals and quantities.

AB  - Parallel global rise in pit-latrine sanitation and groundwater-supply provision is of concern due to the frequent spatial proximity of these activities. Study of such an area in Malawi has allowed understanding of risks posed to groundwater from the recent implementation of a typical developing-country pit-latrine sanitation policy to be gained. This has assisted the development of a risk-assessment framework approach pragmatic to regulatory-practitioner management of this issue. The framework involves water-supply and pit-latrine mapping, monitoring of key groundwater contamination indicators and surveys of possible environmental site-condition factors and culminates in an integrated statistical evaluation of these datasets to identify the significant factors controlling risks posed. Our approach usefully establishes groundwater-quality baseline conditions of a potentially emergent issue for the study area. Such baselines are foundational to future trend discernment and contaminant natural attenuation verification critical to policies globally. Attribution of borehole contamination to pitlatrine loading should involve, as illustrated, the use of the range of contamination (chemical, microbiological) tracers available recognising none are ideal and several radial and capture-zone metrics that together may provide a weight of evidence. Elevated, albeit low-concentration, nitrate correlated with some radial metrics and was tentatively suggestive of emerging latrine influences. Longer termmonitoring is, however, necessary to verify that the commonly observed latrine-borehole separation distances (29-58 m), alongside statutory guidelines, do not constitute significant risk. Borehole contamination was limited and correlationwith various environmental-site condition factors also limited. This was potentially ascribed to effectiveness of attenuation to date, monitoring of an emergent problem yet to manifest, or else contamination from other sources. High borehole usage and protective wall absence correlated with observed microbiological contamination incidence, but could relate to increased human/animal activity close to these poorly protected boreholes. Additional to factors assessed, a groundwater-vulnerability factor is recommended that critically relies upon improved proactive securing of underpinning data during borehole/latrine installations. On-going concerns are wide ranging, including poorly constrained pit-latrine input, difficulties in assessing in-situ plume natural attenuation and possible disposal of used motor oils to latrines.

AB  - Many empirical environmental justice ( EJ) studies lack a systematic framework in which to undertake research and interpret results. This paper characterizes the conventional EJ study and examines how results can be influenced by the choice of the spatial scale and scope of analysis. After thoroughly reviewing a sample of prominent EJ studies, a conventional EJ study was performed for ( Superfund) National Priorities List sites at multiple scales and scopes. It was found that evidence of environmental injustice could be sensitive to scale and scope chosen, which partly explains the observed inconsistency in the empirical literature. Implications for interpreting existing EJ research and conducting future EJ research are discussed.

AB  - In the U.S., approximately 9.3 million lead service lines (LSLs) account for most lead contamination of drinking water. As the commitment to replace LSLs with safer materials grows, empirical evidence is needed to understand which households are benefitting most from current replacement practices. This exploratory study analyzes factors predictive of whether an LSL was replaced fully (from water main to premise) or partially (only the portion on public property). Conventional ordinary least squares, negative binomial, and geographically weighted regression models are used to test the hypothesis that full lead service line replacements (LSLRs) were less common in lower-income, higher-minority neighborhoods under a cost-sharing program design in Washington, D.C. between 2009 and 2018. The study finds supportive evidence that household income is a major predictor of full replacement prevalence, with race also showing significance in some analyses. These findings highlight the need for further research into patterns of full versus partial LSLR across the U.S. and may inform future decisions about LSLR policy and program design.

AB  - In the light of social and political currents calling for increased accountability for public processes and discussions between federal officials about the performance of the public involvement process, this paper examines public involvement in transportation and develops frameworks for identifying suitable approaches and evaluating outcomes. The aims of this paper are to (a) foster analytic, evidence-driven discussion between public involvement professionals, project managers, consultants, and other members of the transportation community about process quality metrics and (b) propose strategies for increasing performance of such processes by developing multidimensional process evaluation frameworks for public involvement design and outcomes. A significant Anistein gap is identified in the quality of public involvement in transportation. A critical overview of current practice that draws on the literature on public involvement and participation is presented. Using a soft systems approach, the authors frame participation methods in distributive domain and define outcome performance criteria. The authors examine the literature on process performance in environmental management and other participation research and propose four process performance metrics for public involvement: quality, inclusion, clarity, and efficiency. Objective data from projects in structured public involvement are presented. These data illustrate that processes that satisfy these metrics will help to close the Arnstein gap by identifying stronger methodologies for involving large groups of citizens with diverse values, delivering objectively high stakeholder-evaluated process quality, and integrating these valuations into effective decision support systems for project managers and engineers. However, this improvement will require a philosophical shift to a higher level on the Arnstein ladder.

AB  - Mexico's recent energy reform portends a new era of private engagement in the oil and gas sectors. According to government officials and industry leaders, the opening of energy reserves for private development will spur economic growth and establish the country as a leader in the energy arena. This article examines whether the reforms could also lead to community-led growth in the renewable energy sector, specifically in Oaxaca, Mexico, which has been identified as one of the windiest places in the world and is currently already the site of extensive wind energy development. Building on my prior work exploring the impact of renewable energy development on indigenous communities in Oaxaca, this article presents a framework to explore the aspects of the energy reform that could lead to greater participation in renewable energy development by communities who have historically disproportionately borne the brunt of the country's energy development in the country. This article utilizes the theory of energy justice, which incorporates principles of environmental justice and climate justice as well as energy democracy, to consider whether opening the Mexican energy market to private participation and increased competition in the electricity sector could render communities more resilient in the face of climate change and better able to meet their energy needs.

AB  - National polls reveal stark and growing political divisions on the issue of climate change within the United States. However, few studies have explored whether these trends generalize to communities of color, who experience disproportionate environmental risks. Synthesizing over a decade of nationally representative survey data (2008-2019; N = 23,707), we conducted a conceptual replication and extension of previous research on the "racial/ethnic gap" in U.S. climate change opinion. Consistent with prior work, we find that African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos show less political polarization-including both weaker ideological and partisan divides-across a diverse range of belief, risk perception, and policy-support measures. Further, we find that this differential polarization has remained largely stable over time and is robust to effects of other sociodemographic variables, such as education and income. Notably, across the political spectrum, people of color were more likely to report that global warming poses a danger to themselves. Racial/ethnic differences were generally more pronounced among the political Right than the political Left, are generally larger for beliefs and risk perceptions (vs. policy support) and are only partially accounted for by racial/ethnic differences in ideology or party sorting. These results offer comprehensive evidence that climate change is less polarized among people of color in the U.S. Increasing diversity in the environmental sector and conducting more research on socio-cultural differences in environmental responses (including other racial/ethnic groups and indigenous populations) is important to promoting equity in decision-making, addressing environmental disparities, and potentially bridging growing political divides in the U.S.

AB  - In the current international system, sovereign states hold extensive rights over the natural resources in their territories. How are sovereign rights in natural resources justified? What are the implications of these rights for the demands of climate justice, which pertain to the use and management of natural resourcesfor example, rainforests? This article reviews five theories of territorial rights, in contemporary political and legal philosophy, and the justifications that they provide for territorial jurisdiction over natural resources. It is argued that insofar as the philosophical-normative perspectives justify sovereigns' jurisdiction over natural resources within their borders, they also give rise to limits on the legitimate and permissible exercise of the jurisdictional prerogative. This theoretical proposition is then illustrated in the case of international climate-justice obligations of rain-forest-rich countries.

AB  - Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is vital to the future of Malawi and motivates this study's provision of the first stable isotope baseline characterization of the Shire River Basin (SRB). The SRB drains much of Southern Malawi and receives the sole outflow of Lake Malawi whose catchment extends over much of Central and Northern Malawi (and Tanzania and Mozambique). Stable isotope (283) and hydrochemical (150) samples were collected in 2017-2018 and analysed at Malawi's recently commissioned National Isotopes Laboratory. Distinct surface water dry-season isotope enrichment and wet-season depletion are shown with minor retention of enriched signatures ascribed to Lake Malawi influences. Isotopic signatures corroborate that wet-season river flows mostly arise from local precipitation, with dry-season flows supported by increased groundwater contributions. Groundwater signatures follow a local meteoric water line of limited spread suggesting recharge by local precipitation predominantly during the peak months of the wet-season. Relatively few dry-season groundwater samples displayed evaporative enrichment, although isotopic seasonality was more pronounced in the lowlands compared to uplands ascribed to amplified climatic effects. These signatures serve as isotopic diagnostic tools that valuably informed a basin conceptual model build and, going forward, may inform key identified Malawian IWRM concerns. The isotopic baseline establishes a benchmark against which future influences from land use, climate change and water mixing often inherent to IWRM schemes may be forensically assessed. It thereby enables both source-water protection and achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6.

AB  - Over three decades, environmental justice scholarship has examined justice movements through diverse perspectives shaped by their research traditions and disciplinary boundaries. This article distills three themes of justice from these research traditions in order to propose a four-dimensional environmental justice model. The proposed model includes four justice-seeking strategiescultural justice, material justice, processual justice, and political justicethat movement groups adopt to mobilize their claims. I apply this model to the study of an environmental movement in Land Between the Rivers, Kentucky. Research findings from the case study concludes that movement strategies are plural and changeable and that justice is best conceived as a repertoire of justice-seeking strategies that are influenced by political alliances, economic preconditions, and cultural contexts.

AB  - Policymakers face a dilemma in highly diverse societies with many ecosystems: how to implement national policies that allow for serious consideration of these differences. In connection with the attempts to advance towards sustainability in forest systems, Mexico is confronting this problem with difficulty. Although it has committed to implementing policies consistent with REDD+, there are competing pressures for supporting commercial development of plantations on the one hand, and community based management systems that involve multiple objectives in complex proposals on the other. We trace the implications for environmental justice of the choices being made by indigenous communities in the highlands of Oaxaca for promoting sustainable programmes that assure adequate living standards and environmental protection. The analysis shows that this alternative approach offers an interesting set of outcomes that the standard paradigm of the green economy has difficulty achieving.

AB  - Lead is a toxic heavy metal that is associated with lowered intelligence quotient scores, behavioural problems, and physical health impairments in children. Current consensus is that there is no safe level of child lead exposure and that even low doses of lead can have negative effects. Several reviews conducted in South Africa have revealed the sources and potential risk factors associated with child lead poisoning. However, no South African reviews have focused on the quality of studies focusing on child lead poisoning and psychological outcomes (intelligence, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes). This study reviews epidemiological studies of child lead poisoning with a particular focus on the association between child lead poisoning and psychological outcomes in South Africa over a 30-year time span (1986-2016). The review pays particular attention to study design, measurement, sampling, and confounding variables. Nine studies that measured child lead poisoning were included in the review. Just two of the nine studies (one cross-sectional and one follow-up) measured psychological outcomes and neither study adequately adjusted for confounding. In all studies, sampling was purposive and lead exposure indicators were suited to short-term acute exposure. There is, therefore, insufficient evidence to determine the magnitude of the association between child lead poisoning and psychological outcomes in South Africa. More rigorous epidemiological studies are needed to strengthen the evidence base. The article also highlights opportunities for psychological research in intervention studies and studies that are framed by an environmental justice agenda.

AB  - Peri-urban spaces are frontiers of privatisation where inequalities in access to land and water evolve. In this article, we analyse a particular mode of land and water privatisation in peri-urban spaces of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. We illustrate that in the domain of land, traditional authorities tend to act as private owners rather than custodians of customary land, while in the domain of water, multiple private water providers have emerged next to the official water utility. A combined reading and analysis of these processes as forms of de facto privatisation contributes to understanding the similarities in the control over and access to land and water in peri-urban spaces. We show that in the de facto privatised control context of the peri-urban GAMA, access gained to land and water has to be actively maintained. Both gaining and maintaining access exhibit socio-economic inequalities and this is particularly so in the case of maintaining access. The article is a call for a better connection between land and water studies in order to deepen understanding of the processes at play in peri-urban spaces.

AB  - Many U.S. states have taken significant action on climate change in recent years, demonstrating their commitment despite federal policy gridlock and rollbacks. Yet, there is still much we do not know about the agents, discourses, and strategies of those seeking to delay or obstruct state-level climate action. We first ask, what are the obstacles to strong and effective climate policy within U.S. states? We review the political structures and interest groups that slow action, and we examine emerging tensions between climate justice and the technocratic and/or market-oriented approaches traditionally taken by many mainstream environmental groups. Second, what are potential solutions for overcoming these obstacles? We suggest strategies for overcoming opposition to climate action that may advance more effective and inclusive state policy, focusing on political strategies, media framing, collaboration, and leveraging the efforts of ambitious local governments.

AB  - Naphthalene is a ubiquitous pollutant, and very high concentrations are sometimes encountered indoors when this chemical is used as a pest repellent or deodorant. This study describes the distribution and sources of vapor-phase naphthalene concentrations in four communities in southeast Michigan, USA. Outdoors, naphthalene was measured in the communities and at a near-road site. Indoors, naphthalene levels were characterized in 288 suburban and urban homes. The median outdoor concentration was 0.15 mu g/m3, and a modest contribution from rush-hour traffic was noted. The median indoor long-term concentration was 0.89 mu g/m3, but concentrations were extremely skewed and 14% of homes exceeded 3 mu g/m3, the chronic reference concentration for non-cancer effects, 8% exceeded 10 mu g/m3, and levels reached 200 mu g/m3. The typical excess individual lifetime cancer risk was about 10-4 and reached 10-2 in some homes. Important sources include naphthalenes use as a pest repellent and deodorant, migration from attached garages and, to lesser extents, cigarette smoke and vehicle emissions. Excessive use as a repellent caused the highest concentrations. Naphthalene presents high risks in a subset of homes, and policies and actions to reduce exposures, for example, sales bans or restrictions, improved labeling, and consumer education, should be considered. Practical Implications Long-term average concentrations of naphthalene in most homes fell into the 0.21.7 mu g/m3 range reported as representative in earlier studies. The highly skewed distribution of concentrations results in a subset of homes with elevated concentrations and health risks that greatly exceed US EPA and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The most important indoor source is the use of naphthalene as a pest repellant or deodorant; secondary sources include presence of an attached garage, cigarette smoking, and outdoor sources. House-to-house variation was large, reflecting differences among the residences and naphthalene use practices. Stronger policies and educational efforts are needed to eliminate or modify indoor usage practices of this chemical.

AB  - In spite of the 2015 Paris Agreement requiring all Parties, irrespective of their development status, to take climate action, the operationalization of climate justice in global climate governance and policy has been fraught. Other avenues, such as litigation, have emerged as a policy tool for seeking redress for past and prospective harm resulting from climate change. The academic and policy literatures have, however, had limited engagement with the role of rights-based litigation in climate governance since Paris. We help fill this gap by developing the four-component OATH (Objective, Associated climate impact, Type of justice, Harm) framework and applying it to three high-profile climate litigation cases - Urgenda v. The Netherlands, Juliana v. United States, and Demanda v. Minambiente. Our analysis confirms that the progress and achievements of these cases demonstrate the potential of climate litigation to force greater national and sub-national government action on climate change. However, litigation better serves some types of justice (e.g. intergenerational) than others (e.g. distributive). Therefore, as its ambition and progress continue to grow, litigation must be combined with other forms of climate action to better advance justice in a post-Paris world. Key policy insights International climate agreements and obligations are important to the success of climate litigation. Climate litigation can be used to hold countries accountable to the commitments they communicate in their NDCs and other policy instruments, but it should be used as one of several policy tools. Litigation pertaining to climate adaptation should and can be expanded to support and advance justice. Distributive justice cannot be sufficiently advanced through domestic climate litigation so it must be further incorporated into international climate agreements and obligations. The universal right to a clean environment, its definition and criteria should be (a) established in international environmental agreements and obligations, and (b) aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Narrative research is in vogue in the social sciences. A current debate in philosophy of economics concerns the role of storytelling in economic modelling, and a growing research programme in policy studies investigates the influence of stories on policy outcomes. These two streams of research have yet to be connected in an investigation of how scientific models, in addition to delivering numerical results, also shape policy through the stories that are told with them. This article addresses that gap, arguing that stories produced with integrated assessment models of global climate change are particular types of policy narratives. An analytical framework for studying their composition and content is suggested. The narrative analysis of modelled stories illuminates some of the models' underpinning values and beliefs. These values and beliefs influence the normative, policy-relevant conclusions generated with the models. For illustration, the framework is applied to the analysis of two variations of the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy model that are used to tell different stories about climate justice and climate policy.Key policy insights IAMs consist of mathematical structures and the stories told by manipulating these structures.There is an intricate but not fully deterministic relationship between IAM structures and stories.Examining both these elements contributes to our understanding of the models' role in climate governance.Appreciation of modelled stories may facilitate more effective use of IAMs in the policy process.

AB  - In this article, we review an array of positions in the contemporary literature that concern the moral reasons for vegan consumerism. We situate veganism within the broader field of ethical consumerism, present a variety of motivations and justifications for veganism, and discuss criticisms of vegan consumerism. The arguments presented in the article ultimately pertain to the question of whether concerns for animals, human rights, or climate justice entail strong moral reasons to adopt a vegan lifestyle. Additionally, we address issues of particular relevance for political philosophy, such as whether organized vegan consumer campaigns are a politically legitimate means to strive for structural change. We hope to show that there are anthropocentric, as well as animal-centered, reasons that speak in favor of radically reformed human-animal relations, including diets that are at least predominantly plant-based.

AB  - Mine remediation entails long-term risks associated with the containment and monitoring of dangerous materials. To date, research on mine remediation in Canada has focused primarily on technical fixes; little is known about the socio-political and colonial aspects of remediation. Using the Giant Mine in Yellowknife (Northwest Territories, Canada) as a case study, this research investigates the story of the Giant Mine 'Monster', how it was defined, how it has changed and how nearby communities will care for the mine in the future. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research combines literature reviews, archival analysis, key informant interviews and participant observation in analyzing the multiple experiences, practices and stories of the Giant Mine Remediation Project. Directed by the frameworks of ecological restoration, Indigenous environmental justice and science and technology studies theories of care, this research reveals that, by focusing on the technical containment of arsenic trioxide pollution, the Giant Mine Remediation Project sidelined community objectives for compensation, independent oversight and a perpetual care plan. However, through the ongoing activism of the Yellowknives Dene First Nations and community allies, the Giant Mine Monster is being creatively reframed as something to care for and live with for generations to come - a responsibility for mining wastes that settlers across Canada have yet to meaningfully reckon with. I argue that the Giant Mine case points to a critical reconceptualization of environmental remediation as an anti-colonial mechanism to (re)structure, or (re)mediate, relationships with both land and people. Without a community objectives based approach to remediation, such projects risk continuing systems of colonization, marginalization and environmental injustice.

AB  - In this paper, Cassandra's role in the ancient Greek myth of the fall of Troy, as one given the gift of prophesy but cursed to be disbelieved, is explored with a view to understanding the apparently powerless position of climate justice and environmental activism to change public policy. To make this case, we re-interpret the myth of Cassandra to imagine her as a different kind of person, and explore the ideas and stories of certain Teme Augama Anishinaabe Elders that we believe reflect a divergent ontos (being state) from that of the global, modern West. This being state is embedded in the natural world in a constantly reciprocal and dialogical way. We couple this with parallel arguments from recent theories around the human neuro-hemispheric divide relating to ontology and use both to explore how we might become the kinds of people that are capable of dealing with climate change: Cassandras of the second kind. Viewed methodologically, this paper is a cyclical philosophical investigation that, in part, makes use of hermeneutics and narrative inquiry to understand mythic Greek tales and the stories of Indigenous Elders. It also draws on literary traditions that employ allegory to explore meaning.

AB  - Over the past few decades, there has been an increasing interest in the active involvement of local stakeholders in the management of floods in Europe. Such involvement is seen as necessary as the management of floods becomes more complex. Management approaches now seek to include a range of potential measures to reduce risk (e.g. structural defence, spatial planning and property-level protection measures). Local stakeholder involvement is seen to be important because governments lack the capacities such as knowledge and funding required to deliver all these measures alone. This paper focuses on the implications that more participative approaches have on the fairness of European flood risk management (FRM). Studies of environmental justice are well placed to address this question because they are interested in who is included and excluded from decisions related to the distribution of environmental goods (resources) and bads (risks). Existing literature suggests that fair decision-making processes (procedural justice) can lead to fair distribution or resources and risks (distributive justice). This literature review of 30 peer-reviewed papers provides an analysis of justice and FRM by assessing practices of participation which are presented in the recent literature on local stakeholder involvement in FRM in England, Germany and the Netherlands. It was found that participation in practice generally focuses on transferring responsibility to the local level at the expense of power. This paper discusses the implications that this finding has for justice and synthesises potential ways forward based on recommendations of the reviewed literature.

AB  - Many geopolitical jurisdictions, including the European Union, demonstrate a growing commitment to mitigating climate change through a transition to renewable energy production. While ambitious targets and the transformations they inspire should be celebrated, it is nevertheless increasingly important to understand how renewable energy policies and discourses are being mobilized in the rollout of controversial energy technologies such as waste incineration. This paper engages analytical lenses from environmental justice scholarship on discourse, scale, and waste siting controversies to contribute to the emerging literature on the competing ways that actors frame controversial energy technologies. Specifically, drawing on case study research conducted in Austria from 2013 to 2015, it asks in what contexts, and by whom, are discourses of renewability enrolled in relation to waste-to-energy planning and management? Findings demonstrate the divergent ways in which Austrian and European Union policy elites and local residents frame waste incineration vis-a-vis its renewability. Ultimately, the article argues that framing discrepancies between policy elites and local residents are a reflection of procedural injustice.

AB  - In this paper we argue that political ecology, a critical subdiscipline of geography, can contribute important insights for transportation geographers and planners. Specifically, political ecology's attendance to environmental subjectivities helps explain why some groups traditionally assumed to be in favor of mass transit resist the projects developed in part to benefit them. Based on qualitative research conducted in Oakland, California between 2011 and 2012, this paper ultimately argues that a political ecology lens helps highlight how environmental and transit subjectivities identities developed from everyday interactions with mobile and built environments shape dispositions towards, and the politics around, mass transit projects. This insight is important as it reveals how interactions with the built environment, and the subjectivities these interactions engender, can be overlooked in the context of transportation interventions, especially when these subjectivities are in tension with transit planners' working assumptions and worldviews.

AB  - It is often assumed that neutralist liberalism and environmentalism are incompatible because promoting environmentally friendly policies involves endorsing a particular conception of the good life. This paper questions that assumption by showing that one important version of neutralist liberalism, John Rawls's 'justice as fairness', can allow two kinds of justification for environmental policies. First, public reason arguments can be used to justify conceptions of sustainability and environmental justice. Second, comprehensive ideals (including non-anthropocentric ideals) can be used to justify more ambitious environmental policies when two conditions are met, namely, the issue under discussion does not concern constitutional essentials or matters of basic justice; and the policy is endorsed by a majority of citizens. Rawls's willingness to allow this second kind of justification for environmental (and other) policies is defended against two objections, which claim that Rawls's democratic liberalism' is incoherent. The first objection - the 'justice' objection - is that to spend public money promoting comprehensive (environmental) ideals is inconsistent with the 'difference principle'. The 'justice' objection depends on a common Misunderstanding of the difference principle. The second objection - the 'neutrality' objection - claims that 'democratic liberalism' is inconsistent with Rawls's commitment to neutrality. The 'neutrality' objection is unconvincing because 'democratic liberalism' is 'fundamentally neutral' whereas the leading alternative is not.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that low-income and minority communities in liberal democratic societies suffer a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards. Is "environmental injustice" a necessary feature of liberal societies or is its prevalence due to the failure of existing liberal democracies to live up to liberal principles of justice? One leading version of liberalism, John Rawls' "justice as fairness," can be "extended" to accommodate the concerns expressed by advocates of environmental justice. Moreover, Rawlsian environmental justice has some significant advantages over existing conceptions of environmental justice.

AB  - Large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system features centrally both in definitions of, and proposed responses to, the Anthropocene. In its deliberate guise - as climate geoengineering - such intervention is highly contentious, threatening to profoundly reshape the geography and politics of environmental governance frameworks, not to mention the nature of the environments towards which those frameworks are oriented. Yet, even as experiments with geoengineering technologies are growing in number, geographers continue to engage seldom with scientific, political or indeed public debates about them. In this paper we contend that geographical ideas about space, scale, power and geopolitics must urgently be brought to bear on ongoing efforts to experiment with geoengineering, and to deliberate its future role in responses to climate change. We develop this argument in two parts. First, we suggest that ongoing debates about the acceptability of geoengineering experimentation would benefit from recognising incumbent spatial and scalar categorisations (e.g., small scale vs. large scale, indoors vs. outdoors) not as fixed ontological anchors, but as relational and provisional constructs, open to being rethought in new, potentially productive ways. Second, we call for geographers to document and contest inequalities and injustices, both in debates about what geoengineering is or might become, and in the outcomes generated by efforts to undertake geoengineering in practice. Here there are opportunities for geographers to reshape the frames of reference used by others to comprehend the implications of the Anthropocene itself, drawing on traditional disciplinary strengths in ecofeminism, political ecology and environmental justice, as well as the production of space and critical geopolitics. Such endeavours, we contend, will form a vital complement to existing geographical engagements with the concept of the Anthropocene, reaffirming the value of the discipline's distinctive - and explicitly normative - voice within ongoing policy and public deliberations.

AB  - Local governments play a crucial role in distributing environmental harms and benefits and all too often, they disproportionately impose environmental burdens on low-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color. The concentration of toxic uses and environmental risks in these communities poses a serious threat to residents' health and safety. Concern about these disproportionate impacts has ignited a vibrant environmental justice movement in communities across the nation, but advocates have struggled to find adequate legal tools to protect their communities. This Comment examines the potential for a little-used anti-discrimination statute in California's Planning and Land Use Title (Government Code section 65008) to allow environmental justice claims against local governments. The statute renders null and void any action that denies enjoyment of residence, landownership, or other interest in land to individuals on the basis of race and other characteristics including low-income status. The statute also forbids discrimination against the same classes in the enactment or administration of ordinances. The inclusion of socioeconomic class as a protected characteristic offers an important opportunity for racial justice advocates to capture the full range of disadvantages that burden many communities of color. Together with the use of the disparate impact standard, the statute accommodates robust theories of discrimination necessary to confront the nature of racial disadvantage that drives environmental discrimination. A close reading of the terms of section 65008 highlights its availability for environmental justice claims against local governments. Reading the term "enjoyment of residence" in light of the common law doctrines of constructive eviction, the implied warranty of habitability, and nuisance, I conclude that section 65008 renders null and void local government actions that interfere with residents' health and safety interests on a discriminatory basis. The second provision, barring discrimination in the enactment or administration of ordinances, has an even broader reach, potentially covering a host of local government actions relevant to the allocation of environmental harms and benefits. Finally, I argue that the statute's protections apply to existing communities, but recommend clarifying language that would remove some confusion created by inelegant drafting. This explication of section 65008 illustrates some of the crucial elements of a model environmental justice statute: the ability to capture structural and implicit discrimination that underpin spatial inequality; protection of ongoing residential interests connected with health and safety and not simply access to housing; and coverage of the full range of local government powers that may be implicated in regulating and distributing environmental harms. A statute with these elements promises to represent a breakthrough in environmental justice litigation.

AB  - Poor air quality in Utah creates an array of economic, environmental, and health-related impacts that merit investigation and informed political responses. Air pollution is known to cause a variety of health problems, ranging from increased rates of asthma to cardiovascular and lung disease. Our research investigates the extent of Utahn's understanding of the health risks associated with long-term and short-term impacts of air quality. To assess the degree to which Utahn's perceive the health risks of air pollution, we performed an ordinal logistic regression analysis using responses to the Utah Air Quality Risk and Behavioral Action Survey, a representative panel survey administered between November 2018 and January 2020 (n = 1160), to determine how socioeconomic status impacts risk perception. Socioeconomic status is not a predictor of perceiving air's short-term risks to health. Those with more conservative political orientation, as well as those with higher religiosity scores, were less likely than those with more liberal political orientation or those with lower religiosity scores to strongly agree that air pollution poses short-term health risks. We find that for short-term health risks from air pollution, Utahns in the middle-income category are more likely than those in the low-income category to strongly agree that air pollution poses long-term health risks. In addition, those with more conservative political orientation were less likely than those with more liberal political orientation to strongly agree that air pollution poses long-term health risks.

AB  - In the past 10 years, interest in studying the relationship between area of residence and health has grown. During this period empirical relations between place and health have been observed at a variety of spatial scales, from census tracts to administrative units in metropolitan areas to whole regions, and for a variety of health outcomes. Despite the richness of the data, there are relatively few publications offering theoretical explanations for these observations, and a sound conception of place itself is still lacking. Using place as a relational space linked to where people live, work and play, this paper conceptualises the nature of neighbourhoods as they contribute to the local production of health inequalities in everyday life. In reference to Giddens' structuration theory, we propose that neighbourhoods essentially involve the availability of, and access to, health-relevant resources in a geographically defined area. Taking inspiration from the work of Godbout on informal reciprocity, we further propose that such availability and access are regulated according to four different sets of rules: proximity, prices, rights, and informal reciprocity. Our theoretical framework suggests that these rules give rise to five domains, the physical, economic, institutional, local sociability, and community organisation domains which cut across neighbourhood environments through which residents may acquire resources that shape their lifecourse trajectory in health and social functioning.

AB  - Indonesia is one of the world's "megadiverse" countries, providing ecosystem services that accrue at the global scale. However, control over access to and use of natural resources has historically been a source of tension between the central government and local communities, with the latter usually being marginalized by the former. Since the fall of the authoritarian Suharto regime in 1998, however, a grassroots movement supports the revitalization of customary communities and their traditional systems of social organization (adat). A major part of this quest for legitimacy is the portrayal of indigenous people as environmentally benign. This chapter describes how indigenous systems have been influenced by political processes over time. We then describe how the changing political-administrative landscape has given rise to a national indigenous rights movement. We also analyze international factors that have contributed to the emergence of the indigenous movement before discussing potential challenges facing the movement in the future. This chapter seeks to get beyond the simplistic conflation of indigenous peoples and environmentalism by understanding the strategic articulation of indigeneity and environmentalism.

AB  - In recent debates on climate change and migration, the focus on the figure of climate refugees' (tainted by environmental determinism and a crude understanding of human mobility) has given ground to a broader conception of the climate-migration nexus. In particular, the idea that migration can represent a legitimate adaptation strategy has emerged strongly. This appears to be a positive development, marked by softer tones that de-securitise climate migration. However, political and normative implications of this evolution are still understudied. This article contributes to filling the gap by turning to both the climate refugees' and migration as adaptation' narratives, interrogating how and whether those competing narratives pose the question of (in)justice. Our analysis shows that the highly problematic climate refugees' narrative did (at least) channel justice claims and yielded the (illusory) possibility of identifying concrete rights claims and responsibilities. Read in relation to the growing mantra of resilience in climate policy and politics, the more recent narrative on migration as adaptation' appears to displace justice claims and inherent rights in favour of a depoliticised idea of adaptation that relies on the individual migrant's ability to compete in and benefit from labour markets. We warn that the removal of structural inequalities from the way in which the climate-migration nexus is understood can be seen as symptomatic of a shrinking of the conditions to posing the question of climate justice.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of droughts on industrial emissions into surface waters and transfers to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). We use industrial discharges into surface waters data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) database. We employ runoffs normalized using previous 61-year average runoffs as a proxy for drought. We match both the discharges into surface waters and the runoffs at the 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) level. Our analysis indicates that normalized runoffs of the current and previous years positively influence industrial emissions into surface waters. We also find that the impact of uneven availability of water on emissions is higher on larger facilities. Normalized runoffs of the current and previous years do not have a statistically significant influence on transfers to publicly owned treatment works. However, normalized runoffs of the previous year do affect transfers of larger facilities. Businesses are dependent on water not only for their operations but to discharge their pollutants as well. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods. Therefore, every business that requires significant quantities of water must plan to cope with uneven availability of water.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The National Environmental Policy Act and related state laws require many public agencies to analyze and disclose potentially significant environmental effects of agency actions, including effects on human health. In this paper we review the purpose and procedures of environmental impact assessment (EIA), existing regulatory requirements for health effects analysis, and potential barriers to and opportunities for improving integration of human health concerns within the EIA process. DATA SOURCES: We use statutes, regulations, guidelines, court opinions, and empirical research on EIA along with recent case examples of integrated health impact assessment (HIA)/EIA at both the state and federal level. DATA SYNTHESIS: We extract lessons and recommendations for integrated HLA/EIA practice from both existing practices as well as case studies. CONCLUSIONS: The case studies demonstrate the adequacy, scope, and power of existing statutory requirements for health analysis within EIA. The following support the success of integrated HIA/EIA: a proponent recognizing EIA as an available regulatory strategy for public health; the openness of the agency conducting the EIA; involvement of public health institutions; and complementary objectives among community stakeholders and health practitioners. We recommend greater collaboration among institutions responsible for EIA, public health institutions, and affected stakeholders along with guidance, resources, and training for integrated HLA/EIA practice.

AB  - In the period 2015-2017 a Health Impact Assessment, HIA, was carried out in the Municipalities of Viggiano and Grumento Nova, in Val D'Agri, where since 2001 the oil first treatment plant, COVA, has been active. HIA envisaged the constant involvement of local communities and a multidisciplinary scientific group. Seven scientific articles have been published on: review of evidence on non-methane hydrocarbons; diffusion model of air pollutants emitted by the COVA; characteristics of the HIA process; investigation on volatile organic compounds, odorous substances and citizens' reports; sample study on respiratory function using spirometry and questionnaire; residential cohort study on mortality and hospitalization; analysis of media outputs in a critical period. The results showed environmental and health impacts related to the population's area of residence. In addition to environmental-health surveillance activities, the preventive HIA approach emerges as a preferential way for reducing communities' exposure to recognized pollutants and sustaining environmental justice options.

AB  - In contrast to the US environmental justice movement, which has been successful in building a networked environmentalism that recognises-and has impacted upon-national patterns of distributional (in)equalities, campaigns in the UK have rarely developed beyond the local or articulated a coherent programme of action that links to wider socio-spatial justice issues or effects real changes in the regulatory or political environment. Our purpose in this paper is to extend research which explores the spatial politics of mobilisation, by attending to the multi-scalar dynamics embedded in the enactment of environmental justice (EJ) in north-east England. It is an approach that is indebted to recent work on the scalar politics of EJ, and also to the network ideas associated with actor-network theory (ANT)-inspired research on human-nature relations. Our account provides preliminary reflections on the potential for an "assemblage" perspective which draws together people, texts, machines, animals, devices and discourses in relations that collectively constitute-and scale-EJ. To conclude, and building upon this approach, we suggest future research avenues that we believe present a promising agenda for critical engagement with the production, scaling and politics of environmental (in)justice.

AB  - Major developments, such as mines, will often have unavoidable environmental impacts. In such cases, investors, governments, or even a company's own standards increasingly require implementation of biodiversity offsets (investment in conservation with a measurable outcome) with the aim of achieving 'no net loss' or even a 'net gain' of biodiversity. Where conservation is achieved by changing the behaviour of people directly using natural resources, the offset might be expected to have social impacts but such impacts have received very little attention. Using the case study of Ambatovy, a major nickel mine in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar and a company at the vanguard of developing biodiversity offsets, we explore local perceptions of the magnitude and distribution of impacts of the biodiversity offset project on local wellbeing. We used both qualitative (key informant interviews and focus group discussions) and quantitative (household survey) methods. We found that the biodiversity offsets, which comprise both conservation restrictions and development activities, influenced wellbeing in a mixture of positive and negative ways. However, overall, respondents felt that they had suffered a net cost from the biodiversity offset. It is a matter of concern that benefits from development activities do not compensate for the costs of the conservation restrictions, that those who bear the costs are not the same people as those who benefit, and that there is a mismatch in timing between the immediate restrictions and the associated development activities which take some time to deliver benefits. These issues matter both from the perspective of environmental justice, and for the long- term sustainability of the biodiversity benefits the offset is supposed to deliver.

AB  - In communities surrounding the Salton Sea, high rates of asthma are associated with high aerosol dust levels. However, the Salton Sea itself may play an additional role in pulmonary health. Therefore, to investigate a potential role of the Salton Sea on pulmonary health, we exposed mice to aerosolized Salton Sea water for 7 days and assessed tissue responses, including cellular infiltration and gene expression changes. For reference, mice were also exposed to aerosolized fungal allergen (Alternaria sp.) and Pacific Ocean aerosols. Exposure to aerosolized Alternaria sp. induced dramatic allergic inflammation, including neutrophil and eosinophil recruitment to the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. By contrast, Salton Sea "spray" induced only B cell recruitment to the lung tissue without increased inflammatory cell numbers in BALF. However, there were consistent gene expression changes suggestive of an inflammatory response. The response to the Salton Sea spray was notably distinct from the response to Pacific Ocean water, which induced some B cell recruitment but without an inflammatory gene expression profile. Our studies suggest that soluble components in Salton Sea water promote induction of a unique inflammation-associated response, though any relationship to asthma remains to be explored.

AB  - In this paper, we offer a childist reading of school strikes for climate in an overheated world. We argue that school strikes can be understood as offering a dynamic counterweight to formal education, by providing opportunities for children to self-educate, and for others, especially adults, to learn from them. We suggest that taking school strikes seriously as sites of political appearance-which highlight interdependencies and vulnerabilities in the face of crises in Anthropocene neoliberalism requires rethinking the boundaries of democratic participation and education. In particular, we highlight that school strikes for climate serve as an invitation for adults to let children contribute to their own ongoing formation. A childist philosophical attitude that emphasises mutual teaching-i.e. the adult capacity to see and hear what children show and say-can expand through an engagement with, rather than against school strikes. Children's political appearance on streets to influence political priorities from an intergenerational global justice point of view is a gift for adults and adultist structures. It is a passage to grasp deep interdependence and to assume appropriate responsibility. If 'education' is a beacon of hope in times of overheated despair, then the hope is in educational philosophies that have room for mutual teaching. The philosophical assumption that it is adults who must always, and necessarily, teach children to prepare them for a better future would have to be discarded.

AB  - In October of 2012, youth organizers from the immigrant justice and climate change resistance movements in the southeastern US metropolitan region of Atlanta, Georgia, coordinated a direct action tactic framed by a unified narrative justifying collaboration between immigrant and climate justice activists on equal terms. In a continuing collaborative relationship, these organizers embraced mutually strategic narratives rooted in local civil rights history, but rejected common global climate justice' narratives used to frame social and environmental collaborative organizing. We examine the departure from global climate justice' narratives, which was exemplified by coalition building in Georgia, to argue that scholarship articulating global climate justice' as a new context for integrating social and environmental movements must anticipate barriers to these solidarities, especially historical, regional and racialized dynamics of power among organizations engaged in these developing alliances. Based on an investigation of strategic alliances between anti-racist, immigrant justice organizers and climate change activists in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta and Athens, Georgia, we argue that climate justice narratives in both activism and scholarship would benefit from more attention to the particular political and cultural geographies in which diverse forms of climate justice organizing can take hold.

AB  - Large areas of the rural Lao landscape are being rapidly transformed by infrastructure development projects. Arguably, it is hydraulic development that is contributing most significantly to rural socio-ecological change, due to the profound socio-political ruptures dams precipitate. The nationally iconic Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project, commissioned in 1998 and expanded in 2012, provides an illustrative case of hydropower's complex social-ecological outcomes. Proponents have argued that the project represents a best-case example of planned, sustainable development, through successful mitigation of negative impacts and benefit-sharing with affected communities, and implemented in accordance with international good practice. This article questions the narratives of sustainability. It is argued that while the project could be considered successful in achieving certain economic objectives defined by the government and investors, evidence of social and environmental sustainability is questionable, raising questions about other dam projects in the country with weaker standards and oversight. Given the extent of negative impacts and associated social trauma in the Nam Hinboun basin, the article considers whether and to what extent such hydraulic development processes under authoritarian rule may be framed as expressions of structural injustice and slow violence.

AB  - Laos has rapidly expanded its hydraulic infrastructure, creating profound environmental, economic and social ruptures. We combine frameworks of environmental justice with political ecology to examine the multiple expressions of water injustice evident in three hydropower project case studies involving resettlement. We find that livelihood restoration measures have not ameliorated, but reproduced underlying problems of poverty, inequity, exclusion and coercive expressions of social injustice. These are viewed as the structural outcomes of political choices. We conclude that there is little potential for a water justice paradigm in Laos without significant reforms to the national frameworks for water governance and human rights.

AB  - Objective. The "environmental justice" movement has suggested that demographic inequities characterize the location of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). While some researchers have found evidence that TSDFs are disproportionately located in minority areas, others attribute TSDF location to nonracial factors such as income and industrial employment. Methods. We used both univariate and multivariate techniques to analyze the Il,cation of TSDFs in Los Angeles County, California; the focus on one county allowed us to overcome the problem of "false" addresses for TSDF sites and to introduce specific land use/zoning variables that are not used in the other studies. Results. In our univariate results and the multivariate model, we find that (1) industrial land use and manufacturing employment do matter, as suggested by critics of environmental justice; (2) income has first a positive, then a negative effect on TSDF location, a pattern that likely reflects the fact that the poorest communities have little economic activity while wealthier communities have the economic and political power to resist negative environmental externalities; and (3) race and ethnicity are still significantly associated with TSDF location, even when percentage African American and percentage Latino are evaluated as separate groupings. Taken together, the results suggest that communities most affected by TSDFs in the Los Angeles area are working-class communities of color located near industrial areas.

AB  - In relation to literary ecocriticism, ecocritical analysis of visual art is in a nascent stage. Despite, or perhaps due to, the centrality of idealized representations of nature in the history of art, and also because of the dominance of the gallery mercantile system as the chief means of display and dissemination of works of art, researched and documentary projects on ecosystems and vulnerable cultures and biotic matter, public art performing sustainability, and photographs as critical landscapes, have been slow to gain attention. A genealogy of significant group exhibitions in museums is followed by focus on current approaches. Visual art is often called upon to effect political change; reified categories of political engagement and aesthetic autonomy are dissolving in more nuanced conceptions of art's social position and contributions. Issues of agency and materiality are becoming central, as well as environmental justice. The work of critical art historians Malcolm Miles, T.J. Demos, and Emily Eliza Scott are featured.

AB  - In semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa, farming populations face harsh climatic conditions but also very unequal and dynamic social processes that affect their resilience. This study addresses aspects of power and social justice related to the social-ecological system of the Niayes coastal region of Senegal and examines the potential of agroecology to improve the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. We performed a knowledge co-production process with a local farmer union to identify the main social-ecological nexuses that matter for smallholder farmers, their dynamics and the influence of powerful actors and institutions on them. We also look at the potential actions of the farmer union under the banner of agroecology to transform these dynamics. We found that social-ecological dynamics involve reinforcing feedback loops that undermine the resilience of smallholder farmers and that powerful actors such as agribusinesses have a strong influence on these processes. Union actions promoting agroecology have enhanced system thinking and related solutions, but observed social justice claims are very recent and have a limited scope. Our findings expand the notion of resilience grabbing, understood as the undermining of resilience through the loss of commons, to include systemic degradations due to direct and indirect actions of involved stakeholders. We also propose to expand the notion of resilience justice vertically, integrating procedural and recognition justice, and horizontally, integrating linked social-ecological issues. We conclude that agroecology can become a transformative bridge from resilience grabbing to resilience justice, but must be more sensitive to power relations, in particular around labour.

AB  - In this paper we examine the spatial distributions of four types of technological hazards in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The focus is on the locations of hazardous industrial and toxic waste sites in relation to the demographic composition of adjacent neighborhoods. Our interest is to determine whether hazardous sites, including industrial facilities in the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, Large Quantity Generators of hazardous wastes, Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities, and federally identified contamination sites, are disproportionately located in areas with lower income and minority residents. We examine patterns of environmental inequity in Phoenix, a sprawling Sunbelt city with a growing post-Fordist industrial sector. First, using 1996 EPA data for four types of technological hazards, and 1995 Special Census data for Maricopa County, we employ a GIS to map the spatial distributions of hazardous sites and to analyze the demographic characteristics of census tracts with and without point-source hazards. A second methodology is used to produce a cumulative hazard density index for census tracts, based on the number of hazard zones-one-mile-radius circles around each facility-that overlay each tract. Both methodologies disclose clear patterns of social inequities in the distribution of technological hazards. The cumulative hazard density index provides a spatially sensitive methodology that reveals the disproportionate distribution of risk burdens in urban census tracts. The findings point to a consistent pattern of environmental injustice by class and race across a range of technological hazards in the Phoenix metropolitan region.

AB  - Much recent work on climate justice and activism focuses on the broader socio-political economic contexts in which contestation occurs. These contestatory spaces in neoliberalised economies are frequently depoliticised through a variety of processes, strategies, practices, and actors. Recently this has been framed as the post-political - whereby dissent is legitimised as "democratic" only when it does not challenge the status quo of business-as-usual. Most of the analysis and commentary on the post-political has focused on policy or democratic decision-making processes and conflict at relatively broad scales, rather than nuanced empirical case studies. In this paper we draw on an empirical case study to explore how processes of delegitimisation affect climate justice activists in emotional and personal ways. We argue that while the political subjectivities of climate justice activists are fragile achievements, a key aspect that sustains them is an ethic of care for humans and non-humans, both near and more distant, who are affected by climate change. Fostering this ethic of care is one key way for climate activists to continue enacting responsibility for climate justice in a way that contests depoliticising and delegitimisation processes.

AB  - One sustainability challenge is confronting the process of global urbanization considering wellbein g and environmental justice. Integrating different disciplines to describe and analyze the relationships of urban socio-ecological systems gives us usef u l empirical tools to formulate policies and programs in urban planning considering their spatial dimension. The objective of this study is to present a model that integrates and explains the socio-ecological urban relations of a Latin American city considering three high-level approaches: forestry, geography, and psychology. Thus, we defined fou r factors: a) urban forest and green areas; b) urban spatial segregation; c) perceived restoration; and d) subjective wellbeing. For these, we grouped 16 measured variables and collected them with three specific procedures: a) SPOT remote sensors and object-based classification of urban coverage; b) analysis of geospatial data with census information; and c) field surveys. We applied descriptive multivariate statistics and also proposed a structural equation model (SEM) that integrates a l l the variables and data. We found that the factor "urban green areas" had a direct positive relationship with the factors "urban spatial segregation" and "perceived restoration." We observed that urban green areas were meeting spaces between different socioeconomic categories, reducing segregation and multiplying opportunities for the psychological restoration of citizens. However, we found no evidence that green areas are related to subjective wellbeing. The model quantified the socio-ecological relationships produced by combining various factors of urban socio-ecological systems, suggesting the benefits of this method to generate knowledge towards planning and managing Latin American cities. Ou r results are encouraging in terms of environmental justice and wellbeing. In developing countries where forecasts indicate rising urban populations, the need to establish planning processes based on scientific information is vital to meet the challenges of sustainability in the twentyfirst century.

AB  - Many agree that developed states must bear greater burdens in tacking climate change than developing states for two reasons: their greater historical responsibility for global warming and their greater wealth. People disagree, however, about the relative importance of these two reasons. This article develops an "institutional view" to address this issue, which consists of two claims. First, many emissions of greenhouse gases that took place before the establishment of legitimate institutions of global climate governance do not give rise to climate-related duties. Second, the absence of legitimate institutional global governance, more generally, undermines full rights to wealth on the part of developed states and thus removes an objection to their having to contribute more to tackling the challenges of climate change. The upshot is that, at present, climate duties should be allocated between states mainly on the basis of wealth rather than history.

AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been an efflorescence of park and greenspace research. This trend may reflect substantial increases in urban populations globally and concomitant pressures on land resources - including greenspace. But so far research has mainly tended to focus on demand rather than supply, and specifically the practice of provision - notwithstanding the body of literature studying disparities in greenspace access and geographic distribution through an environmental justice lens (e.g. using spatial analysis). Comparatively fewer studies have considered the interplay of factors that may shape local government's capacity to supply greenspace. This paper reports results of a systematic quantitative review of the greenspace provision literature: assessing the factors that configure its supply, and different approaches to planning and assessing greenspace provision. A conceptual model is offered, explaining the interaction between greenspace provision factors across different scales. Findings suggest many cities continue to experience gaps between planned and actual green space provision. Moreover, urban greenspace is typically planned using a recreational standards approach, despite increasing demands for a range of ecosystem functions, services, and benefits. Future research should engage directly with greenspace managers responsible for urban greenspace delivery, especially in rapidly expanding cities, to illuminate points of convergence and divergence between theory and practice. Policy implications include consideration of holistic greenspace planning approaches that better recognise and respond to emerging demands upon, and for, urban greenspace.

AB  - Large linear transport infrastructure projects, such as highways connecting large metropolitan areas, are continuously under development in France. Although the economic and social benefits of such projects are often disputed, their impacts on the environment and local populations are multiple. These potential impacts almost systematically result in conflicts between decision-makers and planners on one side, and local actors with various profiles (e.g. farmers, residents, environmental associations) mobilised against the projects on the other. In the context of a citizen mobilisation against the A45 highway project in eastern France, this study aimed to analyse the social contributions of maps in terms of information reception. The study is based on the creation of maps representing combined spatial impacts (on mobility, housing, land, landscapes, agriculture, and ecosystems). These maps, created by researchers, were presented in the form of posters aimed at opening discussions with non-experts. The maps created an original medium for discussing and debating the impacts of a highway project through the participatory encounter. Under the lens of spatial and environmental justice, this study questions the discrepancies between who makes decisions on a project and who suffers its impacts, and also raises questions about the position of scientific research in citizen mobilisation.

AB  - In the United States and beyond the challenges of global climate change are increasingly being governed via the militarization of nation-state borders rather than, or in addition to, the mitigation of carbon emissions and collective strategies for climate adaptation. In this article we apply the concept of "geopopulationism," introduced by Bhatia et al. (this issue), to think through the zero-sum Manichaean logics of traditional geopolitical calculation and the ways these become applied to climate governance via the securitization of climate change-related migration. In order to disrupt this securitization of climate policy, we draw on the insights of feminist geopolitics and what Koopman calls "alter-geopolitics" to consider how contemporary grassroots movements like the Sanctuary movement and #BlackLivesMatter have made connections between political, economic and environmental vulnerabilities while developing relationships of solidarity and care that broaden, disseminate, distribute and regenerate security as an expansive and inclusive project. We conclude by considering ways that scholars can continue to ally ourselves with and contribute to these grassroots efforts.

AB  - In addition to lower carbon dioxide emissions, policies to reduce fossil fuel combustion can yield substantial air quality co-benefits via reduced emissions of co-pollutants such as particulate matter and air toxics. If co-pollutant intensity (the ratio of co-pollutant impacts to carbon dioxide emissions) varies across pollution sources, efficient policy design would seek greater emissions reductions where co-benefits are higher. The distribution of co-benefits also raises issues of environmental equity. This paper presents evidence on intersectoral, intrasectoral and spatial variations in co-pollutant intensity of industrial point sources in the United States, and discusses options for integrating co-benefits into climate policy design to advance efficiency and equity.

AB  - In the United Kingdom (UK), daily circulation figures for tabloid newspapers are as much as ten times higher than broadsheet sources. Nonetheless, studies of media representations of climate change in the UK to date have focused on broadsheet newspapers. Moreover, readership patterns correlate with socio-economic status; the majority of readers of tabloids are in 'working class' demographics. With a growing need to engage wider constituencies in awareness and potential behavioral change, it is important to examine how these influential sources represent climate change for a heretofore understudied segment of citizenry. This paper links political geographies with cultural issues of identity and discourse, through claims and frames on climate change in four daily 'working class' tabloid newspapers in UK - The Sun (and News of the World), Daily Mail (and Mail on Sunday), the Daily Express (and Sunday Express), and the Mirror (and Sunday Mirror). Through triangulated Critical Discourse Analysis, investigations of framing and semi-structured interviews, this project examines representations of climate change in these newspapers from 2000 through 2006. Data show that news articles on climate change were predominantly framed through weather events, charismatic megafauna and the movements of political actors and rhetoric, while few stories focused on climate justice and risk. In addition, headlines with tones of fear, misery and doom were most prevalent. These analyses then enable discussions of how these representations may influence ongoing climate science and governance interactions as well as political geographies, and (re)shape the contemporary cultural politics of climate change discourse.

AB  - In January 2014, then British Prime Minister David Cameron declared that his government was 'Going all out for Shale.' In November 2019, during an election campaign, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Gov-ernment imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing bringing to a halt industry hopes of developing shale gas in the UK. This paper explores what happened, integrating research employing a mixed methods research design including a review of the literature, expert interviews, household interviews, a series of nationally representative and local surveys, and a content analysis of political testimony. It starts with a brief history of the shale gas debate in the UK and social science research on the issue. It then examines the UK's Shale Gas landscape, and in particular energy policy failure, by considering three issues: first, the framing of the shale gas debate in the national Parliament, exploring the arguments for and against it; second, changing public perceptions and atti-tudes towards shale gas development; and third, the attitudes and lived experiences of the communities most affected by shale gas exploration activities. These three dimensions are combined to explain the UK Govern-ment's shale gas failure to-date. The paper concludes by identifying the lessons learnt from the Government's initial policy failure, both in relation to further shale gas exploration, but also for other technologies required for a future Net-Zero energy system.

AB  - Introduction: The health benefits of cycling have widely been recognized, but cycling is also associated with health risks (e.g., pollution exposure, crash risk). Past studies of these competing health impacts have been limited in their treatment of social equity, rarely considering spatial variations in risk that could be highly salient for marginalized populations. This study investigates the health risks of cycling through the lens of social equity by considering variations in PM2.5 concentrations and crash risk across space and across sociodemographic groups. Methods: We conducted this analysis in Los Angeles County, CA, which has a relatively high bicycle fatality rate and consistent non-attainment status for traffic-related PM2.5. We used publicly available data, including PM2.5 concentrations, crash locations, bicycle counts, and street network data, to derive measures of pollution exposure and crash risk. We performed descriptive, visualization, and regression analyses to assess how pollution exposure and crash risk vary across census block groups and are associated with area-level sociodemographic characteristics. Results: We found that the health risks of cycling are disproportionately high among marginalized populations (i.e. in block groups with lower income, lower educational attainment, and higher shares of racial/ethnic minority populations). Census block groups with worse outdoor air quality and higher crash risk are particularly likely to be home to low-income people of color. Even in these places, the health benefits of cycling could outweigh the risks; however, the net health benefits of cycling, accounting for these risks, are likely to be lower in marginalized communities. Conclusions: Health impact assessments related to cycling should incorporate neighborhood-level data to better assess the distribution of benefits and risks across space and across population groups. Efforts to promote cycling should focus on making cycling safer and healthier, placing emphasis on communities where it is associated with the greatest health risks.

AB  - Major sustainability transition processes will be necessary in the coming decades to meet international climate protection targets. These transition processes will cause profound economic and social changes. The accompanying redistribution of resources could be an opportunity for society to overcome existing unjust power relations, such as gender inequalities, instead of reproducing these structures. To achieve this, there must be a better understanding of the effects of transformation dynamics on inequalities. Using the example of historical coal transitions in the UK and the USA, we first show how women are affected differently by the transition than men, and how they engage in other ways to shape transition processes. For our analysis, we use Avelino's Power in Transitions (POINT) framework, and draw on data from 60 publications extracted from a systematic literature review on gender and coal transitions. In the second step, we use the relevant variables from the empirical analysis to add a new analytical layer to Avelino's POINT framework. This new layer, entitled gendered power asymmetries, provides a tool for the systematic analysis of gender issues in transition research. Furthermore, we derive from our empirical results first suggestions for gender-just transition policies.

AB  - Our special issue provides a first-of-its kind attempt to examine environmental injustices in the occupied West Bank through interdisciplinary perspectives, pointing to the broader settler colonial and neoliberal contexts within which they occur and to their more-than-human implications. Specifically, we seek to understand what environmental justice-a movement originating from, and rooted in, the United States-means in the context of Palestine/Israel. Moving beyond the settler-native dialectic, we draw attention to the more-than-human flows that occur in the region-which include water, air, waste, cement, trees, donkeys, watermelons, and insects-to consider the dynamic, and often gradational, meanings of frontier, enclosure, and Indigeneity in the West Bank, challenging the all-too-binary assumptions at the core of settler colonialism. Against the backdrop of the settler colonial project of territorial dispossession and elimination, we illuminate the infrastructural connections and disruptions among lives and matter in the West Bank, interpreting these through the lens of environmental justice. We finally ask what forms of ecological decolonization might emerge from this landscape of accumulating waste, concrete, and ruin. Such alternative visions that move beyond the single axis of settler-native enable the emergence of more nuanced, and even hopeful, ecological imaginaries that focus on sumud, dignity, and recognition.

AB  - In the United States, concentrations of criteria air pollutants have declined in recent decades. Questions remain regarding whether improvements in air quality are equitably distributed across subpopulations. We assessed spatial variability and temporal trends in concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) across North Carolina from 2002-2016, and associations with community characteristics. Estimated daily PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations at 2010 Census tracts were obtained from the Fused Air Quality Surface Using Downscaling archive and averaged to create tract-level annual PM2.5 and O-3 estimates. We calculated tract-level measures of: racial isolation of non-Hispanic Black individuals, educational isolation of non-college educated individuals, the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), and percentage of the population in urban areas. We fitted hierarchical Bayesian space-time models to estimate baseline concentrations of and time trends in PM2.5 and O-3 for each tract, accounting for spatial between-tract correlation. Concentrations of PM2.5 and O-3 declined by 6.4 mu g/m(3) and 13.5 ppb, respectively. Tracts with lower educational isolation and higher urbanicity had higher PM2.5 and more pronounced declines in PM2.5. Racial isolation was associated with higher PM2.5 but not with the rate of decline in PM2.5. Despite declines in pollutant concentrations, over time, disparities in exposure increased for racially and educationally isolated communities.

AB  - Land-use control is local and highly varied. State agencies struggle to assess plan contents. Similarly, advocacy groups and planning researchers wrestle with the length of planning documents and ability to compare across plans. The goal of this research is to (1) introduce Natural Language Processing techniques that can automate qualitative coding in planning research and (2) provide policy-relevant exploratory findings. We assembled a database of 461 California city-level General Plans, extracted the text, and used topic modeling to identify areas of emphasis (clusters of co-occurring words). We find that California city general plans address more than sixty topics, including greenhouse gas mitigation and Climate Action Planning. Through spatializing results, we find that a quarter of the topics in plans are regionally specific. We also quantify the rift and convergence of planning topics. The topics focused on housing have very little overlap with other planning topics. This is likely a factor of state requirements to update and evolve the Housing Elements every five years, but not other aspects of General Plans. This finding has policy implications as housing topics evolve away from other emphasis areas such as transportation and economic development. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach reveals that many cities have had a focus on environmental justice through Health and Wellness Elements well before the state mandate in 2019. Our searchable state-level database of general plans is the first for California-and nationally. We provide a model for others that wish to comprehensively assess and compare plan contents using machine learning.

AB  - Planning for equitable outcomes in transportation requires the development of evaluation methods that support the integration of equity in planning processes. This paper presents a methodology for equity evaluation that addresses limitations in current practices by analyzing transportation system outcomes regionally for the full range of demographic groups over time to incorporate the results into performance-based planning processes. This work applied current equity evaluations and a proposed methodology to a case study of the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan region. The results illustrate the current methodological limitations and provide an application of the proposed method that shows its ability to address the limitations. The proposed methodology is a comprehensive approach to analyze and characterize transportation system impacts that can be incorporated into performance-based transportation planning at the regional level to improve equity of transportation outcomes.

AB  - Just sustainabilities has emerged as a powerful discourse to guide local action towards sustainability. As an overarching discourse, it prescribes four policy principles: (1) addressing well-being and quality of life; (2) meeting the needs of present and future generations; (3) enabling justice and equity in terms of recognition, process, procedure, and outcome; and (4) living within ecosystem limits. Following previous calls for engaging public and private actors in just sustainabilities, this paper inquiries about the extent to which these principles can be realistically integrated in local environmental governance. A database of 400 sustainability initiatives in more than 200 cities in all world regions is analysed to examine whether just sustainabilities principles are already enshrined, explicitly or implicitly, in local sustainability initiatives. This analysis suggests that, in this sample, there is a significant deficit in terms of addressing the principles of justice and equity, and ecosystem limits. However, the data also suggest that local action may already be delivering some aspects of just sustainabilities, even if this is not always explicit. The paper concludes with a call for a coordinated effort to translate a just sustainabilities discourse to local actors leading action on the ground.

AB  - In this review, we take stock of the last decade of research on climate change governance in urban areas since the 2009 conference in Copenhagen. Using a systematic evaluation of academic publications in the field, we argue that the current moment of research has been shaped by two recent waves of thought. The first, a wave ofurban optimism, which started in 2011 and peaked in 2013, engaged with urban areas as alternative sites for governance in the face of the crumbling international climate regime. The second, a wave ofurban pragmatism, which started in 2016, has sought to reimagine urban areas following the integration of the "sub-national" as a meaningful category in the international climate regime after the 2015 Paris Agreement for Climate Action. Four themes dominate the debate on climate change governance in urban areas: why there is climate action, how climate action is delivered, how it is articulated in relation to internationally reaching networks, and what implications it has to understand environmental or climate justice within urban settings. Calls to understand the impacts of climate change policy have fostered research on climate change politics, issues of power and control, conflicts, and the inherently unjust nature of much climate policy. What is largely missing from the current scholarship is a sober assessment of the mundane aspects of climate change governance on the ground and a concern with what kind of cultural and socio-economic change is taking place, beyond comparative analyses of the effectiveness of climate policies.

AB  - In the wake of the Paris Agreement on climate change, promises to phase out coal-fired power have suggested cause for optimism around energy transition globally. However, coal remains entangled with contentious development agendas in many parts of the world, while fossil fuel industries continue to flourish. This article discusses these entanglements through a climate justice lens that engages the cultural politics surrounding coal and energy transition. We highlight how recent struggles around phasing out coal have stimulated renewed critical debates around colonialism, empire, and capitalism more broadly, recognizing climate change as an intersectional issue encompassing racial, gender, and economic justice. With social movements locked in struggles to resist the development or expansion of coal mines, power plants, and associated infrastructure, we unpack tensions that emerge as transnational alliances connect disparate communities across the world. Our conclusion signals the need for greater critical engagement with how intersecting inequalities are coded into the cultural politics of coal, and how this shapes efforts to pursue a just transition.

AB  - Nature exposure in virtual reality (VR) can provide emotional well-being benefits for people who cannot access the outdoors. Little is known about how these simulated experiences compare with real outdoor experiences. We conduct an experiment with healthy undergraduate students that tests the effects of 6 min of outdoor nature exposure with 6 min of exposure to a 360-degree VR nature video, which is recorded at the outdoor nature exposure location. Skin conductivity, restorativeness, and mood before and after exposure are measured. We find that both types of nature exposure increase physiological arousal, benefit positive mood levels, and are restorative compared to an indoor setting without nature; however, for outdoor exposure, positive mood levels increase and for virtual nature, they stay the same. The nature-based experience shows benefits above and beyond the variance explained by participants' preferences, nature and VR experiences, and demographic characteristics. Settings where people have limited access to nature might consider using VR nature experiences to promote mental health.

AB  - In this review, we provide an introduction to the topics of environmental justice and environmental inequality. We provide an overview of the dimensions of unequal exposures to environmental pollution (environmental inequality), followed by a discussion of the theoretical literature that seeks to explain the origins of this phenomenon. We also consider the impact of the environmental justice movement in the United States and the role that federal and state governments have developed to address environmental inequalities. We conclude that more research is needed that links environmental inequalities with public health outcomes.

AB  - Over the last decade we have seen the growth and development of low carbon lifestyle movement organisations, which seek to encourage members of the public to reduce their personal energy use and carbon emissions. As a first step to assess the transformational potential of such organisations, this paper examines the ways in which they frame their activities. This reveals an important challenge they face: in addressing the broader public, do they promote transformative' behaviours or do they limit themselves to encouraging 'easy changes' to maintain their appeal? We find evidence that many organisations within this movement avoid 'transformative' frames. The main reasons for this are organisers' perceptions that transformational frames lack resonance with broader audiences, as well as wider cultural contexts that caution against behavioural intervention. The analysis draws on interviews with key actors in the low carbon lifestyle movement and combines insights from the literatures on collective action framing and lifestyle movements.

AB  - Over 20 years have, passed since Executive Order 12898 put environmental justice (EJ) issues on the policy agenda. Since this time, EJ has technically remained a policy priority at all levels of government. However, despite this apparent commitment to EJ, research has shown over the decades after the passage of the Executive Order, we still see persistent trends in inequality of air pollution exposure by race. This begs the question: are EJ policies actually working to create environmentally just outcomes? This article seeks to evaluate this question by examining the impact of state EJ policies on disproportionate exposure to air pollution, with the goal of understanding what types of state actions, if any, are associated with decreases in pollution inequality.

AB  - Knowing how people prepare for disasters is essential to developing resiliency strategies. This study examined recalled concerns, evacuation experiences, and the future preparedness plans of a vulnerable population in New Jersey, United States, following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Understanding the responses of minority communities is key to protecting them during forthcoming disasters. Overall, 35 per cent of respondents were not going to prepare for an event. Intended future preparedness actions were unrelated to respondents' ratings of personal impact. More Blacks and Hispanics planned on preparing than Whites (68 versus 55 per cent), and more Hispanics planned on evacuating than did others who were interviewed. A higher percentage of respondents who had trouble getting to health centres were going to prepare than others. Respondents' concerns were connected to safety and survival, protecting family and friends, and having enough food and medicine, whereas future actions included evacuating earlier and buying sufficient supplies to shelter in place.

AB  - Many US governmental and Tribal Nation agencies, as well as state and local entities, deal with hazardous wastes within regulatory frameworks that require specific environmental assessments. In this paper we use Department of Energy (DOE) sites as examples to examine the relationship between regulatory requirements and environmental assessments for hazardous waste sites and give special attention to how assessment tools differ. We consider federal laws associated with environmental protection include the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as regulations promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Tribal Nations and state agencies. These regulatory regimes require different types of environmental assessments and remedial investigations, dose assessments and contaminant pathways. The DOE case studies illustrate the following points: 1) there is often understandable confusion about what regulatory requirements apply to the site resources, and what environmental assessments are required by each, 2) the messages sent on site safety issued by different regulatory agencies are sometimes contradictory or confusing (e.g. Oak Ridge Reservation), 3) the regulatory frameworks being used to examine the same question can be different, leading to different conclusions (e.g. Brookhaven National Laboratory), 4) computer models used in support of groundwater models or risk assessments are not necessarily successful in convincing Native Americans and others that there is no possibility of risk from contaminants (e.g. Amchitka Island), 5) when given the opportunity to choose between relying on a screening risk assessments or waiting for a full site-specific analysis of contaminants in biota, the screening risk assessment option is rarely selected (e.g. Amchitka, Hanford Site), and finally, 6) there needs to be agreement on whether there has been adequate characterization to support the risk assessment (e.g. Hanford). The assessments need to be transparent and to accommodate different opinions about the relationship between characterizations and risk assessments. This paper illustrates how many of the problems at DOE sites, and potentially at other sites in the U.S. and elsewhere, derive from a lack of either understanding of, or consensus about, the regulatory process, including the timing and types of required characterizations and data in support of site characterizations and risk assessments.

AB  - In the wake of colonial fragmentation and genocide, Indigenous 'Khoisan resurgence' movements in South Africa have mobilised subversive forms of authenticity, including heteroglossic and inventive translanguaging from fragments of Khoekhoegowab. In our analysis of video ethnographic texts produced in collaboration with the Gamtkwa Khoisan Council (GKC) in Hankey, the birthplace of Sarah Baartman, we explore how memory, language politics, and environmental activism are interwoven in acts of linguistic citizenship that constitute the 'rememorying' of a history that has remained persistently obscured. We argue that rememorying advances a politics of reminding which counters the Rainbow Nation's institutionalised politics of forgetting, as well as anthropological accounts that consider Indigenous activist invocations of history as merely 'therapeutic'. Through an engagement with the memory activism of the GKC, we identify how reconstructing word-histories, reliving historical traumas, retelling histories of sites of memory, seeing oneself mirrored in one's ancestors, and the nexus of land, memory, and time form the basis for shared meaning-making, bringing impetus, focus, and intergenerational continuity to struggles for environmental and land justice.

AB  - Land grabbing results in social impacts, injustice, conflict and displacement of smallholders. We use an environmental justice framework to analyse land grabbing and actions taken by local communities (resistance, protest, and proactive organisation). Qualitative research investigating land grabbing for tree plantations and agriculture (primarily soy) was undertaken in Argentina. We found that pre-existing local vulnerabilities tended to result in people acquiescing rather than resisting land grabs. Local people considered existing injustices to be more pressing than land grabbing. Locals tacitly accepted injustice resulting in communities becoming displaced, fenced-in, or evicted. Consequently, already-vulnerable people continue to live in unhealthy conditions, insecure tenure situations, and bear a disproportionate social and environmental burden. More attention should be given to pre-existing vulnerabilities and to improving the wellbeing of people affected by land grabs. Analysing land grabbing from an environmental justice perspective contributes to understanding the deeper reasons about why, where and how land grabbing occurs.

AB  - Migration is frequently driven by the need to improve social and economic opportunities or to flee conditions of political insecurity. The increased risks of environmental hazards, including climate change, have intensified the push to migrate. Nevertheless, the relation between climate change and forced displacement is not direct and is complicated by globalization, local ecological conditions, and deteriorating domestic institutions. Significantly, the muddy situation means the question "did this person migrate because of climate change?" may never be fully answered. On the basis of ethical arguments, in this Perspective article we propose a framework with both strong and mild responses to address cross-border migration. The strong version acknowledges that it is impossible to separate out fully the climate-induced causes of migration from others and using climate attribution studies for this purpose is potentially harmful. This implies designing an open door policy for asylum seekers as the impacts of climate change unfold, bearing in mind that host countries having the most responsibility for climate change ought to be the most welcoming to them. In the mild version, the international community designates vulnerable zones, areas where significant land area is susceptible to overwhelming loss and damage. Such countries would include most small-island states, those that are severely drought-prone and those with substantial low-lying deltaic areas. In both the mild and strong versions, asylum seekers are provided rights of free passage to host countries under nonrefoulement, so that they are not forced to return to their unliveable or unviable home countries and face continuing harm.

AB  - Over the past decade research on urban thermal inequity has grown, with a focus on denser built environments. In this letter we examine thermal inequity associated with climate change impacts and changes to urban form in a comparatively socio-economically disadvantaged Australian suburb. Local urban densification policies designed to counteract sprawl have reduced block sizes, increased height limits, and diminished urban tree canopy cover (UTC). Little attention has been given to the combined effects of lower UTC and increased heat on disadvantaged residents. Such impacts include rising energy expenditure to maintain thermal comfort (i.e. cooling dwellings). We used a survey of residents (n = 230) to determine their perceptions of climate change impacts; household energy costs; household thermal comfort practices; and dispositions towards using green infrastructure to combat heat. Results suggest that while comparatively disadvantaged residents spend more on energy as a proportion of their income, they appear to have reduced capacity to adapt to climate change at the household scale. We found most residents favoured more urban greening and supported tree planting in local parks and streets. Findings have implications for policy responses aimed at achieving urban climate justice.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to accumulate in traditional food animals of the Arctic, and arctic indigenous peoples may be exposed via consumption of subsistence-harvested animals. PFASs are suspected of disrupting thyroid hormone homeostasis in humans. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between serum PFASs and thyroid function in a remote population of Alaska Natives. Serum samples were collected from 85 individuals from St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. The concentrations of 13 PFASs, as well as free and total thyroxine (T-4), free and total triiodothyronine (T-3), and thyrotropin (TSH) were quantified in serum samples. The relationships between circulating concentrations of PFASs and thyroid hormones were assessed using multiple linear regression fit with generalized estimating equations. Several PFASs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were positively associated with TSH concentrations when modeled individually. PFOS and PFNA were significantly associated with free T-3 and PFNA was significantly associated with total T-3 in models with PFAS*sex interactive terms; these associations suggested negative associations in men and positive associations in women. PFASs were not significantly associated with concentrations of free or total T-4. Serum PFASs are associated with circulating thyroid hormone concentrations in a remote population of Alaska Natives. The effects of PFAS exposure on thyroid hormone homeostasis may differ between sexes.

AB  - Insufficient attention has been paid to how research can be leveraged to promote health policy or how locality-based research strategies, in particular community-based participatory research (CBPR), influences health policy to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. To address this gap, we highlighted the efforts of 2 CBPR partnerships in California to explore how these initiatives made substantial contributions to policymaking for health equity. We presented a new conceptual model and 2 case studies to illustrate the connections among CBPR contexts and processes, policymaking processes and strategies, and outcomes. We extended the critical role of civic engagement by those communities that were most burdened by health inequities by focusing on their political participation as research brokers in bridging evidence and policymaking.

AB  - Natural resource conflicts in Mali in the last decade represent an important case to visualise the interconnection between land and climate issues. The country has received significant international attention in recent years both due to the announcement of large-scale land deals and due to its perceived vulnerability to climate stress. At the same time, Malian peasant movements have formed important networks of resistance and have been leading the pilot implementation of village land commissions to recognise and manage community resources, based on a new Agricultural Land Law. This paper explores emerging trends in natural resource politics through the lens of interactions between land and climate policies and discourses. We analyse the growing use of the frame of 'climate security' to associate climate change, conflict and migration in relation to countries such as Mali, by looking into the possibilities that this frame could shift focus and blame towards conflicts between marginalised groups and further close space for bottom-up participation. As an alternative, we explore the relevance of a platform of agrarian climate justice and the possibilities and challenges of enacting some of its principles through the implementation of the village land commissions.

AB  - Objective: An innovative academic-community partnership studied daily decisions in communities of mostly Spanish-speaking, low-income residents of colonias in Hidalgo County, TX, about risk of exposure to fish contaminated by PCBs at an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site. Design and Sample: The team used focus group interviews with colonia residents and content analysis to assess knowledge of risk related to the Superfund site, the Donna Reservoir and Canal System. Results: (1) many lacked knowledge of the Superfund site contamination; (2) a few participants fished at the lake, knew people who did so, and consumed the catch, but most participants feared going there; (3) some participants remember receiving messages saying not to fish at the site, although they recalled nothing about contamination, but most participants knew of no such messages; (4) many use cell phones to get local information through personal networks and several Spanish-language news sources, but they have no consistent, culturally tailored local information source. Conclusions: The findings indicate the need for further efforts to design culturally tailored means of communication and messages to inform local communities widely about the dangers related to the Superfund site and thus decrease health disparities resulting from consuming fish from the site.

AB  - In the Pacific Northwest, control over lucrative and dwindling salmon fisheries have served as the primary source of contention between Native Americans and non-Indians for nearly 200 years. Despite the lopsided power dynamics favoring the states, and the commercial and recreational stakeholders whose interests are championed by State authority, fishing tribes have successfully infiltrated prevailing decision-making bodies and have taken a leading role in efforts to save the salmon from the perils of overfishing and habitat destruction utilizing a combination of scientific methods and traditional knowledge. This study examines the efforts of fishing tribes in Washington State to protect their customary and commercial fishing rights as a key project in a broader process of decolonizing state institutions that have historically controlled Indigenous resources as well as the entrenched ideological foundations that have historically devalued Native American culture. Examined through the lenses of racial formation, state-building and environmental justice theories, this case provides broader lessons for how scholars of social inequality can investigate the mechanisms through which racial inequality is both produced and resisted. Our findings contribute to undertheorized areas in the social inequality literature by taking history seriously, while paying particular attention to the ways that legal, political, and cultural mechanisms interact to reinforce systems of stratification or to reveal opportunities for meaningful resistance. Our analyses also foreground the role of human agency in successfully challenging long-standing legal and cultural foundations of racial inequality.

AB  - Most Americans live in neighborhoods and communities segregated along racial lines, and take this segregation for granted. To the extent they view their communities as racially segregated at all, they assume that this segregation is largely the result of individual choice, socio-economic status, or perhaps a remnant of de jute segregation. The ambition of this Article is to draw attention to a component of segregation that has been largely ignored: the significant role that criminal law and procedure have played, and continue to play, it? maintaining racialized spaces. This is not a matter of little consequence: spatial separateness allows social relationships to be structured along racial lines, which in turn has the effect of perpetuating and reinforcing social and economic inequality,. The thesis of this Article is straightforward: If we hope to achieve our goal of a more perfect union where true racial equality exists, it is critical that we examine and understand the link between policing, race, and place.

In this context, the development of a dynamic scene for a "wide and multiform information exchange" seems to have a particular strategic importance, more so if allowing for people to learn by participation. Therefore, we identified the Environmental Information Centres (EIC) as possible strategic divisions meant to develop non-formal and informal Environmental Education.

AB  - Open-pit coal mining in Cesar, Colombia increased by 74% between 2000 and 2012, generating environmental and social damages unacknowledged by companies and the state. This study aims to identify and value socio-environmental liabilities from coal mining at different stages of the coal life cycle. Environmental liabilities can be operationalized under three types of responsibilities: moral, legal, and economic. The identification of environmental liabilities allocates moral responsibility; the legal responsibility is needed for effective reparation; and the economic valuation provides arguments to claim compensation, seek remediation, and mitigation of damages. To identify socio-environmental liabilities, interviews were conducted and environmental mining conflicts were analyzed. To estimate monetary values, data were linked to existing literature on costs associated with damages. Results show that the economic values of socio-environmental liabilities per ton of extracted and exported coal are higher than the market price of coal. The main socio-environmental liabilities arise from pollution, local health deterioration, water table depletion, land and ecosystem services losses, damages from transportation and shipping, and coal reserve loss. A comparison with studies in China and the United States indicates that values increase when other health impacts and climate change on a global scale are included. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Maps of regional morbidity and mortality rates are useful tools in determining spatial patterns of disease. Combined with socio-demographic census information, they also permit assessment of environmental justice, i.e., whether certain subgroups suffer disproportionately from certain diseases or other adverse effects of harmful environmental exposures. Bayes and empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in smoothing crude maps of disease risk, eliminating the instability of estimates in low-population areas while maintaining geographic resolution. In this paper we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions. We apply our approach to a dataset of county-specific lung cancer rates in the state of Ohio during the period 1968-1988. The goal of this analysis is understanding the role played by a certain depleted uranium fuel processing facility on the elevated lung cancer rates in the counties that neighbor it.

AB  - Objective. Previous research has been unable to arrive at a consensus on the latent structure of environmental concern, yet without a grasp of the dimensionality of environmental concern our understanding of environmental policy support is necessarily limited. This research takes a different tack on this question by seeking to arrive at an understanding of the underlying dimensional nature of environmental policy support in the United States. Methods. This study analyzes a battery of questions from the National Election Study 1995 pilot. I use exploratory factor analysis, structural equations with maximum likelihood estimation (via EQS), and OLS regression to determine the statistical and substantive characteristics of the latent structure of environmental policy support. Results. Environmental policy support is shown to hold a monarchial hierarchical structure, where the second-order factor, environmental policy support, is comprised of three subdimensions. Further, I demonstrate that a substantive difference exists between these dimensions, as they are predicted by differing exogenous variables. Conclusions. I show environmental policy support to be a complex, multidimensional, and multilevel set of attitudes. Further, this research has implications for the environmental justice literature as it demonstrates that external efficacy and race are significant predictors of (only) the environmental quality assessment dimension.

AB  - Once fire-resistant rainforests are becoming fire prone. Uncontrolled fires reflect new ecologies of the Anthropocene, driven by interactions of multiple actors and sectors across scales. They threaten the ecological integrity of tropical forests, impact global climate regimes and importantly cause considerable social and economic burdens. Numerous smallholder farming communities throughout the forested tropics experience the immediate place-based damages of uncontrolled fires and increasingly flammable landscapes. However, these burdens remain largely 'invisible' as leading narratives concentrate on losses accrued at aggregate scales, including to climate and biodiversity. Rather, smallholder farmers are often cast as culprits of contagion rooted in colonial condemnation of their customary fire-based agricultural practices. We use an environmental justice lens, notably the dimensions of recognition and distribution, to reveal the distributional burdens of uncontrolled fires for these land managers. We use empirical data from four case studies in three countries: Brazil, Madagascar and the Philippines, to explore the i) burdens of uncontrolled fire, ii) changing risks, iii) drivers and iv) responses to uncontrolled fire, and finally, the v) level of smallholder dependence on intentional fire. We show that place-based burdens of uncontrolled landscape fire are significant, including in landscapes where fire frequency is low. Burdens are both material and non-material and include infringements on food security, health, livelihoods, social relations and the burden of prohibitive fire policy itself. Equitable responses to uncontrolled fires must be sensitive to the distinctions between fire types. Further, we suggest that through bringing visibility to the place-based burdens of uncontrolled fires, we can begin to co-design resilient responses that avoid placing the final burden of risk reduction on to marginalized smallholder farming communities.

AB  - In Detroit, Michigan, a non-profit organization responsible for planting street trees on city-owned property in neighborhoods received "no-tree requests" (NTR) from 24 percent of residents approached between 2011 and 2014. This example reflects a barrier to urban tree canopy improvement. Power dynamics between stakeholders can be a key reason for resistance to tree-planting. In this study, we sought a deeper understanding of perspectives on the uses and consequences of power in a street-tree planting program in Detroit, Michigan by answering three questions: Who wins? Who loses? Who decides? Interviews with city residents who submitted NTR or received trees, as well as those within the non-profit organization, provided data for this study. Results showed that the non-profit organization made decisions regarding which trees to plant in particular locations, and maintenance protocols. Many residents felt they "lost" with the tree-planting program (i.e. they were unable to have their values integrated into the tree-planting program) due to lack of decision-making involvement about tree species selection and maintenance responsibilities. Negative experiences with trees, particularly lack of city tree maintenance, contributed to residents' views of the problems with the tree-planting program. Those within the non-profit organization focused on educating residents about the benefits of trees to increase acceptance of tree-planting, and expected residents to participate in tree maintenance. These findings demonstrate the importance of providing information relevant to participants who serve as partners in long term stewardship of trees, and the need to include residents in decision-making to identify and achieve shared goals.

AB  - Non-profit organizations are key actors in urban and community forestry (UCF) initiatives, and sometimes city residents resist their efforts. Between 2011-2014, 24 percent of residents offered a street tree in Detroit, Michigan, USA submitted a "no-tree request." Differing views on decision-making emerged as a main reason for resistance to tree planting. This study used interviews with city residents, and those within a non-profit organization, between 2014-2016 to understand reasons for conflict over decision-making between these groups. Heritage narratives, or selective representations of the city's history and character, helped explain conflict over tree planting. Residents who wanted greater decision-making power in tree planting assumed they would be responsible for stewardship, reflecting their historical experiences within the city. The organization's dominant heritage narrative emphasized that residents held misperceptions of trees based on negative past experiences, and required education on benefits of trees. Recommendations for integrating heritage narratives into UCF efforts are provided.

AB  - Participation is increasingly used to legitimize and improve environmental decision making. However, in practice participants often find the process empty and frustrating. This has adverse consequences for environmental planning and consenting processes, where participants become disillusioned, and negative feelings develop into active opposition, causing delays, spiraling costs, and conflict. This paper addresses the gap between participatory ideals and unsatisfactory environmental decision-making in practice. We take a fresh look at how participatory ideals can be implemented and propose a new framework based on translating participatory ideals into practice. We identified commitments and values for fair and achievable participatory environmental decision-making from science and technology studies (STS), procedural environmental justice, and deliberative democracy. These were synthesized and organized into a set of principles (inclusivity, process-orientation, empowerment, and reflection) and then translated into "practical" criteria. The result is a new framework that links participatory ideals to practice.

AB  - Only recently has social work begun to grapple with its place in relation to environmental issues. While considerable progress has been made in bringing environmental considerations into the centre of our profession's scholarship and practice, this project is far from complete. Drawing on environmental literature and based on findings of a qualitative case study of water activism in one Canadian city, this paper argues that the concept of community resilience provides both a practical and a conceptual framework for advancing social work's engagement with issues of the natural environment and environmental justice through community praxis. Findings In Guelph, Ontario, Canada, water issues are the focal point of considerable community activism. The case study research reveals, however, that while water is the focus, much of this activism is driven by three broad social priorities that reflect ideas of community resilience and which suggest entry points for social work participation in community-based environmental initiatives: self-reliance and sustainability, localization and direct citizen participation, and community. Applications Community resilience is increasingly popular in environmental and community development fields as a conceptual framework for assessing and building the capacity of communities to support wellbeing in the face of environmental change, adversity and risk. While the concept of resilience is well established in social work, community resilience remains under-examined in social work literature. In this paper, the author draws attention to this arena of resilience thinking, highlighting its potential for the integration of considerations of the natural environment into social work scholarship, education, and practice.

AB  - Methane superemitters emit non-methane copollutants that are harmful to human health. Yet, no prior studies have assessed disparities in exposure to methane superemitters with respect to race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and civic engagement. To do so, we obtained the location, category (e.g., landfill, refinery), and emission rate of California methane superemitters from Next Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) flights conducted between 2016 and 2018. We identified block groups within 2 km of superemitters (exposed) and 5-10 km away (unexposed) using dasymetric mapping and assigned level of exposure among block groups within 2 km (measured via number of superemitter categories and total methane emissions). Analyses included 483 superemitters. The majority were dairy/manure (n = 213) and oil/gas production sites (n = 127). Results from fully adjusted logistic mixed models indicate environmental injustice in methane superemitter locations. For example, for every 10% increase in non-Hispanic Black residents, the odds of exposure increased by 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.17). We observed similar disparities for Hispanics and Native Americans but not with indicators of socioeconomic status. Among block groups located within 2 km, increasing proportions of non-White populations and lower voter turnout were associated with higher superemitter emission intensity. Previously unrecognized racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to California methane superemitters should be considered in policies to tackle methane emissions.

AB  - Policies to promote bicycle usage in the city of Seville, Spain, are analysed, focusing on the development of a public hire-cycle system, and utilising a survey sample of 1530 citizens in the main parts of the historical old town and generalised ordered logit models. Despite the system being well-received and there being a growing number of users and a major modal shift towards the bicycle, it has had to contend with protests and reticence from some sectors of the population. Political and ideological variables are significant, and citizens' philosophy of a global city'. A policy of this type demands a proper citizen consultation process and a suitable communication campaign to illustrate its advantages in terms of environmental protection and social justice, otherwise the risk is run of hostility turning to vandalism and endangering the scheme's economic viability.

AB  - Objective Globally, indoor and outdoor pollutants are leading risk factors for death and reduced quality of life. Few theories explicitly address environmental health within the nursing discipline with a focus on harmful environmental exposures. The objective here is to expand the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model to include the environmental health concepts of environmental endotype (causative pathway) and environmental exposure. Design Meleis' research to theory strategy for theory refinement was used. Research workshop proceedings, environmental health nursing research expert consensus, panelist research trajectories, and review of the literature were utilized as data sources. Results Ongoing emphasis on the physical environment as a key determinant of health and theoretical perspectives for including environmental exposures and endotypes in symptom science are presented. Definitions of these concepts, further developed, are provided. Recommendations to strengthen environmental health nursing research and practice through capacity building/infrastructure, methods/outcomes, translational/clinical research, and basic/mechanistic research are included. Conclusion The revised model deepens theoretical support for clinical actions that include environmental modification, environmental health education, and exposure reduction. This modification will enable a middle-range theory and shared mental model to inspire the prioritization of environmental health in nursing leadership, research, practice, and education.

AB  - Land acquisition often involves power and displacement and can be carried out on a large scale. There are many forms of land acquisition, including for environmental and conservation purposes as well as for production activities. While green grabbing has joined land grabbing as an environmental justice issue of concern, it is not necessarily the case that all green land acquisition is large scale, done by powerful outsiders, or leads to displacement and exclusion. The outcomes of green land acquisition are dependent on the mechanisms used, the adequacy of resettlement and/or compensation, and the social and environmental context in which it happens. We discuss the outcomes of community-led land acquisition for conservation purposes in Costa Rica. We considered a special case of green land acquisition done by local civil society to defend the forest and water resources of the Juan Castro Blanco National Water Park in Costa Rica. We used the literature on green grabbing, social ecological systems, and social innovation to discuss local environmental governance and regional sustainable development. This paper makes a fresh contribution to environmental planning and environmental governance by bringing in aspects of green land acquisition that have not been previously explored.

AB  - In recent years the processes of stakeholder involvement in power line development projects raised a critique of inflexible decision-making processes and calls for new participatory approaches. Given that attempts of Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to implement new forms of engagement are insufficient to explain the potential success behind stakeholders' participation, we investigated two cases in Norway characterized by high rates of acceptability, small opposition and satisfied stakeholders. In order to explain this phenomenon we conducted an experimental research based on an abductive procedure that has focused our attention on trust. Although trust has been mentioned by many scholars as important component of engagement processes, its multidimensionality has been presented in selective configurations. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights and empirical data, we develop the conceptual meaning of three dimensions of trust in grid extension projects: interpersonal, social and institutional; and we examine how they influence the stakeholder engagement process. Acknowledging diversified meanings of trust we suggest putting more attention to the informal aspects of stakeholder engagement. In this context, in order to build up trustworthy relationships with affected stakeholders, we propose recommendations to TSOs and respective decision-makers, addressing different trust dimensions.

AB  - Multivariate regression has been used extensively to determine if race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status is related to presence of pollution sources, quantity of pollutants emitted, toxicity of emissions, and other indicators of environmental health risk. Most previous studies assume observations and error terms to be spatially independent, thus violating one of the standard regression assumptions and ignoring spatial effects that potentially lead to incorrect inferences regarding explanatory variables. This chapter focuses on the problem of spatial autocorrelation in geospatial analysis of environmental justice and explores the application of simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models to control for spatial dependence in the data. A case study uses both traditional and SAR models to examine the distribution of cancer risk from exposure to vehicular emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the Tampa Bay MSA, Florida. Several approaches are explored to augment the standard regression equation, identify the neighborhood structure of each tract, and specify the spatial weights matrix that accounts for variations in cancer risk not predicted by explanatory variables. Results indicate that conventional regression analysis could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the role of race/ethnicity if spatial autocorrelation is ignored, and demonstrate the potential of SAR models to improve geospatial analysis of environmental justice and health disparities.

AB  - More than three decades since the emergence of the environmental justice (EJ) movement in the U. S., environmental injustices continue to unfold across the world to include new narratives of air and water pollution, as well as new forms of injustices associated with climate change, energy use, natural disasters, urban greenspaces, and public policies that adversely affect socially disadvantaged communities and future generations. This focus issue of Environmental Research Letters provides an interdisciplinary forum for conceptual, methodological, and empirical scholarship on EJ activism, research, and policy that highlights the continuing salience of an EJ perspective to understanding nature-society linkages. The 16 letters published in this focus issue address a variety of environmental issues and social injustices in multiple countries across the world, and advance EJ research by: (1) demonstrating how environmental injustice emerges through particular policies and political processes; (2) exploring environmental injustices associated with industrialization and industrial pollution; and (3) documenting unjust exposure to various environmental hazards in specific urban landscapes. As the discourse of EJ continues to evolve both topically and geographically, we hope that this focus issue will help establish research agendas for the next generation of EJ scholarship on distributive, procedural, participatory, and other forms of injustices, as well as their interrelationships.

AB  - In this article, we 1) develop and demonstrate an approach for assessing the population at risk to airborne releases of extremely hazardous substances, 2) examine the relationship between potential sources sources of hazards and the special needs population in a medium-sized metropolitan area (Cedar Rapids, Iowa), and 3) determine whether the distribution of environmental risks disproportionately impacts the special needs population. Our approach provides a comprehensive view of the risk burden imposed on the population by examining the effects of multiple sources of toxic releases. Disproportionate impacts are evaluated by comparing the existing distribution of the special needs population at risk to 1,000 randomly simulated distribution patterns. The results indicate that a significantly high proportion of the special needs population resides in areas susceptible to worst-case toxic releases.

AB  - Industrial development in India has rarely been studied through the perspective of environmental justice (EJ) such that the association between industrial development and significant economic and social inequalities remains to be examined. Our article addresses this gap by focusing on Gujarat in western India, a leading industrial state that exemplifies the designation of India as an emerging economy. We link the geographic concentration of industrial facilities classified as major accident hazard (MAH) units, further subdivided by size (large or medium/small) and ownership (public or private), to the socio-demographic composition of the population at the subdistrict (taluka) level. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) are used to analyze statistical associations between MAH unit density and explanatory variables related to the economic and social status of the residential population at the subdistrict level. Our results indicate a significant relationship between presence of socially disadvantaged populations (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) and density of all types of MAH units, except those associated with the public sector. Higher urbanization and lower home ownership are also found to be strong predictors of MAH unit density. Overall, our article represents an important step towards understanding the complexities of environmental inequalities stemming from Gujarat's industrial economy.

AB  - Objectives. To assess the environmental justice implications of flooding from Hurricane Harvey in Greater Houston, Texas, we analyzed whether the areal extent of flooding was distributed inequitably with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, after controlling for relevant explanatory factors. Methods. Our study integrated cartographic information from Harvey's Inundation Footprint, developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, with sociodemographic data from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses were based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations. Results. The areal extent of Harvey-induced flooding was significantly greater in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black and socioeconomically deprived residents after we controlled for contextual factors and clustering. Conclusions. Results provide evidence of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic injustices in the distribution of flooding and represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of disproportionate impacts associated with Hurricane Harvey. Public Health Implications. Our findings highlight the need to prepare for and address the unequal social consequences of climate change-related disasters, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity.

AB  - In Hartford, Connecticut, environmental health problems disproportionately affect poor and minority residents of the city. Minority group activists in Hartford have created a multiracial organization composed of urban and suburban residents to fight for environmental justice. The organization has achieved a measure of success in terms of governmental responsiveness to their concerns. This article highlights the strategies used by the organization to advance its interests. These strategies are framed within the minority empowerment and environmental justice literature to develop a theoretical explanation for the organization's success. Additionally, this article provides a model for other communities fighting for environmental justice.

AB  - Low-emission zones (LEZs) are core urban areas where vehicles that are deemed especially polluting are prohibited, in the hope of reducing the population's exposure to outdoor air pollution. LEZs have proliferated in Europe during the past decade. While an emerging body of literature considers LEZs' impacts on pollution, studies thus far have not tackled LEZs' impacts on mobility. This article uses household-travel survey data to assess how a projected LEZ in Grenoble, France could affect individuals' mobility, specifically enquiring whether or not the impact would be socially differentiated and might constitute a social injustice. Four likely scenarios are considered and logistic regressions show that, indeed, the probability that people will be affected by the LEZ is related to their social group. However, interpretations in terms of social justice may vary, depending on the reference population considered and hypotheses regarding the reduction of pollution exposure.

AB  - Placing the urban environment of Monterrey, Mexico at the center of our research, this paper examines how urban mobility intersects with gender and environmental justice. As a transdisciplinary team of scholars, artists, and activists, we examine the urban mobility discourses and discuss how transportation and urban narratives such as sustainable mobility and human cities reinforce: a) a car centered dominant narrative that maintains environmental and mobility injustices, and b) the socio-spatial segregation, exclusion, and accelerated gentrification processes in Monterrey. And, we discuss how these narratives exclude queer and feminist perspectives and their bodies. Using official and media reports we look at how the political and economic elites use narratives to prop up an imaginary of urban equality as part of a walkable and/or cycling city. These narratives maintain a status quo that includes new housing and transportation construction as part of an ongoing unjust system that we refer to as intersectional, in regards to gender, racism, socio-economic status, and age. We conclude environmental justice can only be achieved with mobility justice and that to achieve mobility justice we need to queer the city. To queer a city is when mobility patterns and connectivity of neighborhoods in the periphery are prioritized; when transparency mechanisms, gender perspectives and embodied experiences are the norm, and when aspiration includes achieving a less polluted, sustainable and equitable city.

AB  - In this qualitative study, we aim to identify suitable pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning green chemistry among college students and preservice teachers by examining the teaching methods that have been used to promote green chemistry education (GCE) and how these methods have supported green chemistry learning (GCL). We found 45 articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals since 2000 that specifically described teaching methods for GCE. The content of the articles was analyzed based on the categories of the teaching methods used and the revised version of Bloom's taxonomy. Among the selected articles, collaborative and interdisciplinary learning, and problem-based learning were utilized in 38 and 35 articles, respectively. These were the most frequently used teaching methods, alongside a general combination of multiple teaching methods and teacher presentations. Developing collaborative and interdisciplinary learning skills, techniques for increasing environmental awareness, problem-centered learning skills, and systems thinking skills featuring the teaching methods were seen to promote GCL in 44, 40, 34, and 29 articles, respectively. The results showed that the integration of green chemistry teaching (GCT), e.g., with sustainable education, promoted GCL by fostering environmental consciousness and behavioral change and cognitive processes in a sustainable direction.

AB  - Parks are acknowledged as assets for children, but children's access to parks and their quality is often inequitable. Previous studies have focused on disparities in the spatial distribution of parks. The purpose of this study is to explore park access by both the distribution and the quality of parks in relation to children's potential need. This study compared a broader assessment of park access, incorporating both proximity and quality with an index of park need rather than simple population size or a single measure of socio-economic status (SES). While proximity and quality were assessed by Network Analysis and PARK tool respectively, the index of park need was identified through multiple socio-demographic factors and co-variables. Comparison between the measures was both statistical and graphical. The statistical analysis, using multiple linear regression, determined the extent that park access correlated with park need. The graphical analysis identified spatial gaps between the measures. A protocol was built to increase park proximity and quality within these gaps to improve children's park access and meet their potential need for parks. The results of the comparison showed that park need was positively associated with park access to a significant extent (p < .001) accounting for 56% of the relationship. In the field of landscape and urban planning, this study is a model for examining broader park access and potential park need among children, ultimately improving their access to park proximity and quality, which addresses the corresponding park need.

AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization, parks are important assets for enhancing the quality of life in urban settings. They provide opportunities for outdoor physical activity, recreation, and therapeutic benefits. A growing number of park assessment studies are shifting their focus from spatial assessments such as availability, proximity, and accessibility, to nonspatial assessments such as park quality, park use, and park benefits. Consequently, arguments for developing methods of measuring these non-spatial dimensions of urban parks have emerged in the literature. The purpose of this study is to analyze and synthesize the different approaches used for assessing non-spatial dimensions of urban parks, including quality, use, and benefit, and draw implications for future urban landscape planning, design, and research. We explore the research purpose from the perspectives of how the existing protocols measure the non-spatial park dimensions, what limitations they have, and recommendations for future scholars to choose an existing protocol. The systematic study finds successive patterns and agreement with direct observation methods in the development of park quality protocols. We find protocols for park quality and use focus primarily on physical activity and do not measure non-spatial dimsneions ofurban parks and other uses such as social contact and relaxation. When compared to park quality and use, park benefit protocols are less developed and most are based on self-reported data, an opportunity for future research. For future scholars, study provides a list of recommended protocols for assessing park quality and use.

AB  - Over 40 years of regulations in the United States have failed to protect human and environmental health. We contend that these failures result from the flawed governance over the continued production, use, and disposal of toxic chemicals. To address this failure, we need to identify the broader social, political, and technological processes producing, knowing, and regulating toxic chemicals, collectively referred to as toxic chemical governance. To do so, we create a conceptual framework covering five key domains of governance: knowledge production, policy design, monitoring and enforcement, evaluation, and adjudication. Within each domain, social actors of varying power negotiate what constitutes acceptable risk, creating longer-term path dependencies in how they are addressed (or not). Using existing literature and five case studies, we discuss four paths for improving governance: evolving paradigms of harm, addressing bias in the knowledge base, making governance more equitable, and overcoming path dependency.

AB  - p-dichlorobenzene (PDCB) is a chlorinated volatile organic compound that can be encountered at high concentrations in buildings owing to its use as pest repellent and deodorant. This study characterizes PDCB concentrations in four communities in southeast Michigan. The median concentration outside 145 homes was 0.04 mu g/m3, and the median concentration inside 287 homes was 0.36 mu g/m3. The distribution of indoor concentrations was extremely skewed. For example, 30% of the homes exceeded 0.91 mu g/m3, which corresponds to a cancer risk level of 10-5 based on the California unit risk estimate, and 4% of homes exceeded 91 mu g/m3, equivalent to a 10-3 risk level. The single highest measurement was 4100 mu g/m3. Estimates of whole-house emission rates were largely consistent with chamber test results in the literature. Indoor concentrations that exceed a few mu g/m3 indicate the use of PDCB products. PDCB concentrations differed among households and the four cities, suggesting the importance of locational, cultural, and behavioral factors in the use patterns of this chemical. The high PDCB levels found suggest the need for policies and actions to lower exposures, for example, sales or use restrictions, improved labeling, and consumer education. Practical Implications Distributions of p-dichlorobenzene concentrations in residences are highly right-skewed, and a subset of houses has very elevated concentrations that are equivalent to an excess cancer risk of 10-3 or higher based on the California unit risk effect estimate. House-to-house variation is large, reflecting differences in use practices. Stronger policies and educational efforts are needed to eliminate or modify indoor usage practices of this chemical.

AB  - Many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are classified as known or possible carcinogens, irritants, and toxicants, and VOC exposure has been associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma. This study characterizes VOC levels in 126 homes of children with asthma in Detroit, Michigan, USA. The total target VOC concentration ranged from 14 to 2274 mu g/m(3) (mean = 150 mu g/m(3); median = 91 mu g/m(3)); 56 VOCs were quantified; and d-limonene, toluene, p, m-xylene, and ethyl acetate had the highest concentrations. Based on the potential for adverse health effects, priority VOCs included naphthalene, benzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, isopropylbenzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrachloroethene, and trichloroethylene. Concentrations varied mostly due to between-residence and seasonal variation. Identified emission sources included cigarette smoking, solvent-related emissions, renovations, household products, and pesticides. The effect of nearby traffic on indoor VOC levels was not distinguished. While concentrations in the Detroit homes were lower than levels found in other North American studies, many homes had elevated VOC levels, including compounds that are known health hazards. Thus, the identification and control of VOC sources are important and prudent, especially for vulnerable individuals. Actions and policies to reduce VOC exposures, for example, sales restrictions, improved product labeling, and consumer education, are recommended.

AB  - In recent years, research in climate science has increasingly emphasized the need to reduce fossil fuel supply in order to avoid an overshoot of the global carbon budget and to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global warming 'well below 2 degrees C'. This article aims to outline a balanced appreciation of the particular responsibility held by transnational oil and gas companies in the global challenge to organize an equitably managed decline in fossil fuel extraction. It does so by focusing on a case study. The latter consists of the stylized reconstruction of the internal social dynamics that shape the power structure of the French firm Total and of questioning its ability to make investment decisions aligned with the imperative to preserve the stability of the climate system, as its public position makes clear. The persistence of short-termed compensation schemes in the higher corporate hierarchy impedes the elaboration and implementation of deep decarbonization strategies at the firm level. These would imply a significant upscaling of investments in renewable energy and/or carbon-capture storage technologies, in order to avoid the foreseeable destruction of corporate jobs linked to oil and gas extraction in an increasingly carbon-constrained world.

AB  - New environmental rights were introduced in Argentina with the 1994 amendments to the 1853 national constitution. This constitutional recognition of environmental rights is a fundamental step in the advancement of environmental justice and citizenship, but it is not enough. When and how do environmental rights become effective? Under what circumstances are environmental rights effectively applied and enforced? We claim that participation is the key mechanism through which constitutionally enacted environmental rights become effective. More specifically, we argue that the embodiment of constitutional environmental rights in concrete policies and practices are propelled by the combination of contentious and institutionalized modes of participation. Based on evidence from two contrasting and salient casesriver sanitation in the Metropolitan Buenos Aires Region and open-pit mining in Andean Argentinathis article discusses how the combination of different modes of participation has been an effective channel for the enforcement and effectiveness of environmental rights.

AB  - Municipalities across the United States are prioritizing green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) projects due to their potential to concurrently optimize the social, economic, and environmental benefits of the "triple bottom line". While placement of these features is often based on biophysical variables regarding the natural and built environments, highly urbanized areas often exhibit either limited data or minimal variability in these characteristics. Using a case study of Philadelphia and building on previous work to prioritize GSI features in disadvantaged communities, this study addresses the dual concerns of the inequitable benefits of distribution and suitable site placement of GSI using a model to evaluate and integrate social variables to support decision making regarding GSI implementation. Results of this study indicate locations both suitable and optimal for the implementation of four types of GSI features: tree trenches, pervious pavement, rain gardens, and green roofs. Considerations of block-level site placement assets and liabilities are discussed, with recommendations for use of this analysis for future GSI programs.

AB  - Many previous environmental justice (EJ) studies have argued that there is disproportionate collocation of environmental disamenities with racial and ethnic minorities, even holding constant other factors such as income and political action. However, most of the EJ studies do not account for the presence of spatial autocorrelation, especially those that also include nonnormal distributions. Using the location of new Toxics Release Inventory facilities (TRIFs) in Maricopa County, Arizona in the 1990s, we illustrate a finding of spatial autocorrelation and the use of Bayesian spatial models to accommodate the issue. The results show that the relationship between Asian minority status in a census tract and new TRIF establishments found with regression models does not remain statistically significant once spatial autocorrelation is accounted for. Instead, three variables, the percentage of American Indians in the tract, population density, and the percentage of residents aged 5574, statistically significantly explained new TRIF establishments. This illustrates that failure to control for spatial autocorrelation can lead to incorrect policy understanding.

AB  - Multi-purpose marine protected areas (MPAs) are prevalent world-wide as institutional mechanisms deployed in the marine environment to manage multiple uses, conserve resources and protect ecosystems. Yet some people may experience disadvantage following the implementation of new MPAs. One understudied aspect of MPAs is the distribution of advantages and disadvantages and how best to address the "justice" concerns that they raise. This article identifies a framework of principles, methods and tools to address these concerns. It devises a "MPA justice model" and demonstrates its applicability to a Taiwanese case study. In 2014, Taiwan proclaimed its first multiple-purpose MPA, the South Penghu Marine National Park and the case study shows ways that the MPA's socio-economic sustainability could have been better accomplished. The article focuses on future MPA establishment that incorporates distributional fairness and procedural legitimacy into MPA site designation and zoning design - but might also be adapted to use retrospectively in MPA review processes.

AB  - Over the last decade, there has been increasing interest among geographers in a critical perspective on studies of transportation and mobility, or studies that take into account the power relations within systems of transportation that produce space, place, mobility, and/or identity. This ever-growing body of work includes people who might not consider themselves as transportation geographers per se, but nevertheless are expanding geographies of transportation beyond the traditional focus on vehicles, infrastructure, and economics. In this article, we review such work from three different perspectives: critical studies of professional practice, the interdisciplinary approach of Caribbean Studies, and the work of activists and scholar-activists to connect environmental justice with mobility justice.

AB  - Institutions are important to enhance the contribution of mining industries not only to economic growth, but also to environmental justice and equality. In this paper, we study the processes by which four Latin American countries modified their existing institutions to manage the effects or large-scale mining in their territories. We focus on the political struggles to introduce legislation to restrict the geographical expansion of large-scale mining in their territories. To this end, we integrate a leading theory of the policy process with theoretical insights from studies of environmental governance and political settlements. Our findings show that processes of policy change followed distinct paths with common elements. The elements that link the initial conditions with change are policy learning, challenges to dominant policy images, conflict expansion, and the involvement of veto players. We also observe that the outputs of the reforms diverge significantly. Three contextual variables contributed to the variability of the outputs of these reforms; the degree of cohesion of elites, the degree of development of environmental institutions, and the relative dependency on mineral revenues. During the processes of policy making, these institutions offered different opportunities and constraints for policy challengers to advance their agenda and for dominant actors to maintain the status quo. The new policy designs offer opportunities for countries to deal with the effects of mining on sensitive ecosystems but political instability threatens the long-term institutionalization of these reforms.

AB  - Mega-fires are expected to increase in the Western United States. The state of the science suggests that the best mitigation to prevent destructive forest fires is to reintroduce ecologically beneficial fire, but this can only be accomplished with public support. The objective of this study is to identify the concerns of citizens in central California adjacent to the fire-prone Sierra Nevada Mountains who generate formal complaints about smoke exposure from forest fires. Twenty-seven smoke complaints from 2009 to 2013 were analysed from two air pollution control districts operating in this area. The complaints were submitted via email, letter, or phone to their respective air pollution control districts. Complaint transcripts were reviewed using standard qualitative data analysis procedures. The primary concerns recorded were that smoke from the fires caused health problems, required lifestyle change, and negatively impacted the local economy. Complaints often incorporated statements communicating dislike or mistrust of current forest fire policy and management and suggested no amount of smoke was acceptable. For these formal complaints, the solution was an immediate stop to the burning. The findings of this study can be used to develop appropriate communication and educational campaigns.

AB  - Oil and gas development has led to environmental hazards and community concerns, particularly in relation to water supply issues. Filing complaints with state agencies enables citizens to register concerns and seek investigations. We evaluated associations between county-level socio-economic and demographic factors, oil and gas drilling, and three outcomes in Pennsylvania between 2004 and 2016: number of oil and gas complaints filed, and both the number and proportion of state investigations of water supply complaints yielding a confirmed water supply impairment (i.e., "positive determination"). We used hierarchical Bayesian Poisson and binomial regression analyses. From 2004 to 2016, 9,404 oil and gas-related complaints were filed, of which 4,099 were water supply complaints. Of those, 3,906 received investigations, and 215 yielded positive determinations. We observed a 47% increase in complaints filed per $10,000 increase in annual median household income (MHI) (Rate Ratio [RR]: 1.47, 95% credible interval [CI]: 1.09-1.96) and an 18% increase per 1% increase in educational attainment (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.11-1.26). While the number of complaints filed did not vary by race/acethnicity, the odds of a complaint yielding a positive determination were 0.81 times lower in counties with a higher proportion of marginalized populations (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.81 per 1% increase in percent Black, Asian, and Native American populations combined, 95% CI: 0.64-0.99). The odds of positive determinations were also lower in areas with higher income (OR per $10,000 increase in MHI: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.09-0.96). Our results suggest these relationships are complex and may indicate potential environmental and procedural inequities, warranting further investigation.

AB  - Justice has become important in public and private consideration of the environment, but a number of different ways of operationalizing justice can be seen. Previous literature suggests that principles stressing responsibility and the public good are more common than need and equity in thinking about environmental issues. The results from two questionnaire studies, presented here, confirm that environmental justice-responsibility to other species and to future generations, and the rights of the environment-emerges as the most highly rated consideration in resolving environmental conflicts and that this factor is distinct from traditional procedural and distributive justice factors. Highlighting the individual or the collective makes different justice principles salient bur that the effect depends on one 's original position.

AB  - In May 2017, a two-day workshop was held in Los Angeles (California, U.S.A.) to gather practitioners who work with low-cost sensors used to make air quality measurements. The community of practice included individuals from academia, industry, non-profit groups, community-based organizations, and regulatory agencies. The group gathered to share knowledge developed from a variety of pilot projects in hopes of advancing the collective knowledge about how best to use low-cost air quality sensors. Panel discussion topics included: (1) best practices for deployment and calibration of low-cost sensor systems, (2) data standardization efforts and database design, (3) advances in sensor calibration, data management, and data analysis and visualization, and (4) lessons learned from research/community partnerships to encourage purposeful use of sensors and create change/action. Panel discussions summarized knowledge advances and project successes while also highlighting the questions, unresolved issues, and technological limitations that still remain within the low-cost air quality sensor arena.

AB  - Infrastructure governance has emerged as a subject of critical interest in the current 'infrastructure turn' whereby fragmented governance approaches sit in tension with complex demands for infrastructure transformations within contexts of multiple intersecting crises. To understand the state of the literature and inform ongoing debates, a systematic review method is used to interrogate a large body of infrastructure governance literature across sectoral boundaries. This review identifies a range of literature gaps prevailing in the areas of infrastructure governance on unceded First Nations land, the societal end goals of infrastructure, and understandings and applications of integrated governance.

AB  - Objectives. I assessed the distribution of relative health risk from industrial air pollution in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the extent to which risk was disproportionately attributable to a minority of facilities. Methods. I spatially linked data on airborne emissions, health risk, and sociodemographics by census tract, coupling disproportionality measurements from 2 perspectives: the health risk borne by communities and the harms produced by individual polluters. Results. Of Milwaukee's 307 census tracts, 90 warranted the highest environmental justice concern. Striking variations in risk production existed between industrial polluters. Of 299 facilities with reported emissions, 30 (10%) contributed 90% of all health risk. Conclusions. This research adds to an emerging body of work connecting environmental health risk, environmental justice, and corporate responsibility. Findings support the hypothesis that relatively few heavy polluters create most environmental health risk. Environmental policy often devotes insufficient attention to such outliers, in part because of the questionable assumption that pollution is economically necessary for jobs or essential products. Increased emphasis on risk-based targeting of the worst polluters could significantly improve environmental quality and health in overburdened communities.

AB  - Numerous environmental justice (EJ) studies demonstrate that U.S. racial and ethnic minorities experience disparate hazard exposures, but we lack knowledge about how the societal distribution of risk varies between hazard types and how neighborhood-level racial residential segregation influences patterns of environmental injustice. We address those limitations by comparatively analyzing disparities in exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone (O-3) across census tracts of the contiguous United States and by elucidating the role of local racial residential segregation in structuring environmental injustices based on minority versus White neighborhood composition. Results indicate divergent societal patterns of exposure to the two pollutants. Tracts with higher PM2.5 have greater proportions of Hispanic, Black, and Asian and Pacific Islander residents, whereas tracts with increased O-3 have lower proportions of those racialized groups. Additionally, we find that local multigroup racial residential segregation modifies the effect of minority versus White composition on PM2.5 exposures, such that residents of segregated minority neighborhoods breathe air laden with more PM2.5, whereas those in segregated White neighborhoods inhale air with less PM2.5. We find the opposite pattern for O-3. Our comparative EJ perspective illuminates how the association between privileged Whiteness and O-3 pollution is neither unjust nor equalizes the distribution of risk.

AB  - Noise from road and air traffic is known to harm human health, reduce mobility and accessibility, undermine community well-being, precipitate socio-environmental conflict, and depress land values. However, there have been surprisingly few studies of social inequities in noise exposure in the United States (US). This is the first US national-level study of social inequities in residential noise exposure from transport sources. We integrated data on the socio-demographic characteristics of census tracts in the continental US (n = 70,780) with the most advanced spatial estimates of road and aviation transport noise available. Using bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that account for geographic clustering and effects of other relevant variables, we tested for social disparities in road and aviation noise exposure across US census tracts. Noise from road vs. aviation transport sources was not highly correlated, yet results revealed a clear, convergent pattern of higher road and aviation noise exposures for census tracts characterized by lower socioeconomic status (i.e., higher deprivation and proportion renter occupancy) and greater proportions of Hispanic, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, and middle/working-aged residents. Overall, findings indicate that American neighborhoods with high concentrations of racial/ethnic minority and economically deprived residents bear the brunt of transport noise exposures. Given this study's scope and findings, policy actions to reduce social disparities in transport noise exposures nationwide are warranted.

AB  - Neighborhood level air pollution represents a long-standing issue for many communities that, until recently, has been difficult to address due to the cost of equipment and lack of related expertise. Changes in available technology and subsequent increases in community-based participatory research (CBPR) have drastically improved the ability to address this issue. However, much still needs to be learned as these types of studies are expected to increase in the future. To assist, we review the literature in an effort to improve understanding of the motivations, approaches, and outcomes of air monitoring studies that incorporate CBPR and citizen science (CS) principles. We found that the primary motivations for conducting community-based air monitoring were concerns for air pollution health risks, residing near potential pollution sources, urban sprawl, living in "unmonitored" areas, and a general quest for improved air quality knowledge. Studies were mainly conducted using community led partnerships. Fixed site monitoring was primarily used, while mobile, personal, school-based, and occupational sampling approaches were less frequent. Low-cost sensors can enable thorough neighborhood level characterization; however, keeping the community involved at every step, understanding the limitations and benefits of this type of monitoring, recognizing potential areas of debate, and addressing study challenges are vital for achieving harmony between expected and observed study outcomes. Future directions include assessing currently unregulated pollutants, establishing long-term neighborhood monitoring sites, performing saturation studies, evaluating interventions, and creating CS databases.

AB  - Maroons originate from armed self-emancipation against enslavement in the Americas, with Jamaica hosting Maroon communities now organized as ethnoculturally distinct polities. Maroon ethnogenesis and struggle gave rise to an environmental ethos in which the features of local ecosystems are deeply intertwined with collective historical memory and spiritual life. The Accompong Maroons of Jamaica harness within their social order a distinct approach to environmental protection grounded in ancestral connections to the land, described here as Maroon Ecology. This ethos drives their struggle against extractive industry, the actions of which the Maroons find detrimental to the integrity of their land and autonomy. The praxis of Maroon Ecology locates Maroon struggle within the global environmental justice movement, diverging from dominant Jamaican environmentalism by demanding sovereignty and territorial redistribution as a part of environmental protection. This latest iteration of Accompong's legacy of resistance positions the Maroons as key actors in Caribbean environmental and development politics.

AB  - In this work, we aimed to identify the contribution of a municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) to the air contamination of a complex urbanized area of N Italy using lichen transplants as biomonitors, and to compare the values of contamination with the data of socio-economic deprivation of the population living in the area. The method adopted allowed the identification of the elements of atmospheric origin that contaminate the study area. Although not distinguishable from the background, the contribution of the MSWI could be apportioned and mercury emerged as atmospheric tracer. Although not posing immediate risk, it is advisable to monitor in time the accumulation of Hg in biological systems. Consistently with similar studies, in the surrounding of the MSWI, we observed also the highest socio-economic deprivation. Overall, we found a close correlation between socio-economic deprivation and air pollution, clearly showing that the most disadvantaged population is clustered in the most polluted areas.

AB  - It will be argued in this paper that the problematic of social cohesion is also one of socio-ecological cohesion whereby the urbanisation of nature and its socio-environmentally enabling and disabling conditions are key processes. By viewing the contradictions of the urbanisation process as intrinsically socio-ecological ones, the terrain of social cohesion is shifted both epistemologically and politically. The paper critically examines three contemporary schools of thought that consider in different ways the relationship between cities, social cohesion and the environment. It begins with a critical examination of the notion of urban sustainability. The paper will then move on to consider two approaches that emphasise issues of (in)equality and (in)justice in the urban environment, those of environmental justice and urban political ecology. The final part of the paper pinpoints four areas of research that urban researchers must examine if we are to understand more fully-and act more politically on-the nexus between cities, social cohesion and the environment.

AB  - Most collective agroecological initiatives in Europe today are built around a plurality of knowledge systems. Going beyond the well-documented instrumental goals of this knowledge-plurality, this paper highlights another, perhaps less obvious objective: the pursuit of recognition and cognitive justice. The subordination of alternative farming practices, such as agroecology, to industrial high-input farming leads to the misrecognition of peasant communities. Challenging industrial agriculture hence requires both equality between different forms of doing farming and an active engagement with different ways of knowing farming. Cognitive justice, a concept originating in decolonial thought, encompasses not only the right of different practices to co-exist, but entails an active engagement across their knowledge-systems. Using an example of participatory maize breeding in France, the paper illustrates how peasant movements in Europe organize an 'agroecology of knowledges', a counter-hegemonic engagement with modern agronomic science, through the recovery and co-production of situational, environment-specific knowledge, and the reskilling of farmers. It aims not only at improving agricultural science, but also at rebuilding collective identities and reclaiming autonomy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intersecting systems of land use and transportation access, employment opportunities, employer roles, and neighborhood dynamics shape commuting experiences among people of color and other marginalized communities, but how they do so is not well known. This study adopts a qualitative approach to identify understudied and interconnected factors in the transportation experiences of disadvantaged job seekers in Chicago, especially those identifying as Black who commute without cars. Majority Black job seekers in focus group discussions reported a complex web of transportation barriers to employment, including those related to geographic and schedule mismatches, resulting in lost opportunities and heavy commute burdens. Job seekers desire closer quality jobs and more coordination between employers and transit agencies. Respondents suggested that employers, who are sometimes biased toward hiring those with personal vehicles, are personally unaware of transportation experiences that the entry-level workforce faces. Findings showed that job access strategies for disadvantaged workers need broader understandings of lived-rather than solely modeled-job accessibility. Accessibility assessments will be overly optimistic without accounting for security concerns that exist in some locations and that disproportionately affect people of color. Although transportation improvements are vital, the findings showed that transportation strategies are insufficient without holistic strategies, such as equitable community and economic development.

AB  - In this paper, we present an analysis of the relationship between pedestrian-vehicle crashes and characteristics of areas with high low-income and minority populations in the Chicago metropolitan area (also called environmental justice or EJ areas in the United States). While related research has indicated that pedestrian crashes occur more frequently in these areas than in non-EJ areas, this paper attempts to relate the incidence to environmental characteristics and behavioral factors through a better understanding of the contributing factors present in crash occurrences in EJ versus non-EJ areas. Specially constructed small-area factors from a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) are used to explain pedestrian-vehicle crashes. Using a Poisson model that corrects for underreporting, we find that pedestrian crash incidents in EJ areas are related to variables of exposure (including the suitability of the area for walking and transit accessibility), crime rates, transit availability, and general population demographics such as income and presence of children. Results suggest that it may be necessary to better incorporate a safety perspective or measures of safety improvements in pedestrian and transit improvements and expansion programs within EJ areas.

AB  - Maternalist framing has been a consistent part of a long history of powerful, often successful organizing for environmental protection and justice. Yet today's calls on individuals to simultaneously engage in proenvironmental behavior and to protect themselves from environmental threats through consumption have mobilized maternal discourse in a way that is likely demobilizing in the long run. Indeed, the increasing individualization of the environmental movement is intersecting with persistent, unequal gendered structures of labor in a way that places the burden of environmentalism and environmental risk management on women and mothers. I argue that precautionary consumption and other forms of individualized environmental risk management add to the "third shift," on top of the disproportionate burden of household labor and care work that women already face. This phenomenon is concerning because it has the potential to (1) limit women's engagement in other forms of environmental advocacy and leadership, and to (2) reproduce existing gender inequalities not only between men and women but also among women of different levels of race and class privilege. Thus, the increasing individualization of the environmental movement also potentially exacerbates environmental injustice at the household level. Despite such emerging concerns, the domestic scale remains an often overlooked site of environmental harm and gendered burden.

Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions-approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making.

AB  - Like other risk management strategies, effective sea level rise response must suit local socio-ecological contexts. These include particular civic discourses, perceptions of agency, and analytic deliberation, the latter integrating scientific information with local knowledge and social values. We describe three cases in eastern North Carolina, in the southeastern United States, with differing conceptions of economic development, environmental change, governance, property rights, and social collectivities. On the flat coastal plain and barrier islands, wetland conservation, soft engineering, and other coastal zone management options can protect shorelines from flooding and erosion, whereas hard engineered structures can cause long term problems. Fearing that scientific information would lower real estate values, a well-financed advocacy group averted public discussion of proactive policy by deploying discursive and legislative strategies to suppress scientific decision support. We find that a study site with high financial resources showed the most resistance to science-based adaptation in the public interest, whereas a study site with minimal financial resources was the most receptive. Ideology proves to be a significant consideration in the framing of information to advance coastal policy.

AB  - New technologies and rising energy prices have resulted in many energy companies investing significant amounts of capital in rural America. Much of the recent focus of energy companies has been on the development of shale oil and natural gas. We examine the differences in levels of support and opposition to shale oil and gas development, building on the literatures of the growth-machine coalition, polluter-industrial complex, and environmental justice. Specifically, we examine different frames of shale development held by government leaders and the public who reside above the New Albany shale play in Southern Illinois and Northwest Kentucky. Using a combination of interview, survey, and participant observation data, we find that government officials emphasize economic growth and many support shale development. While most government leaders claimed that there was not a major division in their communities about shale development, we found the public to be split, with a large countercoalition to shale development in existence.

AB  - New technologies coupled with high energy prices, a desire for energy independence, and cleaner energy, have led to many energy companies investing large amounts of capital into rural places. In the last decade, along with solar and wind, unconventional shale oil and gas production has risen steeply throughout the United States (U.S. Energy Information Administration, Drilling productivity report, 2018) boosting economic growth and stimulating wealth creation in many communities. Because farmers own or operate over half of rural lands in the lower 48 states, the possibility is high for shale development to contribute to the financial well-being of farmers with land in shale regions. However, by focusing on the large royalties of some landowners, environmental and social risks that farmers encounter may be overlooked. To address the gap of farmer impacts, I examine the experiences and perceptions of crop farm owners who reside in two established shale plays: the Bakken region in North Dakota and the Marcellus region in Pennsylvania and in one emerging shale play: the New Albany region in Southern Illinois. I survey farm owners of both large and small crop farms, who farm a variety of crops both by conventional and organic methods. By having such a diverse sample of farm owners in both established shale plays and emerging shale plays, I explore how farmers' experiences differ with respect to their finances and investments, environmental degradation as well as how their perceptions of trust in oil and gas companies and community rifts differ.

AB  - In order to better understand the intersections of environmental communication, advocacy and materiality, this project analyzes how Seattle's Bullitt Center embodies and enacts messages that offer arguments in favor of changing attitudes and behaviors through its spatial and material design. Through a rhetorical analysis of the building's design, media coverage of the site, and interviews with the designers, the author offers a case study that illuminates the importance of architecture and materiality in environmental discourse. By encouraging behavior-change in tenants, shaping industry practices and standards, persuading manufacturers to reformulate products, and challenging existing municipal policies, the building reacts to the environment, humans and policies in ways that underscore its agentic capacity and its durability as a material environmental argument. Ultimately the Bullitt Center modifies our understanding of the persuasive power of architecture and the role of advocacy in campaigns for sustainability.

AB  - Over the last decade, poverty law scholars and practitioners have engaged in a lively debate about the relationship between law and social change. What has emerged from this dialogue is a new community-based approach to progressive lawyering that combines legal advocacy and grassroots action in a form of practice that this Article terms "law and organizing." The law and organizing model privileges movement politics over law reform efforts and suggests that lawyers should facilitate community mobilization rather than practice in the conventional mode. In the academy, this model has attracted heightened attention from legal scholars dissatisfied with the Potential of litigation efforts to produce meaningful social change. On the ground, lawyers have deployed organizing tactics to achieve significant gains for marginalized communities. Yet, although it holds out rich possibilities, the law and organizing paradigm is still largely unrested as a practical strategy and has not been subjected to close academic scrutiny. This Article initiates a critical reflection on law and organizing by providing a historical account of its evolution, examining how poverty lawyers are incorporating organizing into their day-to-day practice, and analyzing some of the structural, practical, and ethical issues posed by this new approach.

AB  - Lead (Pb) poisoning is a major public health concern in environmental justice communities of the USA and in many developing countries. There is no identified safety threshold for lead in blood, as low-level Pb exposures can lead to severe toxicity in highly susceptible individuals and late onset of diseases from early-life exposure. However, identifying "susceptibility genes" or "early exposure biomarkers" remains challenging in human populations. There is a considerable variation in susceptibility to harmful effects from Pb exposure in the general population, likely due to the complex interplay of genetic and/or epigenetic factors. This systematic review summarizes current state of knowledge on the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in determining individual susceptibility in response to environmental Pb exposure in humans and rodents. Although a number of common genetic and epigenetic factors have been identified, the reviewed studies, which link these factors to various adverse health outcomes following Pb exposure, have provided somewhat inconsistent evidence of main health effects. Acknowledging the compelling need for new approaches could guide us to better characterize individual responses, predict potential adverse outcomes, and identify accurate and usable biomarkers for Pb exposure to improve mitigation therapies to reduce future adverse health outcomes of Pb exposure.

AB  - In an age of accelerating wealth at the very top and accelerating risks at the bottom, there is a clear disjunction between the flow of social benefits and social damages produced by different actors and their share of these respective benefits and damages. Yet, the specific processes that generate the dualization of tracks of accumulation of rewards or accumulation of risks and precarity are still up for debate. In tackling this dual process in a way that is attuned to the critical contribution of contemporary forms of the law to this uneven accumulation of wealth and of risks, this paper focuses on organized irresponsibilitywhere individuals can cumulatively contribute to risks, but avoid individual culpabilityand how relations of organized irresponsibility provide extensive opportunities for risk arbitrage. Risk arbitrage is correspondingly a process where actors, whether it be individuals or larger organizations, can produce social risk, appropriate benefit from these risks, and disproportionately avoid the consequences of the risks so as to benefit from the overall cycle of reward and riskeven if society as a whole is worse off. The paper identifies organized irresponsibility as fundamentally undergirded by mismatches between existing configurations of law and the existing complexity of the processes of the production of social goods and risks. This paper proceeds to show how gaps in the law enable the organized irresponsibility principlethat given a level of risk production, the greater the number of actors involved and the greater complexity between causes and the risk's impacts, the less overall culpability that tends to be assigned. It then shows how the organized irresponsibility principle enables relationships of risk arbitrage that intensify contemporary risk and inequality.

AB  - In this article, I review recent research showing that even relatively low levels of pollution can affect infants' health. This research attempts to go beyond documenting correlations by using sharp changes in pollution levels, carefully selecting control groups (including unexposed siblings as controls for exposed children), and considering behavioral responses to pollution such as maternal mobility. Poor and minority children are more likely to be affected, and differential exposure could be responsible for some of the observed group-level differences in health at birth. Policy makers concerned about the roots of inequality should consider the role played by environmental exposures of pregnant mothers.

AB  - In September 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor issued a new policy paper detailing the Office of the Prosecutor's (OTP) priorities for case selection and prioritization, including giving a 'particular consideration to prosecuting Rome Statute crimes that are committed by means of, or that result in, inter alia, the destruction of the environment, the illegal exploitation of natural resources or the illegal dispossession of land'. This new commitment of the OTP in fighting environmental devastation has been received enthusiastically by civil society and alleged victims. Indeed, few would disagree that protecting the environment against harmful conduct and conserving the world's natural resources are some of the most compelling challenges faced by the international community. Further, the negative impact of environmental destruction on human rights and peace and security is a matter of concern for many international institutions, including the Security Council. This article considers the merits and limits of prosecuting environmental destruction before the ICC. It contends that the significance and practical implications of the OTP's green shift ought to be appreciated against the constraints posed by existing criminal provisions (which have already received attention in the literature) and, more significantly, factual and structural challenges that have been more peripheral in the academic debate. Accordingly, the article suggests possible ways to overcome some of these obstacles. The article concludes by reflecting on the necessity to strike a balance between the OTP's commendable policy shift, victims' and environmental activists' expectations, and the ICC's possible contribution to 'environmental justice'.

AB  - Objectives. We used an environmental justice screening tool (CalEnviroScreen 1.1) to compare the distribution of environmental hazards and vulnerable populations across California communities. Methods. CalEnviroScreen 1.1 combines 17 indicators created from 2004 to 2013 publicly available data into a relative cumulative impact score. We compared cumulative impact scores across California zip codes on the basis of their location, urban or rural character, and racial/ethnic makeup. We used a concentration index to evaluate which indicators were most unequally distributed with respect to race/ethnicity and poverty. Results. The unadjusted odds of living in one of the 10% most affected zip codes were 6.2, 5.8, 1.9, 1.8, and 1.6 times greater for Hispanics, African Americans, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and other or multiracial individuals, respectively, than for non-Hispanic Whites. Environmental hazards were more regressively distributed with respect to race/ethnicity than poverty, with pesticide use and toxic chemical releases being the most unequal. Conclusions. Environmental health hazards disproportionately burden communities of color in California. Efforts to reduce disparities in pollution burden can use simple screening tools to prioritize areas for action.

Statistical and spatial correlations between the 6 indices were computed for individual South Carolina facilities. Results. Although the 6 toxicity indices are not highly correlated in theory, they have more commonality in practice, There was significant spatial variation in the indices by individual facility level. Conclusions. Environmental justice researchers must be cognizant of differences in toxicity indices because the choice of the toxicity measure can alter (statistically and spatially) the results of equity analyses and lead to erroneous conclusions.

AB  - Local parks and walkable neighborhoods are commonly cited as elements of the urban environment that promote physical activity and reduce obesity risk. When those vulnerable to obesity-related diseases live in neighborhoods without these qualities, it works against environmental justice goals that aim for a fair distribution of amenities. We use geographic information systems (GIS) to evaluate the relationship between the distribution of populations vulnerable to obesity and proximity to parks and walkable street networks in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Though previous studies have used GIS to assess the distribution of access to opportunities for physical activity, none have analyzed access to both parks and walkable resources at once. Neither have they included data that reflects findings on a smaller scale indicating that perceptions of resource quality, safety. and cultural relevance also affect physical activity levels. We include these safety and quality factors in our study through statistical data on traffic fatalities, crime rates and park size. We find that, counter to predictions, subpopulations generally considered vulnerable to obesity (and environmental injustices more generally) are more likely to live in walkable neighborhoods and have better walking access to neighborhood parks than other groups in Phoenix. However, crime is highest in walkable neighborhoods with large Latino/a and African-American populations and parks are smaller in areas populated by Latino/as. Given the higher prevalence of obesity and related diseases in lower income and minority populations in Phoenix, the results suggest that benefits of built environments may be offset by social characteristics. Our most consistent finding indicates a strong negative relationship between the percentage of the population under 18 years of age living in an area and the likelihood that the structure of the built environment supports physical activity. Children under 18 are significantly underrepresented in regions deemed highly walkable and those with access to parks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In today's society, the traditional point-source, risk-based approaches employed in environmental policy need to be expanded to include solutions that pay more attention to diffuse emissions from products, and the problems of increasing consumption. Whereas point-source pollution has been cut significantly in many industrialized countries, we see how waste, chemicals, transport, and other diffuse environmental problems along the product life cycle have been more problematic to address through policy-making. Targeting the product and its life cycle provides a more integrated approach to these problems. But as product chains are increasingly international in nature, the challenges for policy-making increase. National policies are of limited use, and are often challenged by actors employing free trade arguments. The increased importance of standards has raised a number of issues related to environment and trade. At the most fundamental level, there is often a tension. One concern is that standardization is in most cases - an industry-driven process, and an increased use of standards rather than mandatory regulation may enhance the power of industry at the expense of governments and citizens, which may have limited access to the standard-making bodies. There is currently a lot of discussion on how consumer and environmental interest groups may get better access to the standard-making processes. Another important issue is how environmental criteria addressing environmental impacts from the product life cycle concerns could be integrated in standards in a meaningful way. Thirdly, a very hot topic relates to how product standards adopted in the industrialized world, with little or no consulting of developing countries, affects suppliers in developing countries and may pose a barrier for market access. Finally, there is a tension between industry's legitimate preference for global standards which would be beneficial from a trade perspective, and the need to let certain counties set stricter standards and act as 'policy innovators'. In this chapter, we discuss some of the problematic issues and the existing tensions between partly conflicting policy objectives.

AB  - Literacy educators can guide students to examine the stories we live by, or the larger narratives that guide individual and collective sensemaking about relationships between humans and the environment. Drawing from the field of ecolinguistics, the authors consider two ecologically destructive stories we live by: Humans are the center of existence, and consumerism is a main pathway to happiness and fulfillment. The authors also explore three intersecting beneficial stories we live by that center on indigenous perspectives, feminist foundations of climate justice, and youth activism. This work is rooted in three essential understandings about climate change: It is a complex socioscientific topic and escalating problem, engaging with climate change is mediated primarily by a complicated array of motivated digital texts and motivated readers, and climate change is about climate (in)justice. The authors conclude with ideas about being a climate justice literacy educator.

AB  - Performance of environmental justice models depends on the level of accuracy in measuring or estimating the health of the environment. In the past decades, and especially in the area of stream health modeling, significant improvement has been observed. However, the impacts of these improvements on the robustness of environmental justice models have not been evaluated. Therefore in this study, the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice modeling was evaluated. The Saginaw River Basin in Michigan was considered as the study area, and four major ecological indices evaluating the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to instream stressors were used for stream health assessment. Seventeen socioeconomic and physiographic indices were evaluated at three census levels of county, census tract, and block group. Then the ecological, socioeconomic, and physiographic indices were used in the development of stream health based environmental justice models. Results showed that incorporating ecologically relevant indices and a using two-phase modeling approach not only improved the performance of stream health predictive models but also reduced the sensitivity of environmental justice models to aggregation at different census levels. In addition, using improved stream health indices reduced the redundancy of the independent variables (socioeconomic and physiographic indices), where the total number of significant parameters was reduced from 171 to 115. Besides that, more robust and meaningful spatial dependencies were observed among stream health measures and environmental justice parameters at different spatial levels. In summary having a reliable stream health information is the key for development of robust environmental justice models as evidence by improving model predictability and eliminating contradictory results compared to previous studies.

AB  - Justice and injustice related to natural resource management (NRM) regimes are perceived differently by various actors who seek to effect, and focus their attention on different parts of a governance system. Each innovation that will change the NRM regime and governance system will therefore be subject to politics and struggles between who is likely to win or lose something from the change. This chapter seeks to uncover and investigate these often behind the scenes' struggles to expose some of the factors that facilitate or block the development and implementation of innovations aiming to enhance environmental and social justice, at least at one particular scale or for one sector or stakeholder type. It does this by bringing together a framework of analysis for the politics of innovation in multilevel governance systems related to three types of justice decision-making or policy-making processes (interactional, procedural and distributive), then using it for the analysis of five case studies from Australia, China, Bulgaria and Iran. The analyses show that the environment or marginalised and weak stakeholder groups require a strong coalition of sponsors if they are to achieve a fairer deal or equitability - the spirit of justice' - because economic development actors are often supported by existing governance regimes or strong financial interests.

AB  - Objective. This research investigates environmental justice activists' claims that pollution is unevenly distributed across communities in the United States. We examine three possible explanations for environmental inequity: racial discrimination, economic stratification, and urban ecology. Methods. To assess pollution levels, we use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1990 Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), a data set which contains information on permitted and accidental releases of over 300 toxic chemicals from manufacturing facilities. We combine this information with county-level data from the 1990 U.S. Census and the 1990 County Business Patterns. Results. In support of activists' claims, the regression analysis reveals a positive relationship between proportion Black and toxic releases to air, which is partly explained by urbanization and industrial location. The effect of economic status is revealed to be curvilinear, with lower- and higher-income counties experiencing lower levels of toxic releases than middle-income counties. Conclusions. Our results suggest that processes such as urbanization and industrial location, which are often treated as control variables, may best be regarded as mechanisms through which disadvantaged residents and toxic pollution come together in space.

AB  - In this chapter we evaluate the 'Tasmanian forest peace process' from the perspective of procedural justice, focusing on the process rather than on its outcomes (distributive justice). This allows for an exploration of how the negotiation process influenced perceptions of the justice process, providing insights to the trade-offs involved between procedural justice and achieving desired outcomes. Following a brief overview of the study methods, we present key principles of procedural justice using the Social Justice Framework (Lukasiewicz and Baldwin 2014), and identify nine normative indicators of procedural justice that guide our subsequent analysis. We then discuss lessons from the Tasmanian forest peace process for justice, focusing on the challenge of satisfying multiple procedural justice objectives within a highly contested political environment.

AB  - One of the most effective sources of legitimation for privileged access to the environment and its natural resources comes in the form of hegemonic ideologies, such as private property rights. The concentratiosn of ownership and control over land and natural resources is rarely contested, because to question the rights of an industrial actor's property rights would be to question the ideological premise that private property ownership promotes societal well-being and progress. The staying power of this and other hegemonic ideologies, however, derives from the ability to keep certain internal contradictions associated with those ideologies concealed. Using recent conceptual work on ideology, this article focuses on recent events in forest politics in northern California, to illustrate the means by which environmental catastrophe has served as a source of vulnerability to the present hegemony of the ideology of private property rights. As with other instances of environmental justice mobilization, this case illustrates how the ability to elucidate contradictions in hegemonic ideologies may provide a more potent avenue for social transformation than attempts to introduce alternative ideologies.

AB  - In this article, we shine a spotlight on approaches to research ecosystem service trade-offs and critically assess their representation of relevant social dynamics. Although studies linking ecosystem services and human well-being have provided theoretical insights into social and ecological trade-offs, we argue that ecosystem services research has paid insufficient attention to "social feedbacks," people's cognitive and behavioral responses to change. We demonstrate that augmenting ecosystem services research with environmental justice approaches (exploring perceptions of the distribution of costs and benefits, decision making procedures, and recognition of different values and identities) can more effectively capture important responses to ecosystem governance. Spatial analysis of land use change, mixed-method assessment of multidimensional well-being, and qualitative environmental justice research were applied in three villages adjacent to Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in northern Laos. Spatial analysis showed that, from 2006 to 2015, forest clearance for cultivation remained stable within the protected area. Well-being assessment revealed the local population benefited from rapidly increasing incomes, asset ownership, and reduced poverty during that time. In combination, spatial and well-being analyses paint a picture of limited trade-offs, despite growing incentives to exploit protected land and resources through cash crops and high-value forest products. In contrast, results from environmental justice research revealed profound trade-offs between conservation and local practices, and highlight governance deficiencies relating to procedure and recognition. Consequently, formal protected area rules were perceived to be illegitimate by many and actively undermined, for example through negotiated access with alternative authorities. We conclude that although well-being research provides an essential foundation to understand diverse attachments to natural resources, the addition of environmental justice research can reveal local perceptions and social feedbacks critical to ecosystem service trade-offs, and highlight pathways to reconcile them through satisfying stakeholders' diverse, dynamic objectives.

AB  - In this paper we present the results of the first phase of the project Who is Who in Brazilian Environmental Health. The aim of this project is to identify and characterize the Academic Groups and Civil Society Organizations acting on the field of environmental health that are able to contribute both to the strengthening of its technical and scientific basis, and to the dialogue with organized civil society. The identification took place through the data source available at CNPq (Research Groups Directory), ABONG (Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations), FBOMS (Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for Environment and Sustainable Development) and RBJA (Brazilian Network for Environmental Justice). The results were presented and discussed based on time evolution, geographic distribution and areas of research and action. Final considerations point to the great potential for dialogue between experts and non experts, governmental and non-governmental, in order to create the foundation for a extended peer community capable of combining policies, knowledge, technologies and actions, seeking the comprehension and search of solutions to the establishment of health as a prerequisite and X a result of well being and full life.

AB  - Models envisaged by policy makers and sustainability scientists cooperatively produce tools with desired practical implications. Models presented in the volume are summarized, with existing policy methods for resource management and Global perspective for resource planning methods in context. Models are discussed firstly in the framework of learning environments as an opportunity to test and practice sustainability, combining different tools from models, case studies, and scenarios. Sustainability asks for a multi-scale pragmatics; key elements of the multiple scale approach representing common ground in existing practice and frontier research have been identified. Two case studies are presented as a meta-summary of the issues presented in the book, being Rural South Asia (with special reference to India), and analysis of mega-diverse countries in Latin America, with special focus on Ecuador. India's case study offers an account of policies implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MTA) since 1947, creating sustainable models for biodiversity and natural resource management. To comprehend the methods of resource sustainability usage in the present era, while enhancing resource utilization capacity of traditional practices, a tribal (indigenous communities) village-'Ajanta' (Western India)-is elaborated upon. The Latin America case study focuses on declinations of the buen vivir (good living) concept and the debate between putting nature to the service of a nation (extractivism) and Yasunization, the neologism coined in Ecuador by a civil society seeking territorial innovation combining community engagement, biodiversity conservation, and environmental justice. Through the macro-cosmic to micro-cosmic approach, a 'north-south', 'developed versus developing regions' dichotomy and possible areas of accord for resource management and sustainability in the global perspective is presented.

AB  - Making our cities more sustainable includes the need to make the transition a just one. This paper focuses on distributive justice with regard to greenspace in cities. Urbanisation and densification will likely result in less greenspace in urban residential areas, especially in deprived neighbourhoods. This is a threat to the aim of healthy and liveable cities, as greenspace has positive effects on human health and well-being. In this study, we show that in The Netherlands, neighbourhoods with a low socioeconomic status already tend to have a lower presence and quality of greenspace than those with a high socioeconomic status. This outcome is independent of the greenness metric that was used. However, depending on the precise greenness metric, socioeconomic differences in greenness between neighbourhoods are smaller in highly urban municipalities than in less urban municipalities, rather than larger. The paper discusses the implications of these outcomes for policy and planning regarding urban greenspace.

AB  - Our in-depth study of 12, spiritual but not religious (SBNR), participants arrested to protect nature as sacred presents a case to consider the religious and spiritual meanings of contemporary environmental and ecology movements. Through a lived religious approach to participants' narratives of environmental justice (ENVJ) activism, this paper identified four themes-reconstructing self and nature, re-envisioning social and moral life, living with vulnerability, and practices of spiritual and cultural work-whose meanings evidenced transformative spiritual effects on participants identity, ethics, coping, and ways of participating in society. Findings present a case to argue that although ENVJ activism resembles a SBNR phenomenon and satisfies criteria of an implicit religion, it most closely aligns with a contemporary nature religion whose substantive essence is an immanent sense of nature as sacred.

AB  - Indigenous women in North America have traditionally had reciprocal relationships with and responsibilities to the Earth. The process of colonization violently transformed both the treatment of the Earth and of Indigenous women. Current environmental crises highlight not only the vulnerability of Indigenous women, but also their long-standing leadership in resisting environmental injustices affecting their families, relationships, and nations. In this article, authors focus on the resistance of Dakota water protectors with the #NoDAPL movement in the United States and Anishinaabe water protectors in Mother Earth Water Walks in Canada. Recommendations for social workers in supporting Indigenous women in a thoughtful and effective way include incorporating a definition of a "social" response to more-than-human world relationships and responsibilities, supporting direct action as a necessary social response to environmental issues, and acting in solidarity with Indigenous women in these movements.

AB  - This article seeks to contribute to the reconstruction of an African-centered ecophilosophy and political ecology. Employing Cheikh Anta Diop's theory of African cultural unity, it considers the Ndi Igbo philosophy Omenala, its paradigmatic implications for Africana studies, and its capacity to demonstrate the continuity of indigenous African socioecological praxis cross culturally. In addition, it explores the relevance of Omenala to the development of an authentic social history of African people and as a theory to analyze contemporary problems in the African world. Three key issues are addressed. First, the article accounts for the absence of ecological theory within Africana studies. Second, it explicates the cultural and philosophical basis for an African-centered ecophilosophy and political ecology. Third, it envisions new approaches and areas of inquiry within Africana studies.

AB  - In this article, I discuss access and benefit-sharing (ABS) for plant genetic resources from an ethical perspective. This leads to the question of what types of justice actually play a role when more equity and fairness is demanded for plant genetic resources. Five dimensions of justice will be distinguished: classical distributive justice, which deals with a fair distribution of goods; commutative justice, which concerns a fair exchange of "give-and-receive"; justice as recognition, which relates to treating all involved parties with the same respect; reparative justice, which pertains to fair amendments for wrongful actions in the past; and procedural justice, which is concerned with just decision processes. Drawing on the discussion of ethical problems with biopiracy, the distribution of environmental burdens, and plant genetic resources in agriculture, I will illustrate that the use of genetic resources poses challenges across all five dimensions of justice. Because the combination of justice challenges is specific for each case of resource use, I will argue that it is important that users of genetic resources are aware of the complexity of justice problems to ensure fair and equitable ABS negotiations.

AB  - Instructors have used real-world problems in introductory economics classrooms for over three decades, but today's students continue to perceive that economics is not relevant for their lives. I provide three teaching modules associated with pollution externalities designed to improve student perceptions of relevance and make the study of environmental problems "more useful for more people." I provide a new context-rich problem that helps students make a personal connection with local environmental quality indicators. Two additional modules are included. The second module engages students with the interdisciplinary field of environmental justice. The third module explains how a Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase's influential and controversial insight about reciprocal harm can help encourage critical thinking about negative externalities in a world with transaction costs. In such a world, the module focuses on the legal system's role and Coase's overlooked view that factors other than efficiency should be considered. Finally, I include supplementary materials and tips for instructors wishing to use one or more modules in their classrooms.

AB  - Objective. Much of the empirical work on environmental justice centers on the geographic distribution of potential chronic health risks (e.g., planned toxic releases or treatment storage and disposal facilities). Far less attention has been devoted to the geographic distribution of acute health risks that cause immediate harm. The purpose of this work is to examine environmental justice in terms of potential acute health risks by examining the distribution of serious chemical accidents across diverse subpopulations. Methods. We draw upon 1990 census data for the United States to study the relationship between the racial, ethnic, and economic characteristics of census block groups (N= 226,398) and the presence or absence of chemical accidents that caused at least one injury, death, or evacuation for the time period of 1990-1996. The data used to map the location of the chemical accidents were obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency's Accidental Release Information Program (ARIP) database. Results. Our results indicate that the acute risk associated with chemical accidents at fixed facilities is greater for individuals living in low-income census block groups, especially when comparisons are made within the counties where the chemical accidents occur. Our results concerning race and ethnicity are less consistent and somewhat weaker. Conclusions. Although these results do not show large and dramatic effects, as have often been found in the study of the social distribution of chronic environmental risk, they do stand as one of a relatively few social analyses of social variation in exposure to acute environmental risk.

AB  - Justice dilemmas associated with climate change and the regulatory responses to it pose challenges for global governance, arguably hampering progress and raising concerns over efficacy and relevance. Scholarly literature suggests that transnational civil society groups can help address problems of governance and injustice that cross borders and pit states against each other. Findings of a comparative, qualitative study of climate justice advocacy suggest, however, that civil society groups' work in the US and EU is significantly shaped by institutional factors specific to those regimes, limiting advocates' broader impact. Moreover, political opportunities for the pursuit of climate action, and justice particularly, have diminished in those settings. By contrast, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides greater opportunities for discussions of justice, although civil society actors are significantly constrained within it. It is argued that greater roles for civil society in the UNFCCC could prove constructive in the face of current challenges connected with justice issues. Three themes in civil society advocacy linking principles of global justice with current climate policy debates are summarized. Finally, it is suggested that the first iteration of the UNFCCC Periodic Review provides timely opportunities to more fully draw upon civil society's potential contributions toward a fair and effective global climate regime.Policy relevanceThe roles of civil society organizations in climate governance were examined in three policy contexts: the UNFCCC, the US, and the EU, with special attention to advocacy addressing issues of equity and justice, identified as key challenges for a post-2012 global agreement. Findings suggest that (1) civil society roles are significantly constrained in each context, and (2) political opportunities for climate advocacy have diminished since 2009 in the US and EU, underlining (3) the continued salience of the UNFCCC as a forum for engagement and the construction of effective and equitable climate policy. Potential exists for increased civil society involvement at the UNFCCC to help resolve obstacles based in divergent national priorities. Three areas of justice-focused civil society activity are reviewed for current negotiation topics and the governance structure of the institution. The current UNFCCC Periodic Review is identified as an opportunity to increase civil society involvement.

AB  - Informal play in nature is fundamental to children's health and well-being, providing physical, social, and psychological benefits. Yet children in urban environments frequently lack access to natural spaces for free play. Participatory planning similarly is important across many domains in contributing to children's well-being. This chapter reviews the benefits and threats to children's informal play in nature in cities today. It then examines the role of green schoolyards as one means of providing opportunities for such play. Finally, it explores a case study of a participatory planning and design process to expand nature play opportunities in a schoolyard and adjacent park in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Interviews with professionals involved in the project are used to identify themes, programs, and policies at municipal, state, and international levels that promote children's informal play in urban green spaces.

AB  - Ongoing losses to mangrove forests globally have prompted increased interest in restoration programs that seek to restore vital ecosystem functions and services. In many cases, data on local-scale environmental tolerances of mangrove species used in reforestation efforts is lacking, and failure of restoration projects has been attributed to incorrect species selection in plantations. Here, we assess the impact of soil salinity on the early establishment success of monospecific red mangroveRhizophora manglereforestation projects in the Saloum Delta, Senegal, a region where widespread mangrove restoration efforts are ongoing. At soil salinities >60 ppt, stomatal conductance, photosystem II operating efficiency, and growth of plantedR. mangleseedlings were severely reduced. Similarly, after 1-3 years, survival of mangrove seedlings decreased in soil salinities of >60 ppt. In contrast, we recorded naturally occurring black mangroveAvicennia germinansgrowing in exceptionally hypersaline conditions (90 ppt), representing some of the most saline vegetated ecosystems on Earth. The findings reported herein can be used to inform species choice in reforestation projects and help improve success rates of coastal wetland restoration projects in semiarid regions.

AB  - Indigenous peoples who are taking actions on climate change issues have formed networks that are at the intersect between Indigenous knowledges and various environmental science fields. These climate organizations work across many boundaries in science, politics, and culture. This article asks how large-scale U.S. climate boundary organizations that convene Indigenous and non-Indigenous climate practitioners contend with ongoing colonialism. Analysis indicates that Indigenous-settler networks offer avenues for Indigenous values to be practiced in collaborative climate science. Such organizations also provide limited opportunities to utilize climate science in tribal climate adaptation. While these boundary organizations aim to build meaningful cross-cultural and mentoring relationships, uneven power dynamics and resources also permeate the partnerships. These structural inequalities cause tensions to arise. Tensions further arise from uses of new terminology to navigate longstanding struggles over places, political sovereignties, and human relationships to natural worlds. I argue that a decolonial environmental framework discerns roles for Indigenous governance in attending to anthropogenic climate change. The approach broadens sociological understandings of climate change by examining the attempts of Indigenous and non-Indigenous actors to build climate networks.

AB  - Many communities, especially minority communities, have to deal with contaminated water supplies. Remediating such risks is usually expensive, so requires action from state and/or federal governments. In turn, this requires political support for provision of a collective good, an altruistic action. We use data from a Mechanical Turk convenience sample to examine the influence of values and beliefs on donations to remediate water quality, using actual donations to an environmental group as our dependent variable. We find that views about minorities are the strongest predictor of donations, with symbolic racism-beliefs that minorities have received advantageous treatment-substantially reducing donations. In addition, altruistic values have an indirect effect of increasing the likelihood of donating while self-interested values reduce donations. It appears that support for collective action on water quality is closely tied with both altruism and racial views, suggesting links between research on environmental justice and on environmental decision-making.

AB  - Lead, the 82nd element in our periodic table, has accompanied humankind throughout the millennia of our history and development. As a ubiquitous heavy metal, lead is used in multiple applications and nine billion tons continue to be extracted globally every year. Although the United States has succeeded in limiting lead exposure among its own citizens by banning the use of lead in gasoline and household paint, while instituting improved working conditions for those who are exposed to lead in the workplace, the battle against lead is not won. In addition, it continues to plague the rest of the world today; the United States has played an increasing role in the world's exposure to lead and plans to stop are currently stalled. The year 2011 marked the centennial celebration of the life's work of Dr. Alice Hamilton in exposing lead poisoning among industrial workers in Chicago, Illinois. Her legacy provides us with the opportunity to look back and reevaluate our leaded history in the US. It also reminds us that there is more to be done to mitigate lead poisoning both domestically and in the developing world.

AB  - In this paper, we acknowledge that the literature has successfully articulated processes that have brought about environmental injustices. However, it remains weak in its engagement with processes that can or should contribute to the realisation of environmental justice, which can be attributed mainly to the limited but popular perspective that has been championed principally by the North American literature. We suggest that concerns with environmental justice should go beyond the preoccupation with the evidence of injustice to encapsulate processes and strategies for achieving environmental justice in its various forms. Empirically, this implies the need to move away from the preoccupation with toxic waste as the main central focus of the environmental justice literature. We argue that the processes and strategies for achieving environmental justice are as important as the end results that we strive for, particularly in areas of human settlements. To this end we used the case of Mfuleni Flood Relief Project in Cape Town, as an empirical evidence of the complexity of resettlement as a 'just' process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to regulate natural processes and control the scale of human activities, sustainability assessment needs to be integrated into urban planning. In this context, indicator-based sustainability assessment tools are fundamental instruments that provide information to support policy and decision-making. Indicators are necessary to monitor the implementation of the policies and provide feedback needed to accomplish the desirable state of sustainable urban development. This paper aims to explore the role of indicator-based sustainability assessment in policy and the decision-making process. Therefore, it reviews the identified sustainable development indicator initiatives and addresses the research gaps in the literature for future improvement of sustainability assessment frameworks. It concludes with a discussion that the major problem in sustainability assessment lies in the gathering of reliable and accessible data.

AB  - In the United States, community water systems are not only numerous but also diverse. Nonetheless, operational scale and public versus private ownership have dominated the understanding of safe water access, leaving underexplored many other factors related to governance. Applying insights from the Institutional Analysis and Design literature, we create and analyze a dataset of California's water systems classified into 26 structural types associated with distinct governance institutions. We document differences in the number of Safe Drinking Water Act violations among these types and demonstrate their relevance for implementing solutions targeting noncompliance. Advancing equitable access necessitates greater attention to organizational structure and institutional diversity in drinking water provision.

AB  - Inspired by the thesis that an alliance between degrowth and environmental justice (EJ) movements is essential (Akbulut et al., this issue), this paper presents the findings of empirical research concerning the pitfalls and possibilities of such an alliance as understood by prominent Croatian EJ movement leaders. We outline the context of the Croatian EJ movement through two specifics - the country's semiperipheral position in the global world-system and the ecological distribution conflicts (EDCs) characteristic of the post-socialist societal metabolism in Europe. The research explores the theory-practice nexus, materialist vs. post-materialist value base, and the potential of 'a politico-metabolic reconfiguration' (ibid.) for the proposed alliance. Our findings indicate a hitherto limited, but positive potential for degrowth to provide a theoretical framework for the semiperipheral EJ movement. Both the EJ movement and degrowth demonstrably share a materialist motivation, but not for reasons of 'under-development' of semiperipheral societies. Our analysis concludes that semiperipheral EJ activists are open to a politico-metabolic reconfiguration proposal, though they are presently not aware that a viable reconfiguration strategy is proffered by the degrowth research community. On the European semiperiphery, an alliance between theory and movement would benefit from a clearer explication of such a strategy.

AB  - In previous works, I examine inferential methods employed in Probabilistic Weather Event Attribution studies (PEAs), and explored various ways they can be used to aid in climate policy decisions and decision-making about climate justice issues. This paper evaluates limitations of PEAs and considers how PEA researchers' attributions of "liability" to specific countries for specific extreme weather events could be made more ethical. In sum, I show that it is routinely presupposed that PEA methods are not prone to inductive risks and presuppose that PEA researchers thus have no epistemic consequences or responsibilities for their attributions of liability. I argue that although PEAs are nevertheless crucially useful for practical decision-making, the attributions of liability made by PEA researchers are in fact prone to indicative risks and are influenced by non-epistemic values that PEA researchers should make transparent to make such studies more ethical. Finally, I outline possible normative approaches for making sciences, including PEAs, more ethical; and discuss implications of my arguments for the ongoing debate about how PEAs should guide climate policy and relevant legal decisions.

AB  - Many environmental pollutants are known to have disproportionate effects on Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) as well as communities of low-income and wealth. The reasons for these disproportionate effects are complex and involve hundreds of years of systematic oppression kept in place through structural racism and classism in the USA. Here we analyze the available literature and existing datasets to determine the extent to which disparities in exposure and harm exist for one of the most widespread pollutants in the world - pesticides. Our objective was to identify and discuss not only the historical injustices that have led to these disparities, but also the current laws, policies and regulatory practices that perpetuate them to this day with the ultimate goal of proposing achievable solutions. Disparities in exposures and harms from pesticides are widespread, impacting BIPOC and low-income communities in both rural and urban settings and occurring throughout the entire lifecycle of the pesticide from production to end-use. These disparities are being perpetuated by current laws and regulations through 1) a pesticide safety double standard, 2) inadequate worker protections, and 3) export of dangerous pesticides to developing countries. Racial, ethnic and income disparities are also maintained through policies and regulatory practices that 4) fail to implement environmental justice Executive Orders, 5) fail to account for unintended pesticide use or provide adequate training and support, 6) fail to effectively monitor and follow-up with vulnerable communities post-approval, and 7) fail to implement essential protections for children. Here we've identified federal laws, regulations, policies, and practices that allow for disparities in pesticide exposure and harm to remain entrenched in everyday life for environmental justice communities. This is not simply a pesticides issue, but a broader public health and civil rights issue. The true fix is to shift the USA to a more just system based on the Precautionary Principle to prevent harmful pollution exposure to everyone, regardless of skin tone or income. However, there are actions that can be taken within our existing framework in the short term to make our unjust regulatory system work better for everyone.

AB  - In this paper, we advocate a collaborative approach to investigating past human-environment interactions in southwest Madagascar. We do so by critically reflecting as a team on the development of the Morombe Archaeological Project, initiated in 2011 as a collaboration between an American archaeologist and the Vezo communities of the Velondriake Marine Protected Area. Our objectives are to assess our trajectory in building collaborative partnerships with diverse local, indigenous, and descendent communities and to provide concrete suggestions for the development of new collaborative projects in environmental archaeology. Through our Madagascar case study, we argue that contemporary environmental and economic challenges create an urgency to articulate and practice an inclusive environmental archaeology, and we propose that environmental archaeologists must make particular efforts to include local, indigenous, and descendent communities. Finally, we assert that full collaboration involves equal power sharing and mutual knowledge exchange and suggest an approach for critical self-evaluation of collaborative projects.

AB  - It is said that politics is the art of the possible, and so the discipline of public policy is the art and craft of implementing the possible. Especially in resource and environmental management, where allocation of environmental goods and bads' is the core task, public policy has focused on procedural justice (although rarely using those words) in terms of seeking greater and more constructive modes of public participation and community engagement. This has produced a very large body of theory and practice. Although modelling of distributional outcomes are often a large part of input into decisions, the fairness of eventual outcomes is less a focus. This chapter looks at how concepts of environmental justice can inform public policy in the environmental domain, concluding that a more nuanced and robust lexicon and knowledge of justice would be a positive contribution. Conversely, public policy can guide justice research towards points in the policy and institutional system where justice might be pursued to greater or lesser effect. This book presents a range of Australian perspectives, applied across different resource and environmental management contexts, from the relatively new and still fluid and contested field of environmental justice. Environmental justice seeks fairness - variously in process or outcome - across groups in a human population in the policy and management that decides on and assigns access (or not) to natural resources and environmental assets. At times, it explores justice for the environment itself, or living parts of the environment. Pragmatically, as noted in Chapter 2, environmental justice more often seeks to identify and mitigate injustices or actual or perceived unfairness. We can postulate that this is simply because such instances will be brought to the attention of governments and the public rather than just or fair outcomes (no headlines there!), and because perfectly' just outcomes are at once unknowable and certainly always contestable depending on one's perspective and interests. Fundamentally, environmental and natural resource management policy is, like all public policy, about the allocation of resources, access and privileges - whether of water, timber, fish stocks, health care, open space, recreational opportunities, transport routes, emergency services, minerals, or protection from the negative products of human activities such as pollution or noise. Public policy, as both a discipline and practice, seeks to provide structure, transparency and defensible processes underpinning such allocations of 'goods and bads' (generally, see Howlett et al. 2009; specific to environment, Dovers and Hussey 2013). Public policy deals with fairness and justice in ways qualitative and fungible, or quantitative and rigid, and sometimes leaves judgement to the courts when procedures to cater for fairness are deemed unfulfilled. Public policy also leaves significant justice and other value decisions to elected governments and their constituent parts (first ministers, ministers, Cabinet), in a parliamentary liberal democracy. The warning of Davis and colleagues, emphasis in original) is apposite: Politics is the essential ingredient for producing workable policies, which are more publicly accountable and politically justifiable ... While some are uncomfortable with the notion that politics can enhance rational decision-making, preferring to see politics as expediency, it is integral to the process of securing defensible outcomes. We are unable to combine values, interests and resources in ways which are not political. (Davis et al. 1993: 257) Values, interests and resources: the last of these, resources, can be in most cases measured; interests can be at least identified and possibly managed; but values are more political or moral, difficult if not impossible to measure, individually or socially formed and negotiated, and always contestable and resistant to the analyses and trade-offs that are the stock-intrade of attempts at 'rational' public policy processes. Justice is a value matter, and thus fundamentally a matter of politics, in whatever social arena those politics are played out. This introduction, and the role of politics, prompts a crucial distinction. Environmental justice - for the moment recognising just the two predominant forms discussed - concerns both the process of reaching decisions around allocation (procedural justice) and the fairness of the outcomes (distributive justice). Public policy, and the environmental and resource management regimes thus shaped, is concerned overwhelmingly with process: the institutions, organisational settings, rules, norms and practicalities of policies as they are formulated and implemented within the political system. Public policy may shape, but does not determine, political decisions. Whatever judgements may arise from normal procedures of review of policy implementation - Senate inquiries, independent evaluations or investigations by an Auditor- General - these will only judge fairness of process or outcomes against what the policy stated would happen. If the outcome is demonstrably unfair, or strongly argued to be, but is consistent with the original intent, then that may be remarked upon but not judged as wrong. An unfair allocation policy, or one with skewed distributional impacts (and there are many such), is not, from a public policy perspective, a failed policy: it may be as intended by the government or key political figure who set the parameters, supported by sufficiently numerous or powerful actors in the wider policy and political system. To that extent, public policy is a less normative enterprise than environmental justice, whatever individuals in the process may personally believe or desire. Scholars and practitioners of public policy tend not to use the term 'justice' but rather less strict enunciations of fairness. If justice is considered, it tends to be in the hands of what public policy would view as the proper arbiters - the court that overturns a decision or process, the electorate who ejects a government or politician they think made unfair decisions, or the media pressure that reacts to or inflames public rage and forces the reversal of a decision. In this chapter, I first note how environmental and natural resource policy seeks to allow as wide as possible or permissible input into formulating policy, and how it seeks to achieve at least tolerable outcomes in allocation, which are not open to the perception or proof of unfairness. The question is then asked: how can the ideas from the field of environmental justice inform questions of public participation and of tolerable, or at least transparent, fairness in the outcomes of decisions that seek to consider values, interests and resources in allocation of goods and bads? That is, what might environmental justice contribute to public policy in this domain? Along the way, we might ponder the converse, too: what can environmental justice learn from public policy?

AB  - Objective. Drawing on recent debates over environmental justice and environmental racism, this paper investigates the distribution of Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) emissions in Michigan in an attempt to ascertain whether these emissions are inequitably distributed according to race. Methods. The analysis examines TRI emissions for the entire state, the state's urban areas, and the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA). Results. TRI emissions for the entire state are inequitably distributed according to race. This finding does not hold for multivariate analyses of the state's urban areas and the DMA. However, in these areas, race is significantly correlated with TRI emissions in bivariate regressions. Conclusions. I make several arguments. First, the nature of specific conclusions drawn from this and another, similar study depends on a) whether one holds an institutional or intentional model of environmental discrimination and b) whether one gives more weight to statewide analyses or analyses restricted to urban areas. Second, one should not theorize race and income as competing explanatory variables. Third, qualitative historical case studies are necessary if we are to adequately explain the formation of current environmental hazard distributions.

AB  - In this article, the author demonstrates how geographic information system (GIS) software can be used to reconceptualize spatial relationships and ecological context and address the modifiable areal unit problem. In order to do this, the author uses GIS to (1) test an important category of spatial hypotheses (spatial proximity hypotheses), (2) overcome methodological problems that arise when data sets are not spatially comparable, and (3) measure ecological context. The author introduces a set of GIS variable construction techniques that are designed to accomplish these tasks, illustrates these techniques empirically by using them to test spatial proximity hypotheses drawn from the literature on environmental inequality, and demonstrates that results obtained using these techniques are methodologically superior to and substantively different from results obtained using traditional techniques. Finally, the author demonstrates that these techniques are the product of an alternative conceptualization of physical space that allows sociologists to develop new ways to think about and measure spatial relationships, ecological context, and place-based social inequality and that gives them the ability to reconceptualize spatially based methodological problems that have confronted them for years.

AB  - Objective. This study uses tract-level demographic data and toxicity-weighted air pollutant concentration estimates for the continental United States to determine whether (1) single-mother families are overrepresented in environmentally hazardous Census tracts and (2) the percentage of single-mother families in a Census tract is a significant predictor of tract-level toxic concentration estimates. Methods. After calculating tract-level toxic concentration estimates for the average female-headed family, male-headed family, and married-couple family with and without children, we use fixed-effects regression models to determine whether the percentage of single-mother families in a tract is a significant predictor of tract-level toxic concentration estimates. Results. Single-mother families are overrepresented in environmentally hazardous Census tracts, and the percentage of single-mother families in a tract remains a significant predictor of estimated toxic concentration levels even after controlling for many of the most commonly used variables in the literature. Conclusion. Environmental inequality researchers need to broaden their focus beyond race and income to include groups such as single-mother families in their research.

AB  - Millions of low-income people of diverse ethnicities inhabit stressful old urban industrial neighborhoods. Yet we know little about the health impacts of built-environment stressors and risk perceptions in such settings; we lack even basic health profiles. Difficult access is one reason (it took us 30 months to survey 80 households); the lack of multifaceted survey tools is another. We designed and implemented a pilot vulnerability assessment tool in Worcester, Massachusetts. We answer: (1) How can we assess vulnerability to multiple stressors? (2) What is the nature of complex vulnerability-including risk perceptions and health profiles? (3) How can findings be used by our wider community, and what lessons did we learn? (4) What implications arise for science and policy? We sought a holistic picture of neighborhood life. A reasonably representative sample of 80 respondents captured data for 254 people about: demographics, community concerns and resources, time-activity patterns, health information, risk/stress perceptions, and resources/capacities for coping. Our key findings derive partly from the survey data and partly from our experience in obtaining those data. Data strongly suggest complex vulnerability dominated by psychosocial stress. Unexpected significant gender and ethnic disease disparities emerged: notably, females have twice the disease burden of males, and white females twice the burden of females of color (p < 0.01). Self-reported depression differentiated by gender and age is illustrative. Community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches require active engagement with marginalized populations, including representatives as funded partners. Complex vulnerability necessitates holistic, participatory approaches to improve scientific understanding and societal responses.

AB  - Low income, multi-ethnic communities in Main South/Piedmont neighborhoods of Worcester, Massachusetts are exposed to cumulative, chronic built-environment stressors, and have limited capacity to respond, magnifying their vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. "Neighborhood STRENGTH", our community-based participatory research (CBPR) project, comprised four partners: a youth center; an environmental non-profit: a community-based health center; and a university. Unlike most CBPR projects that are single topic-focused, our 'holistic', systems-based project targeted five priorities. The three research-focused/action-oriented components were: (I) participatory monitoring of indoor and outdoor pollution; (2) learning about health needs and concerns of residents through community-based listening sessions; (3) engaging in collaborative survey work, including a household vulnerability Survey and an asthma prevalence survey for schoolchildren. The two action-focused/research-informed components were: (4) tackling persistent street trash and illegal dumping strategically; and (5) educating and empowering youth to promote environmental justice. We used a coupled CBPR-capacity building approach to design, vulnerability theory to frame, and mixed methods: quantitative environmental testing and qualitative surveys. Process and outcomes yielded important lessons: vulnerability theory helps frame issues holistically; having several topic-based projects yielded useful information, but was hard to manage and articulate to the public; access to, and engagement with, the target population was very difficult and would have benefited greatly from having representative residents who were paid at the partners' table. Engagement with residents and conflict burden varied highly across components. Notwithstanding, we built enabling capacity, strengthened our understanding of vulnerability, and are able to share valuable experiential knowledge. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Policy Points: Communities, funding agencies, and institutions are increasingly involving community stakeholders as partners in research, to provide firsthand knowledge and insight. Based on our systematic review of major literature databases, we recommend using a single term, community-academic partnership (CAP), and a conceptual definition to unite multiple research disciplines and strengthen the field. Interpersonal and operational factors that facilitate or hinder the collaborative process have been consistently identified, including trust among partners and respect among partners (facilitating interpersonal factors) and excessive time commitment (hindering operational factor). Once CAP processes and characteristics are better understood, the effectiveness of collaborative partner involvement can be tested. ContextCommunities, funding agencies, and institutions are increasingly involving community stakeholders as partners in research. Community stakeholders can provide firsthand knowledge and insight, thereby increasing research relevance and feasibility. Despite the greater emphasis and use of community-academic partnerships (CAP) across multiple disciplines, definitions of partnerships and methodologies vary greatly, and no systematic reviews consolidating this literature have been published. The purpose of this article, then, is to facilitate the continued growth of this field by examining the characteristics of CAPs and the current state of the science, identifying the facilitating and hindering influences on the collaborative process, and developing a common term and conceptual definition for use across disciplines. MethodsOur systematic search of 6 major literature databases generated 1,332 unique articles, 50 of which met our criteria for inclusion and provided data on 54 unique CAPs. We then analyzed studies to describe CAP characteristics and to identify the terms and methods used, as well as the common influences on the CAP process and distal outcomes. FindingsCAP research spans disciplines, involves a variety of community stakeholders, and focuses on a large range of study topics. CAP research articles, however, rarely report characteristics such as membership numbers or duration. Most studies involved case studies using qualitative methods to collect data on the collaborative process. Although various terms were used to describe collaborative partnerships, few studies provided conceptual definitions. Twenty-three facilitating and hindering factors influencing the CAP collaboration process emerged from the literature. Outcomes from the CAPs most often included developing or refining tangible products. ConclusionsBased on our systematic review, we recommend using a single term, community-academic partnership, as well as a conceptual definition to unite multiple research disciplines. In addition, CAP characteristics and methods should be reported more systematically to advance the field (eg, to develop CAP evaluation tools). We have identified the most common influences that facilitate and hinder CAPs, which in turn should guide their development and sustainment.

AB  - In many countries around the globe, private freehold lands cover large areas. Conservation on these private lands, next to statutory protected areas, promises to play a critical role in efforts for reaching internationally agreed environmental protection targets. Lying at the heart of an emerging land system science, in which ecology, economics, geography, psychology, and other social sciences interact, private land conservation is reflecting the intertwined and multiscalar processes of our rapidly transforming world. Situated at this disciplinary meeting point, private land conservation invites a great breadth of approaches and cross-disciplinary work that offer deep insights into social and environmental change, often from surprising angles. Although many questions remain in private land conservation, we can now build on a large body of recent high-quality studies as we push this field forward in both research and practice. The Special Feature "Private Land Conservation - Landowner Motives, Policies, and Outcomes of Conservation Measures in Unprotected Landscapes" brings together contributions that explore the diversity of recent advances in private land conservation science. As an introduction to this Special Feature, first we are reviewing recent dynamics in important social-ecological drivers with bearing on private land conservation science. We go on to introduce the individual contributions to this Special Feature and then examine common themes as they are emerging from these papers, including the need for flexibility in conservation approaches, pursuit of community cobenefits of conservation, increasing consideration of environmental justice questions, and acknowledgment of the importance of social psychology in shaping private land conservation. We conclude with identification of knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research, as we advance from diagnostics to normative work in private land conservation science.

AB  - Maryland residents' knowledge of environmental hazards and their health effects is limited, partly due to the absence of tools to map and visualize distribution of risk factors across sociodemographic groups. This study discusses the development of the Maryland EJSCREEN (MD EJSCREEN) tool by the National Center for Smart Growth in partnership with faculty at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. The tool assesses environmental justice risks similarly to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) EJSCREEN tool and California's tool, CalEnviroScreen 3.0. We discuss the architecture and functionality of the tool, indicators of importance, and how it compares to USEPA's EJSCREEN and CalEnviroScreen. We demonstrate the use of MD EJSCREEN through a case study on Bladensburg, Maryland, a town in Prince George's County (PG) with several environmental justice concerns including air pollution from traffic and a concrete plant. Comparison reveals that environmental and demographic indicators in MD EJSCREEN most closely resemble those in EPA EJSCREEN, while the scoring is most similar to CalEnviroScreen. Case study results show that Bladensburg has a Prince George's environmental justice score of 0.99, and that National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) air toxics cancer risk is concentrated in communities of color.

AB  - In the face of rapid environmental change, restoration will need to emphasize innovative approaches that support the long-term resilience of social and ecological systems. To this end, we highlight the critical, but often overlooked, role of adaptive capacity, which enables restoration practice, governance, and target ecosystems to adapt to directional environmental change. We identify three core attributes of adaptive capacity: (1) diversity, (2) connectivity, and (3) flexibility. For each attribute, we describe key strategies, including enhancing mechanisms of ecological memory, facilitating the generation of beneficial novelty, and developing governance structures that are flexible and anticipatory. These core attributes can also lead to maladaptive outcomes; careful consideration of a social-ecological system's resilience and vulnerabilities to environmental change will likely be critical to avoid unwanted outcomes. Ultimately, implementing strategies that increase adaptive capacity can bolster restoration efficacy as it seeks to confront the global challenge of rapid environmental change.

AB  - One of the central questions in climate change debates concerns fair burden-sharing, i.e. justice in the distribution of costs of undertaking climate-managing policies. In this paper it is argued that in order to distribute such costs justly, it is necessary to have a nuanced understanding of what types of burdens they represent. Climate managing policies are usually divided into responses that seek to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mitigation) and responses that seek to prevent harm arising from a changing climate (adaptation). Some have argued that there are normatively significant differences between mitigation and adaptation: that the two responses adhere to different logics and evoke different patterns of burden-sharing. This paper argues that the relevant distinction is instead between negative and positive climate duties, i.e. whether an agent has a duty to undertake climate-managing policies on account of the harm its excessive emissions are causing or simply on account of its ability to assist those in need. The paper offers a typology of the different mitigation and adaptation responses that can be sorted under the negative/positive distinctions. This way of conceptualizing the issue not only enables us to better address the burden-sharing question, offering a more nuanced understanding of the types of climate burdens that are ascribable to agents and pointing out the appropriate roles of contributory responsibility and ability. It also clarifies aspects of the climate negotiations, and explains why it matters whether adaptation finance transferred to vulnerable countries is portrayed as compensation for harmful emissions or simply as donor countries discharging their humanitarian duties.

AB  - Many governments have implemented environmental justice mandates requiring agencies to consider the implications of cleanup decisions for poor and/or minority populations. To the extent that this mandate alters decisions, it usually does so by considering the composition of a community in the present without adjusting for potential demographic changes that may occur over time. However, communities change and these changes are likely to affect how well an agency meets its environmental justice mandate over the long term. In this research, an agent-based model is introduced to simulate how alternative environmental remediation scenarios may affect environmental justice outcomes in a dynamic residential environment with two demographic classes with preferences for living in proximity to neighbors similar to themselves. Under these circumstances, there is unlikely to be one best strategy to achieve both environmental improvement and environmental equity, and a focus on valuable land is the least effective over the long run.

AB  - In the United States Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit, the Appellants Mom's Against Mercury, Connecticut Coalition for Environmental justice, Oregonians for Life, California Citizens for Health Freedom, Kevin J. Biggers, Karen Johnson, Linda Brocato, R. Andrew Landerman, and Antia Vazquez Tibaul filed a petition for review of Regulatory Inaction by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).(1) On Monday June 2, 2008, the lawsuit was settled with the FDA after it agreed to classify mercury fillings. During its negotiation session with the Appellants, the FDA indicated that it would change its website on mercury fillings. The FDA no longer claims that no science exists about the safety of mercury amalgam or that other countries have acted for environmental reasons only. On its website, the FDA now states the following: "Dental amalgams contain mercury, which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetus."(2) The FDA also states that "Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury bioburden, should not avoid seeking dental care, but should discuss options with their health practitioner." The FDA decision to classify mercury fillings is a reflection of the legislations enacted in Europe and Canada that highlight the neurotoxic effects of mercury fillings.

AB  - Increasing human populations are challenging cities to grow sustainably while maintaining green spaces that deliver ecosystem services and well-being benefits. Community gardens are green spaces that provide food, community, and health benefits, but gardens often are non-permanent due to development and green space loss. Thus, investigating their significance and benefit across urban regions is critical for research and policy alike. This study investigated the role of community gardens in providing human well-being benefits across three counties in the California Central Coasta region undergoing massive urban transformation in the last century. We measured how multiple aspects of self-reported gardener well-being varied in relation to the social opportunities of surrounding neighborhoods and the biophysical features of the landscapes in which the gardens were embedded. The results document improvements in gardener well-being through gardening across social and biophysical gradients. Gardeners are motivated by diverse reasons, varying from gardening in order to connect to nature, to gardening for improved food access, or to enhance time spent with family. Community gardens are therefore important for supporting many well-being benefits. Policies to maintain and protect gardens should prioritize neighborhoods with needs for connecting to nature and enhancing social interaction within the community.

AB  - Landscape Justice, we argue, is one of the preconditions for social sustainability underlined by an ethos of equality. While there are several social groups who experience discrimination, in this paper we focus on landscape and migration in the context of Europe's gravest refugee crisis since the Second World War. Refugees, and migrants in general, are one of the most vulnerable groups of people in society. In most Western countries they face economic hardship and difficult living conditions and frequently have to face a social climate of prejudices and hostility. Such adversities, affected by spatial conditions and access to spatial resources, as well as affecting potential positive associations with landscape, are at the core of landscape justice. Building on the premise that landscape is the essential infrastructure for wellbeing and that research on landscape justice is instrumental to achieving the goals of the European Landscape Convention, this article offers a review of existing literature on landscape and migration. The goal is to identify new potential research directions and strategies that would contribute to landscape justice and wellbeing.

AB  - In life history methodologies, 'human' lives appear to take primacy over other lives. Within science education literature, life history methods often are approached as reflective tools to make meaning out of teachers' pedagogical practices and commitments. In the present research, we tinker with life history research, to follow its performative work in (re-)producing what counts as life, nature, science and science education. Thinking with life history(ies), bodies and stickiness, we analyze a college instructor's (Nurul) life with others. Nurul is committed to a science pedagogical approach ('STEPWISE') centered on STSE education for social and environmental justice. This paper relays what was (re-)produced when Nurul's life narrative, and our own encounters with life history methodologies were plugged into one another. Analytically, we discuss stickiness of humanist and meaning-making practices in life history methodologies and how this might have enabled/complicated our analyses of Nurul's life history. We invite further analyses into productive aspects of life history(ies) and how they might gesture to pedagogical possibilities for being/living differently within nature, science and science education.

AB  - Inspired by Torres-Olave and Bravo's original paper, entitled 'Facing Neoliberalism through Dialogic Spaces as Sites of Hopes in Science Education: Experiences of two Self-Organized Communities', the present essay considers potential contexts to resist neoliberal models of science education. This paper discusses affordances of themes and notions from domains of Science and Technology Studies (STS) to inform STEPWISE-informed pedagogies (Bencze 2017) that engage with (bio)political analyses of technoscience for social and environmental justice. Notions from STS highlighted include: 'sociotechnical imaginaries', 'emotive actants' and 'anthropocentric temporalities'. We illustrate these in relation to contemporary science and technology products and practices to highlight futures and subjects that they foreground and foreclose. We end by considering how such STS notions may extend areas of interest within science education (scholarship), through: 1) situating fields of (techno)science within their social and political sphere, 2) meeting future studies that seek to problematize individual perceptions of futures, 3) considering different forms of environmental activism beyond (personal) actions and 4) contributing to an 'affective' science education.

AB  - Objectives: Concern about the impact of the environment on health and well-being has tended to focus on the physical effects of exposure to toxic and infectious substances, and on the impact of large-scale infrastructures. Less attention has been paid to the possible psychosocial consequences of people's subjective perceptions of their everyday, street-level environment, such as the incidence of litter and graffiti. As little is known about the potential relative importance for health of perceptions of different types of environmental incivility, a module was developed for inclusion in the 2004 Scottish Social Attitudes survey in order to investigate this relationship. Study design: A random sample of 1637 adults living across a range of neighbourhoods throughout Scotland was interviewed. Methods: Respondents were asked to rate their local area on a range of possible environmental incivilities. These incivilities were subsequently grouped into three domains: (i) street-level incivilities (e. g. litter, graffiti); (ii) large-scale infrastructural incivilities (e. g. telephone masts); and (iii) the absence of environmental goods (e. g. safe play areas for children). For each of the three domains, the authors examined the degree to which they were thought to pose a problem locally, and how far these perceptions varied between those living in deprived areas and those living in less-deprived areas. Subsequently, the relationships between these perceptions and self-assessed health and health behaviours were explored, after controlling for gender, age and social class. Results: Respondents with the highest levels of perceived street-level incivilities were almost twice as likely as those who perceived the lowest levels of street-level incivilities to report frequent feelings of anxiety and depression. Perceived absence of environmental goods was associated with increased anxiety (2.5 times more likely) and depression (90% more likely), and a 50% increased likelihood of being a smoker. Few associations with health were observed for perceptions of large-scale infrastructural incivilities. Conclusions: Environmental policy needs to give more priority to reducing the incidence of street-level incivilities and the absence of environmental goods, both of which appear to be more important for health than perceptions of large-scale infrastructural incivilities.

AB  - Midstream oil and gas infrastructure comprises vast networks of gathering and transmission pipelines that connect upstream extraction to downstream consumption. In the United States (US), public policies and corporate decisions have prompted a wave of proposals for new gathering and transmission pipelines in recent years, raising the question: Who bears the burdens associated with the existing pipeline infrastructure in the US? With this in mind, we examined the density of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines in the US, together with county-level data on social vulnerability. For the 2,261 US counties containing natural gas pipelines, we found a positive correlation between county-level pipeline density and an index of social vulnerability. In general, counties with more socially vulnerable populations have significantly higher pipeline densities than counties with less socially vulnerable populations. In particular, counties in the top quartile of social vulnerability tend to have pipeline densities that are much higher than pipeline densities for counties in the bottom quartile of social vulnerability. The difference grows larger for counties at the upper extremes of pipeline density within each group. We discuss some of the implications for the indigenous communities and others affected by recent expansions of oil and gas infrastructure. We offer recommendations aimed at improving ways in which decision-makers identify and address the societal impacts and environmental justice implications of midstream pipeline infrastructure. Plain Language Summary Recent years have seen a wave of oil and gas development in the United States (US) and elsewhere. Research on human health and other societal impacts of oil and gas focus mainly on upstream activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, and on downstream activities, such as refining and electricity production. Gathering and transmission pipelines, which connect upstream and downstream parts of the supply chain, also have negative impacts, but receive less attention than other areas. No prior research has determined whether the negative impacts of gathering and transmission pipelines fall equitably across society. We analyzed publicly available data sets and found that the existing network of natural gas pipelines in the US is concentrated more heavily in counties where people experience high levels of social vulnerability than in counties where social vulnerability is low. These results have implications for environmental justice, which is concerned, in part, with how environmental burdens are distributed throughout the society. We highlight some of the burdens faced by indigenous peoples and others who are impacted by the ongoing pipeline development. Our work reiterates a need for researchers and decision-makers to look closely at these impacts, especially in light of environmental justice policies, to understand the broader societal costs of oil and gas infrastructure.

AB  - Indigenous peoples worldwide face barriers to participation in water governance, which includes planning and permitting of infrastructure that may affect water in their territories. In the United States, the extent to which Indigenous voices are heard-let alone incorporated into decision-making-depends heavily on whether or not Native nations are recognized by the federal government. In the southeastern United States, non-federally recognized Indigenous peoples continue to occupy their homelands along rivers, floodplains, and wetlands. These peoples, and the Tribal governments that represent them, rarely enter environmental decision-making spaces as sovereign nations and experts in their own right. Nevertheless, plans to construct the Atlantic Coast Pipeline prompted non-federally recognized Tribes to demand treatment as Tribal nations during permitting. Actions by the Tribes, which are recognized by the state of North Carolina, expose barriers to participation in environmental governance faced by Indigenous peoples throughout the United States, and particularly daunting challenges faced by state-recognized Tribes. After reviewing the legal and political landscapes that Native nations in the United States must navigate, we present a case study focused on Atlantic Coast Pipeline planning and permitting. We deliberately center Native voices and perspectives, often overlooked in non-Indigenous narratives, to emphasize Indigenous actions and illuminate participatory barriers. Although the Atlantic Coast Pipeline was cancelled in 2020, the case study reveals four enduring barriers to Tribal participation: adherence to minimum standards, power asymmetries, procedural narrowing, and "color-blind" planning. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for federal and state governments, developers, and Indigenous peoples to breach these barriers.

AB  - Objectives: Effectively communicate results from a community exposure study to meet predetermined community priorities, mantaining ethical principles of autonomy, empowerment and justice. Methods: The community established principles for the communications and a plan to inform study Participants, community and other stakeholders of results and recommendations in a novel sequence: the "Community-First " communication model. Results: The communications resulted in positive actions including company sponsored free bottled water, accepted by 77.6% of eligible households. Over 95% of participants in a follow-up survey had made some change to residential water supplies. Serum perfluorooctanoate levels were reduced. Government agencies acted. on the results. Conclusions: The unique communication approach generated workable solutions to the problem investigated, raised community awareness and modified behaviors. Information generated a "free market " of community-level solutions. Each major stakeholder voluntarily adopted a "precautionary principle." (J Occup Environ Med. 2009,51:146-156)

AB  - Local participation in environmental decision making is a fundamental tenet of environmental justice. This essay examines the participation process for nuclear waste siting decisions and suggests that the lack of a viable means for discussion of competing values is a flaw in the currently used model of participation. Through analysis of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear waste site in the USA, I show how the lack of discussion of values occludes participation by marginalized American Indians. In particular, I examine the incommensurability between American Indian nations that value Yucca Mountain as sacred land and the federal government that values Yucca Mountain as a national sacrifice zone. I argue that Yucca Mountain acts as a polysemous value term in the controversy. My findings suggest that an environmentally just model of participation in environmental decision making must include a way to account for incommensurable values and cultural differences. Further, I highlight the lessons we can learn from the Yucca Mountain project as we deliberate about what to do with nuclear waste.

AB  - Ocean-based economic development arising from an increasing interest in the 'blue economy' is placing ecosystems and small-scale fisheries under pressure. The dominant policy response for dealing with multiple uses is the allocation of coastal space through coastal zone planning (CZP). Recent studies have shown that the rush to develop the blue economy and regulate coastal activity can result in social injustices and the exclusion of less powerful and unrecognized groups (e.g., small-scale fishers, women, Indigenous peoples and youth). To achieve a primary goal of the 2030 sustainable development agenda to "leave no one behind", it is important to understand the implications of coastal planning and development for these groups. Here, we present a social survey protocol for examining perceptions of justice related to small-scale fisheries (SSF) in the context of the blue economy in coastal areas. Specifically, we designed the survey instrument and sampling protocol to assess whether decisions about the use of the coastal zone over the last five years have i) followed principles of good governance, ii) recognized fishers' knowledge, culture and rights and iii) been attentive to impacts of changed coastal zone use on fisheries. The survey will engage coastal planners (N = app. 120) and fishers (N = app. 4300) in all the coastal municipalities (N = 81) in Northern-Norway. The sampling protocol is designed to ensure representation of different sectors of society, including those defined by gender, age, ethnicity and occupation (e.g., small-scale fishers, large-scale fishers, coastal planners).

AB  - People from across the Caylloma Province of Peru are adapting to social-ecological changes, such as decreasing water supplies and rapidly retreating glaciers, in different and unequal ways. In this study, we show how this inequality is intersectional; identities like gender and age compound and interact with systems of power to shape how people adapt to these changes at the individual, household, and district scales. We draw from 130 semi-structured interviews with agricultural actors and participant observations in district and regional meetings across four districts, to demonstrate how intersectionality shapes adaptation to social-ecological change. Our results show (1) what social-ecological changes are perceived and experienced, (2) how individuals, households, and groups within the agricultural sector adapt to these changes in private (at the individual and household scale) and public adaptation spaces (institutions where people adapt collectively within each district), and (3) how intersectionality shapes adaptive capacity to these changes. Specifically, we found that 'unskilled' women diversified their income through day-labor in agriculture, while 'unskilled' men had more options for income diversification. Migrants who are also renters had access to water; however, migrants who lived in informal settlements lacked water access. Pastoralists over 50 faced more difficulties pursuing income diversification and labor migration than younger populations with similar livelihoods. Public adaptation spaces, including irrigation commissions, were largely designed for Spanish-speaking men who own land, which caused additional barriers for Quechua speakers, women, and migrants who used this space to contribute to adaptation for themselves, their household, and for the broader district. Together, these results expand scholarship on differential adaptation to social-ecological change within globally marginalized, yet locally heterogenous, communities. In particular, this study brings to light how intersecting identities, along with the social, political and economic structures in which they are situated, can lead to unequal adaptation opportunities within heterogeneous communities.

AB  - Little is known about the distribution of urban forests of rapidly growing megacities in the developing world and what role they have on the well-being of citizens. Lack of information on their spatial distribution and ecosystem service (ESS) provision is especially pressing since megacities are often characterized by irregular land use patterns, social inequities, and socioeconomic instability. We explored spatial equity in key tree structural characteristics and ESS predictors from public urban forests in Bogota, Colombia. We used one of the most comprehensive public urban tree inventories in Latin America, ESS indicators, and geospatial data to statistically and spatially analyze structural and diversity attributes and provision of ESS across Bogota's land uses and socioeconomic strata. We found that the poorest socioeconomic stratum had the lowest tree size and crown attributes while the wealthiest stratum had the largest trees attributes. Tree diversity was greatest in northern, affluent areas and total C stocks were greatest in residential areas. Potential particulate matter removal was notably proportional to socioeconomic strata with the wealthiest having the greatest potential while the poorest stratum had the lowest. Residential land-use property value premiums were weakly related to tree diameter and height, and locality and socioeconomic strata were the most significant predictors of property value in residential land-uses. We identified marked inequalities in ESS provision by urban trees in Bogota, Colombia highlighting a need for urban forest ESS to be taken into account in city planning efforts to address environmental justice issues and improve citizen welfare.

AB  - In the search for sustainable development, in which the ecological footprint is carefully considered by consumers and companies, teachers play an important role within a social and economic framework. This role relates to aspects of social responsibility. It should involve knowledge about education for responsible consumption in order to care for the environment both individually and socially. Considering this, the aim of this study is to find out whether there are differences in the level of awareness and the habits of future teachers of Early Childhood and Primary Education regarding sustainable social responsibility. A non-probabilistic sample of 30 Early Childhood Education degree students and 22 Primary Education degree students was used. Semi-structured interviews and an inductive process were conducted to examine the importance of Sustainable Development in society, the relevance of Social Responsibility for Sustainable Development (individual versus corporate), the attitudes and habits relative to Sustainable Development and the education on Sustainable Development in schools: knowledge, attitudes, and proposals. Students agree that they consume excessively. This is everyone's individual responsibility (as regarded by all participants), although changes could be supported by institutions and companies (Early Childhood education students argue in favour of corporate responsibility). Knowledge deficits were identified in relation to production, distribution, and sale processes. They consider education to be the main factor for sustainability, while society is ranked as the least important, observing an evident disagreement in relation to environmental and economic factors (perception of collective responsibility; Early Childhood versus Primary Education students). Finally, they also outline teaching proposals (active and participatory) to foster education for sustainable development at schools.

AB  - Objectives. We documented inequitable, cumulative environmental risk exposure and health between predominantly White low-income and middle-income children residing in rural areas in upstate New York. Methods. Cross-sectional data for 216 third- through fifth-grade children included overnight urinary neuroendocrine levels, noise levels, residential crowding (people/room), and housing quality. Results. After control for income, maternal education, family structure, age, and gender, cumulative environmental risk exposure (0-3) (risk > 1 SD above the mean for each singular risk factor [0, 1]) was substantially greater for low-income children. Cumulative environmental risk was positively correlated with elevated overnight epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol in the low-income sample but not in the middle-income sample. Conclusions. Cumulative environmental risk exposure among low-income families may contribute to bad health, beginning in early childhood.

AB  - In the Ecuadorian Amazon-one of Earth's last high-biodiversity wilderness areas and home to uncontacted indigenous populations-50 years of widespread oil development is jeopardizing biodiversity and feeding environmental conflicts. In 2019, a campaign to eliminate oil-related gas flaring, led by Amazonian communities impacted by fossil fuel production, resulted in an injunction against the Ecuadoran Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources and the Ministry of Environment and Water. On 26 January 2021 the Court of Nueva Loja issued a historical order to ban gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The present citizen science project played an important role in this process, enabling the production of independent spatial information through participatory mapping with indigenous and farmer communities. Globally, lack of independent information about oil activities has led to the monitoring of gas flaring by satellite imagery, achieving remarkable results. However, apart from institutional and remotely sensed data, reliable spatial information on gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon is not available. Therefore, we adopted the community-based participatory action research approach to develop a participatory GIS process, aiming both to provide reliable data and to support social campaigns for environmental and climate justice. This work presents the first participatory mapping initiative of gas flaring at a regional scale, carried out completely through open source data and software. Having identified 295 previously unmapped gas flaring sites through participatory mapping, we highlight that the extent of gas flaring activities is well beyond the official data provided by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Nightfire annual datasets, which map only 24% and 33% of the sites, respectively. Seventy five of the detected sites were in the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve. Moreover, 39 of the identified sites were venting instead of flaring, a phenomenon never before documented in the Ecuadorian Amazon. This study demonstrates that, because official datasets and satellite imagery underestimate the extent of gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon, community-based mapping offers a promising alternative for producing trusted, community-based scientific data. This community-produced data can support campaigns for legal recognition of human rights and environmental justice in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Finally, this study shows how local environmental conflicts can foster policy transformations that promote climate justice.

I consider the implications of extending the concept of resilience beyond the physical environment, analyze the effect of planning for adaptation rather than prevention, and finally examine the positive role played by community groups organized for environmental justice in responding to resiliency planning. My argument is that use of the term resilience tends to obscure distributional impacts and, even under a progressive mayor, supports neoliberal policy initiatives.

AB  - Pacific Island Nations are at great risk from climate change impacts such as storms and sea level rise. In the next century, they face the possibility of losing their homes and land, and having to relocate elsewhere; though questions of to where, how, and when remain open. To better understand these uncertain futures, we look to the past for answers on how these precarious circumstances have come about, examining the contribution of racist colonialism to environmental destruction and climate vulnerability. Telling the story of two islands-Nauru and Banaba-we imagine how it may be possible to begin approaching climate justice through international policy. Thus far, climate negotiations at the international scale have failed to meet the needs of the world's poorest and most vulnerable. However, we see a possibility for just futures with the incorporation of a mechanism on loss and damage that must hold countries accountable for their destructive pasts.

AB  - Meeting global targets that maintain temperatures at 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels while adapting to the growing impacts of climate change requires significant and rapid societal change. Within this context, there has been growing interest in building community resilience to shocks and stressors and as a forward-looking process. Yet while there has been extensive attention to conceptual aspects, there has been much less on how this can be achieved in practice. This research worked with three communities in Scotland (UK) regularly exposed to flooding and other integrated challenges to learn from action about community resilience building. A carefully developed four-tiered transdisciplinary approach was applied that included: relationship-building; enhancing capacities to work with interconnections; enabling processes; and supportive action-oriented research. The findings of the analysis of the system dynamics that were occurring during the resilience-building process highlight that it is a complex and messy social process. Yet, it also shows that if quality and sufficient quantity of support and time to help surface and deliberate on underlying assumptions about communities and change is provided, it can be possible to stimulate emergence of beneficial reinforcing social dynamics that begin to support collaborative and systemic action. To further advance know how about resilience building, much greater focus will be needed on the 'how' of resilience. This, in turn, will require new framings of, and approaches for, community resilience and new framings of research, knowledge and knowing.

AB  - Innovations to manage freshwater resources and avert shortages - including conservation through use of reclaimed wastewater, desalination, and demand-side management measures such as increasing block rate structures offer practical, effective remedies for meeting future water demands. We examine the challenges confronting adoption of these innovations that revolve around perceptions of fairness and public acceptability. A major obstacle to these approaches' adoption is environmental justice - that the risk and burden of resource solutions, as well as their benefits - should be borne equitably, despite differences of income or race. We first consider how debates regarding water supply are often disputes over different notions of environmental justice. We then examine general equity debates over adopting various innovations in one US state at the nexus of water demand and supply innovation: California. We contend that fairly adopting these innovations requires embracing open, inclusive, and transparent decision-making processes in which no important constituency is excluded from decisions, and in which different notions of environmental justice are embraced.

AB  - Links between urban green infrastructure (UGI) and public health benefits are becoming well established. Despite this, how UGI is distributed varies widely. Although not a universal finding, sectors of society that are disadvantaged often suffer from poor provision, something which might be due to which UGI are examined. We assess the distribution of street trees and public greenspaces (two types of publicly-owned and accessible UGI) across the city of Bradford, UK which is characterised by high levels of inequality and variation in ethno-racial background. We do this through statistical and spatial analyses. Street tree density was distributed unevenly and was highest in neighbourhoods with a high proportion of Asian/Asian British residents and with lower socioeconomic status. Conversely, neighbourhoods with better access to public greenspaces were characterised by high income and/or a high proportion of White households. While the quality of public greenspace was spatially clustered, there were only limited spatial associations with ethno-racial group or socio-economic status. Population density was a key determinant of the distribution of UGI, suggesting understanding UGI distributions should also focus on urban form. Nevertheless, within the same city we show that equitable distribution of UGI differs according to the form and characteristics of UGI. To fully realise the public health benefits of UGI, it is necessary to map provision and understand the causal drivers of unequal distributions. This would facilitate interventions that promote equitable distributions of UGI based on the needs of the target populations.

AB  - Latinos' utilization of natural environments in urban areas is affected by a myriad of factors, including acculturation levels and access to natural environments. This study examined the differences in access to natural environments and acculturation levels among Latinos residing in two urban communities and explored the determinants of recreation participation in natural environments. Questionnaires were randomly distributed to 392 Latino households. Descriptive statistics, parametric tests, multiple linear regressions, and binary logistic regressions were utilized in the analyses. Significant differences were found between Latinos residing in the two communities in terms of demographics, acculturation, and access to natural environments, which impacted their frequency of participation in various recreational activities. A major finding of this study was that access to natural environments significantly increases the likelihood of recreation participation. Future interventions may need to focus on increasing access to natural environments in Latino communities.

AB  - Indigenous peoples (IPs) worldwide are confronted by the increasing threat of pollution. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature (n = 686 studies), we present the current state of knowledge on: 1) the exposure and vulnerability of IPs to pollution; 2) the environmental, health, and cultural impacts of pollution upon IPs; and 3) IPs' contributions to prevent, control, limit, and abate pollution from local to global scales. Indigenous peoples experience large burdens of environmental pollution linked to the expansion of commodity frontiers and industrial development, including agricultural, mining, and extractive industries, as well as urban growth, waste dumping, and infrastructure and energy development. Nevertheless, IPs are contributing to limit pollution in different ways, including through environmental monitoring and global policy advocacy, as well as through local resistance toward polluting activities. This work adds to growing evidence of the breadth and depth of environmental injustices faced by IPs worldwide, and we conclude by highlighting the need to increase IPs' engagement in environmental decision-making regarding pollution control.

AB  - In recent years, environmental justice advocates have made a convincing claim that risky facilities have been disproportionately clustered in poor communities and communities of color. NIMBYism (not in my backyard) has spread from predominantly white, affluent suburbs to poorer communities of color. In this article, we propose a means of addressing environmental inequities and breaking the siting impasse. We think that poor communities of color might use the proposed siting of risky facilities as a basis for negotiating substantial improvements in the well-being of their communities. We propose to embed siting negotiations in the preparation of broader development packages,jointly created with citizens of poor neighborhoods and communities of color, so that health risks are reduced, the environment is improved, and all residents are better off. As far as justice is concerned, the perceived fairness of the process by which risks are communicated and selected, and risk management strategies are devised, is as important as the actual allocation of risk.

AB  - In response to the worsening crisis of climate change, researchers across the social sciences are increasingly seeking to understand and enact climate justice. In this Journal of Sociolinguistics Dialog, we suggest that sociolinguists have the opportunity-and the urgent responsibility-to contribute to this work. Julia Coombs Fine and Jessica Love-Nichols begin the Dialog by addressing the questions, "Why is sociolinguistics relevant to climate justice"? and "Why is climate justice relevant to sociolinguistics"? In light of links between environmental degradation and climate change, Rosalie Edmonds' and Jessica Pouchet's commentaries address climate justice through critical perspectives on the sociopolitical organization of wildlife and forest conservation. Highlighting the role of national epics in promoting or hindering climate justice, Diego Forte argues that gendered and colonial Argentinian identities underlie a carnist ideology that impedes substantive efforts toward sustainability. Bernard Perley provides a perspective on climate justice and Indigenous linguistics, calling attention to the power of Indigenous languages to decolonize the search for climate justice and provide a reimagination of hope during traumatic times. In closing, we emphasize the importance of critical and community-engaged work on language and climate justice, and highlight the need for coalitions of research and action.

AB  - Inspired by youth concerns for environmental justice and pathways forward that sustain diverse biology, we draw upon ecological psychology to theorise learning. This novel proposition, against the tide of cognitive constructivism, proffers a non-dualist paradigm more aligned with the purpose and intent of those seeking ecological justice and responds to calls for theory to support place-based education. Additionally, theory from ecological psychology lends support for understanding how ecocide is sustained and why work that inspired the environmental movement over half a century ago, such as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring has seemingly remained ignored and derided in the broader public realm. We provide some clues as to how that ignorance is perpetuated via understandings of perceptual learning theory. Finally, we map a pathway forward to respond with permaculture activism and offer a unique and solutions-based narrative that inspires hope in the face of catastrophe.

AB  - Over the last 20 years, Uganda has emerged as a testing ground for the various modes of carbon forestry used in Africa. Carbon forestry initiatives in Uganda raise questions of justice, given that people with comparatively negligible carbon footprints are affected by land use changes initiated by the desire of wealthy people, firms, and countries to reduce their more extensive carbon footprints. This paper examines the notions of justice local people express in relation to two contrasting carbon forestry projects in Uganda, the Mount Elgon Uganda Wildlife Authority- Forests Absorbing Carbon Emissions (UWA-FACE) project and Trees for Global Benefit (TFGB). UWA-FACE closed down its initial operations at Mount Elgon after 10 years as a result of deep controversies and negative international publicity, whereas TFGB is regarded by many as an exemplary design for smallholder carbon forestry in Africa. Our approach builds upon an emerging strand in the literature, of empirical analyses of local people's notions of justice related to environmental interventions. The main contribution of the paper is to examine how people's notions of justice have influenced divergent project outcomes in these cases. In particular, we highlight the relative success of TFGB in the way it meets people's primarily distributional concerns, apparently without significantly challenging prevalent expectations of recognition or procedural justice. In contrast, we illuminate how controversy across the range of justice dimensions in UWA-FACE at Mount Elgon ultimately led to the project's decline. This paper therefore explores how attention to notions of justice can contribute to a fuller understanding of the reactions of people to carbon forestry projects, as well as the pathways and ultimate outcomes of such interventions.

AB  - In September 2013, President Correa balanced himself on a felled log over an oil waste pit in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Extending a bare hand dripping with crude, he launched La Mano Sucia de Chevron campaign, demanding accountability for decades of contamination. This article explores the role of bodily knowledge in witnessing industrial contamination and struggles for environmental justice. Situating the mano sucia in the history of activism in the region, I show how the juxtaposition of different hands within the same motif reveals profoundly asymmetric relationships to the toxic entanglements that oil produces. Dirtied hands reveal the co-production of toxicity and power in extractive landscapes: At times throughout this article, the gesture calls for corporate accountability and distributive environmental justice, at other times, it reveals the systemic production of material, social and political distance between the accrual of benefit and the production of harm in an industrial-capitalist order. While drawing on the central role of bodily knowledges in apprehending environmental harm, I argue that bodily knowledges must also be examined for their specific relationships to forms of power and exploitation, and for their potential for appropriation by other parties - even when dedicated to condemning environmental injustice.

AB  - In this response to Van Hecken et al. (2018), we seek to clarify the analysis (Fletcher and Biischer, 2017) they critique in the face of gross distortion and redirect the discussion back to the point we sought to make: that it is crucial to point out that PES is a neoliberal conservation paradigm, and that this acknowledgement should be made even if PES implementation is far from any neoliberal "ideal" in practice. Only by following this nuanced perspective on PES that integrates agency and structure can we acknowledge what is inherently flawed about the paradigm: namely that it constrains broader opportunities for social and environmental justice beyond how local actors subject to PES interventions creatively appropriate the mechanism. This is why we titled our original article "The PES Conceit," as its promotion constrains these broader opportunities, even as they do not work out as planned.

AB  - Much of the research on environmental justice centers on environmental hazards. This article offers an overview of the emergence of environmental justice issues in outdoor recreation management and research. The authors argue that a major challenge to future research on environmental justice in outdoor recreation is clarifying definitions of environmental justice and generating awareness of the different dimensions of environmental justice. The authors also examine recent empirical studies of environmental justice issues related to outdoor recreation and other resource amenities. Based on an overview of the literature and these recent studies, the authors set forth some broad outlines to guide future research.

AB  - This article seeks to materialize social theories of modern temporalities. It proposes a tempo-material analysis of carbon resources like coal, oil, and gas to illuminate how fossil materialities both underpin and undermine modern temporalities and introduce the notion of fossil modernity to evoke an understanding of the modern composed of multiple conflicting modes of material temporality. Fossil resources (fossil fuels and petrochemical substances) drive the pace and progressive perspective of modernity. The residuals of these resources (CO2, plastic waste, and petrochemical toxins) confront societies with long-lasting ecological damage. Fossil fuels helped to produce the expectation of growth and endless possibility. Fossil residuals create a horizon of ecological liabilities in which past options have become future obligations. This renders the pretences of "modernization" understood as a process of constant renewal and innovation problematic. The article argues that modern societies cannot simply overcome their material-temporal predicaments through "decarbonization" because even after a shift to solar power, organic agriculture, and sustainable plastics, the fossil past will continue to influence, inform, and incite social operations. The article thus shows how different responses to the problems of fossil modernity need to go back to and emerge from the material residues of the past: this goes for bio-capitalist projects seeking to "recycle" the entropic temporality of fossil residuals as well as for environmental justice movements that decipher these residuals as indexes of social asymmetries and call for socio-ecological "redistribution."

AB  - In the United States (US), immigrants constitute a considerable and growing proportion of the general population. Compared to the US-born, immigrants have differential health risks, and it is unclear if environmental exposures contribute. In this work, we estimated disparities between immigrants and the US-born in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and attributable premature mortality, including by region of origin and time since immigration. With PM2.5 estimates from a validated model at similar to 1 km(2) spatial resolution and residential Census tract population data, we calculated the annual area-weighted average PM2.5 exposure for immigrants overall, the US-born, and immigrants separately by geographic region of origin and time since immigration. We then calculated the premature mortality attributed to PM2.5 for each population group, assessing disparities by immigrant status in PM2.5 exposure and attributable premature mortality in the US as a whole and in each US county to evevaluate spatial heterogeneity. Overall, immigrants were exposed to slightly higher PM2.5 (0.36 mu g/m(3), 3.8%) than the US-born. This exposure difference translates to 2.11 more premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 per 100,000 in population for immigrants compared to the US-born in 2010. Immigrant - US-born disparities in PM2.5 and attributable premature mortality were more severe among immigrants originating from Asia, Africa, and Latin America than those from Europe, Oceania, and North America. Disparities between immigrant groups by time since immigration were comparatively small. Sensitivity analyses using 2000 data and a non-linear set of PM2.5 attributable mortality coefficients identified similar patterns. Our findings suggest that environmental exposure disparities, such as in PM2.5, may contribute to immigrant health disparities in the US.

AB  - Parks are potential key urban assets for improved population health; however, their use is not equal among all social groups. Individual and contextual factors could influence residents' perceptions of parks and how they interact with and, eventually, benefit from them. The use of complementary methodologies provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between park use, physical activity (PA), and residents' perceptions. Thus, we designed a mixed-methods study to analyze differences in park use and PA, and the perceptions of parks as urban assets for PA. We selected six parks from three neighborhoods in Madrid (Spain) with different neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) for systematic social observation. We registered park users by age, PA level (low, medium, and high), gender, and NSES using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) audit tool adapted for iOS software (iSOPARC). We also conducted 37 semi-structured interviews and 29 focus groups to analyze residents' perceptions of parks as urban assets for PA in the same neighborhoods. We adopted a convergent-parallel design to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data, and to describe the convergence and divergence areas between them. Parks within the high-NSES were more visited, showing a higher proportion of people performing high PA (11.9%) as compared to residents of the middle (9.3%) and lowNSES (3.2%). Female visitors showed lower PA levels compared to men, especially for parks within high-NSES. The following issues were reported as influence urban park use and perceptions: park maintenance and area perception, works constraints, insecurity and crime, differential perceptions by age, and the availability of organized activities in the parks. Residents from high-NSES reported fewer barriers to park use compared to residents from the other areas, who reported limitations such as less leisure time due to job constrains or perceived insecurity in parks. Senior participants reported that having parks with organized activities and a design oriented towards different age-groups are valuable. Our study shows consistency between the fewer and less intense use of parks registered in the middle and low-NSES neighborhoods, and the more barriers for PA reported in this areas during the qualitative analysis. Mixed-methods provided an insight of the potential causes leading to the differences in park use and PA within cities, which is essential in terms of environmental justice and health equity. Thus, a mixed-methods comprehensive approach to public health problems can help designing public policies addressing relevant factors related to urban health inequities.

AB  - In Australia, local communities often enact Community-Based Initiatives (CBIs) to respond to climate change through Climate Change Adaptation (CCA). CBIs can also be integrated into the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) agenda. The paper explores the extent to which CBIs promote the mainstreaming of CCA into DRR. Primary data were obtained from interviews with representatives of CBIs and supporting organisations in three local governments of the Hunter Valley (New South Wales, Australia). Findings show that CBIs recognise the potential contribution of climate change in modifying the local hazard profile. CBIs mainstream CCA into DRR by following four approaches: environmental and social justice; sustainability and transition; ecosystem-based approach; and adaptive planning. Partnerships were identified both among CBIs and between CBIs and City Councils; however, conflicts between CBIs, City Councils and business actors emerged, and a lack of commitment by multi-level governments in responding to climate change was revealed. The findings show that CBIs consider CCA and DRR within a broad everyday context related to vulnerability and local development. But we argue that assigning responsibility for climate change issues to CBIs is not a panacea and should not be the only local climate change response. Instead, CBIs need to be included in a larger and long-term commitment by actors that possess access to resources, such as higher levels of government. The paper provides a local Australian perspective on the effectiveness of mainstreaming CCA into DRR and furthers the conversation for the benefit of other communities facing similar challenges.

AB  - Many cities are working to increase greenspace and tree canopy to improve residents' quality of life. However, from an environmental justice perspective, it is important to ask where greenspace is increased and whose quality of life is improved. This research investigates the environmental justice implications of urban tree canopy distribution and change in Philadelphia. Specifically, we conduct three distinct, yet interrelated analyses: (1) an evaluation of the environmental justice implications of Philadelphia's 2018 tree canopy distribution, (2) a description of tree canopy change in the city between 2008 and 2018, and (3) an assessment of the environmental justice implications of tree canopy change during this period. Thus, our study expands upon previous urban forest environmental justice research by evaluating the environmental justice implications of current tree canopy distribution and temporal changes in tree canopy coverage. We found that neighborhoods in Philadelphia with higher proportions of racialized minorities had lower levels of tree canopy coverage in 2018 and were less likely to gain tree canopy between 2008 and 2018. We argue that cities should use past changes in urban tree canopy, along with an understanding of the current distribution, to make future cities more green and just.

AB  - In this Article, Professor Foster examines the environmental justice movement from the "ground up"-from the perspective of the predominantly poor, African-American residents of Chester, Pennsylvania who attempted to.stop the clustering of waste facilities in their.community. From this perspective, Professor Foster evaluates the manner in which the phenomenon of environmental injustice is framed the efficacy of reforms in environmental decision-making processes, and the strategies and possibilities of grassroots efforts in achieving environmental justice. She argues that the distributive paradigm that often frames discussions of environmental injustice obscures the mechanisms and processes underlying inequitable outcomes, thwarting a full understanding of the phenomenon. Case studies such as Chester, however, illustrate that disproportionate exposure to environmental hazards result from a set of ongoing social processes that structure the political economy of poor communities of color. These grassroots struggles provide a window into the social relations and processes underlying distributive inequities and thus, assist reformers in identifying the types of policy reforms likely to help achieve environmental justice. Professor Foster argues that achieving environmental justice requires that siting reforms take both social structure and process seriously. She, however, concludes that while siting reform is necessary to achieve environmental justice, it should not displace the kind of transformative political action currently taking place in communities such as Chester, This political action is crucial to marginalized communities hoping to gain access and contribute to the policy- and decision-making processes that affect their material interests.

AB  - In the United States water pollution is a serious problem criminalized not only by the federal government, but by all states. These laws vary greatly in content, but are widely disobeyed and universally under-enforced. Statutes, case law, histories and journalism show "law in action" typologies of non-enforcement efficacious for analysis including: (1) jurisdiction issues like federal pre-emption, inter-state compacts, and constitutional limitations; (2) legislative issues such as failure to legislate, or legislating ineffectively; (3) agency issues, including administrative obstacles, delegation, power vacuums, procedure, and "agency capture"; (4) policing issues like apathy, under-funding/training, jurisdictional confusion, and "following the path of least resistance"; (5) prosecutorial issues, including isolation, intimidation, and ideological priority bias; (6) trial and appellate court issues, including unclear culpability, erroneous holdings, bias, and lack of judicial independence; and (7) citizen, victim, and defendant issues, including legal intellectual influence, environmentalist criminalization apathy, industry lobbying, environmental justice, reporting failures, self-policing, ethics and flight. The conclusion is non-enforcement in this area of criminal law shows that while federally there may exist a relatively consistent, content neutral enforcement system, at the state level resistance to enforcement is seen across a number of fronts. Ultimately, states can be seens as colonized frontiers servicing venture capitalism, consistent with a "race to the bottom.".

AB  - In order to share the benefits of oil production with people living in extraction areas, the oil industry targets social development investments and projects to communities most affected by production activities. Yet, the effectiveness of industry-led community development projects remains unclear and under explored. In this study, we use a benefit-sharing, distributional justice framework to assess the efficacy of social development projects among 11 municipal governments and 114 local communities in the Tampico-Misantla Basin, a major oil extraction region in Mexico. To test for distributional justice, we use geospatial, rapid rural appraisal, and government data to compare the spatial overlap of oil production, pipelines, recent drilling activity, well counts, state-funded public works, and social marginalization indexes to social development infrastructure (e.g. paved roads, schools, bridges). We explain the uneven distribution of risks and benefits among some rural communities as the result of premature investments in social development projects, party politics, corruption, community capacity, and proximity to urban areas. This study contributes an empirical approach to evaluate distributional justice in oil extraction areas. It also provides insights into Mexico's oil sector during a period of significant neoliberal restructuring, most recently with the 2014 Energy Reforms.

AB  - Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is becoming a dominant approach in generating political and societal support for conservation of globally important biodiversity. PES assumes that corporate actors and policymakers will be more likely to support environmental action if convinced of the economic rationale of doing so. However, by process-tracing two biodiversity projects funded by the Global Environment Facility in Jamaica and Mexico, I argue that linking biodiversity conservation to neoliberal economics reifies a short-term, exploitative view of the environment. Economic calculations about biodiversity will not persuade corporate actors and policymakers to abandon short-term exploitation. Moreover, commodifying nature under the neoliberal paradigm undermines other perspectives on the value of nature, notably those rooted in cultural, historic, subsistence and aesthetic paradigms. In turn, this restricts the ability of populations not integrated into major economic markets to participate in governance and influence what "effective" regime implementation looks like at the local level.

AB  - Introduction: Climate change is impacting the physical and mental health of children and families. This is a state of the science update regarding the impacts of climate change for pediatric-focused health care providers and advanced practice registered nurses. Method: Using an equity lens, the authors reviewed and synthesized current literature regarding the adverse impacts of climate change. Results: The poor and communities of color are disproportionately impacted by climate change. Physical health impacts include increased vector and water-born infectious diseases, increases in asthma and respiratory infections, and undernutrition. Social disruptions lead to human trafficking. Climate change is associated with mental health concerns, including anxiety and posttraumatic stress after natural disasters. Discussion: As clinicians, pediatric-focused providers, and advanced practice registered nurses should use multipronged and interdisciplinary approaches to address or prevent the adverse impacts of climate change. Advocacy at all government levels is necessary to safeguard children and vulnerable populations.

AB  - Open government data (OGD) are critical for environmental justice (EJ) policymaking, which is characterized by power and information asymmetries across government agencies, affected populations, and advocacy groups. We contend that not only should state governments provide OGD but also they should remove the burden associated with data access and use it to address the data divide and facilitate the participation of vulnerable populations in policymaking. Applying a user-oriented approach, this article evaluates the completeness, usability, and accessibility of EJ-OGD initiatives across the 50 US states. Results show that only one out of five states achieves at least half points on our EJ-OGD Implementation Score, suggesting that most states do not provide OGD to answer two core EJ questions: "To what extent is my community exposed to environmental harm and health hazards? Is the exposure disproportionately high given my community's socioeconomic characteristics?" We discuss implications for equity and next steps for the government.

AB  - It has been shown that the location of schools near heavily trafficked roads can have detrimental effects on the health of children attending those schools. It is therefore desirable to screen both existing school locations and potential new school sites to assess either the need for remedial measures or suitability for the intended use. Current screening tools and public guidance on school siting are either too coarse in their spatial resolution for assessing individual sites or are highly resource intensive in their execution (e.g., through dispersion modeling). We propose a new method to help bridge the gap between these two approaches. Using this method, we also examine the public K-12 schools in the Sacramento Area Council of Governments Region, California (USA) from an environmental justice perspective. We find that PM2.5 emissions from road traffic affecting a school site are significantly positively correlated with the following metrics: percent share of Black, Hispanic and multi-ethnic students, percent share of students eligible for subsidized meals. The emissions metric correlates negatively with the schools' Academic Performance Index, the share of White students and average parental education levels. Our PM2.5 metric also correlates with the traffic related, census tract level screening indicators from the California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool and the tool's tract level rate of asthma related emergency department visits.

AB  - Our project examines the association between percent African American and smoke pollution in the form of prescribed burn-sourced, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the U.S. state of Georgia for 2018. (1) Background: African Americans constitute 32.4% of Georgia's population, making it the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the state followed by Hispanic Americans at 9.8%. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and lower wealth groups are more likely than most middle and upper income White Americans to be exposed to environmental pollutants. This is true because racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live in urban areas where pollution is more concentrated. As a point of departure, we examine PM2.5 concentrations specific to prescribed fire smoke, which typically emanates from fires occurring in rural or peri-urban areas. Two objectives are specified: a) examine the association between percent African American and PM2.5 concentrations at the census tract level for Georgia, and b) identify emitters of PM2.5 concentrations that exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the 24-h average, i.e., >35 mu g/m(3). (2) Methods: For the first objective, we estimate a spatial Durbin error model (SDEM) where pollution concentration (PM2.5) estimates for 1683 census tracts are regressed on percent of the human population that is African American or Hispanic; lives in mobile homes; and is employed in agriculture and related occupations. Also included as controls are percent evergreen forest, percent mixed evergreen/deciduous forest, and variables denoting lagged explanatory and error variables, respectively. For the second objective, we merge parcel and prescribed burn permit data to identify landowners who conduct prescribed fires that produce smoke exceeding the NAAQS. (3) Results: Percent African American and mobile home dweller are positively related to PM2.5 concentrations; and government and non-industrial private landowners are the greatest contributors to exceedance levels (4) Conclusions: Reasons for higher PM2.5 concentrations in areas with higher African American and mobile home percent are not clear, although we suspect that neither group is a primary contributor to prescribed burn smoke but rather tend to live proximate to entities, both public and private, that are. Also, non-industrial private landowners who generated prescribed burn smoke exceeding NAAQS are wealthier than others, which suggests that African American and other environmental justice populations are less likely to contribute to exceedance levels in the state.

AB  - Nature-based and heritage tourism development provides a potentially valuable tool in the distribution of benefits to rural counties in the southeastern United States. However, tourism planners often fail in their efforts to incorporate culturally diverse populations in planning processes. This study examines African Americans' role in nature-based and heritage tourism planning in Hamilton County, Florida. While public officials have solicited community involvement, African Americans, who comprise over 40% of the county's population, continue to be underrepresented in public planning initiatives. This study uses qualitative ethnographic methods to account for African American residents' opinions regarding participation in county decision making and their role in the emerging nature-based and heritage tourism industry. It highlights issues that can impede efforts at cross-cultural collaboration and points to the need for addressing historic power relations in approaching future collaborative strategies.

AB  - Insofar as race, class, and gender have profound effects on people's environmental experiences, and consequently their activism, the environmental field needs more work on the environmental experiences and insights of groups whose voices have been missing, including youth of color who live in urban areas in the U.S. In this paper, we focus on African American and Latinx students engaged in environmental projects in their urban communities and the impact of such projects on promoting pro-environmental leadership, agency, and behavior. We draw from written reflections and focus group interviews of several hundred 4th-12th graders (majority middle- and high-school students) who participated in place-based civic science projects. Thematic analyses of student responses found that students engaged in work on local environmental issues cultivated an appreciation for the natural world and an understanding of human-nature interdependence and the ties between the local environment and their communities' health. Through taking action with others in their communities, students viewed themselves as contributors to their communities and started to form environmental identities in ways that are not traditionally measured. Findings point to the need for forms of environmental education that are contextually grounded and centered on environmental justice in urban areas.

AB  - In a scenario where ecosystemic services are being eroded and there is high social inequity, a new model of development is necessary, namely one capable of promoting social development with a reduction of its ecological footprint. The 'Green Economy' model is one of the proposed models. This paper seeks to analyze the environmental, social and individual impacts on human health in the context of a 'brown economy', and discusses the contributions of a green economy on the promotion of equity and health. The assumption is that economic development and environmental sustainability are not incompatible and both contribute to the eradication of poverty. The transition to a sustainable economy depends on political decisions, and transcends technological developments. Above all, it should instigate new models of production, consumption and social organization, which promote socio-environmental justice, encouraging social participation and democratic forms of governance to define a solid agenda for the implementation of sustainable development and mechanisms to implement them at all levels.

AB  - In the field of environmental health, the impact of air pollution on people's cognitive function is receiving increasing attention. Various air pollution exposures and different exposure periods result in different degrees of damage to cognition. This paper first used CFPS cognitive tests to evaluate the cognitive function of 15,163 adults in 25 provinces of China. Next, based on the geographical location of the population, the kriging interpolation method was applied to evaluate the different exposure periods for various air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2 and O-3). Air pollution exposures lasting 3 years and more were referred to in this paper as long-term exposures, while those lasting<3 years were short-term exposures. This paper used an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model to explore the differential effects of various air pollutant exposures and discussed the impact of long- and short-term exposure to pollutants. Subsequently, Moran's index was used to test the spatial connection for cognitive function, and the spatial error model was used for analysis in the spatial autoregressive model. This research also conducted a heterogeneity study on the justice of air pollutant exposure among people with different characteristics. The population was classified according to cognitive function and geographic location using OLS regression and quantile regression, and a propensity score matching (PSM) model was used for crossvalidation to explore whether people with different characteristics and attributes were differentially exposed to air pollution. We found that there were significant negative relationships between air pollutant exposure and cognitive function, especially PM2.5 exposure and long-term exposure. In addition, air pollution had significantly different impacts on cognition based on the different characteristics and attributes of the person exposed. This study helps by analyzing the socioeconomic factors that affect the level of exposure and suggests that groups who are vulnerable to environmental pollution should be protected and the occurrence of injustice reduced. The study also provides a reference for the distribution of pollution sources and the allocation of health resources, which can be useful for population distribution planning.

AB  - Increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows. Low impact development (LID) approaches present a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide water conservation opportunities. They also provide a wide array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics, increasing property value, and providing shared green spaces. While projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities, marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation. Underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities. This research develops a participatory decision-making approach to address environmental justice for marginalized communities and explore LID strategies at the watershed scale for improving hydrological performance and mitigating flooding. Focus groups are designed and conducted to solicit input from community members, stakeholders, and community advocates about sustainable stormwater management alternatives. Input will be used to develop LID strategies that meet community goals, such as maximizing the provision of ecosystem services, providing water conservation opportunities, and fostering community building. A hydrologic/hydraulic stormwater modeling system will be developed using HEC-HMS and SWMM to simulate the stormwater impacts of rain water harvesting systems, green roofs, and bioretention cells. This approach will be implemented for a marginalized community within the Walnut Creek Watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina. On-going research will seek further feedback from the community about LID strategies that are developed using the hydrologic/hydraulic modeling system to assess preferences about LID decisions and tradeoffs among design goals.

AB  - Increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area, which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows. Green Infrastructure (GI) approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics, increasing property value, and providing shared green spaces. While projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities, marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation. Underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities. This research explores GI-based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows. GI deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential. A hydrologic/hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5.1) to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies. Management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households, the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households, the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land, and combinations of those strategies. Realities of implementing Cl on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios. The effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow; social benefits are not evaluated. This approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the Walnut Creek Watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper examines how MillionTreesLA and MillionTreesNYC defined environmental justice and assesses their progress. While the literature measures distributive equity using statistics, these programs lacked quantifiable benchmarks, leading to ambiguous outcomes. While only MillionTreesNYC successfully planted a million trees, it did not prioritize underserved neighborhoods to a significant degree. In contrast, MillionTreesLA may have prioritized underserved neighborhoods, yet its records were insufficiently detailed to know for sure. Cities must connect theory and practice, adopting statistical benchmarks and improving data collection to monitor progress toward environmental justice.

AB  - In light of 2014-2016 media coverage about the inadequate water and sanitation services for households in places like Flint and Detroit, Michigan and the Central Valley of California, this paper asks whether places with majority non-White residents in the United States disproportionately lack access to these most basic of services. Investigating this issue through the combined lenses of structural racism, environmental justice, and the human right to water and sanitation, we analyze U.S. Census American Community Survey household data at the county level. Our findings indicate strong White versus non-White racial effects at the national and county levels (R-2 = 0.0462, P < 0.05). When the non-White population is broken down into racial categories, places with higher percentages of American Indians and Alaska Native households are significantly associated with lack of access to complete plumbing facilities. Lacking access to complete plumbing does correlate with lower educational attainment and higher percentages of unemployment, and less robustly, it also correlates positively with median household income. The implication is the existence of a pattern of structural environmental racism in terms of the practical accessibility of water and sanitation infrastructure. We suspect, however, that the U.S. Census, while considered the most comprehensive national data source on this issue right now, significantly undercounts those lacking access to water and sanitation services. We argue that better data will be essential in order to carry out a more in-depth analysis of water access conditions and to develop strategies that address this issue of growing importance.

AB  - It is apparent that contemporary American nature writing and environmental fiction have, for decades, evinced a trait that Lawrence Buell sees as definitory: "Human accountability to the environment is part of the text's ethical orientation." The best of the environmental essays and fictions of the late twentieth, early twenty-first centuries share an implicit, and often, explicit, ethical configuration wherein human agency calls for responsibility, respect, and care. Has literary criticism, and ecocriticism in particular, engaged this ethically charged literature with a similar sense of responsibility and commitment? Are ecocritical discourses intrinsically ethical, intrinsically committed and transformative? It is the aim of this article to answer these questions by considering some of today's most stimulating discussions, among ecofeminists and environmental justice actors, in particular, and by examining related fields such as bioregionalism and animal rights. This study will show that environmental criticism reveals, indeed, an ethical orientation which results in various types of engagement (intellectual, and sometimes physical) and in theoretical and social commitment.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a toxic and ubiquitous class of environmental chemicals, products of fuel combustion from human and natural sources. The objective of this study was to identify vulnerable populations for high PAH exposure and variability, to better understand where to target PAH exposure reduction initiatives. Urinary metabolite data were collected from 9517 individuals from the U.S. CDC National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 2005-2014 for four parental PAHs naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. We utilized these urinary biomarkers to estimate PAH intake, and regression models were fit for multiple demographic and lifestyle variables, to determine variable effects, interactions, odds of high versus low PAH intake. Smoking and secondhand smoke exposure accounted for the largest PAH intake rate variability (25.62%), and there were strongest interactions between race/ethnicity and smoking or SHS exposure, reflected in a much greater contribution of smoking to PAH intake in non-Hispanic Whites as compared to other races/ethnicities. Increased odds of high PAH intake were seen in older age groups, obese persons, college graduates, midrange incomes, smokers, and those who were SHS exposed. Among the non-smoking population, effects of other demographic factors lessened, suggesting a highly interactive nature. Our results suggest that there are demographic subpopulations with high PAH intake as a result of different smoking behaviors and potentially other exposures. This has human health, environmental justice, and regulatory implications wherein smoking cessation programs, SHS exposure regulations, and public health initiatives could be better targeted towards vulnerable subpopulations to meaningfully reduce PAH exposures.

AB  - In the United States today, there is growing concern over what is being referred to as a 'water crisis', but which is, in fact, a crisis of equity in water access. This concern has been exacerbated and illuminated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper draws on reports from leading NGOs, activist groups and media sources, on commentary from high-profile water actors, and on emerging academic literature. In the process of these investigations, it uncovers a tendency to frame the water crisis primarily in terms of affordability; it also notes widespread concern over access and water quality issues. All of these are fundamentally related to equity principles. We argue here that seeing America's water crisis as being about equity of access provides an opportunity to foreground the historic inequities revealed by the pandemic and by the subsequent economic downturn. A broader, intersectional approach can open-up the problem framing of water equity in the US to include histories of racism and colonialism. An intersectional approach allows for a more integrated and holistic analysis of the ways in which social difference shapes access, quality and affordability of water. Underlying power structures can be revealed through a better understanding of how water inequities result from broader patterns of systemic racism and colonial relations. Ultimately, this improved understanding can result in interventions that disrupt familiar patterns of inequality. As the idea of a water crisis in the US comes into the mainstream, the paper offers a point from which academics can begin to frame their research and a base from which practitioners can consider how to better achieve equity in water governance.

AB  - In the last decade, the fossil fuel divestment (FFD) movement has emerged as a key component of an international grassroots mobilization for climate justice. Using a text analysis of Facebook pages for 144 campaigns at higher education institutions (HEIs), this article presents an overview and analysis of the characteristics of the higher education (HE) FFD movement in the US. The results indicate that campaigns occur at a wide array of HEIs, concentrated on the east and west coasts. Primarily student led, campaigns set broad goals for divestment, while reinvestment is often a less clearly defined objective. Campaigns incorporate a mixture of environmental, social, and economic arguments into their messaging. Justice is a common theme, used often in a broad context rather than towards specific populations or communities impacted by climate change or other social issues. These insights contribute to the understanding of the HE FFD movement as ten years of campus organizing approaches. In particular, this study illustrates how the movement is pushing sustainability and climate action in HE and in broader society towards a greater focus on systemic change and social justice through campaigns' hardline stance against fossil fuels and climate justice orientation.

AB  - Neighborhood life expectancy varies by as much as 10 years across the City of Louisville. In 2013, the Greater Louisville Project funded by local government, businesses, and foundations, argued these differences had little to do with environmental factors. The Greater Louisville Project (2013) study argued that these neighborhood differences could be attributed 40% to socio-economic factors (with a major emphasis on education), 10% to physical environment, 30% to health behaviors, and 20% to access to medical care. To test these claims, we construct our own model of neighborhood variation in years of potential life lost (YPLL) by adding two variables testing environmental degradation. We operationalise two separate measures of environmental contamination: proximity to EPA designated brownfield sites and proximity to chemical factories in an industrial park in the neighborhood known as "Rubbertown". We conduct several regression analyses, which show a relationship between proximity to environmental contaminants and an increase in neighborhood YPLL. Our beta weights challenge the claims made by the Greater Louisville Project, which minimize the impact nearness to environmental contaminants has on reductions in life expectancy in Louisville neighborhoods.

AB  - Peasants and rural communities are on the front lines of most climate catastrophes taking place nowadays worldwide; at the same time, we have been the ones taking care of our common planet over generations. This article begins with a brief overview of the current situation of land use in the world today and links it to climate issues. It then describes some of the solutions to climate threats being negotiated between national governments and the private sector. It then highlights solutions that communities are already implementing and concludes with the reasons why systemic change is needed in order to achieve agrarian and climate justice.

AB  - In this article, we review the theory of ecologically unequal exchange and its relevance for global environmental injustice. According to this theory, global political-economic factors, especially the structure of international trade, shape the unequal distribution of environmental harms and human development; wealthier and more powerful Global North nations have disproportionate access to both natural resources and sink capacity for waste in Global South nations. We discuss how the theory has roots in multiple perspectives on development, world-systems analysis, environmental sociology, and ecological economics. We detail research that tests hypotheses derived from ecological unequal exchange theory on several environmental harms, including deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and water pollution as well as related human well-being outcomes. We also discuss research on social forces that counter the harmful impacts of ecologically unequal exchange, including institutions, organizations, and environmental justice movements. We suggest that ecologically unequal exchange theory provides an important global political-economic approach for research in environmental sociology and other environmental social sciences as well as for sustainability studies more broadly.

AB  - In November 1972, the United Nations developed the World Heritage Convention in recognition of the need for protecting valuable cultural and natural sites of global importance. The convention was designed to identify and protect heritage sites worldwide. Although the Aral Sea has not yet been preposed by any of the Central Asian states as a world heritage site, it meets many of the criteria designated by the Convention as a site meriting such status, The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, the notion of heritage and its application to world heritage status are discussed, Second, this notion is applied to the Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia in an attempt to answer the question, 'Does the Aral Sea merit heritage status?'. Finally, 'environmental justice' issues, which might arise as a result of such a designation, are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neighborhoods shape every element of our lives. Where we live determines economic opportunities; our exposure to police and pollution; and the availability of positive amenities for a healthy life. Home inequity-both financial and racial-is not accidental. Federal government programs have armed white people with agency to construct "white" spaces while stigmatizing "Black" spaces. The urgency of addressing structural injustice in housing has been laid bare by police-involved shootings and the disparate death rates linked to COVID-19. Using political philosopher Tommy Shelbie's theory of corrective justice, this Article explores the historical and present-day harms that need to be rectified and then offers a path forward through concrete changes to federal housing policy. This Article's proposals address access to home-ownership, stable housing for renters, reliable mass transit, and increased availability of affordable housing. The policy prescriptions are intended to address systemic racism, but the changes wrought would benefit people across race and ethnicity. As those on the front lines of the Black Lives Matter movement argue: freedom and justice for Black people will extend to freedom and justice for all people.

AB  - Low-cost housing provision has been a major focus of government in post-apartheid urban South Africa. While successes can be noted, there is growing concern regarding the social and environmental sustainability of housing programs and the impacts upon both the surrounding environment and human health. Utilizing key informant interviews, survey research, Census data and documentary review, this essay identifies the major impediments to a sustainable low-cost housing provision in urban South Africa. The essay also points to hopeful signs in new policy directions, particularly attention to health issues and informal settlement upgrade programs. However, the major obstacles to a sustainable low-cost housing process, including macro-economic conditions, enduring historical legacies of race and class, the scale and rapidity of urban growth and institutional challenges show little indication of abating.

AB  - Numerous cities in the world have to handle and support increasing populations, with questions remaining concerning good planning strategies for their growth and development. Among these questions, access to nature for urban residents has been the subject of increased scrutiny in recent years. We here propose and apply a generally applicable new approach to quantitatively investigate the role of close access to natural or nature-based green-blue areas for the well-being of urban populations. A key novel aspect of this approach is to use income level as a measure of people's ability to choose their nearby living environment such that it provides them with the highest affordable level of well-being. Based on this measure, we concretely investigate possible trends in local green-blue area access with increasing local income level in the case-study example of the Stockholm Metropolitan region in Sweden. For this regional case, we find clear relationships between income level (and related degree of nationality homogeneity) and share of natural/nature-based green-blue areas and man-made grey areas within walksheds of different population segments. The results point at the importance of maintaining and restoring nearby natural and nature-based green-blue areas as key solutions for increased well-being of urban populations and call for further testing and comparative investigations of local-scale associations between socio-economic descriptors and physical environment in other parts of the world.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the field of urban political ecology (UPE) has developed into a robust theoretical framework for understanding the production of uneven socionatures. More recently, expanded theoretical and empirical innovations in UPE research are pushing the framework's radical roots into new and productive directions for addressing (not just critiquing) persistent inequalities and marginalizations in and beyond cities. We trace this trajectory of UPE towards its more transformative potential and argue that UPE's relevance will increase as scholars continue to embrace the power of what Povinelli calls "obstinate curiosity" to give rise to unexpected connections between people and ecologies. Specifically, we call for continued diversification of both theoretical and methodological starting points for UPE research, particularly with respect to the ways that scholars practice situated solidarity movements for social and environmental justice in cities.

AB  - Knowledge of the health impacts of environmental exposures (such as pollution disasters, poor air quality, water contamination, climate change) on children's health has dramatically increased in the past 40 years. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 23% of all deaths worldwide were attributable to the environment, and 26% of deaths in children less than 5 years old could be prevented with removal of environmental risks factors. Yet, little has permeated medical education, leaving pediatric providers ill equipped to address these issues. To address this gap, members from the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a United States nationwide network of academically affiliated experts who have created numerous environmental health educational materials and programs, have identified fifteen core environmental health (EH) competencies needed by health care providers to enable them to effectively address environmental health concerns. These competencies can serve as the foundation for the development and implementation of relevant educational programs. The core EH competencies are based upon these foundational elements: 1) Definition of "children's environmental health" that describes how environmental exposures (positive and negative) in early life influence the health and development in childhood and across the entire human life span 2) Children are not "little adults" and so have unique vulnerabilities to environmental hazards; 3) Environmental health inequities exist, causing some children to have a disproportionate amount of unhealthy exposures and consequently a greater risk of adverse effects; 4) Climate change will translate to numerous adverse health effects that will particularly affect children worldwide. In this article, the authors describe the core environmental health competencies and provide resources, online tools, strategies, and examples targeted to all levels of training and practice to better enable leaders and educators to bring this important content to the forefront.

AB  - In this paper we pursue the hypothesis that acceptance of the energy transition is not merely determined by technology acceptance but also by the perception of socio-institutional stakeholders and the perception of fairness. We test an acceptance model which includes the following main predictors: attitudes towards the risks of the energy transition and attitudes towards the technology options such as wind power, photovoltaic systems or transmission lines. Additional influences are assumed to arise from the perception of regional added values and the trust in various socio-institutional stakeholders. Furthermore, we expect fairness to be a mediating variable for acceptance. In this paper we test the model empirically with a representative German sample (N = 2009) in a structural equation model (SEM) for the acceptance of onshore wind power. Moreover, we analyse whether differences in the factors are related to the German regions North, East, West and South since we assume regional landscapes, renewable energy sources and socio-political contexts to be important for acceptance. Results show evidence that perception of stakeholders and fairness is important for the regional acceptance. In addition, results show that, among the four regions, different factors are relevant for acceptance. Results are discussed and conclusions for governance are drawn.

AB  - In the context of a game-changing, uncharacteristic form of authority granted by the 1987 Constitution, the Philippine Supreme Court has shed its restraint-based, pro-precedent inclinations by adopting new rules of procedures for expeditious environmental litigation as well as for effectively managing environmental cases. The "green" rules provide for novel legal means to assert a right or relieve environmental injury, and allow the court to step into the institutional gap created by the persistent incoherence in executive policy-making, in order to prevent further miscarriage of environmental justice. Through illustrations of selected court cases, the paper argues that the ground-breaking post-modernist legal distillations have successfully translated into helpful public policies and good practices which redress unjust distributions of power that weaken environmental protection, and expanded access to justice and effective participation by the poor and other vulnerable sectors. In the process, the "unelected" high court has knocked over conventional counter-majoritarian thinking and made the grade as a sensible activist judiciary.

AB  - Lacking access to stable shelter, infrastructure, and services, houseless people are exposed to a range of environmental hazards. Yet, environmental justice scholars have only begun to consider how environmental justice issues impact unsheltered people. In dialogue with Critical Environmental Justice (EJ) Studies and geographies of homelessness research, and drawing on seven years of participant observation and a national phone survey of 47 houseless community representatives, this paper begins to chart a baseline Critical EJ analysis of homelessness. I argue that understanding the environmental justice experiences of houseless people requires attention not only to direct exposure to hazards, but also to criminalization. Police sweeps in downtown and residential areas push people into toxic spaces; when houseless communities express concerns, they risk further eviction. In this way, cities overwhelmingly respond to hazard exposure with displacement, creating a cycle of criminalization, dangerous living conditions, and serial forced removals. Moreover, examining such intersecting hazards and their impacts through a Black feminist lens of intersectionality reveals how systemic violence vis-a-vis environmental hazards is multiplied and magnified for houseless people along lines of race, gender, age, disability status, and so on. By bringing Critical EJ and geographies of homelessness into conversation, with particular attention to intersectional impacts, scholars and organizers can better attend to the complex suite of issues that differentially shape the lives of houseless people and inspire resistance.

AB  - Many cities in the world seek to establish more sustainable urban transport systems with a view to reduce accidents, congestion, air and noise pollution, and to improve social interactions, liveability and amenity values. Against this background, this paper frames urban transportation as an issue of justice: contemporary transport systems are characterized by injustice, as they tend to favour and prioritize motorized transport, accepting that considerable environmental and social burdens are put on more sustainable forms of transportation, other traffic participants and society as a whole. To conceptualize 'urban transport justice', the paper discusses three dimensions where injustices are apparent: Exposure to traffic risks and pollutants; distribution of space; and valuation of transport time. It is argued that public and political recognition of urban transport injustices provides significant argument for changes in urban planning, transport infrastructure development and traffic management (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of 340 residents of New Jersey found that 15%-20% reported multiple problems with using their immediate neighborhoods for physical activity. These respondents were disproportionately African Americans living in neighborhoods that they regard as only of fair or poor quality. Neighborhood walkability is a second-wave environmental justice issue meriting carefully designed research and ameliorative actions in concert with other neighborhood-level redevelopment activities.

AB  - In the West Bank, hundreds of non-Palestinian women who are married to Palestinian men have recently been issued shortened visas with tightened restrictions. This means they are often prevented from working, their mobilities are severely reduced and they are placed in extremely precarious bureaucratic and procedural positions. The research in this article draws from fieldwork interviews with women affected by such restrictions to show how politically induced precarities produce gendered effects towards specific ends of the occupation of Palestine. We thus frame a discussion of the women's experiences of visa regulations through precarity before giving an account of the profound effects on women's roles in family and political life. We then broaden the focus to consider Israel's occupation of Palestine and the demographic implications of the gendered effects of visa precarity. In doing so we make the argument that Israel's spousal visa regulations contribute to the (re)production of uneven gender relations and the demographic objective of emptying out the West Bank.

AB  - Political equality and responsiveness to citizens are both central values in democracy. Citizens strong in political resources may, however, impress their preferences upon decision makers more effectively than others, meaning that government responsiveness may possibly exacerbate inequality in policy outcomes, especially if participatory democratic arrangements are prevalent. The article studies these processes empirically, drawing on a dataset of the siting of unwanted facilities in two Swedish cities. Indicative of the tension between equality and responsiveness, we find that residents' political resources affect facility siting in the local district.

Modeled air pollution offers environmental justice researchers a new and robust data source for representing chronic environmental hazards. Methods. We used multiple regression equations to predict criteria pollution levels using sociodemographic variables at the Census block group level. Results. We find that Census block groups with lower neighborhood socioeconomic status, higher proportions of Latino immigrants, and higher proportions of renters are exposed to higher levels of criteria air pollutants. Proportion African American, however, is not a significant predictor of criteria air pollution in the Phoenix metro area. Conclusions. These findings demonstrate clear social-class and ethnic-based environmental injustices in the distribution of air pollution. We attribute these patterns to the role of white privilege in the historical and contemporary development of industrial and transportation corridors in Phoenix in relation to racially segregated neighborhoods. Although all people are implicated in the production of criteria pollutants, lower-income and ethnic-minority residents are disproportionately exposed in metropolitan Phoenix.

AB  - Over the last 5 years, environmental justice (EJ) researchers have been calling for incorporation of health outcomes more directly into spatial studies of socio-demographics and environmental hazards. To date, researchers have not incorporated insurance status (an access to health care variable) in their models although access to care likely has an important association with the probability of health effects due to environmental exposures. As such, insurance status represents an important variable within spatial EJ studies focused on health, and the lack of spatially explicit access to care data is a critical limitation in the field. As a solution, we offer a method of using uninsured appendicitis cases, acquired secondarily from state hospital admissions data, to estimate rates of uninsurance at the zip-code level. We apply the technique to explore relationships between cancer risk from hazardous air pollutants and estimated rates of uninsurance, a previously unexplored phenomenon. Then, we compare the uninsurance findings to those related to poverty to illustrate how uninsurance, as a variable, compares to a more traditional socio-economic predictor used in EJ studies. The relationship between cancer risk from hazardous air pollutants and uninsurance is weaker than the relationship between risk and poverty, but both are statistically significant. As such, we conclude with a discussion of the importance of considering insurance status in spatial studies of EJ focused on health.

AB  - Parks benefit communities by supporting the physical, mental, and social health of their residents. This is especially important in urban areas, where parks provide essential access to green space, and especially among low-income populations who may lack alternative venues for outdoor recreation. However, although urban parks may ostensibly be accessible, their use can be influenced by factors including perceptions and realities of safety. This qualitative study explored the issue of safety as it relates to park use and park-based physical activity from six focus groups with 41 total participants in urban Kansas City, Missouri. As a facilitator to safety, participants described social interactions and structural environment factors. Safety constraints emerged along five main themes: violence, concerning behavior, lack of maintenance, lack of lighting, and traffic/busy roads. This study adds to the literature establishing safety as a complex and multidimensional factor influencing park usage and physical activity.

AB  - Legacies of social and environmental injustices can leave an imprint on the present and constrain transitions for more sustainable futures. In this article, we ask this question: What is the relationship of environmental inequality and histories of segregation? The answer for Baltimore is complex, where past practices of de jure and de facto segregation have created social and environmental legacies that persist on the landscape today. To answer this question, we examine the interactions among past and current environmental injustices in Baltimore from the late 1880s to the present using nearly twenty years of social and environmental justice research from the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), a long-term social-ecological research project. Our research demonstrates that patterns and procedures in the city's early history of formal and informal segregation, followed by "redlining" in the 1930s, have left indelible patterns of social and environmental inequalities. These patterns are manifest in the distribution of environmental disamenities such as polluting industries, urban heat islands, and vulnerability to flooding, and they are also evident in the distribution of environmental amenities such as parks and trees. Further, our work shows how these legacies are complicated by changing perceptions of what counts as an environmental disamenity and amenity. Ultimately, we argue that the interactions among historical patterns, processes, and procedures over the long term are crucial for understanding environmental injustices of the past and present and for constructing sustainable cities for the future.

AB  - On 12 December last year, the representatives of almost two hundred nations reached the "Paris Agreement" on climate change. But despite its promising wording, the agreement does not provide for any binding enforcement mechanism. This basically means that liability law remains silent on issues of environmental damage. What would be needed, therefore, are effective enforcement mechanisms including novel forms of private law enforcement. When faced with the demand of climate justice, however, the law finds itself in a paradoxical state that can be described as an "epistemic trap": On one hand, the law is unable to immunize itself against political or economical or other nonlegal communication. On the other hand, it does not appear to be able to achieve nonlegal policy goals, especially those given by norm-incentive models or ex ante consequentialism. But it is these epistemic limitations of law that provide for epistemic autonomy, thus for constructive freedom in a long-term self-reflective "discovery process". In order to escape from the epistemic trap, the law needs to look beyond the traditional criteria of individual causation and fault, likewise transcending its own "reality perceptions" of actors as legal persons and subjects of responsibility.

AB  - In this paper we examine two central concepts of urban metabolism ('system boundaries' and 'flows'), and explore how to approach them as a means to politicise urban metabolism research. We present empirical findings from two case studies of waste management, in Mexico City and Santiago de Chile, looking at: the materiality of waste flows, the actors involved in them, and how waste flows relate to issues of environmental justice. We argue that urban metabolism, as a methodology to understand urban sustainability, has the potential to produce knowledge to trigger urban transformations, and to analyse the social, political and environmental aspects of waste management in urban areas.

AB  - It remains unknown whether exposure to ambient air pollution can be a mediator linking socioeconomic indicator to health outcome. The present study aims to examine the mediation effect of PM2.5 air pollution on the association between urban-rural division and the incidence (mortality) rate of male lung cancer. We performed a nationwide analysis in 353 counties (districts) of China between 2006 and 2015. A structural equation model was developed to determine the mediation effect of exposure to PM2.5. We also tested whether the findings of the mediation effect of exposure to PM2.5 are sensitive to the controls of smoking factors and additional air pollutant, and PM2.5 exposures with different lag structures. According to the results, we found that exposure to PM2.5 significantly mediated the association between urban-rural division and the incidence rate of male lung cancer. Specifically, there were significant associations between urban-rural division, exposure to PM2.5, and the incidence rate of male lung cancer, with PM2.5 exposure accounting for 29.80% of total urban-rural difference in incidence rates of male lung cancer. A similar pattern of results was observed for the mortality rate of male lung cancer. That is, there was a significant mediation effect by PM2.5 on the association of the mortality rate with urban-rural division. The findings of exposure to PM2.5 as a mediator were robust in the three sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, urban-rural difference in exposures to PM2.5 may be a potential factor that contributes to urban-rural disparity in male lung cancer diseases in China. The findings inform that air pollution management and control may be effective measures to alleviate the great difference in male lung cancer diseases between urban and rural areas in China.

AB  - Many countries are facing an aging population crisis, triggering major concerns over how to best provide services for older people. Parks are an important public service resource for older people living in urban areas. Due to the uneven geographic distribution of parks within a city, elderly people may have unequal access to this resource, based on their socioeconomic status. This park access issue has been under-examined among older populations, who may be more vulnerable and have limited physical mobility. The two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method has been increasingly used to measure access to parks; however, a "catchment area," defined as the traveling distance to a resource, may be biased against older subjects, due to the lack of behavior-based information within traditional census data. To bridge this methodological gap within the literature, this study sought to estimate park access for the elderly, using the 2SFCA method and new data sources (mobile phone data), in order to determine if older people experience inequitable park access owing to their socioeconomic status. Based on a spatial and multivariate analysis of data collected in Beijing, we find that housing price, the distance to commercial areas and greenspaces are significant influencing factors of the park accessibility; elderly people living in newly built areas, the lower the housing price, the lower accessibility to parks. These findings may assist municipal policy makers in the planning and management of park access for aging citizens.

AB  - In the context of the mandated phaseout of methyl bromide, California's strawberry industry has increased its use of chloropicrin, another soil fumigant that has long been on the market. However, due to its 2010 designation as a toxic air contaminant, the US Environmental Protection Agency and California's Department of Pesticide Regulation have developed enhanced application protocols to mitigate exposures of the chemical to bystanders, nearby residents, and farmworkers. The central feature of these mitigation technologies are enhanced buffer zones between treated fields and nearby buildings. Not only do buffer zones inherently privilege neighbors over farmworkers, but the determinations of the size of these buffer zones are also based on acceptable threshold levels and probabilities that allow significant exposures to those they are designed to protect. Moreover, these protocols require human monitors to detect sensory irritation. While the science and technology studies literature is highly useful for understanding the inextricability of science and politics in developing protective measures and is attentive to what counts as data in setting acceptable thresholds, it tends to overlook that social sorting is intrinsic to such regulation. We thus turn to Foucault's biopolitics to make sense of regulations that are designed to protect but inherently allow some to become ill. Doing so illuminates how determinations of the bright line are at once technical-political as well as implicit decisions about whose bodies count.

AB  - Philosophers often understand environmental sustainability as a duty of distributive justice between the generations of the earth. Since every generation is equally entitled to the bounty of the natural environment (the thinking goes) every generation should have a fair share of that bounty. But since generations precede each other in time, it is the duty of earlier generations to ensure that later generations receive their fair share. Acting sustainably is the way of meeting this duty, since sustainable practices are those that (ideally) preserve the environment for the future. But what is a 'fair' share of something as complex, varied and dynamic as 'the environment'? How are we to value nature for the purposes of measuring 'shares' of it? I think the answer to these questions lies in the difference between sharing something by parts, like a pie, and sharing something by turns, like a bicycle. The generations share the earth by turns, not by parts, and so questions about fairness of shares are questions about turns, not parts. We need to ask what constitutes a 'fair turn' with the earth, and for that question we don't necessarily need to be able to commensurate the various parts of nature, just as we don't need to know the relative value of the parts of a bicycle to say what constitutes a fair turn with it.

AB  - In response to the Walloon Environment and Health Program, the Scientific Institute of Public Services (ISSeP) developed an integrated approach of environmental exposure assessment in the Walloon region, Belgium. The study presents an index-based approach to estimate the multiple environmental burdens at regional level and detailed local resolution. Indicators are based on environmental measurements of pollutants in ambient air and soil, and on stressors for citizens related to noise and radon. These indicators were mapped as proportions to obtain an accurate comparison between spatial units. In order to indicate the need for intervention, environmental indicators are calculated as the proportion of areas where the level of detrimental environmental factors exceeds threshold values from WHO guidelines and Walloon legal threshold values. In parallel, a spatial web tool based on GIS was developed to enable a flexible and weighted combination of the normalized indicators by computing the resulting composite index online. This interactive web tool designed for policy makers and experts eases the spatial analysis of results in order to identify geographic areas where hotspot exposures are a potential risk to human health. The next steps of this work aim to integrate more environmental indicators (stressors and benefits) and some sociodemographic and health indicators in order to detect vulnerable populations. A holistic assessment is essential to inform environmental justice debates and to ensure a health conducive equal environment. Finally, this environmental health tool will support decision makers focus resources and programs to improve the environmental health of Walloons living in areas disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution.

AB  - In this chapter, I will explain two contrasting theories of animal property rights (Hadley 2015). Whereas each of the two theories is consistent with the idea of giving wild animals property rights in their habitats, only the first theory - what I will refer to as the 'justice theory' - is consistent with the idea that habitat rights are owed to animals as a matter of basic justice. What do I mean by justice? When rights are held as a matter of basic justice, it means that certain persons must act in prescribed ways and states must pass laws designed to ensure that the intended recipients enjoy the relevant rights. The ethical presupposition behind the concept of justice is that people are obliged to act (or not act) irrespective of whether acting (or not acting) in such a way suits them. In other words, justice is a normative or aspirational concept: it speaks to what people should do and how states should be governed. 1 As far as animal property rights are concerned, the kernel of the justice theory is that people have an obligation to refrain from violating the habitat rights of wild animals. Below, I will say more about how such an obligation might translate in the real world, but suffice to say now it means that human landholders must act in good faith and take into account the interests of animals during land-management decision making.

AB  - In the greater metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, close to 20 million people share water resources across multiple uses, from industry to recreation to basic household use. These resources have come under increasing strain due to urban expansion, poor planning, and, more recently, climate change. Conflicts among uses and their underlying principles are increasingly adjudicated in courts, with the Ministerio Publico (Public Prosecutor's Office) acting as a key advocate for both human rights and environmental protection. As legal interventions become more common in policy questions, how are justice principles shaping emerging approaches to water governance? And how are these types of cases provoking a reconsideration of the role of law in public administration? This paper analyzes the justice ramifications of an increasing use of legal discourses and practices to adjudicate water-related conflicts in Sao Paulo. It also, and conversely, shows how legal battles over water and sanitation force a shift in the behavior and perspectives of legal actors, and subsequently broaden the meaning of 'justice.'

AB  - Maryland's growing chicken industry, including concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and meat processing plants, raises a number of concerns regarding public health and environmental justice. Using hot spot analysis, we analyzed the totality of Maryland's CAFOs and meat processing plants and those restricted to the Eastern Shore to assess whether communities of color and/or low socioeconomic status communities disproportionately hosted these types of facilities at the census tract level. We used zero-inflated regression modeling to determine the strength of the associations between environmental justice variables and the location of CAFOs and meatpacking facilities at the State level and on the Eastern Shore. Hot spot analyses demonstrated that CAFO hot spots on the Eastern Shore were located in counties with some of the lowest wealth in the State, including the lowest ranking county-Somerset. Zero-inflated regression models demonstrated that increases in median household income across the state were associated with a 0.04-unit reduction in CAFOs. For every unit increase in the percentage of people of color (POC), there was a 0.02-unit increase in meat processing facilities across the state. The distribution of CAFOs and meat processing plants across Maryland may contribute to poor health outcomes in areas affected by such production, and contribute to health disparities and health inequity.

AB  - Levels of ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), are often higher in low-socioeconomic status (SES) communities than in high-SES communities. Houston is the fourth largest city in the USA and is home to a large petrochemical industry, an active port, and congested roadways, which represent significant emission sources of air pollution in the region. To compare levels of air pollution between a low-SES and a high-SES community, we simultaneously collected a 7-day integrated size-fractionated PM between June 2013 and November 2013. We analyzed PM mass and elements for three particle size modes: quasi-ultrafine particles (quasi-UFP) (aerodynamic diameter <0.25 mu m), accumulation mode particles (0.25-2.5 mu m), and coarse mode particles (>2.5 mu m). Concentrations of vanadium, nickel, manganese, and iron in the quasi-UFP mode were significantly higher in the low-SES community than in the high-SES community. In the accumulation and coarse modes, concentrations of crustal elements and barium were also significantly higher in the low-SES community compared to the high-SES community. These findings suggest that people living in the low-SES community may experience higher exposures to some toxic elements as compared to people in the high-SES community.

AB  - Many analyses have demonstrated that environmental hazards tend to be concentrated in areas with higher numbers of low-income populations and people of color. We used geographic information science (GISc) and statistical analyses to examine issues of air quality and asthma occurrence among urban children in Louisville, Kentucky. The results of our analyses indicate that there is a well-defined spatial cluster of high rates of childhood asthma hospitalizations in western Louisville, an area of the city that is notorious for its poor air quality and the poor economic and physical health of its residents. Analyses also confirmed a strong seasonal pattern to asthma, with a fall peak. The multi-factorial etiology of asthma makes it difficult to pinpoint specific triggers for acute asthma episodes. Analyses of EPA criteria pollutants and volatile organic compounds from local air monitoring sites showed very little correlation with hospital admissions, although acetone, acrylonitrile and chloroform manifested similar seasonal patterns. In order to address the environmental justice concerns of disproportionate siting vs. minority move-in, we used GISc to examine patterns of residential mobility in western Louisville over a 60-year period. The polluting industries in western Louisville's "Rubbertown" preceded the local in-migration of African-Americans, the majority of which took place from 1960 to 1970. While the increasing African-American presence in the community has resulted in a community with greater social cohesion over time and successful community-based initiatives to reduce air toxics emissions have been implemented, significant health disparities in western Louisville must continue to be addressed.

AB  - ObjectiveRecently, much research in the physical sciences has been dedicated to identifying a nexus or connection between water, energy, and food. This research agenda, however, has not been sufficiently examined in the social sciences. This article examines the extent to which individuals demonstrate awareness of the three nexus elements: water-energy, energy-food, and food-water. MethodsWe use three awareness indexes as dependent variables and varying sociodemographic characteristics and aspects of environmental concern as predictors in the statistical analysis. ResultsOur results suggest that there are some patterned or systematic correlates with the nexus elements, although relationships do not always turn out as anticipated. Indeed, explanations of nexus awareness do not follow previously studies' explanations of environmental concern, and vary depending on which elements of the nexus are analyzed. ConclusionWe conclude with suggestions to raise awareness of the connections between natural resources among all populations. Such awareness will promote sustainable societies and reduce environmental inequality and issues of environmental justice

AB  - Narratives of resilience to sea-level rise too often perpetuate social violence. An abolitionist climate justice praxis necessitates seeing beyond physical inundation to sea-level rise as the sole issue. We argue that sea-level rise is environmental racism, if not always in its racialized outcomes of disproportionate harms, then always in its racialized production of differential value. More than mitigating flood risk when developing Black land futures strategies, to mitigate coastal land loss in the face of rising seas necessitates dismantling "racial regimes of ownership" that are imbued in property relations. Recognizing such, we argue that land futures strategies in the face of rising seas must account for multiple capitalist modes of accumulation but specifically the primitive accumulation process connected to heirs' property. Here, we argue that racial coastal formations are still underway in how sea-level rise and gentrification are leading to a double dispossession of land and displacing Gullah/Geechee people on Sapelo Island. Although such displacement precipitates loss through harm and violence, in this article we share strategies from abolition ecology praxis to "blockade" these double dispossession processes and, to a degree, even the narrative of loss. To situate the double dispossession narrative within a broader praxis that imagines alternative futures, we till the soil, trace the archives, and tread the marsh and drainage ditches with each other, and in solidarity with other residents, to work toward achieving agricultural revival, property retention, and flood risk mitigation.

AB  - Participatory visual research, or "visual interventions" (Pink 2007), allow environmental anthropologists to respond to three different "crises of representation": (1) the critique of ethnographic representation presented by postmodern, postcolonial, and feminist anthropologists; (2) the constructivist critique of nature and the environment; and (3) the "environmental justice" critique demanding representation for the environmental concerns of communities of color. Participatory visual research integrates community members in the process of staking out a research agenda, conducting fieldwork and interpreting data, and communicating and applying research findings. Our project used the Photovoice methodology to generate knowledge and documentation related to environment injustices faced by Roma in Hungary. I discuss the promise and limitations of "visual interventions" as a pathway leading applied environmental anthropologists beyond the three "crises in representation."

AB  - Neighborhood stigma, founded on the idea that individuals avoid and denigrate spaces occupied by residents of color due to perceptions of crime and disorder, can influence travel patterns, impact housing markets, and exacerbate social and environmental justice issues. As a proliferation of urban greenways connecting once stratified communities, such stigma may also influence recreation behaviors. Using a series of observations and interviews with users and local residents, this study examined the impact of neighborhood stigma on recreational use of Chicago's 606 Trail and surrounding communities. Results revealed why stigma occurs, how it manifests, and how different groups (e.g., White vs. Latinx residents) respond. Specifically, neighborhood stigma led White users to avoid trail segments, fueled discrimination, and catalyzed redevelop efforts in neighborhoods in the stigmatized area. This study illuminates concerns about the social impacts of urban park projects and provides insight for city officials looking to integrate greenways into diverse communities.

AB  - Our study elucidated knowledge and perceptions of natural resources and climate change by African Americans/Blacks in Washington, DC since they are a traditionally marginalized population and to see if we could dispel the perception that they have low knowledge and interest in environmental issues. Secondarily, we wanted to determine if knowledge and perceptions vary across age groups. We conducted a survey of 491 Blacks in the District and asked 26 questions/statements related to natural resources, climate change, economics, and health. Participants were categorized into four age groups 18-25, 26-40, 41-65, and 66 and older for analysis. We found that the level of environmental knowledge across the age groups was relatively high and largely similar. Our results suggest that Blacks care about the environment, see the environment as beneficial to their health, and are knowledgeable about natural resources. However, younger Blacks (18-25) were the least likely to think of the natural world as a community to which they belong, report feelings of connection to it, and recognize that it impacts their personal welfare. In conclusion, we find that Blacks in the District possess environmental awareness and use local environmental language, depicting the uniqueness of their community. The mainstream environmental movement may fail to recognize this local language, leading to exclusion of vulnerable populations based on a faulty premise that these populations lack knowledge or interest in environmental issues.

AB  - Numerous scholars have used political philosophy to characterise the US environmental justice (EJ) movement's conception of justice. I build upon that work by identifying and critically evaluating the ideas of justice that manifest in mainstream (non-EJ) environmental politics. I do so through a comparative analysis of two groups of activists concerned with the threats posed by pesticides to human health in California. Mainstream agri-environmental activists' narratives and practices evince libertarian and communitarian ideas of justice that support the neoliberalisation of an already compromised regulatory system, as they motivate and legitimise policies, practices, and discourses that undermine the state's environmental protections and shift environmental responsibility to individuals. In contrast, California's EJ activists, like the broader EJ movement, marshal a pluralist notion of justice as distribution, recognition, participation, and capabilities, which rejects the neoliberal project and explicitly criticises the social inequalities and relations of oppression that help produce environmental inequalities.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is a major emergent stressor of marine ecosystems with global implications for bio-diversity conservation, sustainable development and economic prosperity. International action is imperative for addressing it. This paper builds a science-based governing framework, identifying three overarching policy objectives and six areas for action that should be pursued so as to minimise this global problem. No unifying OA treaty or legal instrument with the explicit task of addressing OA currently exists and it looks highly unlikely that any will eventuate. A more pragmatic approach is to use existing multilateral agreements. However, taking on OA as a unified problem seems to be beyond the scope of existing agreements, due to structural limitations and the willingness of Parties. Given this, it is more likely that OA will be addressed by a network of agreements, each responding to discrete elements of the problem of OA within their capabilities. However, it is unclear how existing MEA capabilities extend to addressing OA. This paper therefore offers an analytical framework through existing governance structures can be explored for their capabilities to respond to OA.

AB  - In accordance with environmental injustice, sometimes called environmental racism, minority communities are disproportionately subjected to a higher level of environmental risk than other segments of society. Growing concern over unequal environmental risk and mounting evidence of both racial and economic injustices have led to a grass-roots civil rights campaign called the environmental justice movement. The environmental ethics aspects of environmental injustice challenge narrow utilitarian views and promote Kantian rights and obligations. Nevertheless, an environmental justice value exists in all ethical world views, although it involves a concept of equitable distribution of environmental protection that has been lacking in environmental ethics discussion.

AB  - Indigenous peoples around the world tend to be disproportionately affected by resource extraction activities having access to fewer technical, legal and other resources to participate effectively in the decision-making process. Taking a resistance movement concerning the Phulbari Coal Project in Bangladesh, through qualitative research, this paper examines how Indigenous peoples frame their claims in a mining conflict situation. The Phulbari resistance movement took place more than a decade ago in Bangladesh, however, local Indigenous peoples, Bangalee farming communities, and activists still bear the spirit of the movement. As such, this study seeks to test the claims of how the Indigenous and farming communities, and the actions of national and transnational environmental justice organisations in the Phulbari resistance movement form part of an environmental justice movement. The paper argues that various components of Indigenous resistance and claims may contribute to the overall goals of the environment justice movement against powerful transnational corporations in the global South.

AB  - In this paper I critically engage with the concept of geographical equity in order to reexamine notions of sustainable development and environmental justice. Although asserting a need to examine geographical equity considerations in greater detail in respect of the current environmental debate, it is argued that these always need to be examined in parallel with other dimensions of equity which underpin both sustainable development and environmental justice. Using the case of water management in southern California during the 20th century, I examine examples of intraregional and interregional cost transference which arise from water exports to meet urban development demands. Although clear evidence of cost transference exists, the most appropriate practical means for reducing or compensating these remains unclear.

AB  - Light exposure at night impedes sleep and shifts the circadian clock. An extensive body of literature has linked sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment with cardiac disease, cancer, mental health disorders, and other chronic illnesses, as well as more immediate risks, such as motor vehicle crashes and occupational injuries. In this issue of the Journal, Zhong et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2022;XXX(XX):XXX-XXX) build on this literature, finding that in a cohort of 50,000 California teachers, artificial light at night, noise, green space, and air pollution were all associated with sleep disturbances. Light, noise, air pollution, and the lack of green space are problems inequitably distributed across the population, concentrated among vulnerable populations in inner cities. Zhong et al. provide novel data on the manner in which these local environmental exposures drive sleep deprivation. Future research should explore the degree to which place-based disparities in sleep in turn drive disparities in short and long-term health. Addressing home-based sleep disparities could be an avenue to addressing systemic racism and achieving environmental justice.

AB  - Objectives To explore social inequalities in residential exposure to road traffic noise in an urban area. Methods Environmental injustice in road traffic noise exposure was investigated in Paris, France, using the RECORD Cohort Study (n=2130) and modelled noise data. Associations were assessed by estimating noise exposure within the local area around participants' residence, considering various socioeconomic variables defined at both individual and neighbourhood level, and comparing different regression models attempting or not to control for spatial autocorrelation in noise levels. Results After individual-level adjustment, participants' noise exposure increased with neighbourhood educational level and dwelling value but also with proportion of non-French citizens, suggesting seemingly contradictory findings. However, when country of citizenship was defined according to its human development level, noise exposure in fact increased and decreased with the proportions of citizens from advantaged and disadvantaged countries, respectively. These findings were consistent with those reported for the other socioeconomic characteristics, suggesting higher road traffic noise exposure in advantaged neighbourhoods. Substantial collinearity between neighbourhood explanatory variables and spatial random effects caused identifiability problems that prevented successful control for spatial autocorrelation. Conclusions Contrary to previous literature, this study shows that people living in advantaged neighbourhoods were more exposed to road traffic noise in their residential environment than their deprived counterparts. This case study demonstrates the need to systematically perform sensitivity analyses with multiple socioeconomic characteristics to avoid incorrect inferences about an environmental injustice situation and the complexity of effectively controlling for spatial autocorrelation when fixed and random components of the model are correlated.

AB  - People living in poor areas suffer higher mortality than those in wealthy areas. Environmental factors partly explain this association, including exposure to pollutants and accessibility of healthcare. We sought to determine whether proximity to alcohol outlets varied by area deprivation in New Zealand. Roadway travel distance from each census unit to the nearest alcohol outlet was summarised according to socioeconomic deprivation for each area. Analyses were conducted by license type (pubs/bars, clubs, restaurants, off-licenses) and community urban-rural status. Strong associations were found between proximity to the nearest alcohol outlet and deprivation, there being greater access to outlets in more-deprived urban areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) presents a number of complex equity concerns when implemented in the context of communal resource management. This analysis contributes to our understanding of intracommunity equity and the role of communal governance in determining distributional equity outcomes, specifically in collective PES arrangements. The study examines the relationship between local governance and the distribution of collective payments in an Ecuadorian payment for conservation program implemented in communities in the Andean highlands. We use data from approximately 200 households living in six participating communities to examine how communities distribute collective payments across community members, and identify the household and communal attributes that influence (i) the likelihood that a household will receive a benefit, (ii) perceive the distribution of benefits to be fair, and (iii) perceive that the PES program itself is fair. The results highlight the important role of communal governance mechanisms in promoting participatory and transparent decision processes, and the resultant distribution of benefits. Households in more organized communities are more likely to receive a benefit and are more likely to perceive that the distribution is fair. In contrast, those in less organized communities are less likely to have budgetary information or agree with how the collective payment is spent. The results also indicate that communities generally distribute the benefits based on egalitarian principles and point to a potential disjuncture between communal equity principles and the individual costs incurred under the PES program land-use restrictions. Findings suggest that PES practitioners and researchers pay greater attention to, and support, the governance capacities of communities prior to implementing a PES program. The findings also call attention to the potential conflict between PES distributional principles and communal distributional norms.

AB  - Planned estates may be a solution to housing demand and affordability in high growth regions. As a result, planned estate research has tended to focus on privatisation, social engineering of communities by developers, and social polarisation. Heatwave research has focused on measuring and mitigating the impact of such events on disadvantaged communities. However, these two research streams have not been combined to examine how planned estate residents may be vulnerable to heatwaves. We address that gap by considering past, current, and future heatwave impacts; identifying underlying processes governing the vulnerability of planned estates to heatwaves; and reflecting on the implications for the sustainability of planned estates in relation to future heatwave risk. We adopt a mixed-methods approach using the case of the Jordan Springs estate in Western Sydney, Australia, and that work is underpinned by systems approaches embedded in sustainability science. We find that Jordan Springs is physically vulnerable to heatwaves due to characteristics in its built environment. Human vulnerability is complex: rooted in multiscalar socio-economic and systemic processes both internal and external to the estate. We suggest resilience be increased to improve estate liveability and sustainability by retrofitting the built environment, improving urban greening, broadening consumer awareness, and modifying development processes.

AB  - In this article, it is argued that community opposition and the divisive 'dobs and sobs' debate associated with managed retreat proposals ('defend our bachs' or 'save our beaches'), cannot be simply dismissed as ill informed nimbyism. With reference to the case study of Waihi, the author argues that community resistance to managed retreat is an indicator of the complexity of the political challenges that underpin climate change problems. Adapting to climate change will require more than prescriptive policy solutions. Decision makers also need to rethink democratic processes if they wish to foster deeper community resilience to climate change. This includes revisiting concepts of scale in decision making (both spatial and temporal), procedural justice, and linkage (between local, regional, national and international governments, citizens, non-governmental organisations and the private sector).

AB  - New study investigates heat-induced labor loss in 231 Chinese cities, finding that lower-paid sectors could be disproportionately affected in coming decades, although adaptation measures may mitigate inequality related impacts. Heat-induced labor loss is a major economic cost related to climate change. Here, we use hourly heat stress data modeled with a regional climate model to investigate the heat-induced labor loss in 231 Chinese cities. Results indicate that future urban heat stress is projected to cause an increase in labor losses exceeding 0.20% of the total account gross domestic product (GDP) per year by the 2050s relative to the 2010s. In this process, certain lower-paid sectors could be disproportionately impacted. The implementation of various urban adaptation strategies could offset 10% of the additional economic loss per year and help reduce the inequality-related impact on lower-paid sectors. So future urban warming can not only damage cities as a whole but can also contribute to income inequality. The implication of adaptation strategies should be considered in regard to not only cooling requirements but also environmental justice.

AB  - It is of global interest to understand under what conditions community forestry can be successful and sustainable in terms of environmental conservation and local livelihood benefits. Existing theories have explained several influential factors, including small groups of people with shared norms, sound institu-tions, high levels of decentralization, downward accountability, and security of tenure. This paper explores how local conceptions of environmental justice become closely linked to sustainable community forestry. Based on an in-depth case study in a highly populated and culturally heterogeneous village in southwest China, we examine an enduring example of community forestry, using a combination of qual-itative and quantitative approaches. The results show that village forest cover has increased significantly over the last 30 years, contributing to improvements in local livelihoods. It is argued that one of the important factors in this success has been villagers' ability to align forest management with local justice norms and practices. Distributive, procedural, and recognition aspects of justice are considered, and we find that, in combination, these become integral to building effective institutions for collective action. To broaden the focus on successful factors in existing theories, this paper argues that the consideration of justice as an important condition for establishing effective and durable local institutions that will be effective for community forestry.

AB  - In China, environmental pollution generated via industrialization as well as profound changes in the social structure and the gradual maturation of the social hierarchy have jointly contributed to the Chinese people's increased environmental consciousness and appeals for environmental justice (EJ). Because of the absence of an EJ theory and a lack of empirical research focused on China, this paper proposes a Pyramid Model for EJ research in China that includes the following three factors: basic demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, U.S.-based EJ principles, and Chinese characteristics. A nationwide pilot analysis of environmental inequality at the prefecture level is conducted by empirically examining the association between the demographic variables and socioeconomic status with sources of industrial pollution in China. The prefecture-based results are shown to be robust, and they indicate that areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and western regions of China carry disproportionate environmental burdens. However, a different picture for migrants is presented, revealing that Chinese migrants are not currently exposed to greater levels of industrial pollution. Relevant interpretations of these findings are provided. The results also show that environmental inequality associated with income level, which is observed in the U.S., does not occur in China.

AB  - In the study described in this article, the authors' objective was to use community-owned and -managed research (COMR) to assess the safety and adequacy of water and sewer services in three low-income African-American communities in Mebane, North Carolina. Community monitor (CM) training workshops, household surveys, and drinking water and surface water tests of fecal pollution were completed at private (target) and regulated public (referent) service households. CMs collected survey data showing a mixture of failing private wells and septic systems and regulated public drinking water and sewer infrastructure. Drinking water and surface water fecal pollution levels exceeded limits protecting health at target and referent households. COMR methods built community capacity to investigate private and regulated public drinking water and sewer service failures. Drinking and surface water fecal contamination levels suggest a need for provision of improved water and sewer services to protect health in these underserved and marginalized communities.

AB  - Like many environmental controversies today, the debate over the proposed Pebble Mine in a salmon-producing region of Alaska centres on the development and contestation of scientific projections of risk. This paper traces the participatory public process surrounding a risk assessment of potential mining impacts to examine how forums that join expert and lay knowledge shape scenarios of future imperilment and influence environmental politics in the present. It draws on ethnographic research to analyse how risk assessments demand the delineation of spatial, social, and temporal boundaries that provoke tensions, or overflows', which reveal the constraints of existing frameworks. In the Pebble debate, the public process generated overflows that expose conflicting claims to knowledge and authority, reflecting the risk assessment's overarching, if often frustrated, effort to separate scientific and technical truths from political contestations. The paper shows how these overflows spurred generative effects, new visions that remake spatial, social, and temporal relations in the face of imperilment. It argues that despite the limitations of common consultative processes and discourses of risk, the negotiation of multiple forms of knowledge and authority in the public view can nevertheless open new spaces and social formations for the exercise of politics.

AB  - Peer-to-peer approaches refer to a participatory style of teaching and learning, which increasingly gain popularity as inclusive and participatory interventions to encourage changes towards more sustainable energy practices. However, this prominence has not been matched by evidence on the effectiveness of such approaches. By investigating the design and implementation of the peer-to-peer project useITsmartly, which centred on the topic of energy efficient and sustainable ICT use, this paper focuses on the effectiveness of this peer-to-peer approach as inclusive participatory intervention. Drawing on the environmental justice literature, it addresses particularly the second-level effectiveness, that is the impact peer-to-peer exercises have on the peer educators themselves in terms of capacity building and empowerment. The paper evaluates the preparation, recruitment, training and multiplication phases of the approach and concludes that it is essential to invest enough time and resources to truly recognize the peer educators and their lifestyles and practices, and enable them to participate in the peer education on their own terms. If not, lack of motivation and skills of the peer educators as well as too much focus on quantitative targets may compromise the actual purpose of the peer-to-peer approach and turn it into a top-down exercise.

AB  - Much of the literature on environmental inequities focuses on establishing a correlation between poor or minority communities and environmental hazards. However, these studies do not provide much information on the causes of that correlation. This paper proposes a conceptual model of the siting of a hazardous facility, incorporating three key groups of agents: those associated with the facility, community decision-makers, and affected community residents. These agents' interactions determine a cost (or subsidy) for siting a facility. Hypotheses for causes of the correlation include income effects, information effects, political influence, and discrimination. This model suggests data needs and empirical approaches to testing these alternative hypotheses, and it discusses how identifying these underlying causes can influence the choice of policy remedy for environmental inequities.

AB  - Leisure justice is an approach to how the right to leisure can be facilitated through a social and environmental justice lens. Leisure justice research is described along with the challenges that it manifests. Questions are raised about what becomes of leisure research if justice is discounted as well as what research will embody if justice is an imperative. Further suggestions about what leisure justice research entails and the ongoing issues are proffered as well as how and why all research about leisure can have implications for justice. The challenge before leisure scholars is to use justice research for addressing emerging questions about leisure leading to social change. Leisure justice research is a basis for social action.

AB  - On-road emissions sources degrade air quality, and these sources have been highly regulated. Epidemiological and environmental justice studies often use road proximity as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure, and other studies employ air quality models or satellite observations. To assess these metrics' abilities to reproduce observed near-road concentration gradients and changes over time, we apply a hierarchical linear regression to ground-based observations, long-term air quality model simulations using Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), and satellite products. Across 1980-2019, observed TRAP concentrations decreased, and road proximity was positively correlated with TRAP. For all pollutants, concentrations decreased fastest at locations with higher road proximity, resulting in "flatter" concentration fields in recent years. This flattening unfolded at a relatively constant rate for NOx, whereas the flattening of CO concentration fields has slowed. CMAQ largely captures observed spatial-temporal NO2 trends across 2002-2010 but overstates the relationships between CO and elemental carbon fine particulate matter (EC) road proximity. Satellite NOx measures overstate concentration reductions near roads. We show how this perspective provides evidence that California's on-road vehicle regulations led to substantial decreases in NO2, NOx and EC in California, with other states that adopted California's light-duty automobile standards showing mixed benefits over states that did not adopt these standards.

AB  - One of the global dilemmas of our time is the urgent need to reduce energy demand in some parts of the world and at the same time manage to increase and improve energy services in others. This paper calls attention to the importance of also recognizing local energy dilemmas and pockets of more vulnerable groups in energy efficiency and building renovation projects. Interviews with tenants in a Swedish 'million-program' housing area are used to illustrate the arguments in the paper. Results show essential variations in male and female thermal sensation. They also show little compatibility between the tenants' wishes for a comfortable home and the housing company's energy saving ambitions. The paper argues that the use of generalized indoor climate agreements needs to be taken less for granted and complemented with qualitative investigations of all main actors in a specific local context. Only then can possible disparities become evident, and alternative, more just, solutions be worked out.

AB  - Livability, resilience, and justice in cities are challenged by climate change and the historical legacies that together create disproportionate impacts on human communities. Urban green infrastructure has emerged as an important tool for climate change adaptation and resilience given their capacity to provide ecosystem services such as local temperature regulation, stormwater mitigation, and air purification. However, realizing the benefits of ecosystem services for climate adaptation depend on where they are locally supplied. Few studies have examined the potential spatial mismatches in supply and demand of urban ecosystem services, and even fewer have examined supply-demand mismatches as a potential environmental justice issue, such as when supply-demand mismatches disproportionately overlap with certain socio-demographic groups. We spatially analyzed demand for ecosystem services relevant for climate change adaptation and combined results with recent analysis of the supply of ecosystem services in New York City (NYC). By quantifying the relative mismatch between supply and demand of ecosystem services across the city we were able to identify spatial hot- and coldspots of supply-demand mismatch. Hotspots are spatial clusters of census blocks with a higher mismatch and coldspots are clusters with lower mismatch values than their surrounding blocks. The distribution of mismatch hot- and coldspots was then compared to the spatial distribution of socio-demographic groups. Results reveal distributional environmental injustice of access to the climate-regulating benefits of ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in NYC. Analyses show that areas with lower supply-demand mismatch tend to be populated by a larger proportion of white residents with higher median incomes, and areas with high mismatch values have lower incomes and a higher proportion of people of color. We suggest that urban policy and planning should ensure that investments in "nature-based" solutions such as through urban green infrastructure for climate change adaptation do not reinforce or exacerbate potentially existing environmental injustices.

AB  - In this paper, we bring together the literature on citizen science and on deliberative democracy and epistemic injustice. We argue that citizen science can be seen as one element of "deliberative systems," as described by Mansbridge et al. But in order to fulfil its democratic potential, citizen science needs to be attentive to various forms of exclusion and epistemic injustice, as analyzed by Fricker, Medina and others. Moreover, to tap the potentials of citizen science from the perspective of deliberative democracy, it needs to move towards a more empowered approach, in which citizens do not only deliver data points, but also, in invited or uninvited settings, participate in discussions about the goals and implications of research. Integrating citizen science into the deliberative systems approach embeds it in a broader framework of democratic theory and suggests the transmission of certain practical strategies (e.g., randomized sampling). It can also contribute to realism about both the potentials and the limits of citizen science. As part of a deliberative system, citizen science cannot, and need not, be the only place in which reforms are necessary for creating stronger ties between science and society and for aligning science with democratic values.

AB  - Little attention is paid to the ways that labor market inequalities within urban institutions enforce governance regimes that (re)produce urban environmental unevenness. Milwaukee's Bureau of Forestry is one such institution that has historically been dependent on state-sanctioned labor market inequalities to perpetuate an explicitly White/male regime of environmental governance and production. Historically, the Bureau's management employed and promoted very few African Americans and women within its arboricultural workforce, based on its racist and gendered categories of laboring individuals. Furthermore, and for identical reasons, these workers-and by extension their communities-face distributional injustices as they are not allowed to channel their labors into the production of equitable and/or alternative forms of urban forests more suitable to their own social reproduction. This paper investigates the changing relations between Milwaukee's Bureau of Forestry and its African American and female employees as they attempt to legally (re)articulate their laboring identities and capabilities within a disempowering institution. We use in-depth interviews and archival materials to show that the Bureau of Forestry has consequently been forced to publicly confront its racist/ patriarchal legacy in light of two recent high-profile lawsuits and an ambassadors program. We conclude by discussing how changes that allow some African Americans and women to work in Milwaukee's urban forest have affected the Bureau of Forestry and potentially the forest itself.

AB  - It is rare for discussions of climate justice to explore the challenges that a growing world population might present for mitigation and adaptation. Given the emotive nature of the issue, care must be taken that population growth is introduced in an appropriate way. Population growth is undeniably a factor in human impact on environmental systems, but this does not necessarily entail that it must be reduced if manipulating other variables can reduce overall impact. In the context of climate change, a discussion of responsibility for population increase requires engaging in the question of legitimate state policies to incentivise smaller families and to reduce fertility rates by measures such as promoting social justice, especially gender justice. It must also, however, address the other factors that contribute to human impact on global environmental systems. Examples of such factors include affluence and technology. This article argues that it cannot be permissible for a state to implement policies that make parents bear the full costs of their procreative decisions. Instead it suggests that there is a collective duty of a society to make investments and social changes to accommodate any population growth that might come about after permissible measures to reduce fertility rates are implemented.

AB  - New York City Transit (NYCT) and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have integrated race and income equity considerations into their extensive public outreach processes for fare changes. Responding to FTA civil rights, Title VI, and environmental justice requirements, NYCT developed two quantitative and analytical approaches for forecasting equity impacts of fare restructuring decisions, in place of more traditional origin-destination surveys. The first approach uses standard aggregate fare elasticity models to estimate diversions between different fare classes and ridership losses resulting from fare adjustments. Average farechanges by fare media type are disaggregated with historical farecard usage patterns (consumption data) by subway station and bus route and translated into demographic variables (minority or non-minority and at, below, or above poverty) on the basis of census data. Overall average fare changes are used to analyze equity impacts. A second, more experimental approach identifies user demographics by daily first swipe locations and estimates daily average fares as actually experienced by each passenger by using sequential transactions on discrete farecards. To meet ongoing requirements, methods were developed to analyze impacts separately for peak and off-peak time periods and to demonstrate equity by using statistical tests. Impact analyses results and historical ridership, revenue, and market share data collected by the Metro Card automated fare collection system all inform fare structure design processes, with particular attention devoted to distributing fare increase burdens equitably.

AB  - Point source pollution from industrial activity is a significant environmental problem that unequally impacts people. In addition to disparate impacts on people, the environment is also unequally impacted. Environmental justice is one body of scholarship that studies this problem but almost exclusively from the social side. The question we are striving to answer is how the use of watershed boundaries in place of traditional political boundaries affects environmental justice analyses. Do the same patterns of racial and class inequality hold true when the biophysical boundaries are used? In addition, this analysis looks closely at one watershed to understand where point source pollution output occurs relative to racial and class distribution. The hypothesis is that watersheds of higher minority population and higher poverty will face greater environmental burden in the form of impacted waterways and that these impacted environs will face high concentrations of continuing pollution production. We found that traditional environmental justice patterns hold true with stability for racial inequality. The results suggest that analysis of biophysical conditions and population distribution together is a valuable way to assess environmental impacts while taking into account social and biological forces.

AB  - In the contemporary environmental management landscape, legislation is a principal means through which sustainable outcomes are negotiated. Yet the relations between legislation (as a social practice), nature and justice have been subjected to limited scrutiny. This paper explores these relations through consideration of a system of biodiversity offsets currently being implemented in New South Wales, Australia, following the enactment of the Threatened Species Conservation Amendment (Biodiversity Banking) Act 2006 (NSW). In this paper we investigate the work this legislation does in enacting the materiality of nature in order to explore the interrelations of materiality, law and concerns for environmental and ecological justice. We argue that the act of 'legislating nature' is simultaneously a 'mode of matter-ing' (Law 2004) that in the case of biodiversity banking (BioBanking), resituates biodiversity within new meanings, spatialities, human-nature relations, and which accounts for biodiversity at a state, rather than local, scale. Utilising the work of Latour, we examine the processes of 'translation' required to generate abstracted 'biodiversity values' that can be traded and moved between locations. Examination of these processes leads to a consideration of the broad requirements of environmental and ecological justice as a theoretical and political response to BioBanking.

AB  - Past attempts to uncover evidence that economically disadvantaged groups are unjustly exposed to environmental disamenities have failed to lake into account self-selection behavior of individuals or groups of individuals. For instance, when choosing a place to live, households may be trading environmental quality far other housing, neighborhood, and location characteristics they care about. Previous literature on environmental justice has investigated location choice of polluting industries, but fails to account for consumer self-selection in housing markets. This paper thus focuses on location choice of individuals based an observed housing transactions. From the results of a random utility model, a test: is proposed that incorporates the no-envy concept of economic equity. The results support a finding for environmental discrimination with respect to African American households, but do not support the hypothesis that poor households in general are unfairly exposed to environmental disamenities.

AB  - Managing and adapting to climate change in urban areas will become increasingly important as urban populations grow, especially because unique features of cities amplify climate change impacts. High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider disservices and co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) and their changes have significant influence on heat balance, especially in the urban area. Therefore climate measurement stations are permanently set-up on different land uses, and additionally mobile climate measurements are carried out every year at the same time and similar climate conditions. The study area is Santiago de Chile, one of the most dynamic and fast growing cities in South America. Urban Structure Types (UST) are delineated for areas under investigation in which the urban morphology is rather characteristic for the social strata. UST are compared with climate parameters to find out if significant correlations exist between UST and climate measurements. The overall goal is to estimate environmental justice in large urban agglomerations.

AB  - In response to the failings of the aggressive neoliberalism of the Reagan era, the Clinton administration sought new ways to promote and deepen the neoliberal project. One of its strategies was to develop "neocommunitarian" programs to support political empowerment and economic self-sufficiency in marginalized communities. Its environmental justice policy became an important vehicle for delivering these programs. This paper examines ways in which one regional office of the US Environmental Protection Agency translated the Clinton administration's environmental justice policy into practical guidelines for its managers. It investigates how these guidelines affected the work of personnel in the EPA's program to clean up hazardous waste sites. It asks how the Clinton administration's approach to environmental justice-emphasizing data analysis, managed public participation, and economic opportunity-helped both to deepen the neoliberal project and to transform the geography of risk and remediation. Although the EPA was unable to "normalize" the environmental justice community-to make it a standardized target for the Clinton administration's empowerment programs-its environmental justice policy both contributed to subtle changes in the distribution of hazardous waste risk and made the delivery of neocommunitarian programs an important part of the work of remedial personnel.

AB  - Multiple-use water services (MUS) can enhance the benefits communities receive from the productive use of water. This article uses household surveys, water samples, focus groups and key informant interviews to examine the potential of MUS in northern Malawi. Specific attention is given to the role of existing rural water supply options and knowledge held by an established smallholder rice farmer group. The study finds that expanding MUS requires: (1) forming MUS coalitions between communities, NGOs and business associations; (2) identifying appropriate MUS practices and markets; (3) undertaking community and water availability assessments; and (4) designing services aligned with these assessments.

AB  - It is important to quantify the value of green space amenities in order to justify the cost of their creation and maintenance; furthermore, advances in available data and methods have produced exciting ways to measure the economic values of green infrastructure. In this study, we use publicly available data from Zillow, Inc. to implement the hedonic pricing method at a novel scope and scale. We analyze over 5000 Zillow neighborhoods located in metropolitan areas across 44 states to identify the marginal value of urban green spaces with respect to median neighborhood home prices. By incorporating a vast, heterogeneous study area, we are able to gain a national-scale perspective on the effects of green spaces on home values. Furthermore, Zillow neighborhoods permit reproducible, extensible, and policy-relevant insight into the effects of green spaces on neighborhoods holistically. Our results suggest that for Zillow neighborhoods on average the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and open space are dis-amenities; however, parks and tree cover add premiums to Zillow neighborhood value. By interacting tree cover with land surface temperature, we find the amenity value of trees is realized in part through shading; furthermore, we find that tree-shading has a greater amenity value in higher income areas.

AB  - Levels of chemicals in humans (body burdens) are useful indicators of environmental quality and of community health. Chemical body burdens are easily monitored using breast milk samples collected from first-time mothers (primiparae) with infants 2-8 weeks of age. Currently, there is no body-burden monitoring program using breast milk in the United States, although ad hoc systems operate successfully in several European countries. In this article we describe the value of such monitoring and important considerations of how it might be accomplished, drawing from our experiences with pilot monitoring projects. Breast milk has several advantages as a sampling matrix: It is simple and noninvasive, with samples collected by the mother. It monitors body burdens in reproductive-age women and it estimates in utero and nursing-infant exposures, all important to community health. Time-trend data from breast milk monitoring serve as a warning system that identifies chemicals whose body burdens and human exposures are increasing. Time trends also serve as a report card on how well past regulatory actions have reduced environmental chemical exposures. Body-burden monitoring using breast milk should include educational programs that encourage breast-feeding. Finally, and most important, clean breast milk matters to people and leads to primary prevention-the limiting of chemical exposures. We illustrate these advantages with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a formerly obscure group of brominated flame retardants that rose to prominence and were regulated in Sweden when residue levels were found to be rapidly increasing in breast milk. A community-based body-burden monitoring program using breast milk could be set up in the United States in collaboration with the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC has a large number of lactating first-time mothers: It has 6,000 clinics nationwide and serves almost half (47%) the infants born in the United States. Educational programs (e.g., those run by WIC) are needed that encourage breast-feeding, especially in lower-income communities where breast-feeding rates are low and where breast-feeding may help protect the infant from the effects of environmental chemical exposures. Education is also needed about reducing chemical body burdens. A body-burden monitoring program would provide valuable data on time trends, background levels, and community hot spots in need of mitigation and follow-up health studies; develop analytic methods for new chemicals of concern; and archive breast milk samples for future analyses of other agents.

AB  - Modern lifestyles are disrupting the human senses-primarily sight, sound, and smell. Noise-induced hearing loss has been noted for centuries and increasing over time following the industrial era. From the mid-20th century, the numbers of individuals with myopia (the leading visual impairment) have been increasing globally. Historical evidence for olfactory dysfunction is not known but its etiological links to pollution suggest it increased following industrialization. Clinical interventions for sight and sound loss include preventative and corrective measures but none exist for olfactory dysfunction. Further, olfactory loss is linked to multiple negative health outcomes across physical, mental, and social domains. Due to the global rates of exposure to pollution, olfaction is a global health concern. The environmental injustice inherent in human society (locally and globally) results in inequitable risk for sensory loss by the most vulnerable populations and creates an even deeper gradient in health disparity. Situated within the environmental justice and health disparity literature, this paper introduces the term sensory inequity to describe variation in sensory environments based on socio-economic status (which is often entwined with race and education). A key challenge to risk management is awareness of sensory inequity experienced by vulnerable populations and incorporating that awareness into basic research and policy.

AB  - Introduction Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex environmental toxicants. Exposure to them has been linked to adverse health outcomes including cancer, as well as diseases of the skin, liver, and immune system. Based on an ongoing community engagement partnership with stakeholder groups and residents, we conducted a small longitudinal study to assess domestic exposure to PAHs among residents of Manchester, an environmental justice neighborhood located in the East End of Houston, TX. Methods In December, 2016, we used fiber wipes to collect samples of household dust from 25 homes in Manchester. Following Hurricane Harvey, in September 2017, we revisited 24 of the 25 homes to collect soil samples from the front yards of the same homes. Wipes and soil were analyzed for the presence of PAHs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. Principal component analysis plots, heatmaps, and PAH ratios were used to compare pre-and post-Hurricane Harvey samples. Results While direct comparison is not possible, we present three methods for comparing PAHs found in pre-hurricane fiber wipes and post-hurricane soil samples. The methods demonstrate that the PAHs found before and after Hurricane Harvey are likely from similar sources and that those sources are most likely to be associated with combustion. We also found evidence of redistribution of PAHs due to extreme flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey. Discussion Residents of the Manchester neighborhood of Houston, TX, are exposed to a range of PAHs in household dust and outdoor soil. While it was not possible to compare directly, we were able to use several methods to assess detected concentrations, changes in site-specific PAH allocations, and PAH origination. Additional research is needed to identify specific sources of domestic PAH exposure in these communities and continued work involving community members and policy makers should aim to develop interventions to reduce domestic exposure to and prevent negative health outcomes from PAHs.

AB  - It is widely agreed today that the existence of a network of bicycle paths fosters a feeling of safety as well as the use of the bicycle for both recreational and utilitarian purposes. Recent studies have found a link between the presence of cycling infrastructures and gentrification. Few studies have however examined the growth of the cycling networks from the perspective of environmental equity. The main objective of this study is to determine whether the extension of the cycling network in the urban areas of Montreal and Longueuil and the city of Laval over a quarter of a century (1991 to 2016) has reduced or reinforced inequities in accessibility for low-income populations, recent immigrants, children, and older people. Archival maps were employed to reconstruct the cycling networks in the Montreal area in a GIS for six years (1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016). Census data and spatial analysis methods were then used to measure whether or not inequities in the accessibility of the cycling network increased over the period in question. The results show that, in 25 years, the cycling network has more than doubled in size. It can however be seen that some areas are still very poorly served, and that the network lacks connectivity. Low-income individuals have generally enjoyed good accessibility over the entire period. A strong decrease in inaccessibility for recent immigrants and seniors is also observed. The most important result is clearly that there has been little or no improvement for children, who are found to be in a situation of inequity.

AB  - In a culture with institutionalized racial disparities, administrative norms that attempt to ensure rational decisions through the use of aggregation and quantification can exacerbate the racial disparities that policy attempts to address. We argue that it will be difficult for policy to address the problem without a fundamental reorientation of the ways that administrators make decisions based on race. We conclude by offering some suggestions for how this reorientation can begin.

AB  - Objectives. We assessed how traffic and mobile-source air pollution impacts are distributed across racial/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse groups in port-adjacent communities in southern Los Angeles County, which may experience divergent levels of exposure to port-related heavy-duty diesel truck traffic because of existing residential and land use patterns. Methods. We used spatial regression techniques to assess the association of neighborhood racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition with residential parcel-level traffic and vehicle-related fine particulate matter exposure after accounting for built environment and land use factors. Results. After controlling for factors associated with traffic generation, we found that a higher percentage of nearby Black and Asian/Pacific Islander residents was associated with higher exposure, a higher percentage of Hispanic residents was associated with higher traffic exposure but lower vehicle particulate matter exposure, and areas with lower socioeconomic status experienced lower exposure. Conclusions. Disparities in traffic and vehicle particulate matter exposure are nuanced depending on the exposure metric used, the distribution of the traffic and emissions, and pollutant dispersal patterns. Future comparative research is needed to assess potential disparities in other transportation and goods movement corridors.

AB  - Objectives. We assessed child care facilities' proximity to heavily traveled roadways in an attempt to estimate the extent of potential exposure of young children to vehicle-related pollution in this understudied microenvironment. Methods. We examined approximately 24000 licensed child care facilities in California located within 200 m of heavily traveled roadways. Results. Approximately 57000 of the available slots in California child care centers (7% of the overall capacity) are in facilities located within 200 m (650 ft) of roadways averaging 50000 or more vehicles per day, and another 172000 (21%) are in facilities located within 200 m of roadways averaging 25000 to 49000 vehicles per day. Facilities providing care to infants or preschool-aged children and facilities located in disadvantaged areas were more often situated in medium- or high-traffic areas. Conclusions. Additional research is needed to further clarify the significance of the child care microenvironment in terms of potential childhood exposures to vehicle-related pollutants. Design strategies, notification standards, and distance-based siting restrictions should be considered in the facility licensing process and in land use and transportation planning.

AB  - In this article I consider the initial period of solid waste management planning in the US state of Hawaii. The State encountered a number of economic and ecological controversies during its solid waste management planning, a process that was prompted by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Some issues, like project financing, were common across the US, while others, such as the potential of waste materials to reduce reliance on imported food and materials, were more unique to Hawaii. The controversies from this initial planning period were never quite fully resolved; as they lingered, they were interpreted differently across the Islands. Based on a close reading of government, advocacy group, waste industry and news media documents, I examine the controversies over solid waste management of the time and consider how the dual nature' of waste in Hawaiisimultaneously an ecological threat and (potential) economic inputshaped the adoption of solid waste management systems there. This article adds to an expanding literature examining infrastructure in environmental and technology histories.

AB  - Maui, Hawaii, USA is an island with sensitive ecosystems and sharply circumscribed spatial resources for waste disposal. Despite the State of Hawaii's preferences to the contrary, Maui remains heavily dependent on landfilling and to a lesser extent, landfill diversion techniques to manage its solid waste. This article examines the history of solid waste management on Maui through the lens of Bulkeley, Watson, and Hudson's (2007) modes of governing' framework for the analysis of environmental and infrastructural policy issues. This approach asks users to consider equally and simultaneously the structures, processes, technologies, and ultimately, multiplicities of governance activities. Based on an analysis of approximately 200 government, private firm, and news media documents, it is demonstrated that private firms played a very significant role in shaping solid waste management on Maui, and were able to introduce their own desired modes for governing solid waste management that supplanted the preferences of State and County entities. In making this addition to the original modes of governing framework, it is argued that differences in both legal authority over and functional proximity to the practices and processes of solid waste management on Maui spurred the deployment of and competition between multiple modes of governing solid waste management there, as well as the eventual entry of private firms into the solid waste management process. Ultimately, the fragmentation of solid waste management practices on Maui has resulted in a somewhat ambivalent outcome for the natural environment. As such, this study adds to growing literatures examining both solid waste management and environmental policy issues.

AB  - Indigenous peoples are easily classified as either dangerously vulnerable or inherently resilient to climate risks. There are elements of truth in both categorical statements. Yet neither is completely true. Indigenous vulnerability and resilience, and Indigenous groups' adaptive responses to climate change, need to be understood in the messy contexts of lived experience, rather than either elegant social theories or didactic ideological politics. Climate change action and research needs to acknowledge and engage with the knowledges, ontologies and experiences of diverse Indigenous groups, along with the specific histories, geographies and impacts of colonization, and their consequences for both the colonized and colonizers. Climate change action and research needs to be integrated into wider de-colonial projects as the transformative impacts of anthropogenic climate change are inadequately addressed within both colonial and post-colonial frames. Negotiating respectful modes of belonging-together-in-Country to reshape people-to-people, people-to-environment and people-to-cosmos relationships in Indigenous domains is essential in responding to planetary scale changes in coupled human and natural systems. This paper outlines an approach that nurtures Indigenous self-determination and inter-generational healing to rethink the geopolitics of Indigenous resilience, vulnerability and adaptation in an era of climate change and the resurgence of Great Power geopolitics.

AB  - Natural disasters and aging societies are increasingly prevalent globally. To improve environmental injustice and contribute to social good, the Tzu Chi Recycling Program engages older adult volunteers in recycling usable materials into eco-friendly blankets for disaster survivors. Drawing on life span and ecological systems theories, this study examined the longitudinal effects of this program on older adults' mental and physical health. Using a quasi-experimental longitudinal design, data were collected from older adults at recycling stations (intervention group, n = 36) and community centers (control group, n = 36) in rural areas in Southern Taiwan. Findings from two-way repeated measures analysis of variance show that the program significantly improved older adults' self-compassion, compassion for others, depression, hostility, happiness, and hypertension. Older adults built resilience and contributed to environmental sustainability and social good, which suggest a new avenue for social work practitioners and policy-makers to address social and environmental challenges.

AB  - Industrial smoke emissions pose a significant concern to human health. Prior works have shown that using Computer Vision (CV) techniques to identify smoke as visual evidence can influence the attitude of regulators and empower citizens to pursue environmental justice. However, existing datasets are not of sufficient quality nor quantity to train the robust CV models needed to support air quality advocacy. We introduce RISE, the first large-scale video dataset for Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions. We adopted a citizen science approach to collaborate with local community members to annotate whether a video clip has smoke emissions. Our dataset contains 12,567 clips from 19 distinct views from cameras that monitored three industrial facilities. These daytime clips span 30 days over two years, including all four seasons. We ran experiments using deep neural networks to establish a strong performance baseline and reveal smoke recognition challenges. Our survey study discussed community feedback, and our data analysis displayed opportunities for integrating citizen scientists and crowd workers into the application of Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact.

Based on network analysis, different trip modes (walking, public transport, and car modes) and park attractiveness coefficients were integrated into a Gaussian-based 2SFCA model, and park accessibility in the 10min, 15-min, and 20-min scenarios was analyzed and compared with a single-mode model. The spatial mismatch between park accessibility and population density was also explored by bivariate local Moran's I statistic. Results show that: 1. The landscapes of park accessibility are spatial heterogenous and varied with temporal-spatial scale. With the increase of catchment size, the mean value and standard deviation of park accessibility decreases. 2. The traditional single-mode model will overestimate park accessibility while the multi-modes model can provide more realistic evaluation and offer better guidance for urban park planning. The multi-mode model can also get smoother and homogeneous results. 3. The spatial relationships between park accessibility and population density are divided into a positive match, negative match, positive mismatch, negative mismatch, and non-significant. This paper can provide some improvement to studies that did not consider the impact of trip modes and park attributes on accessibility and spatial equity.

AB  - Many different quantitative techniques have been developed to either assess Environmental Justice (EJ) issues or estimate exposure and dose for risk assessment. However, very few approaches have been applied to link EJ factors to exposure dose estimate and identify potential impacts of EJ factors on dose-related variables. The purpose of this study is to identify quantitative approaches that incorporate conventional risk assessment (RA) dose modeling and cumulative risk assessment (CRA) considerations of disproportionate environmental exposure. We apply the Average Daily Dose (ADD) model, which has been commonly used in RA, to better understand impacts of EJ indicators upon exposure dose estimates and dose-related variables, termed the Environmental-Justice-Average-Daily-Dose (EJ-ADD) approach. On the U.S. nationwide census tract-level, we defined and quantified two EJ indicators (poverty and race/ethnicity) using an EJ scoring method to examine their relation to census tract-level multi-chemical exposure dose estimates. Pollutant doses for each tract were calculated using the ADD model, and EJ scores were assigned to each tract based on poverty-or race-related population percentages. Single-and multiple-chemical ADD values were matched to the tract-level EJ scores to analyze disproportionate dose relationships and contributing EJ factors. We found that when both EJ indicators were examined simultaneously, ADD for all pollutants generally increased with larger EJ scores. To demonstrate the utility of using EJ-ADD on the local scale, we approximated ADD levels of lead via soil/dust ingestion for simulated communities with different EJ-related scenarios. The local-level simulation indicates a substantial difference in exposure-dose levels between wealthy and EJ communities. The application of the EJ-ADD approach can link EJ factors to exposure dose estimate and identify potential EJ impacts on dose-related variables.

AB  - In South Africa, the law of costs states that costs are a matter of judicial discretion, but as a general approach costs follow the result. In South Africa, as in the UK, these rules are regarded as the single most significant barrier to access to environmental justice. In a recent case involving an environmental non-governmental organisation, the Constitutional Court of South Africa has affirmed a new approach to the issue of costs in constitutional litigation which is aimed at facilitating, rather than chilling, litigation of this nature. The Constitutional Court of South Africa recently handed down judgment in Trustees for the Time Being of the Biowatch Trust v Registrar, Genetic Resources & Others(1)-a case which necessitated a consideration of the proper approach to costs in constitutional litigation and which has paved the way for greater access to environmental justice in South African courts. The background to the case, outline of the judgment and analysis are set out below.

AB  - On-site sewage treatment systems can be an important source of antibiotic resistant bacteria and organic micropollutants into adjacent groundwater. Due to the frequent proximity of private wells to septic systems, this contamination is a concern to communities that do not have access to public municipal services. In both rural and urban environments, low-income communities, indigenous communities and those of color are disproportionately affected by well contamination. The objective of this study was to assess well water quality in an underserved North Carolina community by performing a comprehensive evaluation of microbial and organic micropollutant occurrence and determining possible sources of contamination. Well water, septic tanks, and adjacent municipal water were sampled. Culture- and molecular biology-based microbial analysis and non-targeted, high resolution mass spectrometry chemical analysis were conducted to assess water quality in comparison to nearby municipal water. Three of thirteen homes had between 1 and 6.3 CFUs/100 mL of E. coli and two homes had fecal bacteria resistant to antibiotics in their well water. The water of four homes showed concentrations of the artificial sweetener sucralose, a wastewater tracer, higher than the municipal water (range similar to 60-1500 ng L-1). The human-specific HF183 fecal marker was detected in 79% of the wells tested. The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in four home wells, along with the presence of pesticides and insecticides in two homes, suggest possible contamination from septic tanks and lawn care runoff. The implications of this work highlight the necessity of wider scale contaminant evaluation of well water. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many theorists claim that if an agent benefits from an action that harms others, that agent has a moral duty to compensate those who are harmed, even if the agent did not cause the harm herself. In the debate on climate justice, this idea is commonly referred to as the beneficiary-pays principle (BPP). This paper argues that the BPP is implausible, both in the context of climate change and as a normative principle more generally. It should therefore be rejected.

AB  - New business, real estate and public investment dollars are skewed towards the predominantly white outlying suburbs, which fuels metropolitan sprawl, development of green spaces, and loss of farms. Many U.S. centre-cities are relegated to a preponderance of abandoned and potentially contaminated properties or brownfields. This unequal outward expansion is caused, in part, by unfair zoning and real estate practices that result in decreased development choices and increased social and economic inequality. Under-utilization of existing infrastructure potentially results in hundreds of billions of :dollars in inefficiencies due to added costs and under-utilized capital. Exclusionary zoning, often based on minimum lot size requirements per household or exclusions of multifamily or accessory housing units, results in non market limits to affordable housing. Unlike Europe's transit oriented developments, dispersed development in the U.S. increases automobile reliance and associated mobile source pollutants. Smart growth policies and brownfield redevelopment in the U.S. can help redress one-sided investment practices that have directed development and jobs away from older and poorer communities. However, market processes are distorted to under-price sprawling greenfield development, leading to sub-optimal land consumption and allocation of resources affecting the environment, community and regional economies, whilst exacerbating social-economic inequalities. More equitable urban redevelopment efforts can strengthen existing communities while promoting improved regional environmental performance along with fiscal and economic benefits.

AB  - Many studies on disparities in the distribution of urban green space (UGS) focus on the quantity and accessibility of designated open spaces. However, when all types of UGS, including unmanaged green areas, are accounted for, claims of green space distributive injustice become more complicated. We conducted a preliminary investigation questioning the common Global North assumption that the poor have less access to the benefits of green space, using the cities of Mumbai and Jakarta as case studies as, in their respective countries, wealth inequality has grown at a higher rate than in other Asian countries. We employed four sets of geospatial data to analyze green space distribution patterns and probe the relationship with UGS inequity in different land value districts. We found that the lower land value districts had more vegetation coverage with a higher vegetation density, mainly due to a large quantity of unmanaged greenery. The relationship between the status of urban development and the land values in a district is not necessarily reflective of the UGS distribution once unmanaged vegetation is considered. We conclude by discussing ways to optimize the use of unmanaged UGS as a socioecological asset for poorer districts, and we point to the practical consequences of incorporating the study's findings into policy and planning towards the creation of ecologically inclusive cities.

AB  - Normative guidelines for addressing project-induced displacement and resettlement have been successful in coercing companies and practitioners to comply with international standards and local requirements. However, good practice has not always been effectively implemented, leading to reduced social wellbeing of people in local communities. We assess how the reciprocal relationships between institutional norms and practitioners' situated perspectives about company-community interactions can improve social management practice. Drawing on Hajer and Versteeg's method of environmental discourse analysis, discussions and storylines about a mining project in Mpumalanga in South Africa were assessed against contextualised discursive conventions in the mining industry. It was found that practitioners learn to manipulate legislative requirements, which ultimately perpetuates the impoverishment of project affected communities. The question is not whether or not practitioners understand the requirements of environmental and social management, but the extent to which such understandings are manipulated for corporate gain as opposed to social good. We consider practitioner rationalities about the purpose and function of environmental and social management, and how it is implemented. We suggest that practitioners and companies should construct positive aspirational identity perspectives about social management that would transcend from their current limited view (that achieving minimum compliance is sufficient) to aspiring to achieve better social development outcomes for all, especially the most disadvantaged. This requires a genuine commitment to obtaining and maintaining a social licence to operate, perspective transformation, a commitment to inclusiveness, and increased capacity for critical reflection.

AB  - Laboratory test reports are often used as one of the pieces of evidence needed in proving civil environmental justice cases. This study analyses court decisions and their ability to elaborate problems in transmitting these reports as scientific evidence in such cases in Indonesia. They can be qualified as written and expert testimony evidence, with their use left entirely to the judge's discretion. Furthermore, in judicial practices, judges' criteria in assessing these reports are formality and relevance. Conclusively, the research found that the report's relevance, which included validity and reliability, and support from expert testimonies, are critical points in their use as valid legal evidence with probative value in justice cases.

AB  - Income polarization is a pressing issue which is increasingly discussed by academics and policymakers. The present research examines income polarization in Canada's eight largest Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) using data at the census-tract (CT) level between 1971 and 2016. Generally, there are significant decreasing trends in the middle-income population with simultaneously increasing trends in low-income groups. The high-income groups have been relatively stable with fewer significant increasing population trends. Using conventional mapping and cartograms, patterns of the spatial evolution of income inequality are illustrated. Every CMA examined contains an increasing trend of spatial fragmentation at the patch level within each CMA's landscape mosaic. The results of a spatial autocorrelation analysis at the sub-patch, CT level, exhibit significant spatial clustering of high-income CTs as one process that dominates the increasingly fragmented landscape mosaic.

AB  - Neoliberalization of the water sector in Lima, Peru, is analyzed using an innovative conceptual framework with three interrelated dimensions: techno-environmental improvements, the monetization of water services and the search for political legitimacy. Application of this conceptual framework to the recent reforms of the public water services of Lima, a city historically fraught with social inequalities and water management problems, shows that there have been two distinctive phases: firstly, emphasis on techno-environmental improvements and monetization in the 1990s (when the privatization of the local water utility was the ultimate, but unfulfilled, goal); secondly, a focus on monetization and legitimization in the 2000s (marked by more flexible mechanisms of private sector involvement). Fieldwork in Lima reveals that positive results from increased investment in water services have been undermined by the discriminatory and short-term basis of neoliberalization of water. Problems of debt financing, neglect of equity of access to services and weak environmental sustainability threaten the long-term future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Community resilience, the ability of a community to respond positively to adverse situations, is an increasingly important topic in public health. Many resilience frameworks are grounded in concepts initially developed by ecologists to describe and explain the capacity of complex systems, such as a community, to persist or return to its original state following disturbances. As a result, much of the research on resilience is concerned with maintaining systems in their current form, preventing degradation, or promoting recovery. However, for a system that is stuck in a trap, or an unfavorable state, deliberate efforts to build the components that contribute to resilience, called adaptive capacities, may enable that system to reorganize after a disturbance to reach a more favorable state. Objective: The purpose of this research was to apply a resilience framework to analyze how the community of St. Gabriel, Louisiana adapted in response to environmental change. Methods: We used qualitative case-study methodologies to systematically collect newspaper articles, which served as primary data sources to examine how resilience and adaptive capacity evolved in the community of St. Gabriel, Louisiana. Results: Key events in the recent history of St. Gabriel include industrial development, growing concern about environmental health and pollution, the environmental justice (EJ) movement, and the incorporation of the community as a self-governing municipality. Two events, the community's organized resistance to a large hazardous waste facility and the change in government structure, represent critical transformations, or fundamental changes in how the community functions. Conclusion: The incorporation of St. Gabriel gave community members more input in planning and development decisions. As a result, the community has taken steps to improve public health in the form of zoning ordinances to prevent new exposure risks and building community infrastructure, such as a new sewer system and a recreation center.

AB  - Pesticide use is increasing in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and many smallholders purchase, handle, and apply toxic pesticides with inadequate equipment, knowledge, and technical support. Through the frame of environmental justice, this literature-based study analyzes characteristics, impacts, and drivers of smallholder pesticide use in sub-Saharan Africa, with particular attention to Uganda as a case. We find that market liberalization, poor regulation enforcement, and persistent neglect of agricultural extension place the burden of risk largely on farmers, while perceived necessity of pesticides and the elusive nature of impacts (especially under conditions of insufficient monitoring) likely delay social mobilization around pesticides. The environmental justice frame, which has seen limited application in smallholder contexts, importantly helps delineate future directions for research and practice. It is particularly effective for redirecting focus from highly limited managerial solutions for "safe use" toward deeper problem drivers and solutions capable of tackling them.

AB  - Issues of justice and inequality are among the most compelling themes in spatial studies. And yet, the field lacks a normative approach to justice in measurements of inequality in spatial scales, either in the regional, or alternatively, in the urban. In a paper by Israel and Frenkel (2018), the authors offer a theoretical framework that advances the study of social justice in space. It utilizes concepts of Pierre Bourdieu's theory on social class, while using Amartya Sen's 'capabilities' approach to justice to define the metrics of this concept. We take their proposed framework and examine it empirically by means of a regional case study in Israel. Data were collected on a central region in Israel and a field survey was conducted on more than 1000 households. The concept of justice and the socio-spatial structures under which justice is created were converted into measurable values. By using Explanatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling, the conceptual framework was quantitatively estimated. In accordance with the inspected theory, we show that the interrelationship between a person's location in the social space and living environment influences his or her life-chances. The empirical results demonstrate how the proposed theory can be operationalized-that is, binding a normative idea with an empirically based scrutinization of the social and cultural constraints that affect freedom of choice. The framework's operationalization allows for applying it in future endeavors that strive to understand what normative implications spatial development carry when relating to the social space and built environment of a place.

AB  - Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are incentive-based instruments that provide conditional economic incentives for natural resources management. Research has shown that when economic incentives are parachuted into rural communities, participation and benefits are collectively negotiated and shared. However, we know little about how benefit-sharing evolves over time in community-based PES. To address this gap, we examine distributional justice in four communities of the state of Chiapas, Mexico, which participate in a PES programme, and we assess how local justice principles compare with the programme's goals. Our analysis reveals patterns of both continuity and change in how communities share PES benefits, which reflect a suite of contradictory justice principles, including entitlement, merit, need, and equality. The studied communities distribute PES benefits by providing differentiated compensation to diverse groups of landholders via private cash payments, whilst also attending non-landed community members through public infrastructure investments. We show that benefit-sharing is strongly influenced by pre-existing land tenure features and associated norms, which in the study area include three different types of individual and common-property. Yet, we also show that communities continuously adjust benefit-sharing arrangements to navigate distributional challenges emerging from programme engagement. Overall, we provide novel insights on the evolution, diversity, and complexity of distributive justice in community-based PES and we advocate for a context-sensitive, nuanced, and dynamic account of justice in incentive-based conservation.

AB  - Optimal sleep is integral to health but is commonly not obtained. Despite its wide-ranging public health impact, sleep health is considered only rarely by policy makers, employers, schools, and others whose policies and structures can adversely affect sleep. An inadequate duration of sleep and poor-quality sleep are prevalent in minority and low-income populations, and may be fundamental to racial and socioeconomic status inequities that contribute to a range of health conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review examines the relationship between sleep and disparities in CVD. We describe the public health importance of sleep and the role of sleep duration, as well as the two most common disorders (sleep apnea and insomnia) as risk factors for a number of chronic diseases. We use a multilevel model focused on population health and health disparities, which is based on the notion that individual behaviors, such as sleep, are influenced by complex and dynamic interrelations among individuals and their physical and social environments. We also describe modifiable factors that contribute to insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment, propose potential interventions in various sectors (e.g., neighborhoods, schools, workplaces) that can address social structures that contribute to disparities, and recommend areas for future research. Integrating sleep into public health research will identify novel approaches for closing gaps in health disparities.

AB  - Indigenous-specific water entitlements are currently estimated at less than one hundredth of 1% of Australian water allocations. This minute figure contrasts starkly with the extent of Indigenous land ownership that is currently in excess of one-fifth of Australia's land mass. Indigenous Australians see clear connections between the past and present in accounting for this skewed distribution of entitlements, and their testimonies indicate an awareness of the enduring effect of historical injustices in the development of Australia water law and policy. This chapter applies concepts derived from political theory to examine this significant case of historical injustice. It argues that there is a poor appreciation within the water sector, and among wider society, of the importance of historical events and structural processes in explaining today's pattern of access to water. By revealing the dynamics of water allocation over time through the trajectory of water law and policy, the chapter shows how injustices were produced and reproduced during the colonial and state administration eras and the ramifications for achieving justice in the recent and ongoing neoliberal reform era. Indigenous peoples' rights and interests in water have been systematically and persistently marginalised because reparative or restorative mechanisms have not been established in any of the processes that have made and re-made water law and policy over the course of Australian history.

AB  - It's been just over a decade since Unconventional Oil and Gas development began in earnest in the Marcellus Shale, a dense shale formation that, along with the deeper and larger Utica Shale, covers much of the mid-Atlantic United States. Since January 2008, approximately 15,939 wells have been drilled and fracked at 5674 sites across these shales. This decennial documents the pace, scale, and stages of actual development and takes stock of the social science on impacts to communities, people, policies, and culture. We have divided this article into the following sections that are categorized both geographically and thematically: Pennsylvania: Heart of the Marcellus Shale Play, focuses on the plethora of social science research that has occurred on impacts to Pennsylvania communities, health, economics, and agricultural production; West Virginia and Ohio: Legacies of Extraction discusses research on the overlapping historical legacies of extractive industries in the region and details results of original research examining perceived impacts to residents amid complex historical natural resource lineages; and New York: Fracking, Culture and Politics examines how the regulatory process to develop the Marcellus Shale affected both the state and nation's culture, politics, and policy as one of the most densely populated regions of the US came to grips with hosting the modern-day Oil and Gas Industry. We conclude with a discussion of emerging research opportunities and directions as a new generation of social scientists document future development in the Marcellus and Utica Shales.

AB  - Models for supporting climate adaptation and mitigation planning, mostly in the form of Integrated Assessment Models, are poorly equipped for aiding questions related to fairness of adaptation and mitigation strategies, because they often disregard distributional outcomes. When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

AB  - Maintaining enough green areas and ensuring fair access to them is a common planning challenge in growing and densifying cities. Evaluations of green area access typically use metrics like population around green areas (within a certain buffer), but these do not fully ensure equitable access. We propose that using systematic and complementarity-driven spatial prioritization, often used in nature conservation planning, could assist in the complex planning challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of spatial prioritization to identify green areas with highest recreational potential based on their type and their accessibility for the residents of the Helsinki Metropolitan area, the capital district of Finland. We calculated travel times from each city district to each green area. Travel times were calculated separately to local green areas using active travel modes (walking and biking), and to large forests (attracting people from near and far) using public transport. We prioritized the green areas using these multimodal travel times from each district and weighting the prioritization with population data with Zonation, conservation prioritization software. Compared to a typical buffer analysis (population within a 500 m buffer from green areas), our approach identified areas of high recreational potential in different parts of the study area. This approach allows systematic integration of travel-time-based accessibility measures into equitable spatial prioritization of recreational green areas. It can help urban planners to identify sets of green areas that best support the recreational needs of the residents across the city.

AB  - In this study we used a participatory research method, photovoice, to explore community perceptions about environmental health risks, community assets, and strengths in and around an urban, degraded watershed in Northwest Atlanta, Georgia. This watershed, formed by Proctor Creek, is a focal point for redevelopment and infrastructure investments for years to come. Using a community-based participatory research approach, 10 Proctor Creek residents (watershed researchers), and a university partner, engaged in data collection; participatory data analysis; internal discussions; translation of research findings into watershed restoration, community revitalization, remedial action, and policy solutions; and dissemination of results to fellow watershed residents, stakeholders, and decision makers. We present a conceptual model linking the watershed researchers' understanding of urban policies and practice in the Proctor Creek Watershed to environmental, neighborhood and housing conditions and their influence on health outcomes and quality of life. Engaging community members in defining their own community environmental health challenges and assets yielded the following primary themes: 1) threats to the natural environment, 2) built environment stressors that influence health, 3) blight and divestment of public resources, and 4) hope for the future. Residents' vision for the future of the watershed a restored creek, revitalized neighborhoods, and restored people is fueled by a strong connection to history, memory, and sense of place. We demonstrate the value of local knowledge in identifying previously unaddressed environmental health risks in the Proctor Creek Watershed as well as solutions to reduce or eliminate them.

AB  - Payments to communities from landfill developers in exchange for permission to construct, expand, or operate a landfill have become popular. The value of this host compensation varies widely, yet the factors that influence it are unexplored. We construct a unique data set of host fees paid by the 104 largest privately owned solid waste landfills in 1996. We find that citizen participation in host fee negotiations, experience hosting a landfill, state mandates for minimum host compensation, and firms with greater resources all lead to greater host compensation. We find limited evidence that neither the racial makeup or income level of the community nor the negative externalities associated with a landfill are important.

AB  - In this paper, we attempt to contribute to the growing environmental justice debate by exploring environmental equity in the forty-nine counties of Ontario, Canada. We use multiple regression analysis to address a central research question: what variables predict the location of pollution emissions? Data were extracted from the 1993 National Pollutant Release Inventory and the 1991 Census of Canada to assess relationships among socioeconomic class variables, industrial and land-use variables, and pollution emissions. The results agree with the findings of recent US studies. Manufacturing employment, urbanization variables, dwelling value, and household income were all significantly related to pollution emissions. These relationships took the same direction as in most of the US studies. In total, the four variables account for about 63% of the variation in pollution emissions (adjusted R-2 = 0.626, p < 0.0001). Contrary to a hypothesis of environmental inequity, the household income variable displayed a positive relationship with pollution emissions. A conceptual model of the development process is formulated to explain the positive relationship between pollution emissions and income levels. We conclude the paper with suggestions for future research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the distribution of heat risk-related land cover (HRRLC) characteristics across racial/ethnic groups and degrees of residential segregation. METHODS: Block group-level tree canopy and impervious surface estimates were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset for densely populated urban areas of the United States and Puerto Rico, and linked to demographic characteristics from the 2000 Census. Racial/ethnic groups in a given block group were considered to live in HRRLC if at least half their population experienced the absence of tree canopy and at least half of the ground was covered by impervious surface (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, roads). Residential segregation was characterized for metropolitan areas in the United States and Puerto Rico using the multigroup dissimilarity index. RESULTS: After adjustment for ecoregion and precipitation, holding segregation level constant, non-Hispanic blacks were 52% more likely (95% CI: 37%, 69%), non-Hispanic Asians 32% more likely (95% CI: 18%, 47%), and Hispanics 21% more likely (95% CI: 8%, 35%) to live in HRRLC conditions compared with non-Hispanic whites. Within each racial/ethnic group, HRRLC conditions increased with increasing degrees of metropolitan area-level segregation. Further adjustment for home ownership and poverty did not substantially alter these results, but adjustment for population density and metropolitan area population attenuated the segregation effects, suggesting a mediating or confounding role. CONCLUSIONS: Land cover was associated with segregation within each racial/ethnic group, which may be explained partly by the concentration of racial/ethnic minorities into densely populated neighborhoods within larger, more segregated cities. In anticipation of greater frequency and duration of extreme heat events, climate change adaptation strategies, such as planting trees in urban areas, should explicitly incorporate an environmental justice framework that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in HRRLC.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent synthetic organic contaminants that can cause serious human health concerns such as obesity, liver damage, kidney cancer, hypertension, immunotoxicity and other human health issues. Integrated crop-livestock systems combine agricultural crop production with milk and/or meat production and processing. Key sources of PFAS in these systems include firefighting foams near military bases, wastewater sludge and industrial discharge. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances regularly move from soils to nearby surface water and/or groundwater because of their high mobility and persistence. Irrigating crops or managing livestock for milk and meat production using adjacent waters can be detrimental to human health. The presence of PFAS in both groundwater and milk have been reported in dairy production states (e.g., Wisconsin and New Mexico) across the United States. Although there is a limit of 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water by the U.S. EPA, there are not yet regional screening guidelines for conducting risk assessments of livestock watering as well as the soil and plant matrix. This systematic review includes (i) the sources, impacts and challenges of PFAS in integrated crop-livestock systems, (ii) safety measures and protocols for sampling soil, water and plants for determining PFAS concentration in exposed integrated crop-livestock systems and (iii) the assessment, measurement and evaluation of human health risks related to PFAS exposure.

AB  - Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) in China aim to improve sustainability and reduce environmental health impacts of transport emissions. Urban use of EVs rather than conventional vehicles shifts transportation's air pollutant emissions from urban areas (tailpipes) to predominantly rural areas (power plants), changing the geographic distribution of health impacts. We model PM2.5-related health impacts attributable to urban EV use for 34 major cities. Our investigation focuses on environmental justice (EJ) by comparing pollutant inhalation versus income among impacted counties. We find that EVs could increase EJ challenge in China: most (similar to 77%, range: 41-96%) emission inhalation attributable to urban EVs use is distributed to predominately rural communities whose incomes are on average lower than the cities where EVs are used. Results vary dramatically across cities depending on urban income and geography. Discriminant analysis reveals that counties with low income and high inhalation of urban EV emissions have comparatively higher agricultural employment rates, higher mortality rates, more children in the population, and lower education levels. We find that low-emission electricity sources such as renewable energy can help mitigate EJ issues raised here. Findings here are not unique to EVs, but instead are relevant for nearly all electricity-consuming technologies in urban areas.

AB  - In recent decades the concept of environmental justice has remarkably emerged as a compulsory principle for assessing geographical situations and guiding territorial decision making. In this paper, three objectives are intended: firstly, to expose shortly its emersion and conceptual meaning; secondly, to revise a wide set of recently published case studies focused on its measurement and assessment; thirdly, to provide some general guidelines for carrying geo-environmental assessments in this line, and to propose measurement tools to this end. Finally, a balance of the state of art is drawn up and some further perspectives are outlined.

AB  - Inequality in the environmental conditions or burden (negative externalities, hazards, discomfort, etc.) between places and people is an issue of growing interest. Many of works, using a variety of approaches, conclude that there is often discrimination and injustice. However, from the public decision-making and governance perspective, one question needs a clear answer: how much inequality is there? Is this too much, and therefore unfair, and does it justify public action? This paper looks at this question in a case study on the threat posed by air pollution in Madrid and Barcelona (Spain), by examining the spatial distribution of several vulnerable population groups and their potential exposure to high concentrations of PM10 in the atmosphere, and using an affordable method involving GIS and statistical techniques. Adopting an explicitly impartial operating criterion makes it possible to measure the amount of inequality for each population group and determine more objectively if it significantly exceeds the baseline criterion. This would make it more accurate for citizens and decision-makers alike to better assess the possible inequities.

AB  - Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a human carcinogen and associated with cardiovascular, respiratory, and skin diseases. Natural and anthropogenic sources contribute to low concentrations of iAs in water, food, soil, and air. Differential exposure to environmental hazards in minority, indigenous, and low income populations is considered an environmental justice (EJ) concern, yet it is unclear if higher iAs exposure occurs in these populations. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate evidence for differential iAs exposure in the United States (US). The peer reviewed literature was searched for studies that (1) estimated iAs exposure based on environmental concentrations of iAs in water, food, soil, or iAs biomarkers and (2) examined iAs exposure in minority, indigenous, and low income US populations. Five studies were identified that estimated exposures and provided demographic information about EJ populations. These studies reported arsenic concentrations in water, soil, or food to estimate exposure, with varied evidence of differential exposure. Additionally, six studies were identified that suggested potential arsenic exposure from environmental sources including soil, rice, private well-water, and fish, but did not report data stratified by demographic information. Evidence across these 11 studies was qualitatively integrated to draw conclusions about differential iAs exposure. The total body of evidence is limited by lack of individual exposure measures, lack of iAs concentration data, and insufficient comparative demographic data. Based upon these data gaps, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether differential exposure to iAs is an EJ concern in the US. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Our article provides an in-depth analysis of the framing processes and outcomes associated with a petition submitted by Inuit communities in the arctic on the human rights violations caused by climate change before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights in 2005. Drawing on semi-structured interviews conducted in two different Inuit communities in Canada that have ties to the petition and with lawyers and activists in the transnational climate justice movement, we process-trace the role that the petition has played in promoting discursive and collective action frames related to the recognition of the "right to be cold." We argue that the Inuit petition articulated a novel "climate rights" frame through an innovative combination of legal argumentation, scientific research, and the oral testimony of Inuit communities concerning the ways in which climate impacts were affecting their human rights and traditional practices. Our findings reveal that the resonance of this frame has varied significantly among different actors, influencing the ideas and strategies of climate activists and lawyers around the world, but having limited resonance among policymakers in the United States or Canada or among Inuit communities themselves. Our research thus speaks to the complex challenges and ethical responsibilities that must be addressed in initiatives that seek to draw on international human rights law to influence policy decisions and empower Indigenous communities in the context of climate change.

AB  - Ongoing revitalization of the >5000-year-old tradition of using trees for vital culture and heritage activities including carving and weaving affirms Alaska Native resilience. However, support for these sustained cultural practices is complicated by environmental and political factors. Carving projects typically require western redcedar (Thuja plicata) or yellow cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) trees more than 450 years of age-a tree life stage and growth rate inconsistent with current even-aged forest management strategies. Herein, we qualitatively assess the significance of wood products to rural communities and Indigenous cultures with implications for natural heritage sustainability. In partnership with Alaska Native Tribes, we engaged local youth programs to lead community discussions throughout southeast Alaska to provide specificity to the suite of cultural activities linked to regional forest lands. Results from 58 discussions across 11 southeast Alaska communities (primarily Alaska Native participants) highlighted the cultural importance of forest products including totem poles, dugout canoes, longhouses, woven hats, and woven baskets. Findings indicated spiritual well-being, health, education, tourism, and livelihood significance attributed to these products. Participant-suggested management strategies for increasing supply and expanding access to trees on public lands included: engaging local artisans in forest planning, selecting and delivering specific trees to roads as part of ongoing timber sales, allowing bark removal prior to forest-timber sales, simplifying the tree-acquisition permit process, and setting aside cultural forest groves to sustain trees seven generations into the future. By facilitating discussions, this study fostered relevant place-based youth and community engagement, benefiting youth and enhancing community knowledge transfer while simultaneously summarizing the significance of forest products for resilient culture and heritage activities. Forest management plans aiming to support Alaska Native lifeways may benefit from improved understanding of Indigenous perspectives and worldviews; designation of "culture market values" and "culture targets" can help deliver a broad array of ecosystem services.

AB  - Over the last two decades, the international community has focused on building green institutional capacity in the Global South to foster human security across societies marked by rapid environmental change. Numerous nation-states have consequently institutionalized global models that have helped build administrative, fiscal, and regulatory capacity, as well as promote social and environmental protections. The emergence of strong (green) institutions, however, has not translated into the kind of social or environmental change expected; informal extractive activity (e.g., "illegal" mining), violent natural resource conflict, and environmental degradation remain enduring challenges. To understand why green governance reform has been unable to contribute to broader forms of human security, I analyze the process of institutional reform in the Global South, drawing specifically on minerals governance in Ghana and Sierra Leone. Building from multi-method fieldwork conducted between 2014 and 2016, I contend that a persistent focus on institutional design has obscured the ways in which green institution building reconfigures cross-scalar power relations that mediate governance-security linkages. In particular, the reform process has channeled power to transnational networks, which constitute what I call the green regulatory state, that produce and reproduce insecurity by reorienting social relations around global standards of natural resource conduct that 1) limit options for domestic political engagement and 2) exacerbate institutional pluralism and conflict. This argument challenges scholarship that perceives insecurity as a function of weak governance capacity by repositioning it as a direct consequence of the growth of green governance. This article contributes to an emerging body of work that questions the growing enthusiasm for green governance as a mechanism to mitigate conflict and improve social and environmental justice. It simultaneously posits that achieving sustainability and security within the context of the Anthropocene requires a more intensive focus on constructing inclusive - rather than strong - governance institutions.

AB  - Objectives. We described the associations of ambient air pollution exposure with race/ethnicity and racial residential segregation. Methods. We studied 5921 White, Black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults across 6 US cities between 2000 and 2002. Household-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) were estimated for 2000. Neighborhood racial composition and residential segregation were estimated using US census tract data for 2000. Results. Participants in neighborhoods with more than 60% Hispanic populations were exposed to 8% higher PM2.5 and 31% higher NOX concentrations compared with those in neighborhoods with less than 25% Hispanic populations. Participants in neighborhoods with more than 60% White populations were exposed to 5% lower PM2.5 and 18% lower NOX concentrations compared with those in neighborhoods with less than 25% of the population identifying as White. Neighborhoods with Whites underrepresented or with Hispanics overrepresented were exposed to higher PM2.5 and NOX concentrations. No differences were observed for other racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions. Living in majority White neighborhoods was associated with lower air pollution exposures, and living in majority Hispanic neighborhoods was associated with higher air pollution exposures. This new information highlighted the importance of measuring neighborhood-level segregation in the environmental justice literature.

AB  - In the face of growing calls for no-take marine protected areas (NTMPAs) and the development of a UK legal framework for them, fishing industry and related perspectives on the equity, justice and power issues raised by such designations are explored. Whilst these reveal growing concerns about the political and geographical marginalisation of the fishing industry, they also reveal a significant potential for the constructive participation of industry representatives in discussions and decisions concerning NTMPAs. These findings support the argument that this potential should be realised, as the environmental coherence of our seas need not be achieved through the social and economic isolation of our fishing industry.

AB  - In this article we sketch out a geography of hope in Palestine. We focus on hyperprecarious' sites, exactly those where exposure to harm is heightened and where thus reasons not to hope seem plentiful. Focusing on fieldwork at such sites, we examine hope as a temporal practice of waiting, attending especially to how a moment to come' (kairos) constitutes and affirms anti-colonial practices and topologies of everyday Palestinian life. Hope in the cases we discuss is not simply a positive orientation to the future, but an experience of kairo-logical time that ties hopeful waiting to topo-logical practices that disrupt the space-times of the Israeli occupation, and the horizon of hopelessness it creates for Palestinians. We propose that attending to kairos and topos can therefore reveal the ways that together they can operate as conditions of possibility, as a moment' and place', for time-spaces to come forth anew, and so as structuring conditions for everyday Palestinian hope for life that is irreducible to the systematic subjugation and violence of the occupation.

AB  - In this article we discuss the precarities induced by the threat of home demolitions in occupied Palestine. Drawing on fieldwork from four separate sites, the discussion begins by showing how the threat of demolition exposes Palestinians to a powerfully affective future of a violence that will arrive at an uncertain time. From this we develop the notion of 'affectual demolition' to describe how the anticipatory affective dimensions of demolition structure the present and the ways that precarities are embodied in Palestinian communities living under the threat of demolition. The discussion then moves on to further consider how anticipatory affects relate to different practices, including ways of acting on and against induced vulnerabilities and insecurities. We thus argue that the continued threat of home demolitions evokes precarities that are (politically) induced and (ontologically) productive and that they hold significant world-making and -annulling capacities.

AB  - On 20 September 2019 in Cape Town, as part of the global protests on inaction on climate change, the African Climate Alliance submitted a memorandum of demands to South African government representatives, one of which was 'the creation of a mandatory climate-education curriculum for South Africa'. This raises the question of how this imperative would be met within a tertiary music education context. Does the justified insistence on decolonised curricula in the period following the national #FeesMustFall protests of 2015-2016 allow space for inclusion of climate education? Given the links between social justice and environmental justice, there is certainly an argument for a focus on eco-literate education. What, then, would this include at South African tertiary music level? There are several (mostly United States based) course syllabi available online which focus mainly on themes and case studies in the field of ecomusicology. Daniel J. Shevock's work on eco-literate music pedagogy strongly advocates for a place-based approach, but Greg Garrard's critique would indicate otherwise. This article examines eco-critical and eco-literate theories and their application to music and uses the author's own teaching context to outline ideas for integrating a more climate-related educational approach.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) were introduced as integrated, multifunctional and multi-beneficial solutions to a wide array of socio-ecological challenges. Although principles for a common understanding and implementation of NBS were already developed on a landscape scale, specific principles are needed with regard to an application in urban areas. Urban areas come with particular challenges including (i) spatial conflicts with urban system nestedness, (ii) specific urban biodiversity, fragmentation and altered environments, (iii) value plurality, multi-actor interdependencies and environmental injustices, (iv) path-dependencies with cultural and planning legacies and (v) a potential misconception of cities as being artificial landscapes disconnected from nature. Given these challenges, in this perspective paper, we build upon and integrate knowledge from the most recent academic work on NBS in urban areas and introduce five distinct, integrated principles for urban NBS design, planning and implementation. Our five principles should help to transcend governance gaps and advance the scientific discourse of urban NBS towards a more effective and sustainable urban development. To contribute to resilient urban futures, the design, planning, policy and governance of NBS should (1) consider the need for a systemic understanding, (2) contribute to benefiting people and biodiversity, (3) contribute to inclusive solutions for the long-term, (4) consider context conditions and (5) foster communication and learning.

AB  - Nature-based solutions promoting green and blue urban areas have significant potential to decrease the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of cities in light of climatic change. They can thereby help to mitigate climate change-induced impacts and serve as proactive adaptation options for municipalities. We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning.

AB  - Justice is an important and contested issue in the governance of fish stocks threatened by over-exploitation. This study identifies the notions of justice held by stakeholders of the fishery in Newfoundland, Canada, using qualitative interviews, and interprets these notions in light of established justice theories. The interviews are analysed using inductive and deductive coding. A central result is that inshore fishers are seen as the main claim holders, with a claim to participate and be listened to, and the opportunity to make a living from the fishery. Moreover, rules play an important role in the justice notions of the interview partners, and their justice notions are clearly plural. The stakeholder notions of justice in the Newfoundland fishery resonate with the emphasis on recognition, participation and distribution as important aspects of justice within the environmental justice approach [59-61] (Schlosberg 2004, 2007, 2013).

AB  - Low-income urban communities, and the individuals that live within them, continue to face disproportionate interconnected social, economic, and environmental challenges related to their built, natural, and social environments. The aim of our phenomenological research study was to elevate the experiences of residents living in low-income urban neighborhoods in terms of their communities' environmental challenges. Our objectives were to (1) identify challenges across neighborhoods, (2) identify ways individuals and communities are addressing those challenges, and (3) assess the individual and collective efficacy and engagement of communities to lead environmental improvements in neighborhoods. This study brings forward the voices that are often ignored or misunderstood in these communities and uses an ecological-social perspective. We conducted focus groups (N = 68) in four low-income urban neighborhoods across two Ohio cities in the United States. Participants described five key challenges in their communities: Pollution, abandoned buildings with associated crime, low food access and health concerns, trash and illegal dumping, and lack of trees. We assessed engagement and efficacy using two frameworks focused on individual and community readiness to engage in and lead community change. Policymakers should acknowledge the valuable contributions and leadership capacity of residents in low-income communities to implement environmental initiatives.

AB  - Peri-urban and urban green are considered among the basic priorities of the local government's regional policy agenda, in line with the principles of spatial planning. This agenda is promoted at both the national and European levels through a variety of technical and institutional measures. Green spaces in urban and suburban areas are directly linked to the quality of life of urban residents and their environment. In this context, the purpose of this study is to investigate and identify the characteristics and factors that influence the residents of a small Greek city in terms of the value they attach to urban and suburban green spaces. These factors are identified through the residents' willingness to pay (WTP) using the contingent valuation method (CVM). In general, the analysis aims to document the value of environmental economic methods as a tool in the management of natural heritage. According to the research, income and knowledge of environmental issues (global and local) as well as the benefits of green spaces (urban and suburban) are the key factors that drive residents to place a higher value on them. Future work may explore whether or how the COVID-19 pandemic affected city residents' willingness to pay for green spaces.

AB  - Just transition is gaining increasing attention. The need to consider social justice in sustainability transitions is finally being acknowledged. Research on this issue has, to date, mainly concentrated on energy systems. In this paper, we examine how the elaboration of dietary transition widens the spectrum of justice questions in sustainability transitions research. We explicate the arising normative questions along the dimensions of distributive, procedural and recognitive justice; widening the considerations further to restorative and cosmopolitan justice. Dietary transition widens the justice considerations to basic needs, food security and nutrition. By doing so, it evokes socio-cultural tensions that require recognition and procedural solutions. The uneven distribution of capacities to innovate and adapt require scrutiny from the just transition scholarship. Likewise, the recognition of non-human animals and integrity of agro-ecological systems. The relational three-dimensional understanding of justice can advance inter- and transdisciplinary research across various systems.

AB  - John Rawls has never addressed natural goods as "primary goods", nor has he paid attention to environmental justice. Rather than speculating on the reasons for this omission and elaborating on a proposal for how Rawls`s approach to justice could be expanded to integrate issues of environmental justice, this paper defends another claim. It argues that John Rawls's theory of justice still provides a groundbreaking approach to environmental justice. The paper starts with challenges that this field of research presents to Rawls's theory of justice. In order to illustrate these claims, the paper includes a short sketch of climate justice as an emerging field of environmental justice. The contribution then draws attention to several of Rawls' very basic insights which are critical to the discussion of environmental justice. In particular, his insights regarding the political nature of fairness are still particularly important.

AB  - It is well known that environmental burdens are more pronounced in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, a phenomenon known as environmental injustice. Yet, there have been few studies that have addressed whether the degree of environmental injustice has changed over time. We analyze toxic releases in the United States over the first 26 years of the toxics release inventory and examine whether the decreases in toxic releases differ according to characteristics of the communities in which the emitters reside. We find that decreases over these years are universal but far more substantial in high-income areas. Our results speak to both the nascent literature on information disclosure and that on environmental justice.

AB  - Objective. To examine disparities in park availability, features, and characteristics by income and the percentage of foreign-born population within a predominately-Hispanic border community. Methods. This study occurred in 2010-2011 in El Paso, Texas. All census tracts (n = 112) were categorized as low, medium, or high income and percent foreign-born. The number of parks intersecting each tract was determined using ArcGIS and park features (facilities, amenities) and characteristics (aesthetic features, park and neighborhood quality/safety concerns) were assessed via park audits (n = 144). Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests examined differences across income and percent foreign-born tertiles for all park measures. Results. The medium income tertile had more parks than the high tertile, and more park facilities than the low or high tertiles, but no differences in park amenities were observed across income groups. As well, none of park availability, facilities, or amenities differed across percent foreign-born tertiles. Finally, parks in the high income tertile had significant fewer park and neighborhood quality/safety concerns and parks in the high percent foreign-born tertile had significantly greater park and neighborhood quality/safety concerns. Conclusion. Identifying disparities in park availability, features, and characteristics can aid policymakers and citizens in improving the contribution of parks to community health for all.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a land-use regression model for sulfur dioxide air pollution concentrations. We make use of mobile monitoring data collected in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, between 2005 and 2010 inclusive. The observed SO2 concentrations are regressed against a comprehensive set of land use and transportation variables. Land use and transportation variables are assessed as the amount of each characteristic within buffers of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 m around pollution observation locations. In the first instance of regression modeling, we apply ordinary least-squares regression. The OLS model R-2 for training data was 0.38, and an R-2 of 03 for a 50% held out cross-validation data set. The residuals are spatially correlated with the OLS model as determined with Moran's I. We thus applied a simultaneous autoregressive model, specifically the spatial error model. The resulting model slightly improved fit as determined by a pseudo R-2 = 0.4, improved log-likelihood, and reduced MSE, RMSE, and MAE. The spatial error model residuals were not spatially auto-correlated, resulting in a valid model. SAR modeling is a natural extension to OLS regression models and solves the issue of spatial autocorrelation in model residuals with a one-stage model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metropolitan planning organizations typically undertake an analysis of regional transportation plan equity to comply with federal anti-discrimination law, most prominently Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In this critical review, we examine the law, regulatory guidance, academic research, and agency practice pertinent to equity analysis. We find that recommendations are extensive but generally lack specificity and are rarely enforceable. In the absence of detailed guidance, practice has become dominated by a single method that has foundations in the spatial analysis of environmental exposures and the neighborhood effects literature. We argue that this method is not appropriate for the analysis of transportation investment benefits, in part because target populations must be defined a priori based on demographic thresholds for areal units rather than on the basis of exposure. Further, it does not represent the travel behavior of Title VI-protected populations adequately, most notably people of color. Newer travel demand modeling paradigms are capable of sidestepping methodological problems, and legacy models can be adapted and improved. However, agencies generally have not shifted from traditional methods and planners do not view race as a variable relevant to travel behavior. By relying on an analytical technique that is not likely to reflect the travel behavior of people of color, planning agencies reduce the likelihood that racially disparate outcomes will be identified and mitigated. Meaningful transportation equity analyses must include an assessment of both current and near-term conditions and provide racially specific outcomes, while seeking to mitigate inequities through programming decisions.

However, education systems lag behind, preoccupied with the "what" and "how" of climate change, rather than engaging it as a social issue in which students themselves are implicated. In this paper, we share the results of our participatory research exploration into youth and climate change through an international education project, in which 99 students from 13 countries joined virtually in a climate change learning experience, culminating in the collaborative development and presentation of a White Paper to the 2018 IPCC Cities and Climate Change Conference. Grounded in a critical global citizenship education framework, this project provides a site to explore climate change education from the perspectives of diverse youth, who inform possibilities for climate change education that addresses justice, individualisation and emotionality.

AB  - Pollen allergies are one of the most common health problems in the United States and over 20% of Americans are sensitized to the pollen produced by common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L). Despite the importance of allergenic pollen to public health, no research has linked land use and plant populations to spatial heterogeneity in airborne pollen concentrations. In order to quantify these relationships and elucidate the processes which lead to pollen exposure, we surveyed ragweed stem density in Detroit (Michigan, USA) as a function of land use. We then deployed 34 pollen collectors throughout the city and recorded ragweed cover in the immediate vicinity of each pollen collector. We found that ragweed populations were highest in vacant lots, a common land cover type in Detroit. Because ragweed population density was so strongly correlated to vacant lots, for which spatially explicit data were available, we were able to investigate whether observed ragweed pollen concentrations were a function of land use at the spatial scales of 10 m and I km. Both relationships were significant, and the combination of these two variables predicts a large portion of airborne ragweed pollen concentrations (R-2 = 0.48). These results emphasize the important role of pollen production within the urban environment and show that management of allergenic pollen producing plants must be considered at multiple spatial scales. Our findings also demonstrate that there is too much spatial heterogeneity for a pollen collector at any given site to portray the allergenic pollen load experienced by different individuals within the same city. Finally, we discuss how spatial correlations between socio-economic status, vacant lots, and ragweed could help to explain the disproportionate amount of allergies and ragweed sensitization experienced bylaw income and minority populations in Detroit.

AB  - In this conceptual paper, we draw upon the insights of Feminist Science Studies, in particular Karen Barad's concept of agential realism, as a critical analytical tool to re-think nature and culture binaries in dominant science knowledge-making practices and explanatory accounts, and their possible implications for science education in the context of socio-spatial and environmental injustices. Barad's framework proposes a relational and more expansive approach to justice, which takes into account consequential effects of nature-culture practices on humans, non-humans, and more than human vitalities. In efforts to understand potentialities of Barad's theory of agential realism, we situate our argument in the story of local children who encounter a bottle of cyanide in a former manufacturing building. The story takes place in a post-industrial urban city located in the U.S., caught up in an inverse relationship between the technological and scientific advances observed globally and the deteriorating environmental and living conditions experienced locally as the result of erstwhile industrial activity. Based on agential realist readings of the story and taking into consideration children's developing subjectivities, we argue that equity-oriented scholarship in science education might not be able to achieve justice devoid of understanding of the relatedness to plurality of life forms. We invite our readers to consider (re)configuring socio-spatial and environmental issues as an ethical response-ability that is constituted through relationships of care, recognition, openness, and responsiveness to vitalities of humans and nonhumans equally, one which cannot be conceptualized from a priori and distant calculations, but rather continuous entangled relations.

AB  - One of the most important public health issues of the new century is food justice, which is a special case of environmental justice, food access and health equity. Food justice encompasses a range of issues from assuring the production and distribution of healthy food in ways that promote local consumption and protect natural resources and human labor. Further, it also is concerned with community self-determination in food access and honors cultural sensitivity and cultural renewal in terms of how food is made available, and which food products are offered. Food justice goes beyond food security to address health equity in that available foods meet current dietary guidelines and foster healthy eating over the life span. Given the persistence of health inequities and the national and global obesity epidemic, this concept has emerged as highly salient for community health improvement, particularly in underserved, minority communities. This chapter will review the science and practice of community-based action to promote food justice, while examining the relationship between food justice and health equity. Two case studies will illustrate community-based responses to food justice, and highlight the social change processes therein. Discussion will show the relevance of food justice work to community-based health promotion initiatives. The chapter concludes with implications for building healthier communities and utilizing knowledge from food justice efforts, noting potential contributions from public health social scientists.

AB  - In this article, I examine how hydropower projects in Mapuche territory both form part of internationally recognized approaches to develop renewable energy and also anchor colonial relations in rivers. In pursuit of energy development, water and ancestral cultural practices of the Mapuche Pueblo are being seized by a nexus of state laws and informal practices of private sector actors. Concurrently, Mapuche people assert their jurisdictions and experience resurgence of Indigenous lifeways through defending their waterways. Drawing on collaborative research guided by the Alianza Territorial Puelwillimapu, a Mapuche-Williche alliance convoked by ancestral leaders, I provide a methodological contribution to legal geography's analysis of Indigenous rights. Bringing a legal geography approach to dispossession, I explain how collaborative mapmaking and systematizing the "layers of dispossession" provides a methodological approach to consider structural limitations to environmental justice on Indigenous lands. Overall, this case contributes to how we conceive of spatial justice in legal geography and in renewable energy development.

AB  - Mapping the media frames that have both triggered and articulated the mobilisation around air pollution in London in the period 1997-2017, this paper shows how especially those events that have been framed in agonistic terms have led to a rise of media engagement with the topic. From the controversy around Sahara dust as a so-called 'natural' explanation for smog episodes, to the staging of Oxford Street as the most polluted street of the world, from Sadiq Khan's decision to join ClientEarth in its court case against the UK government to the debate on a new runway for Heathrow, from the Volkswagen scandal to the Black Lives Matter blockade of London City Airport: the discursive construction of us/them divides has been crucial in sparking passion, contestation and debate. Empirically, the paper starts from a detailed study of 1594 newspaper articles that appeared on air pollution in five British newspapers, The Guardian, Financial Times, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph and The Times, between January 1997 and March 2017. Theoretically, it combines Chantal Mouffe's political theory with Anabela Carvalho's media theory, in particular her diachronic model of circuits of culture. On this basis, the paper distinguishes five critical discourse periods and shows how a number of critical discourse moments, exactly because of their agonising dimension, have been able to spike media attention and shift the terms of the debate. Starting from this observation, the paper argues that media processes should not only be understood in cyclic terms, but can also trigger non-linear iterative dynamics, leading to upward spirals characterised by thresholds and a gradually increasing level of interest overall, in this case raising the profile of London's poor air.

AB  - Land cover and land use changes can substantially alter hydrologic ecosystem services. Water availability and quality can change with modifications to the type or amount of surface vegetation, the permeability of soil and other surfaces, and the introduction of contaminants through human activities. Efforts to understand and predict the effects of land use decisions on hydrologic services-and to use this information in decision making-are challenged by the complexities of ecosystem functioning and by the need to translate scientific information into a form that decision makers can use. Hydrologic modeling coupled with scenario analysis can (1) elucidate hydrologic responses to anticipated changes in land use and (2) improve the utility of scientific information for decision making in a manner that facilitates stakeholder involvement. Using a combination of general concepts and concrete examples, this paper summarizes hydrologic consequences of land use changes and describes the use of modeling and scenario analysis to inform decision making. Two case studies integrate the concepts raised in the paper and illustrate how an approach employing modeling and scenario analysis offers a potentially powerful way to link research on hydrologic services with decision making.

AB  - In religious ethics, Earth stewardship (ES) relates to the care for creation and climate justice. This chapter analyses as a case study the work done by the World Council of Churches over the last decades on environment and climate change and relates it to other faith initiatives. It takes into account the two different stories of creation in the Bible and their consequences in Christian thought. Listening both to the cry of the Earth and the cry of vulnerable people and trying to respond to them, constitute the rationale for developing actions addressed to individuals as well as to institutions at national and international levels. Ethical and spiritual values are presented as countercultural attitudes to confront the present development paradigm which destroys peoples and Earth.

AB  - Numerous environmental justice studies have confirmed a relationship between population characteristics such as low-income or minority status and the location of environmental health hazards. However, studies of the health risks from exposure to harmful substances often do not consider their toxicological characteristics. We used two different methods, the unit-hazard and the distance-based approach, to evaluate demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the population residing near industrial facilities in the City of Toronto, Canada. In addition to the mass of air emissions obtained from the national pollutant release inventory (NPRI), we also considered their toxicity using toxic equivalency potential (TEP) scores. Results from the unit-hazard approach indicate no significant difference in the proportion of low-income individuals living in host versus non-host census tracts (t(107) = 0.3, P = 0.735). However, using the distance-based approach, the proportion of low-income individuals was significantly higher (+5.1%, t(522) = 6.0, P <0.001) in host tracts, while the indicator for "racialized" communities ("visible minority") was 16.1% greater (t(521) = 7.2, P <0.001) within 2 km of a NPRI facility. When the most toxic facilities by non-carcinogenic TEP score were selected, the rate of visible minorities living near the most toxic NPRI facilities was significantly higher (+12.9%, t(352) = 3.5, P = 0.001) than near all other NPRI facilities. TEP scores were also used to identify areas in Toronto that face a double burden of poverty and air toxics exposure in order to prioritise pollution prevention.

AB  - Many researches have highlighted the importance of environmental justice, where healthy environment is a right to all. Currently, the most vulnerable groups to climate change are low-income urban dwellers, typically residing in urban informalities within cities of the Global South. In Cairo, the awareness about climate change and responsive consumption is minimal and the increase in temperature could have serious effects on residents' health. In 2012, informalities were reported to house two thirds of the population and covered a third of the city's footprint. Thus, this paper highlights the importance of studying environmental performance in informal areas to achieve sustainability and reduce risks. It reviews work related to sustainable urbanization, informal areas, urban heat island and urban climate especially in Cairo. It defines needed parameters and develops an integrated tool to assess comfort in outdoor spaces microclimate. The paper relies on extensive fieldwork, meteorological measurements, socio-environmental surveys, activity mapping and modelling to study both Cairo urban climate and microclimate in one of Cairo's densest informal districts. The paper stresses the possibility of introducing responsive low-tech and low-cost strategies and interventions. This is discussed as an inherent right to marginalized areas and a necessity within a continuous process of urbanization.

AB  - Large hydropower projects are commonly correlated with negative environmental effects, negative social consequences and inequalities. This study examines the negative social ramification that can be mitigated by careful planning of large hydropower projects, which involves incorporating ideas from theories of environmental justice and evaluating its relationship with social sustainability. A conceptual framework was designed based on the theory of environmental justice, and the findings were interpreted by a statistical hypothesis test from 235 sample questionnaires. The results of this study demonstrate that Environmental Justice and Social Sustainability have a positive relationship. The conceptual framework was tested on the residents being displaced in Nepal by the largest hydropower project. The model tests the social sustainability on the four different aspects of Environmental Justice; Substantive Justice, Procedural Justice, Distributive Justice, and Recognition Justice. The research concludes, the mitigation strategies taken by the Nepalese government in the construction of Nepal's biggest hydropower project, `Budi Gandaki Hydropower' to meet the social sustainable aspect of development to be satisfactory.

AB  - In this study, we explore cumulative exposure, climate justice, and flood risk with specific reference to community resilience, vulnerability, and social justice characteristics at the county-level within the U.S. Mississippi River basin from 1990 to 2009. Using a basic conceptual model of spatial resilience to climate risks, temporal lag effect of community capacity, urban and rural spatial classification, integrative cumulative exposure, and spatial clustering of risk, we examine spatial climate risk outcomes and the role of community resilience in reducing such risks. Our approach accounted for local social, economic, environmental, regulatory policy, and planning mitigation contexts. Results suggest that community social and ecological characteristics were influenced by flood losses and that social capital and climate justice characteristics combined with local proactive planning and policy measures lead to lower disaster losses and enhanced community resilience.

AB  - In this study, we examine how climatic heat stress can be mediated by green infrastructure outcomes and how energy justice effort contributes to health adaptation within the U.S. Great Lakes regions and their primary metropolitan areas over a recent 10-year period (2005-2015). Through the lens of policy innovation and the vulnerability-readiness nexus, we explore how climate policy intervention contributes to the mitigation of heat stress by using a quantitative approach. Empirical results suggest that green infrastructure outcomes and energy justice efforts have the potential to mitigate heat stress and enhance health adaptation. Additional results reflect that climate policy innovation and readiness efforts were viable factors in health adaptation to heat events.

AB  - Most epidemiological studies on the adverse effects of air pollution on health have focused on scientific measurements of air quality provided by monitoring stations. However, many studies have indicated that self-reported health status, such as disease severity and depressive symptoms, are associated with perceived air pollution rather than measured air pollution. The main goal of this study was to investigate social factors that may affect perceived local air quality using a multilevel analysis among a Korean population. We used the Seoul Citizens Health Indicator Survey (SCHIS III) and five air pollutants. The total study population was 16,041. We considered individual-level and community-level variables that may affect perceived air quality, such as the percentage of college-educated individuals aged >20 years, satisfaction with public transportation, and the percentage of individuals below the poverty line. Measured air quality showed a negative or neutral relationship with perceived air quality. We found that the degree of perceived air pollution was associated with younger age (20-34 years; OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.18-1.65), married and divorced/separated/widowed people, a higher level of education (>17 years; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.30-2.15), and lower household income. Communities that were more economically deprived were associated with poor perceived air quality. Differences in individual and community characteristics affected perceived air quality. Perception is a key factor influencing the public acceptance of environmental policy. This study may help policymakers understand the social distribution of environmental awareness.

AB  - Objective In the environmental justice literature, uncertainty exists about the underlying causes of environmental risk disparities, especially as they relate to residential choices. To simplify, the two dominant views are racism/discrimination versus inevitable market dynamics. In this article, we move aside from these to examine the potential role of various residential choice constraints on environmental injustice and how they may be interrelated. Methods Using an agent-based simulation model, we examine the interaction of race-based constraints with other experimental conditions that can affect minorities' residential choice sets. Results Simulation experiments demonstrate that if the minority holds relatively lower similarity preferences, the environmental quality gap declines when other conditions are held constant. However, racial parity in communities also decreases the environmental quality gap, as do slower population growth and larger geographies. Conclusion These results enable us to look at the problem of race-based environmental injustice more holistically, and begin to think about holistic solutions that may finally address what has heretofore been an intractable social problem.

AB  - Over two decades have passed since the federal policy on environmental justice (EO 12898) was issued. However, empirical evidence indicates that injustice persists and that US states vary in their adoption of the terms of the environmental justice (EJ) policy. Moreover, studies of the explanations for the variation in states' adoption of EJ policy are rare and have yielded puzzling findings-e.g., environmental interest groups are not associated with states' EJ policy adoption, or the severity of problems is associated inversely with their adoption. We examined the progress and variation in states' EJ policy adoption as of 2005 using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Our analysis showed first that a strong environmental interest group presence, combined with high racial diversity and low problem severity, is sufficient for a high level of EJ policy adoption, especially in Western states. Second, when environmental interest group presence is weak, if it is combined, again, with high racial diversity and the presence of a more liberal state government, a high level of EJ policy adoption also occurs. This is observed in the East coast, Midwestern, and Southern regions of the USA. Environmental politics and policy research can benefit from a configurational approach, especially when there is no guiding theory on the conjunctional effects of key factors.

Drawing from posthumanist scholarship, as well as literature on urban political ecology, urban greening, gentrification and "just green enough," this article argues that to understand green amenities not only as sites of injustice, but rather as dynamic sites of injustice and resistance, requires disaggregating amenities from traditional conceptions of green gentrification. In doing so, it is possible to analyze the complex agencies of greenspace itself as connected to pluralized forms of (in)justice associated with race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class. To illustrate this, I use a more-than-human framework to reconceptualize three existing "just green enough" case studies of (1) riverfront development, (2) urban linear parks, and (3) community gardens to show how injustice and resistance are not only broad-based, but unique to amenity and place. The aim of this review is to offer new ways of understanding and analyzing the dialectic of injustice and resistance associated with green gentrification.

AB  - In this paper, I use an interaction between environmental justice activists, local city officials, and representatives of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the role of place-based identities in intersectional politics of belonging for environmental justice activists. I analyze a conversation around the wordwethat occurred during a Collaborative Problem Solving workshop run by EPA Region 4 to explore how mundane, everyday practices of politics of belonging impact environmental justice activists' abilities to achieve their self-defined goal. I examine how activists and city officials used the termwe, colloquially a term of inclusion, as a political tool. The term was simultaneously used to make distinctions about who did and did not belong and to eliminate differences by homogenizing the broaderwe. For environmental justice activists, the workshop brought to the forefront the influence of geography on intersectional positionalities. While discussions and lack of specification ofwemay seem benign, in practice, they define belonging and exclusion, reinforcing existing power structures that perpetuate environmental injustices. From a theoretical perspective, I highlight the importance of place as an intersectional axis of difference for critical environmental justice scholars. In conclusion, I reflect on how intersectionality can be used to rethink conceptions ofwein micro-scalar politics of belonging for environmental justice activists.

AB  - In Germany the impact of socioeconomic factors on environmental exposures and adverse housing conditions has been rarely studied up to now. The aim of our study was to assess whether and, if yes, how perceived exposure to noise and air pollution is influenced by socioeconomic status in Germany. We used data from a large-scale population-based survey. In this survey, data on perceived exposure to noise and air pollution and on socioeconomic status and housing conditions were collected on an individual basis. The study population consisted of 7275 adults aged 17-98 years (40% women), each representing the head of one household. For the association between perceived environmental exposure and social factors confounder-adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by binary or ordinal logistic regression. In bivariate analyses subjects with non-German nationality, East Germans, respondents with low income, those with lower educational and occupational status, and subjects living in adverse housing conditions were more likely to report being highly exposed. In multivariate analyses high perceived exposure to noise was associated with low household income (OR 1.52 [95% CI 1.13-2.05] lowest versus highest income group). Perceived air pollution exposure was also related to household income (1.67 [1.14-2.44] lower middle versus highest income group). Further associated variables were need for renovation of the house, type of house, and type of neighborhood. This study shows that in Germany, as in other industrial countries, environmental exposures are distributed unequally and that especially economic differences play important roles.

AB  - In historical terms, international justice developed in three principal forms: (1) universal international judicial bodies, which function on a permanent basis; (2) ad hoc international tribunals for settlement of defined categories of international disputes; and (3) judicial mechanisms and procedures for settlement of disputes under a certain convention or agreement. For the settlement of environmental disputes, the parties have traditionally used one of these forms of international justice, depending on the facts and the wishes of the parties. However, for certain states, use of the above forms for the settlement of environmental disputes can appear inconvenient or undesirable. As a result, in recent years an independent international justice system designed for the settlement of environmental disputes has started to develop. The International Court of Environmental Arbitration and Conciliation, set up in 1994, can serve as an example.

AB  - Objective. This article examines claims made by environmental justice advocates that government inequitably enforces environmental laws. Methods. We test for race- and class-based disparities in the regulatory enforcement of the U.S. Clean Water Act from 2000-2005. We estimate pooled logistic regression models, and the analysis is conducted at the facility-level using an areal apportionment methodology to measure the composition of populations living near facilities. Results. We find evidence of modest race- and class-based disparities in both government inspections and punitive actions taken in response to noncompliant behavior, although the pattern of these disparities depends on model specification. Conclusions. Our findings provide some evidence of disparities in government enforcement of the federal Clean Water Act, lending support to the general claims made by environmental justice advocates.

AB  - Noise pollution has been recognized as one of major threats to the health of urban residents. Increasing green space availability can create a natural buffer to the adverse effects of living in an urban environment. These positive effects of urban green space can be directly related to an objective reduction of noise levels and indirectly - to the subjective perception of noise exposure. In our study carried out in Lodz, Poland, we explored the relationship between objective noise levels and the subjective perception of noise exposure by urban residents in relation to urban green space availability. We refer to objective noise exposure expressed as GIS modelled L-den derived from noise maps (compliant with the Environmental Noise Directive, 2002/49/EC), and subjective (self-reported) perception of noise exposure as declared in a questionnaire-based survey. We compared the percentage of green space in a buffer, the objectively measured noise level, and the perceived exposure to noise to find the most appropriate radius of the green space buffer. We decided to choose the green space coverage which is not correlated with an objective noise level to avoid potential multicollinearity in regression models. This contrasts with most studies, in which the radius of the buffer is set a priori. We thus compared the selected buffer of green space coverage - 300 m (representing green space availability) - with perceived noise exposure. We used the spatial error probit model to differentiate the impacts of objective and subjective noise indicators, at the same time including also the factor of green space availability. We found out that the direct effect of objectively measured noise levels, education, the presence of noisy neighbours, and building characteristics were the most important variables influencing the self-reported perception of noise by urban residents. The indirect effect of green space availability on noise perception was not strong, yet statistically significant. Although our study does not provide clear-cut evidence, it indicates that the indirect, psychological effects of urban green spaces can positively affect the life satisfaction of urban residents.

AB  - Low-carbon transitions in industrialised societies will have significant social, economic and environmental impacts, raising concerns of justice. Calls for urgent transitions evoke a question about the roles of different actors in advancing transitions and ensuring they are just. While the responsibilities for emission mitigation have been long discussed, responsibilities for making a just transition have not. The question about responsibilities is particularly pressing because of the diverse constellation of actors involved in climate action, including diverse forms of non-state actors from city-level and business alliances to grassroots activists. We examine the responsibilities of state and non-state actors in the decarbonisation process, asking: what role do different actors play regarding the justice impacts of climate action? We combine sustainability transition studies and political philosophy on roles and responsibilities to create a role-based framework for just transition-related responsibilities of different actors at different spatial scales.

AB  - Mitigating and adapting to climate change requires foundational changes in societies, politics, and economies. Greater effectiveness has been attributed to actions in the public sphere than to the actions of individuals. However, little is known about how climate literacy programs address the political aspects of mitigation and adaptation. The aim of this systematic literature review is to fill this gap and analyze how public-sphere actions on mitigation and adaptation are discussed in climate literacy programs in schools. Based on database searches following PRISMA guidelines we identified 75 empirical studies that met our inclusion criteria. We found that central aspects of climate policy such as the 1.5-degree limit, the IPCC reports, or climate justice are rarely addressed. Whilst responsibility for emissions is attributed to the public sphere, the debate about mitigation usually focuses on the private sphere. Climate change education does not, therefore, correspond to the climate research discourse. We show that effective mitigation and adaptation are based on public-sphere actions and thus conclude that effective climate education should discuss those public actions if it is to be effective. Hence, we propose that climate education should incorporate political literacy to educate climate-literate citizens.

AB  - Objectives. The Community Action to Fight Asthma Initiative, a network of coalitions and technical assistance providers in California, employed an environmental justice approach to reduce risk factors for asthma in school-aged children. Policy advocacy focused on housing, schools, and outdoor air quality. Technical assistance partners from environmental science, policy advocacy, asthma prevention, and media assisted in advocacy. An evaluation team assessed progress and outcomes. Methods. A theory of change and corresponding logic model were used to document coalition development and successes. Site visits, surveys, policy-maker interviews, and participation in meetings documented the processes and outcomes. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to assess strategies, successes, and challenges. Results. Coalitions, working with community residents and technical assistance experts, successfully advocated for policies to reduce children's exposures to environmental triggers, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. Policies were implemented at various levels. Conclusions. Environmental justice approaches to policy advocacy could be an effective strategy to address inequities across communities. Strong technical assistance, close community involvement, and multilevel strategies were all essential to effective policies to reduce environmental inequities.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how 'peak oil' anxieties are woven into the spaces and practices of the state in Norway and the consequences of this for environmental justice and the public sphere more widely. We focus in particular on an ongoing struggle over access to hydrocarbon deposits in the Norwegian Arctic, the so-called 'Battle of the North'. We use this dispute to highlight three wider theoretical points regarding (i) the continuing relevance of the state in the governing of nature-society relations, (ii) the increasingly fragmented and fluid nature of state space, and (iii) the significance of 'security' as a term around which social, economic and environmental tensions pivot. The paper concludes by reflecting on current efforts to prevent new oil activities in the north of Norway. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-state actors are increasingly participating in international climate diplomacy. The tactics employed by diverse civil society agents to influence climate policymaking are radicalizing through the adoption of more confrontational language. Activist groups have been seeking opportunities to influence policymakers regarding the rules related to transparency, public participation and accountability in the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). By scrutinizing efforts of three environmental NGOs (ENGOs) - Climate Action Network, Center for International Environmental Law and Carbon Market Watch - the analysis concentrates on what tactical shifts have occurred in the framing positions and approaches of these activists during the 1997-2015 period. After several years of legal advocacy, expertise and/or critique in an effort to reform input legitimacy of CDM governance, the selected ENGOs have recently drifted away from narratives of green governmentality and ecological modernization and, instead, radicalized their rhetorical tactics by turning to a human rights perspective under the umbrella of climate justice.

AB  - Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Pesticide use data are available for California from the Pesticide Use Report (PUR), but household- and individual-level exposure factors have not been fully characterized to support its refinement as an exposure assessment tool. Unique exposure pathways, such as proximity to agricultural operations and direct occupational contact, further complicate pesticide exposure assessment among agricultural communities. We sought to identify influencing factors of pesticide exposure to support future exposure assessment and epidemiological studies. Household dust samples were collected from 28 homes in four California agricultural communities during January and June 2019 and were analyzed for the presence of OPs. Factors influencing household OPs were identified by a data-driven model via best subsets regression. Key factors that impacted dust OP levels included household cooling strategies, secondary occupational exposure to pesticides, and geographic location by community. Although PUR data demonstrate seasonal trends in pesticide application, this study did not identify season as an important factor, suggesting OP persistence in the home. These results will help refine pesticide exposure assessment for future studies and highlight important gaps in the literature, such as our understanding of pesticide degradation in an indoor environment.

AB  - Landslides have caused substantial economic loss, infrastructural damage, and threatened lives and human shelter in Western Area, Sierra Leone (Africa), requiring effective mitigations. Landslide susceptibility (LS) mapping is one effective and foremost step in reducing landslide disaster as it provides vital information to the local authority for land use planning and management in the future. A set of controlling factors and landslide inventory (LI) are typically used to generate LS. Thus, the LS accuracy can be affected by the LI availability and its source and timespan. Here, the impact of LI from two sources and timespans on the accuracy of LS is analyzed. The LIs are the archived inventory (archived-LI) and small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometry inventory (SBAS-LI). The former LI consisted of landslide events from 1945 to 2014. The latter was acquired by analyzing the ground deformation with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR datasets and covered between 2015 and 2017. Eleven landslide controlling factors after multicollinearity diagnostics were selected. With the controlling factors in a GIS-based environment, the frequency ratio (FR) model is applied to both LIs and the factors, generating two LS maps. Each map accuracy was validated using recent landslides from 2017 to 2020. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.739 and 0.898 for the LS from the archived-LI and SBAS-LI, respectively. The degree-of-fit index of 61.7% for the LS from the archived-LI and 80.8% from the SBAS-LI was obtained. The SBAS-LI produced more reflective present LS and possibly for future susceptibility even though the number of events in the modeling was about one-third of that in the archived-LI. Thus, the current LI is preferred for LS analysis.

AB  - Many scholars have examined the implications and effects of a putative dichotomy between public-as-masculine and private-as-feminine spheres on community activism, and suggest that women's community activism blurs this ideological divide in numerous ways. This article draws on a case study of a siting conflict in St. James Parish, Louisiana, to examine how in the process of blurring boundaries between gendered spheres of interest and activity, predominantly women environmental justice activists contended with differently gendered contexts. Concepts of performance and performativity shed light on how gendered hierarchies of public and private sphere activism both constrained and enabled the protest group's political practice.

AB  - Motivation As governments move in earnest toward a green economy, few countries are considering education policy that can facilitate the development of green skills for such transitions. Where policy discussions are happening, green skills are often conflated with science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) skills, with little attention to the breadth of green skills needed to achieve climate justice. Purpose We present a green skills framework to help support policy stakeholders imagine a continuum of green skills for a just transition. Methods and approach This article applies a critical feminist lens to understand how green skills have been conceptualized across the gender and adolescence, greening and sustainability, and education fields. It also integrates the perspectives of stakeholders from climate, education, and gender-focused multilateral, government, and non-governmental organizations working on green skills. Findings The analysis finds that green skills coalesce around three distinct but overlapping paradigms. The first understands green skills through a technical lens as the specific capacities needed for green jobs. The second and third paradigms understand green skills through a sociological lens, seeking to tackle the behaviours and social structures driving the climate crisis. As such, they centre on cross-cutting generic capacities and transformative capacities, respectively. Taken together, the article offers a new definition of green skills for policy stakeholders. Policy implications The three approaches to green skills outlined in this paper constitute the pillars of a new green learning agenda for climate action, climate empowerment, and climate justice. This green learning agenda fills a significant void in both climate policy and education policy, and could help governments address current capacity building needs while setting their populations up for the long-term social transformations required to achieve a just transition.

AB  - Nuclear hazards, linked to both U.S. weapons programs and civilian nuclear power, pose substantial environment justice issues. Nuclear power plant (NPP) reactors produce low-level ionizing radiation, high level nuclear waste, and are subject to catastrophic contamination events. Justice concerns include plant locations and the large potentially exposed populations, as well as issues in siting, nuclear safety, and barriers to public participation. Other justice issues relate to extensive contamination in the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, and the mining and processing industries that have supported it. To approach the topic, first we discuss distributional justice issues of NPP sites in the U.S. and related procedural injustices in siting, operation, and emergency preparedness. Then we discuss justice concerns involving the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and the ways that uranium mining, processing, and weapons development have affected those living downwind, including a substantial American Indian population. Next we examine the problem of high-level nuclear waste and the risk implications of the lack of secure long-term storage. The handling and deposition of toxic nuclear wastes pose new transgenerational justice issues of unprecedented duration, in comparison to any other industry. Finally, we discuss the persistent risks of nuclear technologies and renewable energy alternatives.

Lead, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil and house dust in the communities surrounding the Sydney, Nova Scotia, tarponds. Environ Health Perspect 2004; 112:35-41.]. In this paper we further the research by documenting and developing community knowledge with a study of resident's observations and experiences of the industrial contamination. We conducted two surveys, a quantitative door-to-door survey and qualitative dust interview, designed to complement each other and bring together the observations and experiences in the different communities to develop the local knowledge. The combined methodology uses techniques from both social and physical science, and was developed with the cooperation of community members. The research supports the proposition that local knowledge adds contextual meaning that complements the physical measurement of environmental contaminants, in order to understand the complex environment in which people live, and the multiple exposure pathways through which they can be affected. Residents in all three communities provided vivid observations and detailed experiences of the industrial pollution in their community and homes. The local knowledge is consistent with our physical data and review of the historical scientific research in Sydney, and supports the inference that the community was adversely impacted by the coke and steel facility. From a justice perspective, the three communities should be equally considered for remediation as part of the 'tar pond remediation policy' rather than the current policy of including only a few streets and houses.

AB  - In this paper we develop an ethical perspective for public and environmental health practice in consideration of the "right to know" by contrasting consequential and deontological perspectives with relational ethics grounded in the concept of fostering autonomy. From the consequential perspective, disclosure of public and environmental health risks to the public depends on the expected or possible consequences. We discuss three major concerns with this perspective: respect for persons, justice, and ignorance. From a deontological perspective, the "right to know" means that there is a "duty" to communicate about all public health risks and consideration of the principles of prevention, precaution, and environmental justice. Relational ethics develops from consideration of a mutual limitation of the traditional perspectives. Relational ethics is grounded in the relationship between the public and public/environmental health providers. In this paper we develop a model for this relationship, which we call "fostering autonomy through mutually respectful relationships." Fostering autonomy is both an end in public health practice and a means to promote the principles of prevention, precaution, and environmental justice. We discuss these principles as they relate to practical issues of major disasters and contaminants in food, such as DDT, toxaphene, chlordane, and mercury.

AB  - In a rising urban age planning for cities around the globe is increasingly based on assessments of ecosystem services, making enhanced considerations of ecosystem service justice critically important. Yet, justice remains a 'blind spot' in urban ecosystem service models and research, which can be traced back to the ecological and economic legacies of the concept itself. This legacy reproduces the normative focus on natural capital as a guarantee of sustaining ecosystem services, enforces a static understanding of nature that insufficiently considers human agency, and conceptualizes ecosystem service flows from nature to humans in a way that does not reflect the social-ecological structure and constantly shifting priorities of the urban realm. In response, this conceptual paper aims at broadening the analytical foundation for justice in urban ecosystem service assessments by presenting a model that links the co-production of urban ecosystem services (including infrastructure, institutions, and perceptions) with established lines of recognition, procedural, and distributional justice. It further highlights the need to embed these classical dimensions of justice within both spatial (downscaled and inter-scalar approaches) and temporal (interrelated past, present, and future conditions) justice frames. Relying on urban environmental, social, spatial and temporal justice theory as well ecosystem service scholarship, we outline theoretical entry points and provide practical examples for weaving notions of justice into urban ecosystem service research and practice, while highlighting future research needs.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the concept of Nannagogy, an innovative pedagogy of informal adult learning enacted by the activist `disorganisation, the Knitting Nannas Against Gas and Greed (KNAGs). The Arannas' are predominantly older women who undertake non-violent direct action using fibre craft, knit-ins, lock-ons, and occasional street theatre to draw public attention to the negative environmental impacts of unconventional coal seam gas extraction ('fracking') and of fossil fuel mining. We identify the characteristics of Nannagogy as a hybrid system of lifelong / later-in-life learning and a complex pedagogy of informal learning that can be understood through social movement learning theory (SML) drawing on Paolo Freire's (1970) original concept of `conscientisation'. Nannagogy is an act of radical adult education that has its antecedents in feminist collective learning strategies such as consciousness raising as well as the formal education strategies of action learning and communities of practice. Nannagogy is highly effective adult learning practice at the intersection of adult learning theory and social movement theory. Data presented in this paper were collected with active KNAG members in Australia as part of a PhD study using surveys, interviews, document analysis of social media (Facebook posts, digital videos, e-news bulletins) and researcher autoethnography. Framing activist adult learning as social movement learning locates environmental and climate justice struggles within lifelong learning practices and enables researchers to better understand the complex processes of informal, situated and often spontaneous adult learning for creating and sustaining movements for social, environmental and political change.

AB  - National climate change policy currently operates on a continuum from the local community to the supra-national level. These initiatives include local deliberative processes of low-carbon futures as well as local-global interactions in 'eco-innovation jam' dialogues carried out in a virtual space, but founded on communicating with local stakeholder groups. Experiences from national processes and international examples of these structured dialogues of community engagement raise important questions of environmental justice and deliberative processes that facilitate participation by some groups, but perhaps also neglect others. This is particularly relevant since the environmental justice discourse traditionally frames environmental concerns in a place-bound manner that includes local responses to environmental questions. In this paper we argue the importance of local and global forums and deliberative processes for community engagement in order to incorporate stakeholders' perceptions of future options for low-carbon living, travelling and consuming services and products. Important policy transformations in planning for low-carbon societies are outlined and results from cases are discussed. We conclude with three remarks about the importance of citizen participation for understanding local conditions for change, processes of localized internationalization, and new roles for nation states facing the climate change challenge. We also recognise the importance of the local and global level of deliberative processes targeting sustainable urban futures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modelling walking distance enables the observation of non-linearities in hedonic property pricing of accessibility to greenspace. We test a penalized spline spatial error model (PS-SEM), which has two distinctive features. First, the PS-SEM controls for the presence of a spatially autocorrelated error term. Second, the PS-SEM allows for continuous non-linear distance decay of the property price premium as a function of walking distance to greenspaces. As a result, compared with traditional spatial econometric methods, the PS-SEM has the advantage that data determines the functional form of the distance decay of the implicit price for greenspace accessibility. Our PS-SEM results from Oslo, Norway, suggest that the implicit price for greenspace access is highly non-linear in walking distance, with the functional form varying for different types of greenspaces. Our results caution against using simple linear distances and assumptions of log or stepwise buffer-based distance decay in property prices relative to pedestrian network distance to urban amenities. The observed heterogeneity in the implicit property prices for walking distance to greenspace also provides a general caution against using non-spatial hedonic pricing models when aggregating values of greenspace amenities for policy analysis or urban ecosystem accounting purposes.

AB  - Latin America exhibits one of the highest rates of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) loss worldwide along with a remarkable asymmetry in the access to ES benefits (ecosystem services inequality, ESI hereafter). The objective of this manuscript is to propose and validate a conceptual model to understand the links between ESI and ecosystem services supply. First, previous ES frameworks were expanded to acknowledge the role of the unequal access to ES on socio-ecological system dynamics. Second an ESI conceptual model was posed to testing feed-back mechanisms between ESI and natural capital. Finally, independent information and expert opinions on ten case studies of five Latin American countries were used to quali-quantitatively validate the ESI model. The most rated ESI impacts were landscape and seascape transformations driven by the markets, overuse of natural capital, ecosystems degradation, and biodiversity loss. This study highlights that ESI may enhance the vulnerability of the socio-ecological systems, describing a self-reinforcing mechanism that differentially affects the well-being of the most economically disadvantaged beneficiaries (ESI traps). However, while the occurrence of ESI traps was inferred for half of the examined cases, remaining cases suggest that potential ESI traps did not operate, or that they were dampened by governance mechanisms.

AB  - Life in the Pacific is characterised by interconnected, fast and slow socio-ecological change. These changes inevitably involve navigating questions of justice, as they shift who benefits from, owns, and governs resources, and whose claims and rights are recognized. Thus, greater understanding of perceptions of environmental justice within communities will be crucial to support fair adaptation. We contend that an environmental justice approach offers a theoretical foundation to help illuminate key concerns and trade-offs as communities navigate global change. Here, we apply an empirical environmental justice lens to the use and customary management of coastal resources in Papua New Guinea. Through two case studies, we examine perceptions of distributional, procedural and recognitional justice. We find similarities and differences. There were common concerns about the injustice of unequal fishing pressure and destructive methods, but in one case, concerns about people's material needs overrode concerns about non-compliance and unequal costs. In the other case, deliberative decision-making served as a platform for not only negotiating and re-defining the distribution of costs and benefits, but also airing grievances, thereby strengthening recognition of different people's values and concerns. In addition, we find that recognitional aspects of justice, such as respect, can confer or undermine the legitimacy of procedures for governing resources and thus making fair decisions about distribution. The heterogeneity of justice criteria in our cases emphasizes the need to elicit and understand plural justice perceptions in different contexts.

AB  - In this paper we overcome limitations of extant models of long-term social evolution by developing a formal theory that explains the emergence of environmental injustices and movements for environmental protection by incorporating the concept of ecological value, a value derived from the supply and quality of ecological services demanded by a society or group(s) within a society. The theory explains how intra- and inter-societal imbalances of political and/or economic power are harnessed to capture distant ecological value in response to selection pressures resulting from reductions in the local level and/or quality of ecological services and in response to the growth of environmental concern. Opposing the continued capture are the same forces that generate it ecological degradation and ecological concern the dynamics of which shift along with the scale; as the forces move from the local to the global they lead to a bifurcation point at which either solutions for ecological sustainability are implemented or failure occurs in the form of ecological collapse. We close by considering the ramifications of this model in which the relative levels of these forces shape the future.

AB  - ObjectivesThis article examines the degree to which environmental concerns are influenced by race and ethnicity, and particularly whether significant differences exist among people of color and whites. Our objective is to clarify this uncertainty since previous studies have been limited by the timeframe and geographic scope of their data. MethodsWe analyze 15 years of nationally representative data from Gallup's General Poll Social Survey. Using a multitude of dependent variables that capture a range of environmental issues, we employ ordinal logistic regression models to understand environmental attitudes across race and ethnicity. ResultsWe find that people of color are more concerned than whites about matters pertaining to environmental justice, and just as concerned about problems related to traditional environmentalism. ConclusionsThe results of this study contribute to our understanding of the individual-level determinants of environmental attitudes, and provide insights into the attitudinal foundations of the modern-day environmental justice movement.

AB  - Over the last decade, shifting strategies of capital accumulation have deepened the integration of land and associated primary commodities into circuits of investment. More than merely an economic revaluation of land, such integration involves an iterative rearrangement of the social and natural processes determining land's material and symbolic qualities. Highlighting these shifts through a comparative study of investment processes for large-scale agricultural and extractive projects, we posit investment processes as assemblages proceeding in the context of different ontologies, valuations, and uses of land, which coalesce and compete with one other in complex ways, producing new spaces and subjectivities. Such assembling, we suggest, notably involves a discursive component involving the narration of the need for investment, an institutional component reforming regulatory arrangements, and an operational component enrolling labour, infrastructure, and ancillary resources associated with agricultural and extractive production. After examining each of these components in turn, we conclude with a discussion of tensions and contradictions inherent in 'opening' lands for investment and the business of harnessing agricultural and extractive resources.

Disruption of the Earth's natural ecosystems due to human overconsumption; disregard for sustainable practices; and the domination of other humans, species, and natural systems has led to an urgent moment in which humans must act to preserve these ecosystems, which support life on this planet. Restoring planetary health requires new directions for nursing. The pragmatic implications for nursing research, education, advocacy, and practice are explored in this article.

AB  - Objective To describe types of strategic actions nurses take to promote environmental justice (EJ) through research, education, advocacy, and practice (REAP) reported in peer-reviewed literature. Design and Sample A scoping review of literature was conducted that described EJ nursing strategies and included nurses listed as authors, subjects, partners, or organizational members. The sample consisted of 35 articles, representing 24 primary research studies and 11 nonresearch articles. Data were separately analyzed by research and nonresearch articles for a clearer understanding of evidence-based strategies within domains of REAP. Results Articles in the sample highlighted the importance of authentic community partnership and represented diversity of nursing strategies that addressed a range of environmental exposures and subsequent health and racial inequities. Climate justice, a concept that emerged from the EJ movement and intersects with planetary health, is a recent focus in professional nursing. Conclusions This scoping review establishes an understanding of the extent of nursing knowledge and research in EJ and lays the groundwork for further research on effective EJ nursing strategies. Community-Based Participatory Research/Participatory Action Research methods are fundamental for EJ research, and further theoretical development is needed to guide evaluation of EJ nursing strategies for education, advocacy, and practice.

AB  - Physical inactivity lies at the heart of the public health crisis in the United States (U.S.). Research on the factors that contribute to inactivity is vast and growing; however, most of this work focuses on individual rather than community-level dynamics such as socio-economics, access to resources, and features of the physical environment. Moreover, few studies have tested spatial relationships between the prevalence of physical inactivity and multiple explanatory variables to identify potential sources of social and environmental justice at the community level of analysis. To address these gaps in previous research, this study drew on an array of secondary data sources to: 1) identify factors that contribute to levels of physical inactivity; 2) examine how these factors affect spatial inequalities; and 3) compare model performance between conventional ordinary least squares regression models and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to predict physical inactivity among U.S. residents. Our findings indicate that multiple variables predict physical inactivity, particularly access to infrastructure, expenditures on recreational activities, and poverty within disenfranchised segments of the population. Given that improvements in our model performance detected non-stationary spatial relationships and reduced the auto correlation of residual variables, we contend that this technique accounts for greater variation than ordinary least squares regression. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive basis for informing urban and landscape planning decisions across spatial and regional scales.

AB  - Issues of social justice and equity related to the environment have taken place in the environmental justice movement. Previously, the environmental movement had focused, almost exclusively, on issues related to the conservation of the physical environment as well as the reduction of pollutants from the atmosphere, land and water. The environmental justice paradigm, however, has sought, since its origins in the United States three decades ago, to incorporate issues of social justice in the environmental movement, with performances of great national success. T he concept of environmental justice is dual, both as a social movement, and as a paradigm with enormous implications in the area of public action. T his article will consider, theoretically, the state of the art of environmental justice, with the aim of evaluating the impact this paradigm has on the environmental movement and on political issues.

AB  - Legal geographers have recently been interested in interlegality: the interactions between different legal orders governing one particular space. Contaminated land is one such space governed by multiple legal orders; however, it is yet to receive great attention in legal geography. In Australia, different authorities and bodies cooperate together in a responsive regulatory framework to prevent contamination and then manage cases where contamination has occurred, although this process is mostly coordinated at the level of the state. This article evaluates the framework by reference to a case where the contamination, by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), has crossed jurisdictional boundaries in Williamtown, in New South Wales, Australia. This cross-boundary incursion has complicated management responses, and may have resulted in contradicting forms of regulatory implementation by different legal orders and a break down in accountability. Ultimately, such findings point to the need for the current regulatory framework to be adapted to better deal with situations of spatial and legal complexity.

AB  - Policy analysis is driven by a dominant normative stance that conflates the notion of social welfare with some notion of collective good or, even more restrictively, strictly utilitarian notions of aggregate benefit. In this paper, we suggest how this perspective leads to a strongly aggregative analysis that masks concerns of actors in their unique contexts. We examine the policies of the South Coast Air Quality Management District in Los Angeles, California, USA and argue that they have strongly furthered the status quo at the expense of communities. We illustrate alternative models for analysis in the hope that this type of dialectic might lead to a more inclusive model of rationality. We also hope to take the conversation deeper into notions of justice and not farther away from them, as some attempts to broaden the discussion by appealing to notions of democratization, civic governance, or modernization naively do.

AB  - In privileging expert risk assessments, we may be failing to recognize the authenticity of a community's actual experience of risk. We should remind ourselves that expert measures are always only partial, often surrogate, estimates of such experience and, at times, may fail to capture the actual nature of risk. There is a need for modes of analysis that allow better description of risk as experienced by community. We develop and test the methods for exploring hitherto delegitimized modes of knowing risk. In this exploratory research, narrative-linguistic analysis and cognitive mapping were used to evaluate the experience of residents near a large, municipal landfill. Text was analyzed, in part using speech-act theory. These methods aspire to thick description, as opposed experts' thin description of risk, and add to the analytical tools at our disposal.

AB  - Ireland's economic development not only provided many benefits but also caused difficulties locally and nationally. The economic crash and bailout, which occurred from 2008, have mired the country with huge debts. In addition, development created many environmental challenges in rural, suburban and urban areas. This chapter will examine community responses to those environmental challenges, discussing the mobilisation of the environmental campaigns that shaped the emergence of the Irish environmental movement.

AB  - Informed by the European Union's waste hierarchy, UK policy has normatively shifted the ontological status of waste from matter out of place to a resource for which uses must be found in order to achieve environmental goals of decarbonisation and waste reduction. Technologies linking waste-management with renewable energy have been supported within an ecomodernist framework of market incentives for stimulating private-sector investment in new waste treatment technologies. Under pressure of EU targets, the UK's policy measures have had several aims: to reduce landfill disposal, increase resource recycling or reuse, expand waste-based renewable energy and thus reduce GHG emissions. As techno-market-fixes, new facilities were meant to convert waste for more beneficial uses, bring it up the hierarchy and localise its management. Consequent tensions can be illuminated by linking concepts of technology scaling and socio-material metamorphosis with critical perspectives on ecomodemism. Although the ecomodernist framework stimulated some waste-management improvements, other outcomes contradict the policy objectives of localising and converting waste for more beneficial uses. These contrary outcomes are illustrated by two technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) and mechanical and biological treatment (MBT), each with multiple possible spatial scalings and techno-configurations. Financial instruments have most incentivised the easiest socio-material metamorphosis for lucrative returns, especially to produce energy (electricity or gas) for grid systems, suiting large operators. For more environmentally beneficial uses of waste, there have been difficulties in overcoming its recalcitrance for producing commercially viable outputs, e.g. digestate replacing chemical fertilisers, compost improving soil and 'dirty' plastics replacing virgin plastics. Techno-configurations and material flows have been scaled towards global goods, distant from the feedstock source. Through the ecomodernist framework, the state's responsibility for such outcomes has been blurred with the private sector and shifted to anonymous markets.

AB  - In environmental risk management, there are often interests in maximizing public health benefits (efficiency) and addressing inequality in the distribution of health outcomes. However, both dimensions are not generally considered within a single analytical framework. In this study, we estimate both total population health benefits and changes in quantitative indicators of health inequality for a number of alternative spatial distributions of diesel particulate filter retrofits across half of an urban bus fleet in Boston, Massachusetts. We focus on the impact of emissions controls on primary fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) emissions, modeling the effect on PM(2.5) concentrations and premature mortality. Given spatial heterogeneity in baseline mortality rates, we apply the Atkinson index and other inequality indicators to quantify changes in the distribution of mortality risk. Across the different spatial distributions of control strategies, the public health benefits varied by more than a factor of two, related to factors such as mileage driven per day, population density near roadways, and baseline mortality rates in exposed populations. Changes in health inequality indicators varied across control strategies, with the subset of optimal strategies considering both efficiency and equality generally robust across different parametric assumptions and inequality indicators. Our analysis demonstrates the viability of formal analytical approaches to jointly address both efficiency and equality in risk assessment, providing a tool for decisionmakers who wish to consider both issues.

AB  - Occupational and environmental medicine evolved out of concern for the effect of work hazards on health. The experienced gained in considering such hazards has been extended to understanding general risks in the environment. As we look toward the future, classical occupational and environmental hazards such as over exposure to lead, asbestos and mercury are waning and being replaced by concerns around sustainable development, toxicology testing and exposure information for high production volume chemicals, development of better approaches for setting workplace and community exposure limits, environmental justice and many others. The opportunities for the future exist in overcoming these new challenges.

AB  - Place-based structural inequalities can have critical implications for the health of vulnerable populations. Historical urban policies, such as redlining, have contributed to current inequalities in exposure to intra-urban heat. However, it is unknown whether these spatial inequalities are associated with disparities in heat-related health outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine the relationships between historical redlining, intra-urban heat conditions, and heat-related emergency department visits using data from 11 Texas cities. At the zip code level, the proportion of historical redlining was determined, and heat exposure was measured using daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST). Heat-related inpatient and outpatient rates were calculated based on emergency department visit data that included ten categories of heat-related diseases between 2016 and 2019. Regression or spatial error/lag models revealed significant associations between higher proportions of redlined areas in the neighborhood and higher LST (Coef. = 0.0122, 95% CI = 0.0039-0.0205). After adjusting for indicators of social vulnerability, neighborhoods with higher proportions of redlining showed significantly elevated heat-related outpatient visit rate (Coef. = 0.0036, 95% CI = 0.0007-0.0066) and inpatient admission rate (Coef. = 0.0018, 95% CI = 0.0001-0.0035). These results highlight the role of historical discriminatory policies on the disparities of heat-related illness and suggest a need for equity-based urban heat planning and management strategies.

AB  - In this article, I offer a clarification of the ambiguities surrounding the pivotal concepts that have shaped and will continue to shape environmental education movement in the United States and beyond: nature, conservation, sustainable development, and environmental justice. I point out that dualistic frameworks not only polarize environmental educators' ethical, political, and pedagogical values but also oversimplify complicated ecological issues. It is critical to generate inclusive and collective pedagogical efforts that recognize the interactions between the natural and the cultural, the possibility of integrating ecocentric and technocentric conservation education movements, and the need to foster humility for ongoing dialogues concerning sustainable development and environmental justice.

AB  - Municipal solid waste and cement manufacture are two sources of environmental justice issues in urban and suburban areas. Waste utilization is an attractive alternative to disposal for eliminating environmental injustice, reducing potential hazards, and improving urban sustainability. The re-use and recycling of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash in the construction industry has drawn significant attention. Incorporating MSWI ash in cement and concrete production is a potential path that mitigates the environmental justice issues in waste management and the construction industry. This paper presents a critical overview of the pretreatment methods that optimize MSWI ash utilization in cement/concrete and the influences of MSWI ash on the performance of cement/concrete. This review aims to elucidate the potential advantages and limitations associated with the use of MSWI ash for producing cement clinker, alternative binder (e.g., alkali-activated material), cement substitutes, and aggregates. A brief overview of the generation and characteristics of MSWI ash is reported, accompanied by identifying opportunities for the use of MSWI ash-incorporated products in industrial-scale applications and recognizing associated environmental justice implications.

AB  - Objective Excess emissions are pollutant releases that occur during periods of startups, shutdowns or malfunctions and are considered violations of the U.S. Clean Air Act. They are an important, but understudied and under-regulated, category of pollution releases given their frequency and magnitude. In this paper, we examine the demographic correlates of excess emissions, using data from industrial sources in Texas. Methods We conduct two complementary sets of analyses: one at the census tract level and one at the facility level. At the census tract level, we use a multinomial logit model to examine the relationships between racial, ethnic, and income characteristics and the incidence of excess emissions. At the facility level, we first estimate a logit model to examine whether these characteristics are associated with facilities that emit excess emissions, and then, conditional on the presence of excess emissions, we use ordinary least square regression to estimate their correlation with the magnitude of releases. Results Across our analyses, we find that the percentage of Black population and median household income are positively associated with excess emissions; percentage of college graduate, population density, median housing value, and percentage of owner-occupied housing unit are negatively associated with excess emissions. We, however, have not found a clear and significant relationship between the percentage of Hispanic population and excess emissions.

AB  - Low-cost sensors (LCSs) are widely acknowledged for bringing a paradigm shift in supplemental traditional air monitoring by air regulatory agencies. However, there is concern regarding its data quality and performance stability, which has greatly restricted its large-scale applications. Knowing the recent techniques, progress, and challenges of LCS calibration is of immense significance to promote the field of environmental monitoring. By summarizing the published evidence, this review shows that the global sensor market is rapidly expanding due to the surging needs, but the calibration efforts have been focused on a limited selection of sensors. Relative humidity correction, regression, and machine learning are the three mainstream calibration techniques. Although there is no one-size-fits-all solution, a feature of the latest research tendency is machine learning. The duration of calibration is largely neglected in the experiment design, but it is found to affect the performance of different calibration methods, especially those that are data-driven. Geographically, China and the United States gained the most research attention in the sensor calibration field, but the spatial mismatch between particulate matter hotspots and calibration sites is quite evident for the rest of the world. Incomplete and unevenly distributed research footprints could limit the large-scale test of method generalizability, as well as diminish the monitoring capacity in underserved areas that suffer greater environmental justice crises. In general, model performance is enhanced by including the key influencing factors, but the degree of improvement is not evidently related to the number of explanatory variables. Overall, studies prove the critical importance of field calibration before sensor deployment, but more studies are needed to establish experiment protocols that can be customized to specific needs.

AB  - Phytoremediation (phyto) strategies employ trees, shrubs, and/or grasses for treating contaminated air. soil. or water, These strategies include buffers, vegetation filters, in situ phytoremediation plantings. and percolation controlling vegetative caps. The design parameter. that separates phytoremediation from landscaping is purposefully placing and growing a root-zone reactor volume with predictable pollutant removal performance. This phyto reactor integrates with other engineered systems to cover landfills, treat petrochemical spills in soils. intercept a soluble subsurface plume, and capture non-point surface sediment entrained in urban or field runoff. There are many potential economic opportunities for biomass associated with phytoremediation. including bioenergy and traditional industrial products such as solid wood products and reconstituted products (i.e., paper, chip board, laminated beams, extruded trim). More intangibly, phyto creates environmental benefits such as soil erosion control, carbon sequestration. and wildlife habitat. Phyto also creates socio-economic benefits by diversify regional manufacturing into new products that employs local labor, thus building value-added industry. Alternative crops develop a greater diversity of products from the farmland, making the regional economy less exposed to global commodity crop price fluctuations. Thus, a strategic phyto treatment of non-point agricultural runoff would help diversify land use from annually tilled crops (corn, soybeans, wheat) into perennial, untilled tree crops. A landscape rebuilt using phyto would create diversity represented in business potential, healthier air and water, wildlife habitat. and aesthetics. Moreover, phyto provides local and current pollutant treatment. Such timely treatment of pollutants that would otherwise move to our downstream, or downwind neighbors is key to the environmental justice concept. We present four case study summaries to illustrate installed commercial applications of phytoremediation. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, multiple media sources claimed the event was an "equal opportunity" storm. These claims challenge existing social vulnerability research that finds marginalised groups have both unequal risk exposure and subsequent differential impacts from disasters (Cutter, Boruff, and Shirley 2003, "Assessing Current and Future Freshwater Flood Risk from North Atlantic Tropical Cyclones via Insurance Claims." Scientific Reports 7 (February): 41609; Faber 2015, "Superstorm Sandy and the Demographics of Flood Risk in New York City." Human Ecology 43 (3): 363-378. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-015-9757-x; Thomas et al. 2013, Social Vulnerability to Disasters. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press). To understand the accuracy of this "equal opportunity" assertion, we use ordinary least squares, simultaneous autoregressive, and geographically weighted regression techniques to investigate the relationships between indicators of social vulnerability and FEMA-approved housing damages from Hurricane Harvey across five cities in the Houston area. Findings suggest Harvey had disproportionate impacts on housing damages for Black, Latinx, and mobile home residents. These results serve as a foundational analysis for the broader purpose of informing policy decisions regarding recovery efforts and future approaches to improving flooding resilience in the Houston area.

AB  - Little research has examined how and why institutional context and framing dynamics shape the institutionalization of movement claims into the states formal policies, and what the implication of these processes might be for movements attempting to mobilize on the same conceptual terms after institutionalization. In this study, I explore the role institutional context and framing play in the institutionalization of movement claims in a case: the implementation of environmental justice policy in the California Environmental Protection Agency from 2002 to 2007. I ask: How and why were aspects of the environmental justice frame institutionalized into regulatory policy while others were not? I use ethnographic field methods and content analysis of archival data to answer this question and offer two contributions to previous research. First, I add to previous scholarship on the environmental justice movement by identifying the character of newer problems faced by movement actors as they engage in regulatory policy processes with opponents in the United States. Second, I extend social movement framing theory by developing the notion of state resonance to understand how and why a collective action frame is institutionalized and implemented in regulatory policy.

AB  - Most street tree inequality studies focus on examining tree abundance at single time point, while overlooking inequality dynamics measured based on a complete set of tree measures. Whether the severities of street tree inequalities vary with different tree structure measures, whether street tree inequalities are diminishing or growing over time, and how the inequality dynamics are affected by tree-planting programs remain largely unexplored. To fill these gaps, this study applied binned regression and cluster analyses to street tree census data of 1995?2015 in New York City. We investigated different structural measures of street tree inequalities pertaining to various aggregations of people, compared street tree inequalities over time, and revealed the inequity remediation role of the MillionTreesNYC initiative. We found that the underprivileged populations, characterized by higher percentages of the poor, racial minorities, young people, and less-educated people, are more likely to have lower tree abundance, less desired tree structure, poorer tree health condition, and more sidewalk damages. When disaggregating inequalities across various aggregations of people, income-based and education-based inequalities were the most severe, but the inequalities diminished over time. The race-based and age-based inequalities show mixed results that disfavor Hispanics, Blacks, and young people. The equity outcome of the MillionTreesNYC initiative is not ideal as the inequalities decrease when measured using tree count and species diversity, whereas they increase when measured using tree health and average diameter at breast height. The findings have important implications for more effective decision-making to balance resources between planting trees and protecting existing trees, and between increasing tree abundance and improving tree structure.

AB  - In the absence of scientific consensus on an appropriate theoretical framework, cumulative risk assessment and related research have relied on speculative conceptual models. We argue for the importance of theoretical backing for such models and discuss 3 relevant theoretical frameworks, each supporting a distinctive "family" of models. Social determinant models postulate that unequal health outcomes are caused by structural inequalities; health disparity models envision social and contextual factors acting through individual behaviors and biological mechanisms; and multiple stressor models incorporate environmental agents, emphasizing the intermediary role of these and other stressors. The conclusion is that more careful reliance on established frameworks will lead directly to improvements in characterizing cumulative risk burdens and accounting for disproportionate adverse health effects.

AB  - In Europe, Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a consolidated practice aimed at predicting health impacts supporting the predisposition of plans and projects subjected to authorization procedures. In Italy, further developments are needed to harmonize the practice and consolidate methodologies in order to extend the HIA application in different fields. The recent HIA conducted in Val d'Agri (Basilicata) on the impacts of a first crude oil treatment plant represents an opportunity to illustrate its tools, methods and fields of application. In this experience, participation methods in impact assessment have been adapted to the context, emphasizing aspects of ethics, equity and democracy. Environmental and epidemiological studies were included in the HIA Val d'Agri in order to characterize the environment and assess the health status of the resident population. On the basis of the results public health recommendations have been elaborated, shared with the stakeholders and shared with local and regional administrators. The experience in Val d'Agri introduces elements of reflection on the potential of HIA at local level in order to support the public health and the environmental control systems in the area, as well as planning based on preventive environment and HIA.

In focus is the cultural discourse circulating in the agency that exposes the real concerns, beliefs, and attitudes of these scientists and experts vis-a-vis their community engagement experiences. Finally, I propose that critical attention to the place of power relations, knowledge politics, and environmental justice are fundamental to studies of toxic contamination where commitments to community engagement and quality science are joined to form a positive research goal and where attempts are made to improve the conditions of quality environmental public health service.

AB  - In the context of rapid urban expansion and population growth, the spatial inequity of park green spaces' (PGSs) supply and demand has become a research focus. However, few studies have conducted a multi-level comprehensive evaluation of the supply-demand ratio of PGSs at the grid resolution scale. This study developed a multidimensional spatial equity evaluation (MSEE) framework consisting of scale dimensions (local, district, and regional levels) and index dimensions (accessibility, supply-demand ratio, spatial cluster identification). Taking the main urban area of Harbin as an example, we measured the spatial differences between supply and demand for PGSs at various planning levels at a resolution of 500 x 500 m. The results showed serious spatial inequity in supply and demand for PGSs, especially spatial discrepancy among different PGSs. The supply of mini-parks is severely insufficient, and the distribution of comprehensive parks is too concentrated, leading to the polarization of saturated supply and inadequate supply. Some social groups studied in this article, such as older people, rural dwellers, and low-income people, are disadvantaged in accessing PGSs. We recommended that the MSEE framework be used as a reference for future policy formulation. It also provides a flexible operating model that is applicable to other cities.

AB  - In the environmental conflict that surrounds the sighting of hazardous waste facilities there is usually a volatile mix of disparities in power, expertise and information access as well as differing views on risk, which are all played out amidst commercial arrangements and environmental justice concerns. In recent times, the volatility of this mix has been further compounded by the growing climate of public concern and distrust surrounding scientific developments and technology. While there is no 'quick fix' to the complex conflict that this entails, community information systems (CISs) based on participatory models can help address the outstanding issues of capacity, information access, power inequities and environmental justice. CISs are an effective response to the five crucial elements of a toxic dispute, that is, the dialogue, capacity building, information access, evaluation of hazards and risk, and expertise. This paper will review the role of community accessible information systems in the dispute in Botany over the management and destruction of Orica. Australia's stockpile of the persistent organic pollutant, hexachlorobenzene (HCB). It will focus on the role of CIS in responding to the challenges for expert information delivery, and in addressing the disparity of informational power within the toxic dispute.

AB  - In this review paper, we aim to describe the potential for, and the key challenges to, applying PES projects to mangroves. By adopting a "carbocentric approach,'' we show that mangrove forests are strong candidates for PES projects. They are particularly well suited to the generation of carbon credits because of their unrivaled potential as carbon sinks, their resistance and resilience to natural hazards, and their extensive provision of Ecosystem Services other than carbon sequestration, primarily nursery areas for fish, water purification and coastal protection, to the benefit of local communities as well as to the global population. The voluntary carbon market provides opportunities for the development of appropriate protocols and good practice case studies for mangroves at a small scale, and these may influence larger compliance schemes in the future. Mangrove habitats are mostly located in developing countries on communally or state-owned land. This means that issues of national and local governance, land ownership and management, and environmental justice are the main challenges that require careful planning at the early stages of mangrove PES projects to ensure successful outcomes and equitable benefit sharing within local communities.

AB  - Media accounts routinely refer to California's Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, as "landmark" climate change legislation. On its surface, this label is an accurate reflection of the state's forward-thinking stance across many environmental issues including pesticides, toxic substances, solid waste, and air quality. For all its promise, however, AB 32 can also be considered a low point in the landscape of conflict between state environmental regulators and California's environmental justice movement. While the legislation included several provisions to address the procedural and distributive dimensions of environmental justice, the implementation of AB 32 has been marked by heated conflict. The most intense conflicts over AB 32 revolve around the primacy of market mechanisms such as "cap and trade." This article examines the drivers and the manifestations of these dynamics of collaboration and conflict between environmental justice advocates and state regulators, and pays particular attention to the scalar and racialized quality of the neoliberal discourse. The contentiousness of climate change politics in California offers scholars and practitioners around the world a cautionary tale of how the best intentions for integrating environmental justice principles into climate change policy do not necessarily translate into implementation and how underlying racialized fractures can upend collaboration between state and social movement actors.

AB  - In light of human population growth, global food insecurity is an escalating concern. To meet increasing demand for food, leading scientists have called for "sustainable intensification", defined as the process of enhancing agricultural yields with minimal environmental impact and without expanding the existing agricultural land base. We argue that this definition is inadequate to merit the term "sustainable", because it lacks engagement with established principles that are central to sustainability. Sustainable intensification is likely to fail in improving food security if it continues to focus narrowly on food production ahead of other equally or more important variables that influence food security. Sustainable solutions for food security must be holistic and must address issues such as food accessibility. Wider consideration of issues related to equitable distribution of food and individual empowerment in the intensification decision process (distributive and procedural justice) is needed to put meaning back into the term "sustainable intensification".

AB  - In the past, the primary focus of the transportation industry was safety and emission. At present, the focus is much broader and includes social sustainability in transportation equity, environmental justice, and public health. Hence, the emphasis is on increasing physical activities and expanding access to essential goods and services through non-motorized modes. Non-motorized transportation increases mobility choices, relieves congestion, promotes local economy, reduces greenhouse gas emission, promotes a healthy lifestyle, and improves quality of life. However, a majority of highway bridges on planned or existing non-motorized paths have become bottle-necks, and discourages efficient use of such facilities. At present, highway agencies evaluate bridge sites on a case-by-case basis to identify alternatives to provide non-motorized access across the bridges. Later, these alternatives with cost estimates are used for funding proposals. Hence, the need is to have a methodological process to evaluate a bridge site for the best possible alternatives and to develop cost estimates for funding proposals. This article presents safe passage alternatives for non-motorized traffic across an existing bridge, alternative analysis methodology, and an implementation example. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many believe commercial fisheries in Alaska (U.S.A.) are sustainability success stories, but ongoing socioeconomic problems across the state raise questions about how this sustainability is being defined and evaluated. Problems such as food insecurity and the disenfranchisement of Alaska Natives from fishing rights are well documented, yet these concerns are obscured by marketing campaigns that convey images of flourishing fishing communities and initiatives to certify Alaska's fisheries as responsibly managed. Fisheries management mandates and approaches built on such metrics and technologies as maximum sustainable yield and systems of tradable quotas actually serve to constrain, circumscribe, and marginalize some Alaskans opportunities for effecting change in how the benefits of these fisheries are allocated. Beneath the narrative of sustainability, these management technologies perpetuate a cognitive ecological model of sustainability that is oriented to single-species outcomes, that casts people as parasites, and thus assumes the necessity of trade-offs between biological and social goals. Alternative cognitive models are available that draw metaphors from different ecological concepts such as keystone species and mutualisms. Such models, when used to inform management approaches, may improve societal outcomes in Alaska and elsewhere by promoting food security and sustainability through diversified natural resource harvest strategies that are more flexible and responsive to environmental variability and change.

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of states, counties and cities in the United States issued mandatory stay-at-home orders as part of their efforts to slow down the spread of the virus. We argue that the consequences of this one-size-fits-all order will be differentially distributed among economic groups. In this paper, we examine social distance behavior changes for lower income populations. We conduct a comparative analysis of responses between lower-income and upper-income groups and assess their relative exposure to COVID-19 risks. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis of 3140 counties, we find social distance policy effect on the lower-income group is smaller than that of the upper-income group, by as much as 46% to 54%. Our explorations of the mechanisms behind the disparate effects suggest that for the work-related trips the stay-at-home orders do not significantly reduce low income work trips and this result is statistically significant. That is, the share of essential business defined by stay-at-home orders is significantly negatively correlated with income at county level. In the non-work-related trips, we find that both the lower-income and upper-income groups reduced visits to retail, recreation, grocery, and pharmacy visits after the stay-at-home order, with the upper-income group reducing trips more compared to lower-income group.

AB  - Mining activities induce profound changes to societies and the environment they inhabit. With global extraction of metal ores doubling over the past two decades, pressures related to mining have dramatically increased. In this paper, we explore where growing global metal extraction has particularly taken effect. Using fine-grain data, we investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of mining of nine metal ores (bauxite, copper, gold, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, silver and zinc) across approximately 3,000 sites of extraction worldwide between 2000 and 2019. To approach the related environmental implications, we intersect mining sites with terrestrial biomes, protected areas, and watersheds categorised by water availability. We find that 79% of global metal ore extraction in 2019 originated from five of the six most species-rich biomes, with mining volumes doubling since 2000 in tropical moist forest ecosystems. We also find that half of global metal ore extraction took place at 20 km or less from protected territories. Further, 90% of all considered extraction sites correspond to below-average relative water availability, with particularly copper and gold mining occurring in areas with significant water scarcity. Our study has far-reaching implications for future global and local policy and resource management responses to mitigate the negative effects of the expected expansion of metal mining.

AB  - In this article, I investigate the origin, limits, and possibilities of just transition as a policy framework to support labor organizing in the energy sector. Just transition first emerged within the labor movement to describe measures to "make whole" workers laid off as the result of necessary environmental policy. Following Gidwani (2015), I analyze claims for income replacement or continued employment as an assertion of "jobs property" based on the collectively bargained standards that unions have negotiated for dangerous jobs in fossil fuel sectors. Although the uses of just transition have grown to encompass broader demands for a democratic and equitable shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy including energy, environmental, and climate justice, I observe that the objectives of labor-centered climate policy often remain focused on the defense of jobs property for dislocated workers. I argue compensation for the loss of jobs property is insufficient to address historical exclusions of people of color and women from energy industry employment or secure the livelihoods of dislocated workers given increasing precarity. Drawing from more than eighty interviews and field work with energy justice campaigns in Atlanta, I consider the case of energy-sector workers in the U.S. South to center a just transition framework that reconstitutes a social wage to address the uneven spatial development of the U.S. labor market.

AB  - Many of the controversies about environmental resource use relate to the perceived conflict between economics and conservation. This conflict might have been resolved with general acceptance of the concept of sustainable development, and with a more transparent and honest use of economics terminology. However, interpretation and application of this concept appear to have led to some further conflicts between perceptions of economics and the environment, partly because commerce and development are sometimes portrayed as having the same meaning. Commercial activity resulting from the use of natural resources is often held to promote social good, while conservation of natural resources, many argue, renders the wealth which may be obtained from such resources unavailable. The latter is deemed to be bad for society. However, although in contemporary parlance economics is usually restricted implicitly to issues concerning commerce, finance and profit, economic theory requires the consideration also of intangible values, such as environmental damage. Environmental and other economists have worked hare to stress the importance of non-financial values in economic theory, and to ensure that they are included in economic analysis. However, these latter aspects of economics are not generally known to the wider public, partly because of the tendentious manner in which interested parties often use economics. When positions are argued on the basis of economics, the arguments are frequently expressed in language designed to persuade members of the community that all commercial activity is in the interests of society, while incurring minimal costs. In these circumstances, economics might be viewed as a form of rhetoric. Anyone assessing the merits of such arguments ought to consider carefully what this rhetoric really means. This is especially important in discussions concerning sustainable development, which is understood by some to mean sustainable, or sustained, commerce.

AB  - Pamela Ann Davies argues that the closure of the Lynemouth, UK, aluminum smelter generated adverse social justice impacts and was caused by the adoption of green state policies. She employs that argument to critique green criminology for promoting adverse social justice impacts. Here, we reanalyze the Lynemouth plant closure. First, this reanalysis illustrates the various social and environmental forms of injustice the plant generated, especially its adverse human, nonhuman and ecological health consequences. Second, the closure is reassessed from a political economic perspective that places the plant closure within the context of global capitalist plant closures in the aluminum industry. That review notes that plant closures and deindustrialization in developed economies are now a common occurrence driven by economic concerns, not environmental policies. We point out that social injustice as well as ecological destruction are often created by the normal operation of capitalism, and that those consequences should not be overlooked.

AB  - In this work we determine whether monetary penalties assessed against petroleum refineries for violation of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and/or the Resource Conservation and/or Recovery Act differ depending upon the racial, ethnic, and income characteristics of communities surrounding the penalized refinery. Our sample consists of all monetary penalties assessed between April 2001 and April 2003 (n = 206). We find mixed evidence of inequality. The racial, ethnic, and income characteristics of census tracts surrounding the penalized refineries are not related to penalty amounts. However, refineries situated within the boundaries of Hispanic and low-income ZIP codes tend receive smaller penalties than refineries located in non-Hispanic and more affluent ZIP codes. These disparities do not appear to be result of factors such as previous enforcement and compliance history, case characteristics, company and facility characteristics, or the political/economic climate.

AB  - Indigenous peoples in Australia, and globally, are situated in an unusual context of both significant vulnerability and unique resilience to climate change which influence their perceptions of climate risk and uncertainty. Their vulnerability to climate change arises in part from their contexts of living in many of the harshest and isolated environments. Their resilience originates from their accumulated knowledge of specific environments over millennia, mediated through sui generis cultural institutions. Our results illustrate that indigenous groups primarily perceive uncertainties related to volition of actors and institutions. When they are involved in climate adaptation planning in ways that mobilise their cultural institutions and knowledge, they can safely manage these uncertainties through their agency to determine and control key risks. We demonstrate that climate justice approaches can be strengthened for indigenous peoples by applying a linked vulnerability-resilience analytical framework. This enables stronger consideration of how unique cultural institutions and knowledge, which are not available to all vulnerable groups, affect indigenous perceptions of uncertainty in climate adaptation planning. We use this analytical approach in a case study with Yuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owner groups within the Great Barrier Reef Catchment. We conclude that a specific focus on sui generis indigenous knowledge and cultural institutions as a source of resilience can strengthen climate justice approaches and work more effectively with indigenous peoples in climate change contexts.

AB  - It has been widely acknowledged that air pollution has a considerable adverse impact on people's health. Disadvantaged groups such as low-income people are often found to experience greater negative effects of environmental pollution. Thus, improving the accuracy of air pollution exposure assessment might be essential to policy-making. Recently, the neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP) has been identified as a specific form of possible bias when assessing individual exposure to air pollution and its health impacts. In this paper, we assessed the real-time air pollution exposure and residential-based exposure of 106 participants in a high-pollution community in Beijing, China. The study found that: (1) there are significant differences between the two assessments; (2) most participants experienced the NEAP and could lower their exposure by their daily mobility; (3) three vulnerable groups with low daily mobility and could not avoid the high pollution in their residential neighborhoods were identified as exceptions to this: low-income people who have low levels of daily mobility and limited travel outside their residential neighborhoods, blue-collar workers who spend long hours at low-end workplaces, and elderly people who face many household constraints. Public policies thus need to focus on the hidden environmental injustice revealed by the NEAP in order to improve the well-being of these environmentally vulnerable groups.

I posit that corporations do indeed have a new political role in a connected world, in particular with respect to matters of human rights, social and environmental justice. We thus find a growing need for ethical and political knowledge to inform and guide the emerging political co-responsibility of MNCs. I draw on the rich literature in cosmopolitanism to seek such guidance and discuss some of the implications that a cosmopolitan perspective implies.

AB  - Objectives: Public health has recognized that nature is good for health but there are calls for a review of its gendered aspects. This review attempts to develop and explore a broad analytical theme the differing interconnections between gender, health and nature. The paper summarizes the interconnections that have been subject to extensive academic enquiry between gender and health, health and space, and gender and space. Methods: A combination of key terms including place; gender; health; outdoor space; green space; natural environment; national parks; femininity; masculinity; recreation; physical activity; sustainability; ecofeminism; feminism; environmental degradation; and environmental justice were used to search the electronic databases Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science and Scopus to identify relevant articles. We took two approaches for this review to provide an overview and analysis of the range of research in the field, and to present a framework of research that is an analysis of the intersection of gender, health and nature. Results: Four dimensions are distinguished: (1) evaluations of health benefits and 'toxicities' of nature; (2) dimensions and qualities of nature/space; (3) environmental justice including accessibility, availability and usability; and (4) identification of boundaries (symbolic/material) that construct differential relationships between nature, gender and health. This paper offers an understanding of how environmental and social conditions may differentially shape the health of women and men. The dimensions direct analytical attention to the diverse linkages that constitute overlapping and inseparable domains of knowledge and practice, to identify complex interconnections between gender, health and nature. Conclusion: This review therefore analyses assumptions about the health benefits of nature, and its risks, for gender from an in-depth, analytical perspective that can be used to inform policy.

AB  - In assessing environmental health risks, the risk characterization step synthesizes information gathered in evaluating exposures to stressors together with dose-response relationships, characteristics of the exposed population, and external environmental conditions. This article summarizes key steps of a cumulative risk assessment (CRA) followed by a discussion of considerations for characterizing cumulative risks. Cumulative risk characterizations differ considerably from single chemical- or single source-based risk characterization. CRAs typically focus on a specific population instead of a pollutant or pollutant source and should include an evaluation of all relevant sources contributing to the exposures in the population and other factors that influence dose-response relationships. Second, CRAs may include influential environmental and population-specific conditions, involving multiple chemical and nonchemical stressors. Third, a CRA could examine multiple health effects, reflecting joint toxicity and the potential for toxicological interactions. Fourth, the complexities often necessitate simplifying methods, including judgment-based and semi-quantitative indices that collapse disparate data into numerical scores. Fifth, because of the higher dimensionality and potentially large number of interactions, information needed to quantify risk is typically incomplete, necessitating an uncertainty analysis. Three approaches that could be used for characterizing risks in a CRA are presented: the multiroute hazard index, stressor grouping by exposure and toxicity, and indices for screening multiple factors and conditions. Other key roles of the risk characterization in CRAs are also described, mainly the translational aspect of including a characterization summary for lay readers (in addition to the technical analysis), and placing the results in the context of the likely risk-based decisions.

AB  - Objective. The social capital literature suggests generalized trust should work to motivate individuals to engage in environmentally beneficial behavior as it is associated with altruistic outcomes, moderation, and self-sacrifice. The environmental justice literature, however, suggests certain populations are understandably more skeptical about who they can trust with respect to environmental threats in their communities, thus undermining the hypothesis that greater trust results in positive environmental outcomes. We seek to test the relative direct and indirect influences of generalized trust and knowledge of environmental issues on individuals' willingness to make sacrifices for the environment. Methods. Based on established theory in the social capital, environmental concern, and environmental justice literature, this study conducts structural equation modeling using data from the 2010 General Social Survey. Results. This analysis finds support for both social capital and environmental justice arguments. However, the positive direct effect of generalized trust on a willingness to sacrifice outweighs its indirect negative effect via perceived environmental threats by a factor of four to one, suggesting generalized trust is a net catalyst for environmental action. Knowledge of issues is positively associated with both perceived environmental risks and a willingness to sacrifice. Conclusion. Generalized trust is an important motivator for self-sacrifice in the realm of environmental behavior. We should nonetheless be skeptical of efforts to promote it that ignore the unequal distribution of environmental threats in the population.

AB  - It has commonly been suggested that in modern cities individual or household deprivation (for example, low income or education) is amplified by area level deprivation (for example, lack of jobs or good schools), in ways which damage the health of the poorest and increase health inequalities. The aim of this study was to determine the location of a range of resources and exposures by deprivation in a UK city. We examined the location of 42 resources in Glasgow City, Scotland, in 2005-2006, by quintile of small area deprivation. Measures included number per 1000 population, network distance to nearest resource, and percentage of data zones containing at least one of each type of resource. Twelve resources had higher density in, and/or were closer to or more common in, more deprived neighbourhoods: public nurseries, public primary schools, police stations, pharmacies, credit unions, post offices, bus stops, bingo halls, public swimming pools, public sports centres, outdoor play areas, and vacant and derelict land/buildings. Sixteen had higher density in, and/or were closer to, or more common in, more affluent neighbourhoods: public secondary schools, private schools, banks, building societies, museums/art galleries, railway stations, subway stations, tennis courts, bowling greens, private health clubs, private swimming pools, colleges, A & E hospitals, parks, waste disposal sites, and tourist attractions. Private nurseries, Universities, fire stations, general, dental and ophthalmic practices, pawn brokers, ATMs, Supermarkets, fast food chains, cafes, public libraries, golf courses, and cinemas showed no clear pattern by deprivation. Thus it appears that in the early 21st century access to resources does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods in the UK. We conclude that we need to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date and context-specific empirical evidence on the distribution of neighbourhood resources, and to engage in further research on interactions between individual and environmental factors in shaping health and health inequalities.

AB  - Individuals experiencing homelessness represent a growing population in the United States. Air pollution exposure among individuals experiencing homelessness has not been quantified. Utilizing local knowledge mapping, we generated activity spaces for 62 individuals experiencing homelessness residing in a semi-rural county within the United States. Satellite derived measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were utilized to estimate annual exposure to air pollution experienced by our participants, as well as differences in the variation in estimated PM2.5 at the local scale compared with stationary monitor data and point location estimates for the same period. Spatial variation in exposure to PM2.5 was detected between participants at both the point and activity space level. Among all participants, annual median PM2.5 exposure was 16.22 mu g/m(3), exceeding the National Air Quality Standard. Local knowledge mapping represents a novel mechanism to capture mobility patterns and investigate exposure to air pollution within vulnerable populations. Reliance on stationary monitor data to estimate air pollution exposure may lead to exposure misclassification, particularly in rural and semirural regions where monitoring is limited.

AB  - Opposition to mines endures even in countries with relatively strong environmental assessment processes and regulations. Why proposed mines fail to obtain a social license to operate is analyzed by developing a framework comprised of three concepts-process legitimacy, distributional outcomes, and values compatibility-drawing from the social license to operate, interactive governance, and environmental justice literatures. The framework is applied to understand opposition from local Indigenous people to two mine projects, one in Sweden and the other in British Columbia, Canada. Evidence from interviews with Sami legal experts and Reindeer Herding Community representatives and an advisor with the Tsilhqot'in National Government, as well as from secondary sources is used to analyze the contestation. Despite the proposed mines being situated in different governance contexts, the reasons for the opposition are markedly similar environmental assessment processes are illegitimate, distributional outcomes unfair, and values incompatible. The comparative empirical analysis leads to refining the framework as a scaffold with values compatibility as the foundational plank, rather than three independent planks contributing to a social license to operate. The analysis offers insights into company commitments to Indigenous engagement, enhancements to process legitimacy, and evolving and paradigmatic shifts in governance processes, as articulated by Indigenous peoples and international governance mechanisms such as the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

AB  - Latinos are the largest U.S. non-mainstreamed ethnic group, and social and environmental justice considerations dictate recreation professionals and researchers meet their recreation needs. This study reconceptualizes this diverse group's recreation patterns, looking at where immigrant Latino individuals in Cache Valley, Utah do recreate rather than where they do not. Through qualitative interviews and interactive mapping, thirty participants discussed what recreation means to them and explained their recreation site choices. Findings suggest that recreation as an activity done outside the home, for fun with others, leads participants to seek spaces with certain characteristics. Reconceiving recreation more broadly and framing it from the perspective of participants' choices can facilitate clearer understanding of differences and promote greater justice in resource provision and management.

AB  - In the 21st century the world has the technology, finance and the human capacity to end water scarcity and unleash another leap forward in human development. However, the lack of public information concerning water distribution, combined with the political influence of economic organizations and urban conurbations have historically led to the inequitable distribution of water resources throughout the world. The crisis of water is not a technical or scarcity-related problem but a management: and governance issue. This article examines the Latin American Water Tribunal (LAWT) which was created in 2000. This body is not a judicial tribunal, as its decisions are not binding. However, it represents an autonomous international quasi-judicial body where legal and ethical discussions concerning water management occur. This contribution will: 1) theoretically discuss the issue of social participation in water management, 2) examine the activities of the LAWT and its significance for social participation. 3) analyse the impact of the Tribunal on political mobilization in Guerrero, Mexico where rural communities have been protesting the Parota dam project and 4) discuss the need to create public spaces for democratic participation through multilayered governance that permit grassroots organizations to access decision-making processes concerning water management.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are currently being deployed in many European Commission Horizon 2020 projects in reaction to the increasing number of environmental threats, such as climate change, unsustainable urbanization, degradation and loss of natural capital and ecosystem services. In this research, we consider the application of NBS as a catalyst for social inclusivity in urban regeneration strategies, enabled through civic participation in the co-creation of green interventions with respect to social cohesion and wellbeing. This article is focused on a social monitoring framework elaborated within the H2020 CLEVER Cities project, with the city of Milan as a case study. Firstly, we overviewed the major regeneration challenges and expected co-benefits of the project, which are mainly human health and wellbeing, social cohesion and environmental justice, as well as citizen perception about safety and security related to the NBS implementation process. Secondly, we examined the relevance of using NBS in addressing social co-benefits by analyzing data from questionnaires against a set of five major indicators, submitted to citizens and participants of activities during pre-greening interventions: (1) Place, use of space and relationship with nature, (2) Perceived ownership and sense of belonging, (3) Psychosocial issues, social interactions and social cohesion, (4) Citizen perception about safety and security, and lastly, we analyzed (5) knowledge about CLEVER interventions and NBS benefits in relation to socio-demographics of the questionnaires' respondents. Thirdly, we cross-referenced a wind-rose multi-model of co-benefits analysis for NBS across the regeneration challenges of the project. Because of the COVID-19 emergency, in this research we mainly focused on site observations and online questionnaires, as well as on monitoring pre-greening scenarios in three Urban Living Labs (ULLs) in Milan, namely CLEVER Action Labs. Lastly, this study emphasizes the expected social added values of NBS impact over long-term urban regeneration projects. Insights from the pre-greening surveys results accentuate the importance of the NBS interventions in citizens' perceptions about their wellbeing, general health and strong sense of neighborhood belonging. A wider interest towards civic participation in co-management and getting informed about NBS interventions in the Milanese context is also noted.

AB  - Overtourism refers not only to situations in which carrying capacity levels have been exceeded, but also to those in which tourists and residents share negative feelings of discomfort and other emotions, loss of quality of life and unpleasant experiences in their activities of daily life. The growing number of places struggling with the problem of overtourism suggests that brand new approaches are required to minimize the effects of excessive tourism. However, the impacts of overtourism are place-specific and a one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate. Many destinations still have a considerable margin to manoeuvre but are nonetheless heading towards increasingly unsustainable levels of tourists per square kilometer. Such regions have time to take some pre-emptive measures based on principles of sustainable development using greener and energy-saving technologies. Over the past few decades, degrowth has arisen as an unorthodox approach based on principles of fairness and social and environmental justice. In certain areas, such as island economies, the economic dynamics remain largely dependent on the tourism sector, which forces the local actors to think and act differently. In this study, we analyze the strategies employed by Madeira to counter the negative effects of oversaturation in a pre-emptive way. The findings of this case study, based on the data at the county level, are enhanced by a panel data analysis of a number of relevant explanatory variables explaining the dispersion of tourists to the rural hinterland. The results suggest that the development of the rural hinterland has proven capable of exerting a progressively positive influence well beyond the borders of the rural hinterland by accommodating a growing share of the increasing numbers of tourists welcomed in the region in the 2002-2019 period, at the expense of the main capital city. This study confirms the importance and potential of the development of the rural hinterland to tackle overtourism in the main tourism areas. In terms of recommendations, it is suggested that local operators and policy-makers must develop efforts to research new ways to adopt energy-saving projects and develop tourisms products that incorporate eco-friendly behaviors.

AB  - Lead poisoning prevention requires knowledge of lead sources and of appropriate residential lead standards. Data are severely lacking on lead sources for Native American children, many of whom live in rural areas. Further, the relation of mining waste to blood lead concentrations (BPbs) of rural children is controversial. In collaboration with the eight tribes of northeastern Oklahoma, we assessed lead sources and their effects on BPbs for rural Native American and White children living in a former mining region. Venous blood lead, residential environmental (soil, dust, paint, water), and caregiver interview (e.g., hand-to-mouth behaviors, socioeconomic conditions) data were obtained from a representative sample of 245 children 1-6 years of age. BPbs ranged from 1 to 24 mug/dL. There were no ethnic differences in BPbs (p = 0.48) nor any patterns of excess lead sources for Native American or White children. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that mean soil lead, mean floor lead loading, mouthing behaviors, caregivers' education, and residence in former mining towns were all strongly associated with BPbs. Logistic regression results showed mean floor dust lead loading >10.1 pg/ft(2) (odds ratio [OR], 11.4; 95% confidence interval [0], 3.5-37.3), and yard soil lead >165.3 mg/kg (OR, 4.1; CI, 1.3-12.4) were independently associated with BPbs greater than or equal to10 mug/dL. We also found strong interactions between soil lead and poverty (p = 0.005), and dust and soil sources (p = 0.02). Our findings indicate that soil and dust lead derived largely from mining waste pose a health hazard to Native American and White children, and that current residential dust lead standards are insufficient to adequately protect children. Moreover, our finding that poor children are especially vulnerable to lead exposures suggests that residential standards should consider interactions among socioeconomic conditions and lead sources if environmental justice is to be achieved.

AB  - In North America, uranium workers are fighting for their right to participate in a free-market system that provides them with small personal benefits. These workers experience powerlessness, instability, and unpredictability - or social dislocation - by living amidst capitalism's polluted ecosystems, unstable economies, and disintegrating communities. However, they feel reliant on uranium for their livelihoods and strongly support the industry's renewal and form sites of acceptance to support industry renewal. Here, we explore the phenomenon of pro-neoliberal activism emerging in communities that identify with uranium markets and that trust in corporate self-regulation, private transparency, and the perceived benefits of potential economic development. Polanyian theory helps us analyze these curious socio-environmental outcomes. While social movements might be 'progressive,' 'regressive,' or otherwise diverge, Polanyi consistently characterized double movement activists as protecting communities and ecosystems from unstable, self-regulating market systems. But here we see something different and ask: First, how does pro-neoliberal activism contribute to the embedding and institutionalization of neoliberal regimes in uranium mining communities? Second, what structural mechanisms precede and help to facilitate socio-cultural support for free markets and corporate self-regulation, as opposed to support for re-embedding markets in local, public social protections for the US uranium industry?

AB  - In the United States, unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production has elicited strong public response. As production occurs amid residential and commercial spaces, environmental, social, economic, regulatory, and mental health impacts have been documented across locations. Some community groups have mobilized against this activity, whereas others have not. We examine how and why UOG production becomes normalized despite its disruptions and risks. Through years of fieldwork, we have observed limited organized mobilization. Even activists express hesitation to demand transformative changes or complete stoppage of UOG production. Yet the drivers of these dynamics need to be better understood. We argue that these passive "sites of acceptance" emerge through a two-part influence of neoliberalism. First, a mosaic of ideas and policy measures privileging deregulation and free markets manifests itself in a unique discourse we call collective neoliberalism. Second, neoliberalism as a system of governance creates a fractured, devolved regulatory environment ripe for regulatory capture and lacking sufficient resources. This, in turn, can discourage local efforts to limit or regulate UOG production as regulators seem unresponsive, poorly resourced, or tacitly more supportive of industry than the public. We use ethnographic data collected amid dense, widespread UOG production in Colorado to illustrate these patterns.

AB  - Over the past several decades, urban community gardens have arisen in diverse and economically compromised neighborhoods across the U.S. as part of multiple environmental justice efforts. Urban community gardens have enabled users to mitigate the effects of many environmental injustices such as the impact of food deserts, nutrient poor food found at convenience stores, and pesticide laden grocery items. While these benefits have promulgated across the U.S., community gardens are also well known to be located in historically contaminated locations in urban landscapes. These landscapes include former brownfield sites, superfund sites, and other abandoned spaces of contamination. Although environmental justice efforts to reclaim healthy food in urban community gardens are commendable, the presence and effects of potentially harmful contaminants is often overlooked as gardens are established. Further, governmental organizations tasked with protecting human health, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, have not established any health standards for urban community gardens. This creates many challenges in determining what is safe in community gardens, and garden mangers and users are often unaware of how severe the impacts of contamination may be or how to mitigate its effects. In this study, I highlight the prevalence of harmful concentrations of contaminants in urban community gardens in and near Seattle, Washington that are managed with organic practices. I then present the challenges and barriers to gardening in contaminated spaces. Finally, I make recommendations to address contamination in gardens spaces, and call for better regulatory standards and other forms of support to mitigate risk to users.

As one part of Indonesian Maritime culture in the development of social welfare and environmental justice, then the identification of workplace culture that supports the growth and performance of SMEs needs to be done in order to determine its impact on growth and poverty reduction efforts. This research using a descriptive-explanatory method with Cultural Organizational Assessment Instrument (OCAI). The population is the entire small business in the province of South Sulawesi. Criteria for small businesses based on the criteria according to Law Number 20 The year 2008 on Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises. Sampling was conducted using a purposive sampling of small medium enterprises in the province of South Sulawesi with the criteria; has been in operation at least 10 years old and showed a significant asset growth compared to the beginning of the establishment. Analysis of the data will show the type of organizational culture at this time and 5 years later.

AB  - Knowledge and perception of federal land-use decisions and policies among residents of poor rural areas in the United States have received little attention in the literature. The purpose of this study was to examine awareness of Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge and its programs as reported by the surrounding public in rural southern Illinois. A snowball or referral chain sampling technique was used to gain access to minority and low-income segments of a diverse rural population. Study findings reveal that race and distance of residence from the refuge mattered in southern Illinois residents' awareness of the refuge. Lack of broad-based awareness and program attendance were assessed in terms of distributive and procedural equity. Comprehensive and sustained efforts at more effective communication with all local residents, particularly minority residents, will be necessary to achieve the goal of environmental justice in planning and delivery of future refuge programs and services.

AB  - Objectives. This study (1) investigates the relationship of nonmalignant respiratory disease to underground uranium mining and to cigarette smoking in Native American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White miners in the Southwest and (2) evaluates the criteria for compensation of ethnic minorities. Methods. Risk for mining-related lung disease was analyzed by stratified analysis, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression with data on 1359 miners. Results. Uranium mining is more strongly associated with obstructive lung disease and radiographic pnuemoconiosis in Native Americans than in Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. Obstructive lung disease in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White miners is mostly related to cigarette smoking. Current compensation criteria excluded 24% of Native Americans-who, by ethnic-specific standards, had restrictive lung disease and 4.8% who had obstructive lung disease. Native Americans have the highest prevalence of radiographic pneumoconiosis, but are less likely to meet spirometry criteria for compensation. Conclusions. Native American miners have more nonmalignant respiratory disease from underground uranium mining,and less disease from smoking, than the other groups, but are less likely to receive compensation for mining-related disease.

AB  - Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) are a policy tool for local governments to gain more control over unconventional oil and gas development. MOUs ideally empower local governments to minimize potential risks by negotiating more stringent best management practices directly with the operators, who benefit from a more stable regulatory landscape. This study investigates the energy justice dimensions of these MOUs as they were negotiated in the midst of community conflicts in Colorado. By comparing two communities whose local governments differently managed the public meetings, our analysis points to the significance of the everyday practices of government representatives for promoting recognition and procedural justice. We track the expressions of trust and mistrust expressed by the "interested public" who actively participated in the meetings to better understand the shifting relationships among those citizens, state and local government, and industry. In the community where local government representatives facilitated recognition and procedural justice, the conflict ended with stronger expressions of trust in that government than in the other community. Expressions of trust in industry and state government remained negative or worsened in both communities.

AB  - Increased exposure to air pollution has been connected with environmentally-linked diseases (increased morbidity), decreased lifespan (increased mortality), environmental injustices (inequitable distribution of pollution based on population characteristics), reduction of quality-of-life, and increased health care costs. The main goals of this study are to explore the possibility that specific populations (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities, less-educated populations, lower income populations) suffer from increased chronic exposure to PM2.5 from local stationary sources when compared to other populations in the context of environmental justice as well as to compare methods of exposure estimation. Fine particulate matter exposure from stationary sources in New York City was estimated using proximity analysis and air dispersion modeling. The characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of these techniques were compared and contrasted. The results of both analyses suggested the presence of environmental injustices, although the relationships appeared complex and non-linear. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neighborhood environments are believed to contribute to negative health outcomes; however, accurately measuring area attributes remains challenging. The objective of this research is to quantify the presence of (or lack of) environmental injustices characterized by the geographic distribution of neighborhood stressors related to the built and social environment in the South Bronx that may contribute to poor health outcomes. Objective environmental audits were collected and coded for over 2,000 block faces. Physical and social indices were calculated. Bivariate correlations and spatial regressions revealed potential environmental injustices related to the distribution of social and physical environmental stressors at the local level. This novel dataset has many future applications in the effort to understand the connection between health, environmental justice, and location.

AB  - This article reviews the relationship between mining and water governance with an emphasis on Latin America. Focusing on the last decade, it identifies three major shifts in global mineral relations: (1) changes to corporation-community relations, most noticeable in corporate social responsibility projects; (2) changes to state-society relations, where there has been a simultaneous strengthening of international support for community rights and a reassertion of the nation-state through so-called 'resource nationalism'; and (3) challenges to the notion of 'community,' which must now stretch to encompass small-scale and artisanal miners. While examining each of these thematic shifts, the paper draws out the relationship between mining and water, suggesting that attention to the 'alloyed waterscape' of global mining would provide a compelling conceptual lens through which to explore dynamics that transcend scales and institutional divides.

AB  - In light of the Aichi target to manage protected areas equitably by 2020, we ask how the conservation sector should be incorporating concerns for social justice. We focus in particular on 'recognition', because it is the least well understood aspect of environmental justice, and yet highly relevant to conservation because of its concern with respect for local knowledge and cultures. In order to explore the meaning of recognition in the conservation context, we take four main steps. First, we identify four components of recognition to serve as our analytical framework: subjects of justice, the harms that constitute injustice, the mechanisms that produce injustices, and the responses to alleviate these. Secondly, we apply this framework to explore four traditions of thinking about recognition: Hegelian intersubjectivity, critical theory, southern decolonial theory, and the capabilities approach. Thirdly, we provide three case studies of conservation conflicts highlighting how different theoretical perspectives are illustrated in the claims and practices of real world conservation struggles. Fourthly, we finish the paper by drawing out some key differences between traditions of thinking, but also important areas of convergence. The convergences provide a basis for concluding that conservation should look beyond a distributive model of justice to incorporate concerns for social recognition, including careful attention to ways to pursue equality of status for local conservation stakeholders. This will require reflection on working practices and looking at forms of intercultural engagement that, for example, respect alternative ways of relating to nature and biodiversity.

AB  - Petrol has been extracted from Achuar territory in the Northern Peruvian Amazon since the 1970s. In spite of early identification of negative impacts on the environment and repeated attempts by the Achuar to improve conditions, very little research has been done on specific environmental and health impacts. Some recent governmental studies have shown extremely high blood lead and cadmium levels in Achuar communities. In this paper we apply an environmental justice framework to review the evidence of pollution and health status available in existing studies, as well as government and operating company actions over the last 30 years. We identify gaps in our knowledge which hamper efforts to respond to the environmental and health situation, as well as negligent actions on the part of the State and petrol companies.

AB  - One of the causes of the increasing number of ecological distribution conflicts around the world is the changing metabolism of the economy in terms of growing flows of energy and materials. There are conflicts on resource extraction, transport and waste disposal. Therefore, there are many local complaints, as shown in the Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJatlas) and other inventories. And not only complaints; there are also many successful examples of stopping projects and developing alternatives, testifying to the existence of a rural and urban global movement for environmental justice. Moreover, since the 1980s and 1990s, this movement has developed a set of concepts and campaign slogans to describe and intervene in such conflicts. They include environmental racism, popular epidemiology, the environmentalism of the poor and the indigenous, biopiracy, tree plantations are not forests, the ecological debt, climate justice, food sovereignty, land grabbing and water justice, among other concepts. These terms were born from socio-environmental activism, but sometimes they have also been taken up by academic political ecologists and ecological economists who, for their part, have contributed other concepts to the global environmental justice movement, such as 'ecologically unequal exchange' or the 'ecological footprint'.

AB  - In August 2018, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg started to strike from school on Fridays to protest against a lack of action on the climate crisis. Her actions sparked a historically large youth movement, leading to a series of school strikes across the world. Over the course of one week in September 2019, striking school children, students and other grassroots movements, such as Extinction Rebellion, called for everyone to participate in a global Climate Strike. This paper is based on comparative research with climate protesters in six cities: Brighton and London (United Kingdom), Montreal (Canada), New Haven and New York (USA), and Stavanger (Norway). Based on original interviews with 64 protesters, the study examines their knowledge, emotions, motivations, and actions in relation to climate change, including any lifestyle changes they have undertaken before or after their protests. Our findings show that protesters have varying degrees of knowledge about climate change, and have taken a range of actions in their own lives to address climate change. They also manifest a wide spectrum of emotions about climate change, and different motivations for taking part in climate strikes. These features are under-studied and dynamically evolving at the present conjuncture. On this basis, we call for expanded academic attention to human, emotional, epistemic, and seemingly mundane aspects of climate protests, their structural tendencies and relational expressions, and the implications for our ability to address underlying drivers.

AB  - Notions of cosmopolitan and environmental citizenship have emerged in response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But even if there are obligation of egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or obligations of environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as obligations of global or environmental citizenship. through identifying a core concept of citizenship, 1 suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that obligations of justice, even then they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as obligations of citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the obligations of environmental justice which it identifies as obligations of ecological citizenship, and the other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objection.

AB  - Japan's civic environmentalism combines a tradition of local protest and activism with a national environmental movement that is limited in size and policy influence. A strong legislative and administrative response to the country's severe pollution crisis of the 1960s and 1970s helped tamp down that era's wave of protests and keep the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in power. While the state has generally supported local organizations engaged in environmental improvement activities, it has erected barriers that limit the scope of non-governmental organization (NGO) activities and inhibit the development of an influential national environmental movement. The 1990s reforms, inspired in part by the citizen response to the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, made it easier for NGOs to attain legal status and raise funds. Yet Japan's civic environmentalism - by most measures - still lags well behind that of peer industrialized countries. The 2011 tsunami and nuclear crisis brought another opportunity for major reforms to the nation's civic environmental culture - but the evidence to date indicates that the much anticipated transformation is turning out to be of a lesser magnitude than many had initially expected.

AB  - PM2.5 is an air pollutant that is widely associated with adverse health effects, and which tends to be disproportionately located near low-income communities and communities of color. We applied a community-engaged research approach to assess the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in the context of community concerns and urban features within and around the city of Santa Ana, CA. Approximately 183 h of one-minute average PM2.5 measurements, along with high-resolution geographic coordinate measurements, were collected by volunteer community participants using roughly two dozen low-cost AtmoTube Pro air pollution sensors paired with real-time GPS tracking devices. PM2.5 varied by region, time of day, and month. In general, concentrations were higher near the city's industrial corridor, which is an area of concern to local community members. While the freeway systems were shown to correlate with some degree of elevated air pollution, two of four sampling days demonstrated little to no visible association with freeway traffic. Concentrations tended to be higher within socioeconomically disadvantaged communities compared to other areas. This pilot study demonstrates the utility of using low-cost air pollution sensors for the application of community-engaged study designs that leverage community knowledge, enable high-density air monitoring, and facilitate greater health-related awareness, education, and empowerment among communities. The mobile air-monitoring approach used in this study, and its application to characterize the ambient air quality within a defined geographic region, is in contrast to other community-engaged studies, which employ fixed-site monitoring and/or focus on personal exposure. The findings from this study underscore the existence of environmental health inequities that persist in urban areas today, which can help to inform policy decisions related to health equity, future urban planning, and community access to resources.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is an environmental neurotoxicant that has been associated with a wide range of adverse health conditions, and which originates from both anthropogenic and natural sources. In California, the city of Santa Ana represents an urban environment where elevated soil lead levels have been recently reported across many disadvantaged communities. In this study, we pursued a community-engaged research approach through which trained "citizen scientists" from the surrounding Santa Ana community volunteered to collect soil samples for heavy metal testing, a subset of which (n = 129) were subjected to Pb isotopic analysis in order to help determine whether contamination could be traced to specific and/or anthropogenic sources. Results showed the average Pb-206/Pb-204 ratio in shallow soil samples to be lower on average than deep samples, consistent with shallow samples being more likely to have experienced historical anthropogenic contamination. An analysis of soil Pb enrichment factors (EFs) demonstrated a strong positive correlation with lead concentrations, reinforcing the likelihood of elevated lead levels being due to anthropogenic activity, while EF values plotted against Pb-206/Pb-204 pointed to traffic-related emissions as a likely source. Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios for samples collected near historical urban areas were lower than the averages for samples collected elsewhere, and plots of Pb-206/Pb-204 against Pb-206/(207) showed historical areas to exhibit very similar patterns to those of shallow samples, again suggesting lead contamination to be anthropogenic in origin, and likely from vehicle emissions. This study lends added weight to the need for health officials and elected representatives to respond to community concerns and the need for soil remediation to equitably protect the public.

AB  - PM2.5 is an air contaminant that has been widely associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health, leading to increased hospital admissions and mortality. Following concerns reported by workers at an industrial facility located in Santa Ana, California, workers and community leaders collaborated with experts in the development of an air monitoring pilot study to measure PM2.5 concentrations to which employees and local residents are exposed during factory operating hours. To detect PM2.5, participants wore government-validated AtmoTube Pro personal air monitoring devices during three separate workdays (5 AM-1:30 PM) in August 2021. Results demonstrated a mean PM2.5 level inside the facility of 112.3 mu g/m(3), nearly seven-times greater than outdoors (17.3 mu g/m(3)). Of the eight workers who wore personal indoor sampling devices, five showed measurements over 100 mu g/m(3). Welding-related activity inside the facility resulted in the greatest PM2.5 concentrations. This study demonstrates the utility of using low-cost air quality sensors combined with employee knowledge and participation for the investigation of workplace air pollution exposure as well as facilitation of greater health-related awareness, education, and empowerment among workers and community members. Results also underscore the need for basic measures of indoor air pollution control paired with ongoing air monitoring within the Santa Ana facility, and the importance of future air monitoring studies aimed at industrial facilities.

AB  - Officials replaced safe water sources with contaminated water sources for tens of thousands of people living in Flint, Michigan, from April 2014 to October 2015. Overwhelming evidence indicates that the officials knew the water was potentially harmful to residents' health and property. This unfathomable disregard for the residents of Flint sparked national outrage and prompted criminal charges as well as multiple civil suits. Residents' civil claims included two strands of substantive due process: that the actions infringed residents' fundamental liberty rights to bodily integrity and to state protection from harmful acts by third parties, and that the government actions "shocked the conscience." The litigants also raised equal protection arguments that government targeted the community based on race and poverty. This Article makes three claims. First, it asserts that fundamental rights and equal protection arguments that challenge the denial of uncontaminated water face the serious, perhaps insurmountable obstacles that plague any call for new or expanded constitutional rights. Constitutional law is clunky and often formalistic. Doctrine and principles of judicial restraint here militate against categorically elevated judicial scrutiny-which we call thick rights strategies-of these and similar public officials' actions. Moreover, the thick rights strategies may entail liability questions that are not-as yet-judicially manageable. Second, it asserts that "shocks the conscience" arguments offer a viable alternative to a thick rights strategy. Properly understood, this test enforces a liberty baseline, even absent a fundamental right or suspect classification. This thin rights test is properly reserved for worst-case scenarios, not for garden-variety government blunders. Flint qualified. Third, it argues that this constitutional baseline liberty may apply to all environmental cases in which shocking government conduct elides established fundamental rights or suspect classification categories. Invoking it would not open judicial floodgates or risk undue judicial intrusion into regulatory matters better left to other government branches. It would maintain a difficult-to-flunk but critical liberty limit on extreme official disregard for human wellbeing and environmental justice. It also would provide space for the development of a potential fundamental right to uncontaminated water while allowing public airing of the serious harms to life, the failure of government processes, the citizen powerlessness, and the grave environmental harms that threaten multiple communities but impose their most horrific costs on the most vulnerable people. The Flint tragedy offers a constitutional cautionary tale that should be noted and heeded. "The Flint water crisis is a story of government failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction, and environmental injustice."(1)

AB  - Marginalized communities lack full participation in social, economic, and political life, and they disproportionately bear the burden of environmental and health risks. This special issue of Environmental Engineering Science, the official journal of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP), reports research on the unique environmental challenges faced by historically marginalized communities around the world. The results of community-based participatory research with an Afro-descendant community in Columbia, Native American communities in Alaska, United States, villagers in the Philippines, disadvantaged communities in California, United States, rural communities in Mexico and Costa Rica, homeless encampments in the San Diego River (United States) watershed entrepreneurs in Durban, South Africa, and remote communities in the island nation of Fiji are presented. The research reported in this special issue is transdisciplinary, bringing engineers together with anthropologists, sociologists, economists, and public health experts. In the 13 articles in this special issue, some of the topics covered include inexpensive technologies for water treatment, novel agricultural strategies for reversing biodiversity losses, and strategies for climate change adaptation. In addition, one article covered educational strategies for teaching ethics to prepare students for humanitarian engineering, including topics of poverty, sustainability, social justice, and engineering decisions under uncertainty. Finally, an article presented ways that environmental engineering professors can engage and promote the success of underrepresented minority students and enable faculty engaged in community-based participatory research.

AB  - Outdoor leisure experiences may represent an understudied yet effective pathway to promote connectedness to nature for urban park visitors. In contrast to outdoor recreation, this critical essay argues outdoor leisure more heavily emphasizes eudaimonic sentiments and intrinsic motivation in comparison with the goal-oriented and hedonic nature of outdoor recreation. It is further argued that two specific social psychological constructs, awe and solitude, may be especially useful in promoting leisure experiences in urban outdoor spaces. Relevant philosophical and social psychological literature is reviewed and synthesized to outline how land managers and environmental educators may facilitate experiences of awe and solitude to better promote contexts for experiencing outdoor leisure in urban parks. Specifically, reviewed literature suggests that utilizing the recreation opportunity spectrum framework and co-creative processes may be an effective path forward in better supporting urban park environments that are conducive to awe, solitude, and leisure. The review and synthesis of this research may ultimately guide environmental educators, land managers, and researchers in ways to more effectively support connectedness to nature via outdoor leisure experiences as an outcome for visitors to outdoor urban spaces.

AB  - In this commentary we trace an important change in the use of social licence for resource-intensive development projects. Social licence is shifting from an approach used by companies to improve relations with affected communities to a concept now used by environmental justice groups, non-governmental organisations and local communities to contest unpopular resource-intensive development projects. The term "going rogue" is a productive metaphor to explore this important change in the role of social licence. We focus on the different logics behind how social licence is being used by progressive groups to protest resource-intensive development, weak state policies and broader economic processes. We end by exploring what the shifting terrain for social licence means for the politics of resource extraction.

AB  - In contrast to well established techniques such as Environmental Impact Assessment and Whole Life Costing which have limited focus, Sustainability Assessment has multiple dimensions and often requires the incorporation of several intangible concerns, for example environmental justice and social capital. The complex social and political dimensions of decision-making for sustainability imply that traditional methods of participation and expert-dominated decision-making may not be the most appropriate approach. It has become imperative, therefore, to shift from this mechanistic viewpoint towards more deliberative democratic and perhaps iterative processes. This paper argues that Sustainability Assessment may be considered as an opportunity to put discursive mechanisms into action, thus empowering the civil society and enhancing local decision-making. Sustainability Assessment would thus be seen less as an analytical technique and more as a forum for dialogue with the potential for serving as a basis for avoiding or handling potential conflicts. One measure of its effectiveness could be its successes in consensus building. Such interactive processes provide opportunities for the participants to share each other's values. Through their involvement in this interchange of ideas and negotiations, the participants will become aware of each other's values, which may not be so obvious at the beginning of the process, thus making it easier to align goals and objectives. This extends the purpose of the democratic process from reaching a consensus to mutual social learning. The paper argues that the innovative and context-specific solutions required for realising sustainable development can emerge from democratic deliberative processes that form part of Sustainability Assessment. These deliberative processes will evolve as the participants learn from new and innovative approaches to sustainability development and assessment.

AB  - Manoomin, the Ojibwe word for wild rice, grows in shallow lakes and streams and provides physical, spiritual, and cultural sustenance as a sacred food and relative for Indigenous peoples across the Great Lakes region of North America. Unfortunately, Manoomin has been declining due to multiple environmental stressors. In 2018, an interdisciplinary group from the University of Minnesota came together with natural resource managers from tribes and inter-tribal organizations to understand Manoomin within its socio-environmental context. This partnership grew despite a history fraught with settler colonial structures of knowledge production and commodification. Based on lessons learned from building this transformational partnership, this paper describes ten tenets for responsible research: 1) Honor Indigenous sovereignty and rights; 2) Address past and present harms; 3) Be on the path together with researchers and Indigenous partners; 4) Recognize, respect, and value Indigenous participation and intellectual labor; 5) Encourage the robust exchange of ideas; 6) Recognize that documents formalizing a relationship are not the whole relationship; 7) Make a plan for identifying and protecting sensitive Indigenous data; 8) Be prepared to navigate institutional obstacles; 9) Seek, support, and collaborate with diverse students; and 10) Actively listen and be open to different ways of engaging with the world. These lessons can serve as tools to form accountable partnerships that enable robust, nuanced, and effective environmental science, policy, and stewardship.

AB  - Landfilling should be the last option in an integrated Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management approach. In the European Union (EU), the policy framework to protect the environment and the public health against the impact of health hazards related to urban solid waste management has been consistently implemented in recent decades. A growing interest in the negative impact of fires in waste landfills on the environment and people's health was reported in some European countries. In Italy, an increasing occurrence of arsons in MSW and landfills has been reported in recent years. During the summer of 2012, a multi-site arson occurred in the Palermo Municipal solid waste landfill of Bellolampo (western Sicily), giving rise to an environmental emergency of public health concern. Local health authorities reacted by creating an inter-institutional multidisciplinary task force with the aim to implement measures to prevent and control the risk of exposure by delimiting a protection area to be taken under strict monitoring. Environmental and epidemiological investigations were put in place by air, soil, and farm product sampling. A syndromic surveillance of the exposed population was conducted as well. The air monitoring stations system in place detected an increase in the concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like substances with the PM10 highest emission pick documented within the first 24 h and estimated at about 60 mu g/m(3). Levels of heavy metals above the limits permitted by law were detected in the top- and sub-soil samples collected within the two landfill sampling sites and also in other nearby sites. Non-conforming concentration values of dioxins and dioxin-like substances were detected in samples taken from farms, milk, and water. The health syndromic surveillance did not document any daily increase in the notification of emergency admissions related to acute respiratory diseases or any other health effect potentially related to the waste arson, but these findings were limited by the non-systematic collection of data. The experience reported in the present case report, as declined within the European Union policy framework and in the view of environmental justice, documented the need to structure a permanent collaboration between the different institutional actors involved in environmental and public health protection activities in order to develop specific protocols to manage events related to the occurrence of waste-related environmental emergencies or disasters.

AB  - New supranational environmental institutions, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the 'green' World Bank, reflect attempts to regulate international flows of 'natural capital' by means of an approach I call 'green developmentalism: These institutions are sources of eco-development dollars and of a new 'global' discourse, a postneoliberal environmental-economic paradigm. By the logic of this paradigm, nature is constructed as a world currency and ecosystems are recoded as warehouses of genetic resources for biotechnology industries. Nature would earn its own right to survive through international trade in ecosystem services and permits to pollute, access to tourism and research sites, and exports of timber, minerals, and intellectual property rights to traditional crop varieties and shamans' recipes. I contend that green developmentalism, with its promise of market solutions to environmental problems, is blunting the North-South disputes that have embroiled international environmental institutions. But by valuing local nature in relation to international markets-denominating diversity in dollars, euros, or yen-green developmentalism abstracts nature from its spatial and social contexts and reinforces the claims of global elites to the greatest share of the earth's biomass and all it contains. Meanwhile, the CBD has become a gathering ground for transnational coalitions of indigenous, peasant, and NGO opponents of 'biopiracy' and the patenting of living things, and advocates of international environmental justice. They have begun to put forward counterdiscourses and alternative practices to those of green developmentalism.

AB  - In this paper, we argue that a crossover class of climate change solutions (which we term "technological solutions") may disproportionately and adversely impact some populations over others. We begin by situating our discussion in the wider climate discourse, particularly with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Basel Convention. We then suggest that many of the most attractive technological solutions to climate change, such as solar energy and electric car batteries, will likely add to the rapidly growing stream of electronic waste ("e-waste"). This e-waste may have negative downstream effects on otherwise disenfranchised populations. We argue that e-waste burdens women unfairly and disproportionately, affecting their mortality/morbidity and fertility, as well as the development of their children. Building on this, we claim that these injustices are more accurately captured as problems of recognition rather than distribution, since women are often institutionally under-acknowledged both in the workplace and in the home. Without institutional support and representation, women and children are deprived of adequate safety equipment, health precautions, and health insurance. Finally, we return to the question of climate justice in the context of the human right to health and argue for greater inclusion and recognition of women waste workers and other disenfranchised groups in forging future climate agreements.

AB  - Just transition is a new framework of analysis that brings together climate, energy and environmental justice scholarships. It was originally coined as a term that was designed to link the promotion of clean technology with the assurance of green jobs. The Paris climate change agreement marks a global acceptance that a more rapid transition is needed to avert disastrous consequences. In response, climate, energy and environmental justice scholarships must unite in assessing where injustices will emerge and how they should be tackled. Just transition offers a new space for developing an interdisciplinary transition sensitive approach to exploring and promoting (1) distributional, (2) procedural and (3) restorative justice, termed here as a new triumvirate of tenets.

AB  - Objectives. To assess the extent to which drinking water violations in the United States differed on the basis of county race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status using the primary county served by the community water system (CWS) as the unit of analysis and to determine whether counties with higher proportions of underrepresented groups were disproportionately burdened with repeat violations. Methods. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate odds ratios of contextual environmental justice covariates associated with initial and repeat drinking water violations. We obtained violations from the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System. Results were nonstratified and stratified on the basis of population size served by the CWS. Results. Stratified multivariable logistic regression results revealed previously unobservable patterns in nonstratified findings. Minorities face significant challenges, including exposure to poor water quality. The most notable differences in both initial and repeat violations that we observed were among CWSs that serve large populations. Our most consistent finding was the positive association of initial and repeat violations with the proportion of those who were uninsured, irrespective of stratification. Conclusions. Greater efforts are needed to ensure that counties with higher proportions of minorities, uninsured households, and low-income households have access to safe drinking water, irrespective of the size of population served by the CWS.

AB  - In the context of a resurgence of civic activism to address climate change, we present findings from an exploratory research project on climate justice education (CJE). We conducted deliberative focus groups and interviews with activists, advocacy workers and educators in order to address three broad aims: to consider the ways in which different stakeholders conceptualise climate justice; to examine how teachers and activists perceive challenges to, and opportunities for, developing climate justice education; to explore the potential for recognising activism and civic engagement as an educational process, considering both activists' views on education and educators' views on activism in this context. Activists recognised the potential for CJE which is connected to social movements (especially youth-led movements), local communities, and addresses the affective dimensions of the climate crisis. Although our teacher participants shared some of the analyses of the activists, they were less well informed about climate justice as a concept and were more ambivalent about the prospect of learning through and from activism.

AB  - Internationally, globalization has been paradoxically translated into colonization. economic rationalist development, nationalism, and closure born of a fear of the implications of globalization and global markets for the least powerful countries, regions, and interest groups. Social problems in terms of the economic rationalist approach are increasingly individualized and citizenship models emphasize the responsibility of individuals and families. Many current human service and social policy models in Australia (as elsewhere) are nonsystemic (psychological, medical, education, crime prevention. and economic). The paper reflects on an experience of undertaking a study of the life chances of citizens in a remote region of Australia. This is a paper about doing systemic thinking and practice in Alice Springs (Mpwartwe, or caterpillar dreaming) as a social policy researcher attempting to use and advocating a participatory action research approach to social policy development based on a multisite, multimethod research design of perceived, expressed, and normative needs.

AB  - In many cities of the global North, city leaders are using greening as a way to compete in the globalized economy. Critiques of this development strategy typically focus on downtown areas, and many have noted that such processes often displace poor and working class people. Less studied are those areas that have not been fully incorporated into the postindustrial economy and where the struggles around social justice, economic development, and ecological restoration are still being played out. It is this insufficiently informed area of knowledge which this paper seeks to address and as to which we ask: What has been the impact of the green economy discourse in relatively more marginalized urban areas? Using industrial areas of Southeast Chicago and South Seattle as case studies, this paper draws on previously unreported qualitative data to argue that community efforts to promote environmental justice in these areas have the potential to redefine practices of green economic growth to incorporate social equity and community coherence. However, their ability to do so is constrained by the difficulty in challenging neoliberal discourses of the primacy of growth and the need of greening to benefit the consumer class. The paper contemplates the implications of the lessons learnt for greening cities in both developed and developing countries.

AB  - Monte Carlo methods are commonly used to assess the statistical significance of disease clusters. This usually involves permuting the observed outcome measure, such as the rate of disease, across the geographic units within the study area. When the variance of the disease rates is heterogeneous, however, randomizing the disease rate across the geographic units results in over-estimating the p-values in areas of low variance and under-estimating the p-values in areas of high variance. This bias results in under-ascertainment of clusters in urban areas and over-ascertainment of clusters in rural areas. As an alternative, randomizing the number of cases of disease or deaths proportional to the population at risk preserves the variance structure of the study area, therefore resulting in unbiased statistical inference. We compare results from randomizing rates with those from randomizing case counts, using county-level prostate cancer mortality data for the United States and ZIP-Code level prostate cancer incidence data for New York State, using the local Moran's I statistic.

AB  - Municipal airport owners and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regularly evaluate capacity and demand to decide if and when airports need more infrastructure. New infrastructure can alter the profile of noise, emissions, and land use, which may affect the quality of life for airport-adjacent communities. When the FAA and airport owners initiate infrastructure expansion, they must conduct environmental justice analysis to measure the distribution of negative externalities on nearby communities. This research investigates the environmental justice methodologies and narratives reported in planning documents for nineteen airport capacity expansions planned or deployed from 2000 to 2010 in the United States. The mixed-methods approach analyzes airport operations data, spatial demographic data, and planning artifacts to determine whether the environmental justice analyses were robust. This research proposes alternative metrics, the 'Risk of disproportionate impact' and 'Capacity strain', to further contextualize the presence of protected population groups alongside capacity needs. The main finding of the study is that the planning documents did not consistently detect environmental justice impacts, nor did they consistently confer importance to those impacts when high proportions of protected populations were detected. As a result, the social costs of collective airport expansion are unclear and likely underestimated. This study identifies two limitations that undermined the environmental justice analysis throughout the airport sample: (1) inconsistent methodological choices impeded the detection of impacts and, (2) narrative interpretations tended to 'null' the finding even when impacts were detected.

AB  - Much of the academic literature and policy discussions about sustainable development and climate change adaptation focus on poor and developing nations, yet many tribal communities inside the United States include marginalized peoples and developing nations who face structural barriers to effectively adapt to climate change. There is a need to critically examine diverse climate change risks for indigenous peoples in the United States and the many structural barriers that limit their ability to adapt to climate change. This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes' barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the Big Horn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture, which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater. Future climate projections suggest increasing temperatures, and changes in the amount and timing of snowpack, along with receding glaciers, all of which impact water availability downstream. Therefore, building capacity to take control of land and water resources and preparing for climate change and drought at Wind River Reservation is of critical importance.

AB  - In academic and policy discourse, the concept of urban resilience is proliferating. Social theorists, especially human geographers, have rightfully criticized that the underlying politics of resilience have been ignored and stress the importance of asking "resilience of what, to what, and for whom?" This paper calls for careful consideration of not just resilience for whom and what, but also where, when, and why. A three-phase process is introduced to enable these "five Ws" to be negotiated collectively and to engender critical reflection on the politics of urban resilience as plans, initiatives, and projects are conceived, discussed, and implemented. Deployed through the hypothetical case of green infrastructure in Los Angeles, the paper concludes by illustrating how resilience planning trade-offs and decisions affect outcomes over space and time, often with significant implications for equity.

AB  - In this article, we analyze the role of measurements practices in a public dispute about the impacts oft mining in the Netherlands. Drawing on studies of material participation and agential realism, we analyze how measurement practices shape he boundaries of subsurface objects . We detail how these boundaries become relevant for assessing mining impacts and show how this enables and constrains material participation. Simply put, if a process or thing is not measured into being, it cannot participate in negotiations about causality and impact. Our analysis shows that scientific conventions narrowly determined what measurements are credible and, consequently, limited the participation of other objects and processes in negotiations about damage and compensation. This underscores how ontological disagreements about the existence and measurability of subsurface processes affect what claims can be made . We conclude by discussing conditions for pluralist and equitable processes of material participation in measurement practices.

AB  - In landscape studies, at the turn of the twenty-first century, the concept of representation has been high on the agenda. Representation has often been understood as the expression of particular cultural politics of landscape, accentuating the socially biased and incomplete nature of textual and visual mediations of the world. In more recent work, it is possible to discern a shift from this emphasis on cultural representation to a fuller engagement with political representation. The concern here, crucially, is to understand representation as a core concept of justice, entwined with the social and material struggle over the right to landscape. In effect, to understand how landscapes materialise struggles over justice, an engagement with political representation is indispensable. As this paper elucidates, one potential consequence of the rediscovery of the political logic of representation is a rapprochement of landscape studies with environmental justice.

AB  - Objective. Methodological issues associated with the conventional statistical approach to environmental justice research, such as scale of analysis, continue to make assessments of environmental injustice problematic. Geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to facilitate multiscale analysis through the generation of statistical surface representations of both socioeconomic character and environmental risk. Methods. As a case study, U.S. Bureau of the Census and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data sets were used to generate statistical surfaces of socioeconomic character and environmental risk for the southeast Pennsylvania region. Results. Analysis of these statistical surfaces reveals that socioeconomic status decreases with proximity to, and density of, hazardous facilities. Conclusions. Further research calls for incorporating other relevant information, such as amount and toxicity of toxic release, into GIS-based statistical surface representations of risk.

Together, these examples have rich lessons to share around the importance of linking climate justice with racial justice; of combining strategies of resistance with those of creating alternative models; of maintaining focus on Black communities' connections with land, territory and Mother Earth; of recognising and creating space for women's leadership; and of intersectionality across geography and sector.

AB  - Land use is central to addressing sustainability issues, including biodiversity conservation, climate change, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable energy. In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science, the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The 10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits-"win-wins" are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping, and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed; and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioners toward meeting sustainability challenges in land use.

AB  - Inner-city universities are noteworthy in relation to food provisioning and consumption because of their locations and spatial characteristics. Among 18,500 university students surveyed by Universities Australia in 2017, one in seven reports being unable to eat in regular patterns. This finding suggests that it is important to explore how eating spaces at inner-city universities intersect with students' eating practices. Ethnographic work conducted over three semesters in Melbourne at RMIT University's city campus revealed that around 100 microwaves installed there were used by students to prepare food in ways that may support regular eating. The research included observations, focus groups, and digital ethnography. Analysis of the findings suggests that the university's eating spaces and their material arrangements are related to students' on-campus and off-campus practices. Using both Walker's interpretation of Sen's capability approach-the social practice capability framework-and Schatzki's site ontology, I propose that this relationship produces spaces of capability, encouraging and enabling varied activities such as using leftovers, bulk cooking, and buying discretionary foods less impulsively. The study and its use of the idea of spaces of capability may foster new insights about the ongoing challenge to ensure student wellbeing and to consider the relationship of student wellbeing to broader issues such as sustainable consumption and environmental justice.

AB  - In this paper I consider the concept of responsibility within sustainable consumption. The paper was inspired by interviews with individuals engaged in community action for sustainability, where respondents held a rather individualistic conception of responsibility. In order to develop a deeper understanding of responsibility I compare sustainable consumption, environmental justice and ecological citizenship literatures. This leads me to develop a new conceptual framework which explains responsibility in relation to the ecological footprint. This framework recognises both the responsibility of the individual for sustainable practice and the limitations on individual action due to their context. It also allows for differentiation between individuals' responsibilities given people's circumstances and their ability to engage with change.

AB  - Metropolitan New Orleans is unique because it has a universal blood lead (BL) screening dataset (n = 55,55 1) from 2000-2005 spatially coupled with a soil lead (SL) dataset (n = 5467) completed in 2000. We evaluated empirical associations between measurements of SL and BL exposure responses of children in New Orleans by stratifying the databases by Census Tracts and statistically analyzing them with pen-nutation methods. A consistent curvilinear association occurred annually between SL and BL with robust significance (P-values < 10(-23)). The mathematical model of the pooled BL datasets for 2000-2005 is: BL=2.038+ 0.172 x (SL)(0.5) (agreement (R) of 0.534, an r(2) of 0.528, and a P-value of 1.0 X 10(-211)) indicating that chance alone cannot explain the association. Below 100 mg/kg SL children's BL exposure response is steep (1.4 mu g/dL per 100 mg/kg), while above 300 mg/kg SL the BL exposure response is gradual (0.32 mu g/dL per 100 mg/kg). In 1995, the BL prevalence was 37% >= 10 mu g/dL for the most vulnerable poor and predominantly African-Arnerican children. In the era of universal screening the prevalence of elevated BL is 10 mu g/dL for the general population of children. The SL map describes community variations of potential BL exposure. If health effects occur at BL >= 2 mu g/dL, then 93.5% of the children in New Orleans are at risk. These results reinforce the proposal that prevention of childhood Pb exposure must include SL remediation as demonstrated by a New Orleans pilot project and a proactive Norwegian government program.

AB  - Objectives. To quantify nationwide disparities in the location of particulate matter (PM)-emitting facilities by the characteristics of the surrounding residential population and to illustrate various spatial scales at which to consider such disparities. Methods. We assigned facilities emitting PM in the 2011 National Emissions Inventory to nearby block groups across the 2009 to 2013 American Community Survey population. We calculated the burden from these emissions for racial/ethnic groups and by poverty status. We quantified disparities nationally and for each state and county in the country. Results. For PM of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or less, those in poverty had 1.35 times higher burden than did the overall population, and non-Whites had 1.28 times higher burden. Blacks, specifically, had 1.54 times higher burden than did the overall population. These patterns were relatively unaffected by sensitivity analyses, and disparities held not only nationally but within most states and counties as well. Conclusions. Disparities in burden from PM-emitting facilities exist at multiple geographic scales. Disparities for Blacks are more pronounced than are disparities on the basis of poverty status. Strictly socioeconomic considerations may be insufficient to reduce PM burdens equitably across populations.

AB  - Over the last two decades, resilience has steadily gained traction in discussions on the theory and practice of adaptation to climate change. The concept is widely considered useful for explaining how coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) resist climate-related stressors or undergo change. At the same time, however, there has been an upswell of critique on resilience and climate-resilient development, stemming most prominently from the quarters of political ecology and human geography. This article seeks to contribute to this literature by using the analytical lens of post-politics to critically evaluate resilience and climate-resilient development in a local adaptation context. Four major critiques are lodged against resilience: (1) its inability to sufficiently recognize the large-scale political, economic, and social forces affecting and effecting change, (2) its oversight of the analyzed systems' internal dynamics, (3) the depoliticized, techno-managerial nature of resilience-centered solutions, and (4) the theoretical vagueness of resilience as applied by development actors. The paper presents a grounded critique of the term based on empirical evidence collected through a quasi-ethnography of a climate change adaptation project implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the national government in Sao Tome and Principe. It is argued that resilience, despite its theoretical attractiveness and growing popularity among donors, continues to dehumanize development and renders adaptation post-political. The article also discusses alternative, more human-centered approaches rooted in vulnerability and climate justice, which offer a more nuanced lens through which to analyze climate impacts and the associated challenges that they pose at the local level.

AB  - In this article we discuss the development of hazardous waste co-incineration in cement kilns in Brazil as well as its impacts on health and the environment. Information was gathered through an extensive review on social and environmental impacts of co-incineration, and case studies, chosen after discussion with social movement representatives concerned with the co-incineration issue and related to the Brazilian Network on Environmental Justice, are described to illustrate the reality of co-incineration in Brazil. Studies showed that workers and community health suffers negative impacts from such practices in high-, middle- and low-income countries. In the Brazilian context, the institutional and social vulnerability intensifies these problems. To conclude, we argue for the necessity of increasing the institutional capacity of health and environmental agencies in Brazil, through staff training and better infra-structure. Additionally, we also propose a return of the debate about political and ethical aspects of industrial waste trade.

Responding to recent geographical critiques of environmental justice research and engaging with post-colonial studies of landscape and environment, we provide an account of environmental injustice that emphasises competing geographical imaginaries of landscape and ordinary political injustices' within everyday spaces. We begin with a discussion of how historical environmental injustices in Wales have been framed within nationalist politics as a form of colonial exploitation of the country's natural resources. We then make use of materials from recent research on opencast mining in South Wales to examine local understandings of and everyday encounters with mining, highlighting contradictory discourses of opencast mining, landscape and place, and the injustices associated with mining developments in this region.

AB  - In future urban energy systems, smart grid systems will be crucial for the integration of renewable energy. However, their deployment has moral implications, for example regarding data privacy, user autonomy, or distribution of responsibilities. 'Energy justice' is one of the most comprehensive frameworks to address these implications, but remains limited regarding smart grids, and regarding concrete guidelines for designers and policymakers. In this paper, we fill this gap by answering the following research question: How do design choices in smart grid projects impact energy justice? Thereby, four smart grid pilot projects are evaluated in a comparative qualitative case study research design. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a content analysis. Our findings contribute to the energy justice literature with insights regarding the design for distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. They underscore the importance of fairness in data governance, participatory design, user control and autonomy, technology inclusiveness, and the design for expansion and replication. Future research should explore the feasibility to govern smart grids as commons and the relationship between trust and perceptions of justice. We conclude with policy recommendations for funding future smart grid experiments and for facilitating the implementation of storage through electricity sector regulation.

AB  - Increasingly, resource managers and planners seek to manage forested landscapes for the value of the services they provide. This is especially true in the Mau Forest of Kenya, a montane area that harbors some of Kenya's most important headwaters but has lost a quarter of its forest cover since 1999. While managing for the Mau Forest's landscape services is a priority, it is critical to understand why and how people value these services differently. Otherwise, land management policies risk exacerbating rather than alleviating conservation and environmental justice problems. This is particularly true of provisioning services, a category of landscape services on which communities directly depend. This research combines participatory mapping and semi-structured interviews to understand how socio-cultural values of provisioning services are distributed across two sites within the Western Mau Forest and analyze linkages between mapped values, their locations, and influencing factors. In total, 55 informants were interviewed. Frequently listed provisioning services were water, firewood, cultivation, grazing, timber, and medicine. Results indicate that four main factors influence the location from where these services were derived: historical and legal arrangements, social relations, economic conditions, and biophysical conditions. How these factors influence where people value provisioning services differ based on the service and community in question. This study demonstrates that communities can use and value provisioning services differently and that the distributions of these services are influenced by the factors mentioned above. Understanding this heterogeneity can enable managers and policy makers to create local land use plans that account for spatially-explicit values.

AB  - Miller SE, Hayward RA, Shaw TV. Environmental shifts for social work: A principles approach The social work profession is rooted in a history of addressing the needs of vulnerable populations. Generally, however, this history has not extended to issues relating to the natural environment. Building on a framework of environmental justice, this article proposes a shift from the artificial separation of the social and natural environments in its person-in-environment focus to an expanded holistic understanding of the dynamic interplay between human society and the natural environment. It examines issues surrounding environmental and ecological justice, and proposes a principles approach to move the profession towards a paradigm of environmental justice using as its template the 17 Principles of Environmental Justice adopted by the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in the USA in 1991. It discusses the value of these principles in enhancing social work's capacity to address issues of environmental concern. It proposes that, with greater awareness of the effects of environmental issues on high-needs populations, the profession would be better able to balance environmental and human concerns.

AB  - In this paper, the focus is on land dispossession instigated by large corporations, and the way they produce spaces of colonial persistence through particular structures and sovereignty systems that differ from the state-based administrative settings in which they are located. The study looks at phenomena that can be observed on large agricultural estates, particularly in the Teita sisal plantation in Taita-Taveta county in Kenya. This is one of the largest sisal estates in the world, established during colonial times. It is a corporation that uses migrant workers to avoid potential conflicts with the neighbouring communities which still consider those fields to be their own ancestral land. Different working tasks are racialized, and functioning bodies are exploited as resources that have to be maximised. Inside the camp, life and work are regulated with meticulous biopolitical order in restricted conditions. Patrolled borders and gates maintain distance from the local communities who claim the estate is expanding, dispossessing them of land, roads and the river, and repositioning them as squatters on what they see as their ancestral land. In relation to this private company, the national state values its taxation contributions and does not question the exceptional conditions of exploitation of human and environmental resources occurring within that space. The estate was accessed in 2013 and interviews took place then and later. This case study reveals situations of oppression on both sides of the estate borders, including struggles that remain fragmented and hidden. There is a need for new solidarity linkages between groups confronting land and other resource dispossession on a wider scale, to support their political empowerment and rights to human and environmental justice.

AB  - Politics of public pedagogies that systemically obscured, ignored, and/or flat-out lied about COVID-19 realities that led to, and worsened, the global pandemic coincides with education that falsely justifies environmental violence, unsustainability, and dominance of Nature. I discuss how ecopedagogy, grounded in the popular education models of Paulo Freire, are essential to critically compare and contrast COVID-19 aspects with environmental issues to construct effective environmental pedagogies for critical literacy (i.e., ecopedagogical literacy) to disrupt and "unlearn" ideologies that sustain and intensify unsustainable acts of environmental violence. The following three disruptions are argued as essential for socio-environmental justice and planetary sustainability: disrupting Northern, dominate epistemologies that instills world-Earth distancing (i.e., "us" humans (anthroposphere) from the rest of Nature); disrupting "development" defined within neoliberal and neocolonial framings, including being solely grounded upon epistemologies of the North, and disrupting academic scholarship and structures that lead to the first two aspects needing disruptions as mentioned.

AB  - In this study, tribal members from an American Indian (AI) community in the midwestern United States used photovoice, a community-based participatory method, to document their perceptions and beliefs about water and health on their reservation. The study infused photovoice's seminal theoretical influences within an environmental justice framework to explore the impact of environmental changes in water on human health and well-being. Study participants included two men and nine women who self-identified as tribal members and either worked or lived (or both) on their tribe's reservation. During the photovoice project, participants took photographs and engaged in face-to-face interviews using the SHOWeD technique to reflect on the images they had captured. An In Vivo coding method was used to code the data using participants' own words, followed by a thematic analysis to contextualize the codes within the cultural realities of the tribal community. Study findings detail how water is fundamental to the lives of the AI study participants and expose the scope of health concerns they have related to water circumstances on their reservation. The article concludes with a discussion about the use of photovoice with AI communities and implications of using the method for social work practice and research.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this research were to examine the relationship between water insecurity and Indigenous health and highlight the social and environmental justice implications water insecurity has for practice, policy, and research with Indigenous communities. Study design: A literature search design was used. Methods: A review of the concepts of water insecurity within an Indigenous context is described through three illustrative case studies. Results: For Indigenous people, water takes on a much greater significance as it is connected to the culture, identity, and livelihoods of Indigenous communities. Although a vast range of determinants influence Indigenous health, water continues to be an integral component of Indigenous health globally. Conclusions: Water is a finite resource, and it is anticipated that water insecurity will grow as water resources are stressed and become scarcer globally. Having safe sustainable water resources by itself will not necessarily result in significant health improvements as there are many other factors involved. However, safe, sustainable water resources are a necessity for health, and health equity is a prerequisite for social and environmental justice for Indigenous people.

AB  - Objective. Much of the environmental justice research has focused on outcome-the relative location of hazardous facilities and low-income or minority populations. While presenting a snapshot of contemporary inequities, these studies fail to demonstrate some of the underlying causes that produced such outcomes. One question is whether the facility was located initially in a minority or low-income community or if minority and low-income populations came to live around the facility over time. This article examines demographic changes in areas near hazardous facilities to ascertain which came first. Methods. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), major South Carolina TRI facilities were classed as urban, suburban, or rural. The racial and income characteristics of host areas surrounding these facilities were traced from the establishment date of the facility through 1990. These results were compared statistically against state data for the same time period. Results. At the time the facilities were established, there were no statistically significant relationships between race and location except for a few host areas that had significantly lower percentages of minority residents than the state average. The results for income were mixed, with only rural host areas having income levels generally lower than the state average; income levels in suburban and urban host areas were generally equal to or higher than the state average income. By 1990, all host areas except rural areas had significantly higher minority percentages than the state. All host areas except urban areas had significantly lower income levels than the state in 1990. Conclusions. These results indicate that the facilities came first. While inequitable situations may exist currently, the process by which they came about is more likely explained by state and regional migration patterns and market dynamics.

AB  - In the wake of the recent unjustifiable deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and several other African Americans at the hands of police, we have witnessed persistent and widespread protests against systemic racism, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed African Americans and Latinos at two to three times the rate of Whites. Racism is undeniably an evil, pervasive, destructive force in our society, yet it can also be a great motivating force. This essay is a personal story of how being the subject of racism led one person to acquire and leverage his professional privilege to help create and change institutions to act on climate and environmental injustices while countering the systemic racism that he witnessed and experienced in childhood.

AB  - In the 1980s, engineers developed new ways to use one of humanity's oldest fuel sources-wood-to create electrical power. This article uses envirotechnical analysis to examine the development of a wood-burning power plant in Flint, Michigan, and argues that when public officials began working with major energy corporations to build industrial biomass facilities in the 1980s and 1990s, new energy technologies designed to run on renewable fuels became part of an entrenched fossil fuel-based power structure that maintained deep historical inequalities. Like other examples of environmental injustice, the burdens of industrial-scale biomass power systems tended to fall on poor, nonwhite communities. By exploring the creation of the Genesee Power Station as part of an envirotechnical regime in Flint, this research seeks to develop conceptual bridges between the history of technology, environmental history, and environmental justice, and demonstrates the use of history to inform contemporary debates about sustainability.

AB  - Methods to assess wood-based bioenergy projects have tended to focus on technological and physical constraints. Less is known about how longer-term environmental, economic, and social systems-the three pillars of sustainable development-have influenced technological development in the context of woody biomass energy. This research offers new methods for assessing the sustainability of wood-based energy projects by combining spatial analysis, semi-structured interviews, and archival data analysis. By integrating quantitative and qualitative methods, this project offers ways to understand how social and environmental dynamics from the past shape technological development in the future. A propensity analysis of biomass energy plants in Michigan, USA was performed using US Census data grouped by social, economic, and environmental categories. This quantitative analysis helped to characterize community and landscape types in which woody biomass plants were developed in Michigan in the late-twentieth century. To help illustrate some of the often-hidden social and political dimensions of energy development, such as access to decision-making and attitudes toward bioenergy projects, transcripts of public hearings, media coverage, and other archival sources were examined, and 30 stakeholder interviews were conducted. By integrating these qualitative and quantitative approaches, this paper aims to provide a more comprehensive approach to assessing the sustainability of wood-based biofuel technologies.

AB  - Innovation is needed to develop rural water supply to support sub-Saharan Africa communities that are hard to reach. The purpose of this study was to critically review rope and washer pumps that have been installed on manually drilled boreholes in 48 communities as part of a pilot project in Rumphi District, Malawi, and which serve as a sustainable source of drinking water from both technical (water quality and functionality) and social (user satisfaction) perspectives. At each water source, an infrastructure checklist was used (n = 48); 10 users were interviewed (n = 472); and, if the pump had water, water quality samples were collected (n = 24). The results show that use of a professional driller does not guarantee a functioning rope and washer pump that produces safe water. Where the pumps were functional, most provided safe drinking water. However, only 8% (4/48) of pumps had good water quality, a flow rate of >20 L/min and a full consensus of positive satisfaction among users. Pumps are not necessarily working better or worse in more remote areas. A process of introducing and creating evaluative guidelines for new (approved) technologies for rural water supply has not been established in Malawi. Sub-Saharan African governments need to be open to innovative solutions while making sure that standards, including those for functionality, water quality, user satisfaction, private operators, and human capacity for local government regulators, are being followed to ensure safe water for rural communities.

AB  - National-level studies examining racial disparities around hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities have been very influential in defining the academic and political debates about the existence and importance of "environmental injustice." However, these studies tend to employ methods that fail to adequately control for proximity between environmentally hazardous sites and nearby residential populations. By using GIS and applying methods increasingly used in environmental inequality research that better control for proximity, we conduct a comprehensive reassessment of racial inequality in the distribution of the nation's hazardous waste facilities. We compare the magnitude of racial disparities found with those of prior studies and test competing racial, economic, and sociopolitical explanations for why such disparities exist. We find that the magnitude of racial disparities around hazardous waste facilities is much greater than what previous national studies have reported. We also find these disparities persist even when controlling for economic and sociopolitical variables, suggesting that factors uniquely associated with race, such as racial targeting, housing discrimination, or other race-related factors are associated with the location of the nation's hazardous waste facilities. We further conclude that the more recent methods for controlling for proximity yield more consistent and definitive results than those used previously, and therefore argue for their wider utilization in environmental inequality research.

AB  - Indications point to exacerbated socio-economic inequalities and/or the emergence of new ones from climate-adaptive interventions in urban form, such as green and blue infrastructure (GBI), adaptive land uses, and urban design measures. We combine a systematic review and content analysis to review 136 peer-reviewed articles (published between 2008 and 2020) on urban climate justice in adaptation in order to: (1) review the emergence of the discourse on climate justice's pillars (i.e., distributive, procedural, and recognitional justice) vis-`a-vis urban climate adaptation; (2) investigate the correlations between climate justice and the adaptive urban form interventions (GBI, adaptive land uses, and urban design measures); and (3) identify the spatial and scalar connections between the climate justice pillars and the adaptive urban form interventions. The findings reveal several trends, including: a deficit of empirical studies that deploy the climate justice pillars for assessing adaptive urban form interventions; an overemphasis on normative suggestions and/or critiques without clarifying "how" to advance climate justice; a dearth of urban design discussions on climate justice; a particular lack of connections between recognitional justice and urban form; and last, a dearth of studies that investigate the justice outcomes of adaptive urban form interventions across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Mobile systems for detecting environmental threats may radically restructure spatial imaginaries as people learn to see and engage with heretofore largely hidden dimensions of urban spaces. While the design of such technological systems is contingent and currently open to varied outcomes, powerful security and industry players are asserting their influence to set overriding protocols that will ensure widespread ambient data collection, especially for security and commercial applications. This paper critically explores the emergent power geographies of surveillance revealed by one such system: the Department of Homeland Security's Cell-All project. This project, which has been under development at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since 2007, equips mobile phones with chemical-agent detectors and links them to security networks so that threats to urban populations can be automatically detected and rapidly mitigated. In order to assess the politics of crowdsourced sensing systems, first we map the core characteristics of the Cell-All development model: creating a participatory system, building public-private partnerships, and outsourcing responsibility for privacy protections. Second, we describe some alternative designs for mobile, participatory environmental sensing and reflect on their potentials for correcting power inequalities or achieving environmental justice. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of these various systems and the conditions that could alter their outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nature conservation and social equity issues have been approached in a myriad of ways by conservation, humanitarian, and development practitioners. The rapid and shifting urbanization of the globe makes the interaction of these issues paramount and it is imperative to articulate pathways to harmonizing these relationships readily followed by conservation practitioners. We describe the processes and compare the resulting social equity and conservation objectives of two initiatives purposefully integrating these approaches. A private nonprofit seeking to develop an urban conservation program in the Atlanta metropolitan area purposefully engaged residents from surrounding communities and self-identified local and sector leaders to identify communities where social equity and conservation objectives could be created together. A public agency, built on a century-long history of environmental stewardship for migratory birds and pollinators, integrated 20 years of participatory action research to engage the surrounding communities using methods suggested and developed by the communities themselves. In both cases, community-based research approaches have helped establish cocreated objectives and flexible monitoring and evaluation baselines. Both initiatives found a need to appropriately resource and train staff to remain open to learning and evolving new objectives as additional perspectives emerge and the impact on conservation and equity objectives is assessed.

AB  - More than 150,000 low-income women perform domestic work in Bogota, Colombia. They are captive public transit commuters, traveling from low-income to high and middle-income residential sites for work. However, the transport system between these neighborhoods suffers from missing links. Hence, domestic workers spend more time commuting to work relative to any other urban worker in Bogota. Moreover, the system affects domestic workers' overall health conditions, where they inhale high doses of air contaminants. In the face of laws and policies in place perpetuating patriarchy, violence, and segregation, these poor and often-racialized women face a conundrum: they must ensure their livelihood facing pervasive health hazards. This paper analyzes the lived realities of domestic workers in terms of their commutes and the environmental hazards they face, depicting grounded legal geography. Fundamentally, it examines how legally constituted housing markets and related transportation infrastructure contribute to highly gendered and class-based geographical divides, placing domestic workers into the spatial and policy periphery and making their bodies disposable, but obliging them to negotiate these divides using inadequate and death-delivering transportation infrastructure. Finally, it reflects on the city's planning methods that often ignore important gender, social, and economic considerations. Based on a mixed-methods approach, the paper brings material that is not often placed together, including a study of exposure to particulate matter, transportation, and legal analysis, decentering current ontologies by connecting law, environment, public health, gender, and class divides, and grounding legal geography on the daily commuting experiences of domestic workers.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this research is to geographically model airborne lead emission concentrations and total lead deposition in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) from 2006 to 2013. Further, this study characterizes the racial and socioeconomic composition of recipient neighborhoods and estimates the potential for IQ (Intelligence Quotient) loss of children residing there. Methods: Lead emissions were modeled from emitting facilities in the DMA using AERMOD (American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model). Multilevel modeling was used to estimate local racial residential segregation, controlling for poverty. Global Moran's I bivariate spatial autocorrelation statistics were used to assess modeled emissions with increasing segregation. Results: Lead emitting facilities were primarily located in, and moving to, highly black segregated neighborhoods regardless of poverty levels-a phenomenon known as environmental injustice. The findings from this research showed three years of elevated airborne emission concentrations in these neighborhoods to equate to a predicted 1.0 to 3.0 reduction in IQ points for children living there. Across the DMA there are many areas where annual lead deposition was substantially higher than recommended for aquatic (rivers, lakes, etc.) and terrestrial (forests, dunes, etc.) ecosystems. These lead levels result in decreased reproductive and growth rates in plants and animals, and neurological deficits in vertebrates. Conclusions: This lead-hazard and neighborhood context assessment will inform future childhood lead exposure studies and potential health consequences in the DMA.

AB  - Over the last two decades, economic restructuring has re-shaped both society and space, resulting in changes to urban form and an explosion in the number of brownfield sites. Increased socio-economic exclusion and the emergence of dualisms has become characteristic of the most recent period of industrialisation and has many policy implications for brownfield regeneration. This paper documents the early redevelopment of Dublin Docklands, highlighting the weaknesses of legislation and the increased social exclusion that has emerged. It is argued that by adopting the principle of environmental justice and by explicitly agreeing to legally binding broad-based development objectives, economic, physical and social rejuvenation can be simultaneously and successfully achieved.

AB  - Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) and politics are common themes in environmental justice. However, insights garnered from the experience of the global north cannot be applied directly to the global south since local processes shape unique landscapes of waste. To this end, my fieldwork in Oaxaca de Juarez, a rapidly urbanizing city in southern Mexico, concentrates on the history and politics of MSWM in the area. Here, the livelihood struggles of local neighborhoods are imbricated with the management of the existing official municipal dump. I argue that it is the marginality of these neighborhoods, both physical and social, that makes it possible for them to block the flow of municipal trash and so reveal it to visitors, residents, and politicians. This case presents a reworking of traditional concepts of environmental justice by examining the contradictory processes of abjection and political activism particular to the global south.

AB  - In the last several decades, garbage strikes have taken place around the world. In this article, I examine the case of garbage strikes in Oaxaca, Mexico, a rapidly growing city. Here, garbage, which is normally considered a hazard, is revealed also to be an effective political tool for people demanding "rights to the city." Processes of modernization that have produced an expectation of cleanliness in modern cities have, at the same time, relied on production and consumption patterns that create more and more garbage. It is this inherent contradiction that provides a space for marginalized people to use garbage as a political tool.

AB  - In this article, I critically review important concepts in new geographies of waste. I focus on both the conceptual frameworks that are used to examine issues concerning waste and the political possibilities produced by understanding waste differently. By plotting a range of concepts of waste along two axes - positive versus negative definitions of waste, and dualist versus relational concepts of waste and society - I contextualize scholarship on waste within the broader discussion about the 'rematerialization' of geography and social science. Understanding when, how, and why waste matters provides a fruitful lens for examining contemporary sociospatial processes.

AB  - In this study, we conducted a citation network analysis of intersectionality scholarship. We aimed to elucidate content domains in this scholarship's citation network. In addition, we explored a citation-based genealogy of this scholarship, attending to the representation of women of color identified in prior critical analyses of intersectionality scholarship as key but under-acknowledged contributors to intersectional thought and praxis. We used CitNetExplorer to analyze a network of 17,332 records and 60,132 citation links. The analysis yielded 17 clusters, with the five largest clusters focusing on (1) conceptualizing intersectionality theory, methodology, and analysis; (2) psychology, identity stigma, and multiple minority statuses; (3) sociology of gender inequality, labor markets, and organizations; (4) political science, political systems and policy, including in the European context; and (5) violence against women, gender and health, and health equity. Although some of the key women of color contributors to intersectional thought were among the most cited authors in the network, others were cited infrequently or not at all across the network and clusters. Taken together, the analyses revealed substantial and ongoing engagement with efforts to define and refine intersectionality as epistemology and methodology. However, the analyses pointed to the need for scholars to reengage with, cite, and follow the examples of the women of color who contributed to intersectional thought by actually doing intersectional praxis that directly advances social justice aims. Some of the smaller clusters in the citation network reflected content domains, such as environmental justice and community planning, ripe for such activist-scholar work.

AB  - Longstanding inequities in science education across the lines of race and class remain the most intractable problem in the field. Justice-centered science pedagogy is introduced as a theoretical framework built on the traditions of critical pedagogy and culturally relevant pedagogy to address these inequities as components of larger oppressive systems. This study examines how a justice-centered advanced chemistry class in an urban neighborhood high school supported students to succeed academically while taking up urgent issues of social and environmental justice identified by their communities. The findings include evidence that curriculum organized around an issue of environmental racism supported academic achievement that exceeded the expectations of a typical high school chemistry course. The findings also document how the curriculum provided opportunities for students to move beyond academic achievement to position themselves as transformative intellectuals. As transformative intellectuals, students demonstrated complex thinking about science and social justice issues, cultivated their commitment to their communities and cultures of origin, and developed credibility as local youth knowledgeable in science. These findings have implications for teachers, teacher educators, and educational researchers who wish to engage with science education as a catalyst for social transformation.

AB  - Past research on "environmental justice" has often failed to systematically link hazard proximity with quantifiable health risks. The authors employ recent advances in air emissions inventories and modeling techniques to consider a broad range of outdoor air toxics in Southern California and to calculate the potential lifetime cancer risks associated with these pollutants. They find that such risks are attributable mostly to transportation and small-area sources and not the usually targeted large-facility pollution emissions. Multivariate regression suggests that race plays an explanatory role in risk distribution even after controlling for other economic, land-use, and population factors. This pattern suggests the need for innovative emissions reduction efforts as well as specific strategies to alter the spatial and racial character of the environmental "riskscape" in urban centers.

AB  - One central question of climate justice is how to fairly allocate remaining 'carbon space' or a global emissions budget. Some commentators hold that the idea of fairness is hopelessly equivocal on this point. Others claim that we need a complete theory of distributive justice to answer the question. This paper argues that on the contrary, given only weak assumptions about fairness, we can show that fairness requires an allocation that is at least as 'prioritarian' as the equal per capita view. Since even the equal per capita view is more prioritarian than is politically feasible, fairness is univocal enough for all practical purposes.

AB  - In this article I argue that countries exporting fossil fuels, such as Australia, have an obligation to bear some of the costs of the harms caused by the use of those fuels. I argue that there is an analogy between other harmful exports - medical waste, tobacco, unsafe jobs, uranium - and fossil fuels. If this is the case, then current methods for allocating emissions and responsibilities for their harms are inadequate and more complex than they appear. I consider several counter-arguments to this claim, such as that it does not recognise the benefits of coal and that exporters are not really responsible. Finally, I consider some of the consequences of this argument and claim that Australia and other fossil fuel exporters ought to have a higher carbon budget' if this argument is true and that exporters ought to bear a higher share of the costs of climate harms.

AB  - Many energy cases suffer from social opposition. It is increasingly asserted that paying due attention to the moral values involved in controversial energy cases may increase social acceptance. Value-sensitive design (VSD) has been recommended as a promising approach for addressing moral values in controversial energy cases. This paper aims to empirically explore the applicability of VSD in controversial energy cases by investigating the extent to which it is possible to identify the relevant values, norms and design requirements in the Groningen gas controversy (the Netherlands) using values hierarchies. It was found in this case that the relevant values, norms and design requirements could be retrieved, but that two conditions need to be fulfilled to avoid underexposure of relevant values. Firstly, data should be collected using a variety of data sources. Secondly, these sources should be analyzed through both top-down approaches and bottom-up approaches. We find that 'Safety' is a critical value in the Groningen case, while other critical values are related to securing 'Procedural Justice'. Strikingly, the important procedural values 'Trust' and 'Honesty' did not translate into concrete policies. Policy makers can use values hierarchies to address moral values in energy cases and to translate these values into concrete measures.

AB  - Originating among the Yoruba' of West Africa, Ifa is an ancient spiritual system that spread throughout the globe due to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. But over the past 50years because of a desire among various racial and ethnic groups, Ifa has grown and is seen as a world religion'. Within Ifa resides the Orisha, representational forces serving the greater force of the Universe. Urban and rural natural environments are sacred spaces for practitioners as tourists to interact and communicate with these forces to intercede in their daily lives. This article will present the underlying environmental ethics of the system of Ifa and how it informs nature-based tourism and interactions with nature for both leisure and spiritual development. What is presented is a continued broadening of our understanding of differing cultural views, norms and behaviours with nature that has been initiated by Native-American-based scholarship.

AB  - Many households in the United States face issues of incomplete plumbing and poor water quality. Prior scholarship on this issue has focused on one dimension of water hardship at a time, leaving the full picture incomplete. Here we complete this picture by documenting the full scope of water hardship in the United States and find evidence of a regionally-clustered, socially unequal nationwide household water crisis. Using data from the American Community Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency, we show there are 489,836 households lacking complete plumbing, 1,165 community water systems in Safe Drinking Water Act Serious Violation, and 21,035 Clean Water Act permittees in Significant Noncompliance. Further, we demonstrate this crisis is regionally clustered, with the specific spatial pattern varying by the specific form of water hardship. Elevated levels of water hardship are associated with the social dimensions of rurality, poverty, indigeneity, education, and age-representing a nationwide environmental injustice. Proper water and sanitation access remains an issue for many in the United States. Here the authors estimate and map the full scope of water hardship, including both incomplete plumbing and water quality across the country.

AB  - Low-cost sensors can provide insight on the spatio-temporal variability of air pollution, provided that sufficient efforts are made to ensure data quality. Here, 19 AirBeam particulate matter (PM) sensors were deployed from December 2016 to January 2017 to determine the spatial variability of PM2.5 in Sacramento, California. Prior to, and after, the study, the 19 sensors were deployed and collocated at a regulatory air monitoring site. The sensors demonstrated a high degree of precision during all collocated measurement periods (Pearson R-2 = 0.98 - 0.99 across all sensors), with little drift. A sensor-specific correction factor was developed such that each sensor reported a comparable value. Sensors had a moderate degree of correlation with regulatory monitors during the study (R-2 = 0.60 - 0.68 at two sites). In a multi-linear regression model, the deviation between sensor and reference measurements of PM2.5 had the highest correlation with dew point and relative humidity. Sensor measurements were used to estimate the PM2.5 spatial variability, finding an average pairwise coefficient of divergence of 0.22 and a range of 0.14 to 0.33, indicating mostly homogeneous distributions. No significant difference in the average sensor PM concentrations between environmental justice (EJ) and non-EJ communities (p value = 0.24) was observed.

AB  - Non-governmental air quality monitoring networks include low-cost, networked air pollution sensors hosted at homes and schools that display real-time pollutant concentration estimates on publicly accessible websites. Such networks can empower people to take health-protective actions, but their unplanned organization may produce an uneven spatial distribution of sensors. Barriers to acquiring sensors may disenfranchise particular social groups. To test this directly, we quantitatively examine if there are social inequalities in the distribution of sensors in a non-governmental air quality monitoring network (PurpleAir) in Los Angeles County, California. We paired sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey and estimates of PM2.5 concentrations from the USEPA's Downscaler model at the census tract level (n = 2203) with a sensors per capita (SPC) variable, which is based on population proximity to PurpleAir sensors (n = 696) in Los Angeles County. Findings from multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEEs) controlling for clustering by housing age and value reveal patterns of environmental injustice in the distribution of PurpleAir sensors across Los Angeles County census tracts. Tracts with higher percentages of Hispanic/Latino/a and Black residents and lower median household income had decreased SPC. There was a curvilinear (concave) relationship between the percentage of renter-occupants and SPC. Sensors were concentrated in tracts with greater percentages of adults and seniors (vs. children), higher occupied housing density, and higher PM2.5 pollution. Results reveal social inequalities in the self-organizing PurpleAir network, suggesting another layer of environmental injustice such that residents of low-income and minority neighborhoods have reduced access to information about local air pollution.

AB  - Mobility systems raise multiple questions of justice. Work on mobility justice and policy often treats different elements of the debate separately, for example focussing on environmental justice or accessibility. This is problematic as it can privilege policy solutions without a full view of the winners and losers and the values implicit in that. Using analysis of current policy, we investigate how mobility justice can reconcile its different components, and find two major consequences. First, is doubt about the justice of the existing policy approach which tries to tackle transport pollution primarily through a shift to low emission vehicles. This approach privileges those with access to private vehicles and further privileges certain sets of activities. Second is a need to reassess which basic normative ideas should be applied in mobility justice. Work on mobility justice has tended to appeal to conceptions of justice concerned with access to resources including resources enabling mobility. These conceptions say little about how resources should be used. We show that avoiding stark inequalities means collectively thinking about how resources are used, about how we value activities involving mobility, and about what sorts of goods and services we create.

AB  - Neighborhood built environment features, including parks, may contribute to social capital, but these relationships have not been adequately explored in communities of color. Our study focused on a specific subset of this population-a national sample of diverse, low-income parents with young children (n = 1,611)-to assess relationships between social capital, parks (e.g., access, visit frequency, and satisfaction), and other aspects of the built environment (e.g., perceptions of neighborhood walkability, traffic, and crime). We found that park satisfaction (a measure of park quality) was strongly linked to social capital among low-income parents, but park use frequency and access (both related to park quantity) were not. Neighborhood walkability and safety from crime were also strong positive correlates of social capital. Despite social benefits of parks, moderate to low ratings of park satisfaction, neighborhood walkability, safety from crime, and social capital within our sample suggest that inequities in park and neighborhood quality may prevent families who might benefit the most from social capital (i.e., low-income minority populations) from enjoying key resources needed to cultivate it. Cities hoping to enhance social capital in vulnerable communities would be wise to invest in quality parks and built environment features that create opportunities for positive social interactions among low-income parents with young children.

AB  - In shrinking cities, with large populations of low-income and people of color, redeveloping vacant lots can improve access to the benefits of greenspace, but also spur or accelerate gentrification. Understanding people's viewpoints on gentrification and vacant lot redevelopment in shrinking cities is important, especially as these perspectives may differ depending on people's socioeconomic conditions and proximity to these spaces. One common development of vacant lots is into parks. As such, we assessed people's beliefs and attitudes about gentrification, their levels of support of park development in low-income areas, and differences based on presence of vacant lots in their neighborhood, through an online survey of residents in St. Louis, Missouri-a shrinking city (N = 521). We found that respondents valued investments in their neighborhood, including park development. Specifically, respondents supported signs of gentrification from those investments, but also supported preserving neighborhoods-a potentially contradictory viewpoint. When comparing by proximity to vacant lots, we found some differences in respondents' views. Further, respondents' beliefs and attitudes about gentrification influenced their support for different types of development, particularly building parks in formerly vacant lots, if there were not vacant lots present in their neighborhood. Among residents living near vacant lots, beliefs about neighborhood change were unrelated to their attitudes toward gentrification or support of park development-suggesting that abstract beliefs about neighborhood change are not salient to their attitudes and support. These findings have implications for urban planning and community engagement, particularly in shrinking cities where legacies of environmental racism endure.

AB  - Justice issues have been prominent in the environmental debate since its beginning in the second half of the twentieth century. This is not surprising, because environmental crises highlight our conceptions of justice, challenging us to consider their adequacy as well as their implications. Does current justice theory accurately describe the issues raised by environmental threats, especially about the justice for future generations? What are the implications of perceptions of justice or injustice for responses to environmental problems, up to and including social protest? For the most part, environmental social sciences have not been at the forefront of these debates, despite some very important contributions. The goal of the present issue is, therefore, to bring together researchers in the field of environmental psychology and justice research and to provide a forum for current research in the field of environmental justice. This introduction gives a short overview of past, present, and emerging findings and questions.

AB  - Poorer communities tend to be located within lower quality natural environments, experiencing greater environmental burdens and fewer environmental amenities. To date, analysis of environmental inequalities has focussed on pollution, with less attention given to natural environment benefits that support human wellbeing. Here, the ecosystem service concept which identifies these benefits, and the natural capital (NC) which provides them, is applied within environmental inequality assessment. For England, 325 local authority districts were classified based on 14 indicators of NC, and the level of deprivation of districts within each class compared. Districts with extensive woodland or agriculture are the least deprived. The most deprived districts tend to be urban areas with lower extent and quality of NC, coastal districts, and rural uplands with extensive coverage of various higher quality NC. These findings demonstrate that the distribution of NC varies by social deprivation, with implications for social inequities and sustainable management of NC. However, whilst higher deprivation is often associated with a lower extent and quality of NC, this pattern is not consistent for all NC types or places. Given the lack of a consistent pattern of inequality nationally, this implies that equitable management of ecosystems should be driven at a local level. To achieve this, the relationship between environmental benefits and deprivation should be assessed at this level and analysis should move beyond NC to address the ecosystem services that flow from it.

AB  - In the epidemiological literature, the impact of environmental pollution on cardiac mortality has been well documented. There is, however, a paucity of evidence on the impact of air pollution exposure on ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality among the Asian aged population. In response, this research seeks to investigate the degree of proximity between exposure to ambient PM2.5, household PM2.5, ground-level ozone (O-3), and IHD mortality in the top seven Asian economies with the highest aging rates. This investigation is held in two phases. In the first phase, grey modeling is employed to assess the degree of proximity among the selected variables, and then rank them based on their estimated grey weights. In addition, a grey-based Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (G-TOPSIS) is adopted to identify the key influencing factor that intensifies IHD mortality across the selected Asian economies. According to the estimated results, South Korea was the most afflicted nation in terms of IHD mortality owing to ambient PM2.5 and ground-level O-3 exposure, whereas among the studied nations India was the biggest contributor to raising IHD mortality due to household PM2.5 exposure. Further, the outcomes of G-TOPSIS highlighted that exposure to household PM2.5 is a key influencing risk factor for increased IHD mortality in these regions, outweighing all other air pollutants. In conclusion, this grey assessment may enable policymakers to target more vulnerable individuals based on scientific facts and promote regional environmental justice. Stronger emission regulations will also be required to mitigate the adverse health outcomes associated with air pollution exposure, particularly in regions with a higher elderly population.

AB  - Payment for Environmental Service programs are increasingly applied in communal settings where resource users collectively join the program and agree to limit their shared use of a common-property resource. Who decides to join PES and the degree to which community members agree with the collective decision is critical for the success of said programs. Yet, we have limited understanding of the factors that influence communal participation and the collective decision process. This paper examines communal participation in a national payment for conservation program in Ecuador. We use quantitative and qualitative analysis to (i) identify the attributes of the communities that participate (or not), and factors that facilitate participation (n = 67), and (ii) assess household preference and alignment with the collective decision to participate (n = 212). Household participation preferences indicate varying degrees of consensus with the collective decision to participate, with those using the resource less likely to support participation. At the communal level, however, our results indicate that over time, those communities that depend more heavily on their resource systems may ultimately choose to participate. Our findings suggest that communal governance structures and outside organizations may be instrumental in gaining participation in resource-dependent communities and building consensus. Findings also point to the need for further research on communal decision-processes to ensure that the collective decision is based on an informed and democratic process.

AB  - Landscape-change studies have attracted increasing interest because of their importance to land management and the sustainable livelihoods of rural communities. However, empirical studies on landscape change and its drivers are often poorly understood, particularly, in small rural communities in developing countries such as South Africa. The present study surveyed local community livelihoods and perceptions of landscape change in the Nzhelele and Levuvhu river catchments in Limpopo Province, South Africa. These areas have experienced land reform and are also characterized by environmental degradation, poverty, inequality and environmental justice concerns among other issues. Land-cover maps derived from Landsat satellite imagery were used for purposes of correlating and validating the survey data findings and results. The survey results showed that education levels, working status and marital status have statistically significant effects on community livelihoods (indicated by levels of income, p < 0.05). Maize, fruits and vegetables are the main cultivated crop varieties in the study area, and these crops are mainly used for subsistence to meet household self-consumption requirements. Moreover, local community members and stakeholders argue that the landscape has changed over the past 20 years mainly as a result of urban expansion, deforestation, agricultural diversification and forestry intensification. These landscape changes were largely confirmed by the land-cover change maps derived from satellite imagery. Soil erosion as a result of landscape changes was identified as a major threat and hazard in the study area. Political, natural, economic and cultural factors have been identified as the major underlying drivers for the observed landscape changes. These results have implications for understanding landscape change, coupled with human-nature relationships as well as informing government policy with respect to advancing land management and further promotion of the sustainable livelihoods of rural communities. Overall, the study proposes a multiple stakeholders' approach and ecosystem-based approach to promote the sustainable management of landscapes in rural areas.

AB  - On 24 October 2018, Super Typhoon Yutu devastated the Mariana Islands with 185 km/hr winds, unnaturally exposing the ongoing consequences of United States' colonialism and disaster militarism. Yutu also revealed the local Indigenous responses as resilience rhetorics, characterized by relationality, responsibility, reciprocity, and justice. This essay argues that U.S. media perpetuation of disaster militarism surrounding Yutu must be understood alongside reverberating Indigenous resilience. First, it outlines the Mariana Islands as a U.S. colony; then, it examines U.S. media and the production of ignorance around empire and militarism; and finally, it concludes with Mariana Islands fieldwork to consider how resilience is rhetorically manifested and locally mediated to challenge colonial power, disaster militarism, and to enact Indigenous environmental justice.

My aim is not to unpack every concept contained herein but rather to provide a provocative introductory synthesis of five big ideas about Anthropocene mobility for further discussion. 1) We are living in the Kinocene, 2) The ontology of our time is an ontology of motion, 3) We need a new movement-oriented political theory to grapple better with the mobile events of our time. We need a kinopolitics, 4) Climate change is a weapon of primitive accumulation. 5) The Kinocene presents us with the danger of new forms of domination (a new colonialism, a new climate capitalism, new states, and new borders) but also with the opportunity for a new revolutionary sequence.

AB  - Local residents often oppose some types of facilities because of their negative side effects, even though they are claimed to be necessary for the public good. These facilities are known as locally unwanted-land-uses, and local opposition to them is often referred to as not-in-my-backyard, usually with a pejorative connotation. However, some studies have challenged this conventional view of local opposition. Given these conflicting views, the present article explores how local mobilisation should be evaluated, focusing particularly on distributive justice. First, the study illuminates how different interpretations of distributive justice lead to difference in views on local opposition. Then, by comparing three waste disposal facility cases in Japan, a distinction between cost sharing and cost overlapping cases is illuminated. The study further develops discussions by pointing out the limits of using this distinction to evaluate local opposition movements and provides insights that can contribute to a fuller understanding of siting conflicts.

AB  - Objectives. We examined the factors that affect access to municipal water and sewer service for unincorporated communities relying on wells and septic tanks. Methods. Using a multisite case study design, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 25 key informants from 3 unincorporated communities in Hoke, New Hanover, and Transylvania counties, North Carolina, July through September 2013. Interviewees included elected officials, health officials, utility providers, and community members. We coded the interviews in ATLAS. ti to identify common themes. Results. Financing for water and sewer service emerged as the predominant factor that influenced decisions to extend these services. Improved health emerged as a minor factor, suggesting that local officials may not place a high emphasis on the health benefits of extending public water and sewer services. Awareness of failed septic systems in communities can prompt city officials to extend sewer service to these areas; however, failed systems are often under-reported. Conclusions. Understanding the health costs and benefits of water and sewer extension and integrating these findings into the local decision-making process may help address disparities in access to municipal services.

AB  - It is increasingly evident that climate change is intersecting in complex ways with the more traditional drivers of migration, such as poverty and conflict. Yet there remains a startling lack of international agreement on how to address the issue. This article examines the problem climate change-related migration poses in terms of international responsibility and provides a review of two approaches to addressing this challenge. First, the idea that migration in the context of climate change requires the development of a new international protection agreement and, second, the argument that migration should be managed and mitigated through in situ adaptation and development programmes These approaches differ in terms of how they understand the relationship between migration and climate change and thus differ also in terms of how they situate responsibility and address issues of climate justice. This paper explores these differences and outlines the benefits and challenges of both. Following this, we turn to the case of New Zealand's immigration tribunal appeals involving claims for climate-refugee status and look at how in situ adaptation, development narratives and arbitrary risk thresholds have been used to legitimise the denial of these claims. Throughout the article, we ask to what extent these approaches acknowledge climate justice, and we conclude by looking at ways that climate (mobility) justice might be better incorporated into solutions that prioritise the needs of migrants in the context of rapid climate change.

AB  - It is widely known that prolonged exposure to high levels of traffic noise has several health effects. While scholarship in environmental justice has explored the environmental equity hypothesis in a wide range of areas, whether the spatial distribution of traffic noise is equitable among different racial and socioeconomic groups has rarely been explored, especially in the United States. This article addresses this lacuna by examining this relationship in the Twin Cities Metro Region, Minnesota. Traffic data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation were used to model the propagation of traffic noise over the study area and aircraft noise contour lines were added to account for aircraft noise. Inequities associated with exposure to chronic traffic noise were investigated using selected demographic and socioeconomic variables from the U.S. Census 2000. Statistical analysis was based on a regression model that addressed spatial autocorrelation. Results indicate that there is an association between noise levels and household income, median household value, the percentage of non-white residents, and the percentage of the population less than 18years of age.

AB  - In a perspective derived from actor-network theory (ANT), 'risk' can be considered as a specific assemblage of heterogeneous entities as well as a proliferation of hybrids. The concept and ideas of ANT offer a meaningful approach to addressing the hybridity and heterogeneity of complex assemblages of risk. Furthermore, the theory provides a theoretical vocabulary to analyse settings of risk and disasters. Especially for ex post analysis of disasters, ANT is able to identify errors in process chains and management practice. In this regard, it deals with questions of stability/instability in management and organisations within the broader context of risk governance. The article discusses the following questions from an ANT perspective: What is 'risk' and how can it be managed? What are the general implications and benefits of an ANT approach to disaster risk management? In what ways does an ANT approach challenge some of the conventional wisdoms in the field of disaster risk management? The article shows the potential of ANT as an analytical tool in disaster risk management and as a tool for planning, design and decision-making.

AB  - Nationally, 80% of pedestrian fatalities occur in urban environments, yet the distribution of injuries across urban areas is not uniform. Identifying street-level risk factors for pedestrian injury is essential for urban planning and improvement projects, as well as targeted injury prevention efforts. However, creating and maintaining a comprehensive database of a city's traffic safety infrastructure can be cumbersome and costly. The purpose of this study was to create and validate a neighborhood environmental observational assessment tool to capture evidence-based pedestrian safety infrastructure using Google Street View (GSV)-The Inventory for Pedestrian Safety Infrastructure (IPSI). We collected measures in-person at 172 liquor stores in Baltimore City from June to August 2015 to assess the tool's reliability; we then collected IPSI measures at the same 172 locations using GSV from February to March 2016 to assess IPSI reliability using GSV. The majority of items had good or excellent levels of inter-rater reliability (ICC >= 0.8), with intersection features showing the highest agreement across raters. Two scales were also developed using exploratory factor analysis, and both showed strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >= 0.6). The IPSI provides a valid, economically efficient tool for assessing pedestrian safety infrastructure that can be employed for a variety of research and urban planning needs. It can also be used for in-person or GSV observation. Reliable and valid measurement of pedestrian safety infrastructure is essential to effectively prevent future pedestrian injuries.

AB  - In this essay, Kim Niewolny, current President of AFHVS, responds to the 2020 AFHVS Presidential Address given by Molly Anderson. Niewolny is encouraged by Anderson's message of moving "beyond the boundaries" by focusing our gaze on the insurmountable un-sustainability of the globalized food system. Anderson recommends three ways forward to address current challenges. Niewolny argues that building solidarity with social justice movements and engendering anti-racist praxis take precedence. This work includes but is not limited to dismantling the predominance of neoliberal-fueled technocratic productivism in agricultural science and policy while firmly centering civil society collective action and human rights frameworks as our guiding imaginary for racial, gender, environmental, and climate justice possibilities for sustainable food systems praxis. She concludes by exploring the epistemic assertion to push beyond our professional and political imaginaries to build a more fair, just, and humanizing food system.

AB  - In the last decade or so, inequality studies have assumed renewed prominence across the social sciences. In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.

AB  - Over 24 million plastic bags are consumed in Kenya monthly. More than half of the bags end up in the solid waste stream. Plastic bags now constitute the biggest challenge to solid waste management in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya and home to three million people. As a result, plastic bag waste has attracted great political and public attention, especially because the waste has myriad unique environmental problems. This paper seeks to unravel the problem of plastic bag waste in Nairobi through an urban political ecological perspective. Urban political ecology has done much to excavate economic, political, and cultural processes, as well as ecological dynamics that create and re-create urban environments. Little has been done in this context with respect to urban solid waste problems, with the exception of urban political ecology of environmental justice. However, research done within the context of urban political ecology of environmental justice has mainly focused on solid waste problems in the Western World, particularly USA. Drawing on research conducted in Nairobi, as well literature on business and politics, and solid waste management in Kenya, this paper examines the nature of plastic bag waste problem, its political-economic roots and implications for environmental justice.

AB  - Objective. This article gleans important lessons for environmental justice (EJ) policy from the empirical literature and demonstrates them using EJ analyses of Superfund sites. It constructively critiques the EJ literature and suggests some future directions for designing policy and framing the discourse. Methods. The research methods of many quantitative EJ studies are reviewed. To demonstrate sensitivity to researchers' choices, logit models are estimated to explain the nationwide distribution of Superfund sites (and deletions from the NPL) using various spatial scales, control variables, and definitions of proximity. Results. Most empirical EJ studies examine cross-sectional distributions for aggregated demographic measures, dwelling on the implied counterfactual or causal mechanism briefly, if ever. The EJ analysis for Superfund sites exhibits much sensitivity to modeling choices and to whether environmental conditions or policy impacts are modeled. Conclusions. The findings highlight the limitations of conventional EJ research designs. Several implications for the design of EJ policy are drawn, emphasizing the importance of clarity about counterfactuals and which sorts of impacts are relevant. Principles for a revised EJ policy framework are proposed.

AB  - Numerous hedonic price analyses estimate price effects associated with hazardous waste site remediation or other environmental variation. This paper estimates a neighborhood transition model to capture the direct price effect from Superfund site clean-up and the indirect price effects arising from residential sorting and changes in investment in the housing stock following clean-up. First-difference models of neighborhood change and a national sample are used. This approach fails to find consistent positive direct price effects. Positive indirect effects, however, may arise through residential sorting and neighborhood investment spurred by remediation. The findings can be sensitive to policy endogeneity and model specification.

AB  - Much as the contemporary understanding of world trade is often based on simple models where two countries engage in trade, so is world trade in fuel commodities typically conceived as consisting of either net-importing or net-exporting countries. However, by paying attention to the structure of world trade, represented by actually occurring trade flows between the actors in such networks, it becomes evident that the structures of such networks are far more complex than intuitively understood. In this chapter, role-analytical tools from social network analysis are applied to bilateral fuel commodity trade flows between 85 countries. Using a novel heuristic for identifying ties between role-equivalent sets of actors, this chapter maps the structure of fuel commodity trade by looking at both the value of such trade flows as well as the non-monetary energy dimension of such flows. Comparing these structural maps with a typological Galtung-style core-periphery structure shows significant similarities, although at a resolution that reveals the existence of 6-8 different roles, expanding the simple, intuitive distinction between net-importers and net-exporters.

AB  - Individuals originating in different neighborhoods fare differently in later life. Part of this is because families sort non-randomly over the urban landscape; different types of families live in systematically different neighborhoods. Another part of the explanation is that children in different neighborhoods are exposed to different urban opportunity structures. The opportunity structure can exert its influence through social interactive, environmental and institutional factors. Using a multi-level framework applied to a Norwegian register-based data set with complete coverage of 1986-1992 cohorts with siblings, we decompose the variation in high school completion and in enrollment in higher education at age 22 into variances at the levels of family and neighborhood occupied at age seven. The variations in both outcome variables among young adults raised in different neighborhoods are substantively important. The gap in expected high school completion rates between children raised in the upper and lower quartiles of the neighborhood distribution is eleven percentage-points; the equivalent gap in being enrolled in higher education is 16 percentage points. We also find substantial heterogeneity in this neighborhood variation; for example, boys are more vulnerable to neighborhood variations, while children residing with both parents at the age of seven are less vulnerable. We argue that the large variation across neighborhoods in educational outcomes of young adults should be of concern for policymakers. It can both imply a suboptimal utilization of human resources and it can feed into inequalities later on in the life course and harm social cohesion thereby.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is capable of investigating questions that no single or independent collection of disciplines can address. This interdisciplinary approach was used to investigate why nonpoint source pollution to a lake had not changed even though the often cited social drivers of this situation had changed significantly. The concept of disproportionality was adapted to examine social and biophysical interactions at different spatial and temporal scales to address this situation. Rather than using social and biophysical variable as contextual or additive relative to each other, we examined their interactive or multiplicative effects at coarse and fine spatial and temporal scales. Limited occurrence of inappropriate behaviors in vulnerable biophysical settings resulted in disproportionate environmental impacts. The concept of disproportionality implies that the environmental meaning placed on any social behavior requires accounting for where and when it occurs in a biophysical setting, and that a few outliers can determine system performance and outcomes.

AB  - In March 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collaborated with government and nongovernmental organizations to host a groundbreaking symposium, "Strengthening Environmental Justice Research and Decision Making: A Symposium on the Science of Disproportionate Environmental Health Impacts." The symposium provided a forum for discourse on the state of scientific knowledge about factors identified by EPA that may contribute to higher burdens of environmental exposure or risk in racial/ethnic minorities and low-income populations. Also featured were discussions on how environmental justice considerations may be integrated into EPA's analytical and decision-making frameworks and on research needs for advancing the integration of environmental justice into environmental policymaking. We summarize key discussions and conclusions from the symposium and briefly introduce the articles in this issue. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:S19-S26. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300368)

AB  - It is more than two decades now since the earliest state-endorsed appropriations of mostly white-owned commercial farms in Zimbabwe. The Third Chimurenga - or Fast-Track Land Reform Programme, as the land takeovers were later on officially tagged - triggered an unprecedented economic cataclysm from which the country is struggling to emerge. Over the years, there has been a rush to document, in multiple archives, experiences of the Third Chimurenga. Naturally, white Zimbabwean farm life-writings thrived during this period as victims of land loss sought to inscribe themselves into its narration. In available studies, their writings are usually read against the backdrop of the state's Third Chimurenga narrative as complex alternative archives of the event. Such studies have mainly explored existential complications of landed whiteness, focusing primarily on how it informs particular notions of land (in)justice. In open letters written by Cathy Buckle during and following her farm's invasion, land justice is discursively entangled with concerns about ecological/environmental justice. This article examines the semantic and aesthetic implications of this 'entanglement'. Focus is placed on the ways in which environmental damage is discursively deployed as a moral site for contesting the state's narrative of land. Beyond this, however, the article argues that, in her preoccupation with establishing moral deficits in violent farm appropriations, Buckle's construction of white victimhood in terms of environmental harm manifests stereotypic sub/un/conscious innuendos that ambiguate and problematise the moral claim of her concept of land (in)justice. This, I further contend, complicates the status and function of the Zimbabwean 'farm narrative' as an unproblematic archive pluralising the Third Chimurenga narrative of land upheavals.

AB  - Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) are increasing in Ghana amid a weak legal and regulatory framework. This paper explores the impacts of this phenomenon on farmer innovations under recurrent environmental changes. Using a case study of zai, an indigenous innovative farming practice, the paper makes two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it shows that the pervasive enclosures coerced by the Ghanaian state undermine how indigenous knowledge could be proactively deployed for climate risk management. Secondly, ISLAs produce a social barrier to climate change adaptation, as they lead to heightened uncertainty and apprehension among farmers, which affects decisions on climate risk management. More specifically, land expropriation is an example of how adaptation could be hindered by governance, institutions, and policy at the extra-local scale, including not only existing land use laws, but also the constitutional guarantee of private property. The evidence supporting these arguments come from survey data on 619 plots, 70 in-depth interviews, village-level transect walks, and participant observations. Overall, the paper contributes to emerging debates at the interface of land use policy, climate justice, and sustainable adaptation. Theoretically, it also contributes to understanding State-society relations, as well as the political economy of eminent domain, often justified through discourses of "public benefits."

AB  - In this paper we analyze the relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in African countries. We examine whether the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa. Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality. African countries are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change. Our results imply that in order to address differences in the burden of climate change in Africa, a re-evaluation of current policy actions is warranted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - NHEXAS AZ is a multimedia, multipathway exposure assessment survey designed to evaluate metals and other analytes. This paper reports the analyte-specific concentration distributions in each of the media examined (air, soil, house dust, food, beverage, and water), for various methodologies used (inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy and hydride generation-atomic absorption spectroscopy). Results are reported for the five primary metals (Pb, As, Cd, Cr, and Ni). Ingestion was the most important pathway of exposure. Metal concentrations in air were very low (ng/m(3)) and found only above the 90th percentile. Metals were commonly found in house dust and soil. Exposure transfer coefficients minimize the importance of this component for those over the age of 6 years. When ranked by exposure, food, beverage, and water appeared to be the primary contributors of metal exposure in NHEXAS AZ. For instance, at the 90th percentile, Pb was undetected in air, found at 131 and 118 mu g/m(3) in floor dust and soil, respectively, and measured at 16 mu g/kg in food, 7.1 mu g/kg in beverage, and 2.0 and 1.3 mu g/1 in drinking and tap water, respectively. We calculated preliminary estimates of total exposure (mu g/day) for each participant and examined them independently by age, gender, and ethnicity as reported by the subjects in the NHEXAS questionnaire. At the 90th percentile for Pb, total exposures were 64 mu g/day across all subjects (n = 176); adult men (n = 55) had the greatest exposure (73 mu g/day) and children (n = 35) the least (37 mu g/day). Hispanics (n = 54) had greater exposure to Pb (68 mu g/day) than non-Hispanics (n = 119; 50 mu g/day), whereas non-Hispanics had greater exposure for all other metals reported. These results have implications related to environmental justice. The NHEXAS project provides information to make informed decisions for protecting and promoting appropriate public health policy.

AB  - Lead (Pb) soil contamination in urban environments represents a considerable health risk for exposed populations, which often include environmental justice communities. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA), Pb pollution is a major concern primarily due to extensive historical Pb-smelting/processing activity and legacy use of Pb-based paints and leaded gasoline. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) organized and/or compiled community-driven soil sampling campaigns to investigate Pb content in surface soils across Philadelphia. Using these data (n = 1277), combined with our own dataset (n = 1388), we explored the spatial distribution of Pb content in soils across the city using ArcGIS. While assessing Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP)-code level data, we found strong correlations between factors, such as the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels (% EBLL) and % minority population as well as between % EBLL and % children in poverty. We developed a "Lead Index" that took demographics, median measured Pb-in-soil content, and % EBLLs into account to identify ZIP codes in need of further assessment. Our results will be used to help lower the Pb-exposure risk for vulnerable children living in disproportionately burdened communities.

AB  - Modern forms of drilling and extraction have recently led to a boom in oil and gas production in the U.S. and stimulated a controversy around its economic benefits and environmental and human health impacts. Using an environmental justice paradigm this study applies Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis to determine whether certain vulnerable human populations are unequally exposed to pollution from unconventional gas wells in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. Several GIS-based approaches were used to identify exposed areas, and a t-test was used to find statistically significant differences between rural populations living close to wells and rural populations living farther away. Sociodemographic indicators include age (children and the elderly), poverty level, education level, and race at the census tract level. Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) technique was applied to find spatial clusters where both high well density and high proportions of vulnerable populations occur. The results demonstrate that the environmental injustice occurs in areas with unconventional wells in Pennsylvania with respect to the poor population. There are also localized clusters of vulnerable populations in exposed areas in all three states: Pennsylvania (for poverty and elderly population), West Virginia (for poverty, elderly population, and education level) and Ohio (for children).

AB  - Inspired by the commitment to address the environmental challenges in Peru under the UN Sustainable Development Goals 13 (Climate Action) and its implications by 2030, therefore, this study investigates the combined role of economic globalization, financial development, and fossil fuel intensity consumption using a combination of dynamic ARDL counterfactual simulation and kernel-based regularized least squares within the context of Stochastic Impact by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology over the period 1971-2017. This research output confirms the inverted-U-shaped hypothesis between economic growth and carbon emissions. In contrast, the kernel-based regularized least squares confirms the scale effect and fossil curse hypothesis in the relationship between financial development and carbon emission, and heterogeneous effects in economic integration and carbon emission. We further document that financial development, fossil fuel consumption, urban population, affluence (economic growth), and government final consumption expenditure spur environmental pollution while economic integration reduces it. This study recommends Peru to instill environmental justice through regulations and policies restricting inflows into an exploration of environmentally unsustainable projects within Peruvian metropolises or in the Peruvian Amazon. There is a need to revisit finance and investment laws and increase investment in low-carbon infrastructure within Peru.

AB  - In San Francisco (SF), many environmental factors drive the unequal burden of preterm birth outcomes for communities of color. Here, we examine the association between human exposure to lead (Pb) and preterm birth (PTB) in 19 racially diverse SF zip codes. Pb concentrations were measured in 109 hair samples donated by 72 salons and barbershops in 2018-2019. Multi-method data collection included randomly selecting hair salons stratified by zip code, administering demographic surveys, and measuring Pb in hair samples as a biomarker of environmental exposure to heavy metals. Concentrations of Pb were measured by atomic emission spectrometry. Aggregate neighborhood Pb levels were linked to PTB and demographic data using STATA 16 SE (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Pb varied by zip code (p < 0.001) and correlated with PTB (p < 0.01). Increases in unadjusted Pb concentration predicted an increase in PTB (beta = 0.003; p < 0.001) and after adjusting for poverty (beta = 0.002; p < 0.001). Confidence intervals contained the null after further adjustment for African American/Black population density (p = 0.16), suggesting that race is more indicative of high rates of PTB than poverty. In conclusion, Pb was found in every hair sample collected from SF neighborhoods. The highest concentrations were found in predominately African American/Black and high poverty neighborhoods, necessitating public health guidelines to eliminate this environmental injustice.

AB  - Over the past decade, sensor networks have been proven valuable to assess air quality on highly localized scales. Here we leverage innovative sensors to characterize gaseous pollutants in a complex urban environment and evaluate differences in air quality in three different Los Angeles neighborhoods where oil and gas activity is present. We deployed monitors across urban neighborhoods in South Los Angles adjacent to oil and gas facilities with varying levels of production. Using low-cost sensors built in-house, we measured methane, total non-methane hydrocarbons (TNMHCs), carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide during three deployment campaigns over four years. The multi-sensor linear regression calibration model developed to quantify methane and TNMHCs offers up to 16% improvement in coefficient of determination and up to a 22% reduction in root mean square error for the most recent dataset as compared to previous models. The deployment results demonstrate that airborne methane concentrations are higher within a 500 m radius of three urban oil and gas facilities, as well as near a natural gas distribution pipeline, likely a result of proximity to sources. While there are numerous additional sources of TNMHCs in complex urban environments, some sites appear to be larger emitters than others. Significant methane emissions were also measured at an idle site, suggesting that fugitive emissions may still occur even if production is ceased. Episodic spikes of both compounds suggested an association with oil and gas activities, demonstrating how sensor networks can be used to elucidate community-scale sources and differences in air quality moving forward.

AB  - In the era of low-carbon energy transitions, both climate and energy justice studies have raised concerns about the deterioration of energy poverty triggered by carbon mitigation policies. Nevertheless, no in-depth analysis has thus far examined the relationship between people suffering energy poverty and their carbon dioxide emissions. This study addresses the issue by presenting a novel approach to measuring people's basic carbon needs (BCN), which are defined as the amount of carbon emissions needed to achieve (socially and materially) adequate levels of domestic energy services. The results, using Japan as a case study, reveal the differences in people's BCN based on climatic, socio-demographic, and dwelling factors, showing that people in energy poverty need greater carbon emissions to fulfil their basic energy needs than the affluent population. In upcoming lowcarbon energy transitions, people's BCN must be reduced while satisfying their basic energy needs. However, this study shows that the carbon intensity of domestic energy services for energy poverty households is high, leading carbon mitigation policies such as carbon pricing to adversely affect them without suitable countermeasures. Hence, ensuring access to low-carbon energy for all, including the energy poor, is essential to engender an inclusive low-carbon energy transition.

AB  - Inspired by the activism of young people in response to growing calls for climate justice, this discussion examines the rich possibilities to more meaningfully engage with the interconnections between human and environmental health in the AC:HPE. We explore how the Sustainability cross-curriculum priority is articulated throughout the Health and Physical Education learning area of the Australian Curriculum (AC:HPE). Adopting an ecofeminist framework based on the work of Val Plumwood, we follow the current of Sustainability as it flows through the AC:HPE, to reveal the limited ways it manifests, as well as the points at which greater inclusion is possible. Given our analysis, we focus on expanding definitions and interconnections in the AC policy language to resituate Sustainability in more ecological and ethical terms, and thereby activate new pedagogical possibilities for teachers and students.

AB  - In this article, we conduct a governmentality analysis of Swedish public procurement in order to show how the notion of sustainability is constructed in this circumstance. We argue that the mainstream approach to sustainability policy in most countries lies within capitalist market rationalities, thus making it crucial to study how such rationalities shape and represent the problems of unsustainability and how these "problems" limit the possibilities for politics and policy in practice. Furthermore, public procurement is a central instrument through which these rationalities are realised and maintained. Thus, the purpose is to examine how problems of unsustainability are represented through public procurement policy and the effects they constitute for the politics of sustainability. To this end we mobilise the Foucauldian based "what's the problem represented to be" approach. As data, we use policy documents published with respect to public procurement in Sweden. Our findings show that the dominant problem representation constructs unsustainability as a market failure, limiting the possibilities for politics and policies of sustainability in several ways. This includes premising sustainability upon the continued expansion of capitalism; constituting the agents of change as apolitical actors; making sustainability a voluntary ambition for the procuring organisations; and constructing the legitimate claim to earth's resources and sinks as a matter of purchasing power, with important implications for environmental justice. However, our analysis also shows a tension in the material creating openings for a politicisation of the representations of sustainability.

AB  - It is claimed that country ownership enables equitable adaption by ensuring that adaptation interventions address priorities of local level vulnerable populations. This paper uses a framings approach to understand whether country owned interventions are aligned with local level adaptation needs. Three framing - the rights and responsibility, capabilities and recognition framings-are used to identify principles of justice reflected in adaptation interventions and compares them to those expressed by local level communities expected to benefit from these interventions. A case study of a Least Developed Countries Fund-funded and Global Environment Facility-administered coastal adaptation project in Tanzania is used. The analysis finds differences between framings by the project and local communities. The project portrays a rights and responsibilities framing with emphasis on government-led technocratic adaptation. Local level communities prioritize the capabilities framing, where local natural resource management institutions are considered necessary for mediating between resource access by resource-dependent households and resource conservation for coastal adaptation. The findings suggest that country ownership may not necessarily be equitable as local level adaptation priorities can fail to be reflected in country owned interventions.

AB  - Infectious diseases associated with dams in many parts of the world suggest a strong possibility of similar occurrence in Southeast Asia, but little is known about the influences of dams on disease occurrences in Southeast Asia, where a wide range of water-related diseases are present. An important public health issue in Southeast Asia is opisthorchiasis, the infection from liver fluke spread by ingesting raw or undercooked freshwater fish. This study investigated the effects of the Ubolratana reservoir in Thailand on Opisthorchis viverrini infection through the analyses of fish species assemblage and fish host infection in the reservoir and rivers, human fish consumption behavior, and their interactions. Multivariate analyses for community ecology and surveys of human practices were used to examine human-environment interactions involved in O. viverrini transmission. The results showed that the reservoir and the rivers harbored different fish species of varied O. viverrini infection densities, with the reservoir having higher overall infection rates than the rivers. Although the preferred species for raw fish dishes was found with low infection, several high-infection species were commonly consumed. The reservoir might have implications for opisthorchiasis risk through the potential change of fish species assemblage and the supply of high O. viverrini-infected fish to most of the villages around it. This study underscored the need to consider human-environment interactions for understanding the risks of disease transmission.

AB  - Over the centuries, the coastal zones of the world have attracted agents of political expansion and instrumental maritime (e.g., fishing, shipping, boat building) industries seeking profit, and also great numbers of the general public seeking a place for residence, relaxation, outdoor recreation, tourism and other forms of play. The impressive amenities of the coastal zone are the economic value of natural resources and the social value of a sublime biophysical and human ecology. In the United States, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 created a mandate for special area management plans to balance protection of the coasts with provisions that allow residence, visitation, and industry. This mandate is also found in the California Coastal Act of 1974 which created the California Coastal Commission. In the time since the passage of these acts, the cultural and policy spaces of California's coast have changed dramatically. It is, however, an open question as to whether the Coastal Commission-and the many governmental entities with which it interacts-have succeeded or failed in their mandates. Whatever the conclusion drawn, this speculative essay suggests that climate change-induced future sea level rise will render the historic coastal management institutions and approaches obsolete. The future will be very different-ecologically, culturally, economically and politically. Coastal zone practitioners will be forced to reconfigure and expand their mandates and toolkit. We encourage a recognition that the challenge before them will be a new and very different one. It will call for an adaptation of the coastal management profession and the reorientation of the training and education of the next generation of coastal leaders in the public, private and civil society sectors. This should entail an expansion of disciplinary expertise to address human dimensions topics that include planned retreat, population and infrastructure relocation, social equity and environmental justice and be intimately informed by science and stakeholder engagement.

AB  - In a recent series of articles, ecological distribution conflicts scholars present descriptive statistical analyses backing Joan Martinez-Alier (2002)'s thesis on the environmentalism of the poor. In their collaborative Envi-ronmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas), their Peru sample reports a success rate of 24% in stopping projects. We contend that successful resistance represents only 2-5% of the total universe of Peru mining conflicts. Our claim is built on the study of 517 conflicts in Peru between 2005 and 2019, as registered by the Ombudsperson's Office. The evidence suggests, moreover, that contentious collective action commonly subordinates environmental justice causes to conventional economic concerns and resolutions, resulting in mining conflicts unfolding into compensation schemes and better deal settlements. Our straightforward interpretation is that while negative impacts are complex phenomena not homogeneously experienced among and within local communities, across space and over time, natural resource commodification brings with it the promise of local development op-portunities. We draw a complementary extractivism of the poor hypothesis: there are diverse forms of (bitter) accommodation with or (structured) involvement in natural resource commodification of the poor and the indigenous.

AB  - Planners intervening on population density and green space provision to improve the livability of a city should have a deep knowledge about how the two vary throughout it. This paper presents a study conducted in the ten largest US cities to understand what are the conditions of density, public green space provision and greenery provision experienced by their inhabitants, and how these variables are related to each other. Based on 2010 census data, park area shapefiles and high-resolution orthophotos, the three variables were assessed by means of neighborhood operations on 1-m raster files as the number of people, extent of park space and extent of other greenery within a 500-m buffer around each pixel. Results show that only in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia a significant share of the population lives at relatively high densities ( > 6000 people km( -2) ) and enjoys an adequate provision of public green space (more than 5% of the buffer area). The provision of other greenery is very high ( > 40%) for most people, especially in the Sun Belt cities, where density is low and the provision of public green space minimal for many. Density and green space provision are generally uncorrelated or weakly negatively correlated, whereas a moderately negative correlation is observed between density and greenery as well as between public green space provision and the provision of other greenery. Future studies should investigate the quality and accessibility of green space in greater detail.

AB  - Integrating information about how ecosystem services (ES) are provided and benefited from in spatial planning is essential to enhance quality of life in urban areas. This study aims to assess mismatches in the provision of urban ES. Specifically, it compares the amount of services that urban dwellers currently benefit from with the capacity of green spaces to provide service and the ES demand, in order to assess two mismatches: "unsustainable flow" and "unsatisfied demand", respectively. We focus on two ES, recreation and food supply, and conduct an empirical study in two adjacent municipalities of the city of Havana, Cuba. The methodological approach includes: the identification of services providing and demanding areas; and the quantification of mismatches by carrying out a spatial comparison between critical capacity and flow, and demand and flow. Results show that urban green spaces may be potentially exposed to overcrowding. Concerning food supply, a mismatch between demand and flow emerged in both of the municipalities. The assessment can support planners in addressing the sustainable use of green spaces and the equitable distribution of ES benefits. However, its applicability requires a deep understanding of local specificities, including demand levels, accessibility to ES, and sustainability thresholds.

AB  - It has been well established that gentrification can undermine access to green amenities for socially vulnerable residents through socio-cultural or physical displacement from working-class and minority neighbourhoods. However, in the growing literature on environmental gentrification, little attention has been given to the impacts of gentrification on young families and children, especially in neighbourhood green spaces where children socialise and play. Using observational methods, surveys and interviews, we assessed perceptions and use of green play spaces in two neighbourhoods of Barcelona at different stages of gentrification. One neighbourhood suffers from advanced residential, commercial and tourism-led gentrification (La Ribera) while the other (Poblenou) experiences more recent gentrification. We find that advanced and more complex processes of gentrification are more likely to be associated with dissatisfaction of public space and less use by children and families. We also observe lower levels of trust, increased delinquency and a greater sense of insecurity. In contrast, early-stage gentrification is linked to new place relations and attachment around green play spaces that are highly used by children and their families. Yet, our research also shows that neighbourhood gains in terms of increased access and use of green play spaces might be short-lived as residents there point to fear of displacement. Our findings thus reveal how gentrification can operate to offer short-term green benefits but possible long-term losses for socially vulnerable families in gentrifying neighbourhoods.

AB  - In March 2015, interim storage facilities began to operate in Fukushima, Japan and to receive waste, including soils and plants that were contaminated with radiation after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's explosions four years ago. Two rural towns that host the plant accepted the operation in their territories, acknowledging that they had benefitted from the plant and they bore the burden as an outcome. The environmental justice framework suggests that such an acceptance reveals peripheralisation of rural villages that were forced to embrace the government-sponsored nuclear industry and to become 'rural-nuclear towns'. An emphasis is often placed on participation of the affected citizens to address the peripheralisation and to seek justice through establishment of procedural equity. Using media reports, published policy documents and interview excerpts, this paper reconstructs historical process by which the peripheralisation occurred and argues that the current emphasis on procedural equity is susceptible to endorsing the ongoing promotion of public participation in disaster management, which fails to facilitate re-imagination of reconstructing rural-nuclear towns as rural towns in a post nuclear world. The paper proposes a corporealist approach to set an analytical ground to establish a new social imaginary in which participation comes to mean creation of a new political process that envisions foundational change.

AB  - In the United States, 'fenceline communities' next to petrochemical facilities have been conducting and advocating for air monitoring since the 1990s, highlighting gaps in U.S. environmental regulators' monitoring programs. Citizen science is imagined to be valuable as a source of data for filling such gaps. But fenceline communities' air monitoring activities also underscore regulators' hermeneutic ignorance, namely their lack of appropriate concepts, categories, and metrics for understanding the temporality of air pollution as experienced by marginalized communities. Citizen science could play a valuable role in addressing hermeneutic ignorance, by providing more adequate epistemic resources for understanding the environmental harms. In the case of community monitoring programs, these have included epistemic resources for understanding the immediacy of air pollution and the chronic nature of unpredictable spikes in pollution. However, regulators confronted with community-led monitoring have acknowledged neither citizen scientists' contributions to epistemic resources nor their own hermeneutic ignorance, limiting the potential for citizen science to address institutionalized ignorance. Recognizing hermeneutic ignorance shows the important role that epistemic resources play in institutionalizing ignorance, and points to reforms necessary if citizen science is to make robust contributions to environmental protection.

AB  - In light of arguments that citizen science has the potential to make environmental knowledge and policy more robust and democratic, this article inquires into the factors that shape the ability of citizen science to actually influence scientists and decision makers. Using the case of community-based air toxics monitoring with ''buckets,'' it argues that citizen science's effectiveness is significantly influenced by standards and standardized practices. It demonstrates that, on one hand, standards serve a boundary-bridging function that affords bucket monitoring data a crucial measure of legitimacy among experts. On the other hand, standards simultaneously serve a boundary-policing function, allowing experts to dismiss bucket data as irrelevant to the central project of air quality assessment. The article thus calls attention to standard setting as an important site of intervention for citizen science-based efforts to democratize science and policy.

AB  - In communities on the front lines of energy facilities, citizen science has been seen as potent tool for environmental justice, giving residents access to quantitative data and, as a result, greater credibility with regulators and other experts. However, as in other realms of energy and environmental policy, greater access to data brings with it increased interpretive challenges-challenges which are especially acute for environmental justice-oriented citizen scientists seeking alternatives to scientists' frameworks for understanding pollution and environmental health. Drawing on Miranda Fricker's (2007) theory of epistemic injustice, this paper shows that frontline communities' struggles to understand air quality data manifest "hermeneutic injustices," or inequities in resources for meaning-making. Following research showing storytelling as one vehicle for making meaning, it argues that the stories told by frontline communities-stories of harms to health, systemic danger, dissembling, and disrespect-can in some circumstances serve as a crucial hermeneutic resource for making sense of air quality data for which scientific frameworks are inadequate. At the same time, it documents the limits of stories in giving meaning to data, pointing to areas of "narrative mismatch" which call for further hermeneutic invention by community groups working in collaboration with sympathetic scientists.

AB  - In light of the flood event in June 2013, local disputes of flood risk reduction measures became a public concern in Germany, as it was argued that these controversies delayed the implementation of flood defence schemes and thus aggravated the flood impacts. However, actual knowledge about such disputes is generally quite limited. Therefore, this paper uses different empirical approaches to present first an explorative overview of such ongoing controversies with a focus on the measures under dispute and their geographical distribution. Second, current insights in the disputes are delineated, and the following four central conflict lines are expounded: (1) the desire for safety, (2) arguments of nature and landscape protection, (3) questions regarding economic development, and (4) participation issues. The results are discussed comprehensively, and conclusions are drawn regarding further research as well as planning practice in the field of risk reduction measures.

AB  - Increased understanding of global warming and documentation of its observable impacts have led to the development of adaptation responses to climate change around the world. A necessary, but often missing, component of adaptation involves the assessment of outcomes and impact. Through a systematic review of research literature, I categorize 110 adaptation initiatives that have been implemented and shown some degree of effectiveness. I analyze the ways in which these activities have been documented as effective using five indicators: reducing risk and vulnerability, developing resilient social systems, improving the environment, increasing economic resources, and enhancing governance and institutions. The act of cataloging adaptation activities produces insights for current and future climate action in two main areas: understanding common attributes of adaptation initiatives reported to be effective in current literature; and identifying gaps in adaptation research and practice that address equality, justice, and power dynamics.

To evaluate universal access to clean drinking water by characterizing relationships between community sociodemographics and water contaminants in California domestic well areas (DWAs) and community water systems (CWSs). Methods. We integrated domestic well locations, CWS service boundaries, residential parcels, building footprints, and 2013-2017 American Community Survey data to estimate sociodemographic characteristics for DWAs and CWSs statewide. We derived mean drinking and groundwater contaminant concentrations of arsenic, nitrate, and hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) between 2011 and 2019 and used multivariate models to estimate relationships between sociodemographic variables and contaminant concentrations. Results. We estimated that more than 1.3 million Californians (3.4%) use domestic wells and more than 370 000 Californians rely on drinking water with average contaminant concentrations at or above regulatory standards for 1 or more of the contaminants considered. Higher proportions of people of color were associated with greater drinking water contamination. Conclusions. Poor water quality disproportionately impacts communities of color in California, with the highest estimated arsenic, nitrate, and Cr(VI) concentrations in areas of domestic well use. Domestic well communities must be included in efforts to achieve California's Human Right to Water.

AB  - Over the past five years, the process of hydraulic fracturing, or "frocking," has become a hot-button topic in the media and the courtroom. As more information about frocking becomes publicly available, serious questions have arisen about the environmental and health hazards it poses. In light of these risks, local governments have been some of the most vocal opponents of the process, many of them going so far as to completely ban fracking within their boundaries. By contrast, several state governments have embraced the oil and gas industry in hopes of capitalizing on the revenue generated from frocking. Now both groups have turned to the courts to answer the question: Who gets to regulate frocking? Until fairly recently, both the litigation and its concomitant scholarship focused on the concept of preemption. State courts have been tasked with defining what kind of relationship their state has with its local governments and the bounds by which that relationship is confined. Some have ruled in favor of total state preemption, striking down any local bans or regulations deemed more stringent than their statewide counterparts. However, in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court became the first to overturn key provisions of a state regulatory regime that claimed to preempt previously enacted local frocking bans. The court's decision was not based on arguments of preemption, but instead focused on the environmental rights afforded to Pennsylvania's citizens through the state constitution; the statewide uniform regulatory regime violated those rights and potentially placed the burdens of the industry on some communities far more than others. This Note uses the Pennsylvania decision to step outside of the discussion on preemption, and instead focuses on how this struggle between local and state regulators has affected the environmental justice movement. Its aim is to first describe the environmental and economic impacts faced by those nearest to Pennsylvania's frocking operations. In describing these impacts, this Note suggests that those burdened with the hazards of frocking are, not coincidentally, some of Pennsylvania's poorest communities-justifying the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's concern about fracking's disparate impact. Building on that premise, the second half questions whether the court's decision should serve as a means to achieve greater environmental justice for communities impacted by the rapidly growing frocking industry. Does the preservation of local regulation of frocking advance the environmental and economic justice movements? There is not a clear consensus among environmental justice advocates, but this Note concludes that given the current trend of lax state regulations, judicial decisions upholding local authority to regulate frocking may be the most effective way to advance environmental justice.

AB  - In this article I think through Black feminism and queer theory to critically analyze toxicology. I focus on toxicology's conception of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), a class of toxicants that can cause epigenetic changes leading to inheritable health issues. I suggest that Black feminist interventions are particularly necessary for the study of toxicants because multiply marginalized populations are disproportionately more exposed to EDCs. The structural preconditions that generate this uneven, racialized, and sexualized toxic body-burden threaten to turn cultural constructions of race and sex (epistemologies) into biological realities (ontologies). My discursive analysis of key scientific texts on toxicology, EDCs, and epigenetics underscores how Eurocentric biases and eugenic logics permeate and co-constitute biochemical matter. I further argue that these texts' un/articulated norms regarding the human, sexual behavior, and evolutionary fitness undermine the usefulness of toxicological assessments for environmental justice. I close by urging scientist scholar-activists to reconceive the study of toxicants. A Black feminist approach to toxicity, I suggest, would not only situate chemical exposures in their sociopolitical contexts, but also radically revision what it means to be human.

AB  - On 11 February 1994, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income Populations." Under the order, 17 federal agencies and offices are required to compile information about the race, national origin, and income of populations in close proximity to federal facilities that may have a significant effect upon ecosystem and human health. The goal is to protect historically disenfranchised groups from being disproportionately impacted by negative externalities associated with federal actions. This study examines the outcome of efforts to educate federal land-use managers about their roles in implementing the Executive Order in their respective districts. The managers participated in a 6-h Nominal Group Technique (NGT) workshop where they were instructed to weight environmental justice issues versus others associated with hazardous waste problems in their districts. Participant responses were quantified and analyzed through a series of rounds. After each round, participants received increasing amounts of information on environmental justice issues. It was hypothesized that the managers would come to a consensus that environmental justice is an important issue that should be seriously addressed. Prior to administering the NGT, the managers appeared to have limited knowledge of environmental justice issues and thus assigned relatively low rankings to such concerns. After being "educated" by viewing films on environmental justice and reading related literature, in general, managers' weightings decreased and a narrower consensus developed. The authors conclude that exposure to the issue may not be as effective as expected in convincing land-use managers to become sensitive to justice issues so that they may effectively implement the Executive Order.

AB  - Latin America has always been a region of great interest not only for its rich-multicultural heritage, and diverse flora and fauna, but also for its natural resources that have become valuable commodities worldwide. In this paper an exergy-based analysis is used to investigate the cost of mineral depletion. By applying exergy replacement costs (ERC), a concept based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics, ERC determines the cost in exergy terms to recover minerals to its prior conditions with the current best available techniques when they have been completely dispersed after their usage. Such an assessment is a robust tool when evaluating natural resources in a country or region. We show that by using the above-mentioned methodology, it is possible to objectively quantify the loss of mineral wealth in Latin America associated to mineral extraction. Our study shows that the loss of mineral wealth in 2013 in the region was not compensated in comparison to the revenues obtained for the sale of minerals. Therefore, to establish a sustainable future scenario for the production of minerals in Latin America, a new framework for trading and management of fuel and non-fuel minerals is necessary.

AB  - Pluvial flooding is a serious hazard in inland U.S. cities. City managers and communities are increasingly interested in reducing their pluvial flood risk through the development of green infrastructure (GI) features. This research explores the relationship between pluvial flood exposure and GI placement in three inland cities-Atlanta, Phoenix, and Portland-and analyzes the variation of sociodemographic variables in census block groups (CBG) located in pluvial flood zones. Using the Arc-MalstrOm method, we estimated areas of pluvial flooding in the CBGs of our selected cities by relating pluvial flood area to the density of GI in CBGs and assigning CBGs one of four classifications: i) managed (large flood area, abundant GI), ii) prepared (small flood area, abundant GI), iii) vulnerable (large flood area, scarce GI), and iv) least concern (small flood area, scarce GI). Then, using the historical GI data, we examined the proportionality of GI investment over time to pluvial flood area. We found relationships between GI density, flood area, ethnic and racial minority populations, age, educational attainment, and median household incomes that indicated inequalities and potential discrimination in flood risk management, but also some evidence of equitable and appropriate management given differences in flood risk, especially in Phoenix and Portland. In Atlanta, newer GI installation prioritized white and wealthy neighborhoods where relatively higher flood risk exists (less equitable). Our classification framework may assist city flood risk managers to distribute GI more equitably according to equitability and need.

AB  - Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.

AB  - Indigenous territories are facing increasing pressures from numerous legal and illegal activities that are pushing commodity frontiers within their limits, frequently causing severe environmental degradation and threatening indigenous territorial rights and livelihoods. In Central and South America, after nearly three decades of participatory mapping projects, interest is mounting among indigenous peoples in the use of new technologies for community mapping and monitoring as a means of defense against such threats. Since 2014, several innovative projects have been developed and implemented in the region to demonstrate and train indigenous communities in the use of small drones for territorial mapping and monitoring. In this paper, we report on five projects carried out in Peru, Guyana, and Panama. For each one we describe the context, main objectives, positive outcomes, challenges faced, and opportunities ahead. Preliminary results are promising and have gained the interest of many indigenous societies who envision this technology as a powerful tool to protect their territories and strengthen their claims regarding specific environmental liabilities and justice issues. Based on the results presented here and a review of previous similar studies, we offer a critical discussion of some of the main opportunities and challenges that we foresee regarding the use of small drones for indigenous territorial mapping and monitoring. In addition, we elaborate on why a careful, well thought-out, and progressive adoption of drones by indigenous peoples may trigger grassroots innovations in ways conducive to greater environmental justice and sustainability.

AB  - In this community based research initiative, we employed a survey instrument predominately developed and administered by Teen Educators to assess occupational health risks for Haitian, Salvadoran, and Brazilian immigrants (n = 405) in Somerville, MA, USA. We demonstrate that a combined analysis of ethnicity, years in the US, and English proficiency better characterized the occupational experience of immigrant workers than considering these variables individually. While years in the US (negatively) and English proficiency (positively) explained the occurrence of health risks, the country of origin identified the most vulnerable populations in the community. Brazilians, Salvadorans, and other Hispanic, all of whom who have been in the US varying length of time, with varying proficiency in English language had twice the odds of reporting injuries due to work compared to other immigrants. Although this observation was not significant it indicates that years in the US and English proficiency alone do not predict health risks among this population. We recommend the initiation of larger studies employing c community based participatory research methods to confirm these differences and to further explore work and health issues of immigrant populations. This study is one of the small number of research efforts to utilize a contemporaneous assessment of occupational health problems in three distinct immigrant populations at the community level within a specific Environmental Justice context and social milieu.

AB  - Large parks?including regional parks, state parks, and national forests and parks?have particular health, social, and environmental benefits. Thus, promoting equal access to large parks is increasingly becoming a goal of environmental justice activists, planners, and policymakers. Disadvantaged populations (e.g., low-income people of color) have worse walking access to large parks than more privileged groups and might rely on public transportation to access such parks. But empirical studies on whether access to large parks via public transit is justly distributed are lacking. In this paper, we examine the relationship between a novel measure of public transit access to large parks (the T2P index) and neighborhood-level disadvantage (income, race/ethnicity, and age). Using network analysis with public transit feed data and park location data, we calculate the T2P index for every census block group in the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the U.S. West. We find some evidence of environmental injustice. A spatial filtering model shows that T2P access increases when a neighborhood has a larger share of non-Hispanic Whites and a smaller share of older adults, but that median household income is not associated with T2P in the entire sample. We also find that some regions present significant environmental injustices in T2P whereas others have fewer to no injustices. Transit agencies and park planners could use our T2P index and findings to prioritize transit investment for disadvantaged populations and promote healthy living.

AB  - Mobility can indicate a powerful or privileged relationship with one's environment. The ability to exercise mobility or not (of oneself or others) is an exertion of power that demarcates where particular people belong and under what kind of environmental conditions. This essay focuses on the significance of borders in creating environmental privilege in the Anthropocene. Environmental privilege is accrued through the exercise of economic, political, and cultural power that enables the construction of exclusive environmental amenities such as clean air and water, open space, and safe neighborhoods. For years, environmental justice scholars have revealed the burdens and oppressive conditions associated with environmental inequality, but few studies consider the flipside of that reality. We argue that environmental privileges enjoyed by some rest upon the manipulation of the mobility of others - human and nonhuman. We believe border making will come under greater pressure as the effects of climate change increase, and the volume of resources required to maintain exclusive spaces intensifies. Continued mass migration will bring heightened anxieties about national identity and calls for greater border enforcement, despite the reality that borders - both literal and figurative - consistently fail to alleviate migratory pressures while exacerbating the effects of climate change and environmental injustice. Our research shows that greater ecological instability increases efforts to create privatized places as pristine spaces untouched by global turmoil, thereby reinforcing those social forces that produce environmental injustices in the first place.

AB  - Many environmental justice studies have sought to examine the effect of residential segregation on unequal exposure to environmental factors among different social groups, but little is known about how segregation in non-residential contexts affects such disparity. Based on a review of the relevant literature, this paper discusses the limitations of traditional residence-based approaches in examining the association between socioeconomic or racial/ethnic segregation and unequal environmental exposure in environmental justice research. It emphasizes that future research needs to go beyond residential segregation by considering the full spectrum of segregation experienced by people in various geographic and temporal contexts of everyday life. Along with this comprehensive understanding of segregation, the paper also highlights the importance of assessing environmental exposure at a high spatiotemporal resolution in environmental justice research. The successful integration of a comprehensive concept of segregation, high-resolution data and fine-grained spatiotemporal approaches to assessing segregation and environmental exposure would provide more nuanced and robust findings on the associations between segregation and disparities in environmental exposure and their health impacts. Moreover, it would also contribute to significantly expanding the scope of environmental justice research.

AB  - This article seeks to answer why North-South climate negotiations have gone on for decades without producing any substantial results. To address this question, we revisit and seek to integrate insights from several disparate theories, including structuralism ( new and old), world systems theory, rational choice institutionalism, and social constructivism. We argue that the lack of convergence on climate grew almost inevitably from our starkly unequal world, which has created and perpetuated highly divergent ways of thinking (worldviews and causal beliefs) and promoted particularistic notions of fairness ( principled beliefs). We attempt to integrate structural insights about global inequality with the micro-motives of rational choice institutionalism. The structuralist insight that 'unchecked inequality undermines cooperation' suggests climate negotiations must be broadened to include a range of seemingly unrelated development issues such as trade, investment, debt, and intellectual property rights agreements. We conclude by reviewing the work of some 'norm entrepreneurs' bringing justice issues into climate negotiations and explore how these insights might influence 'burden sharing' discussions in the post-Kyoto world, where development is constrained by climate change.

AB  - Moving beyond the typical focus on individual injustices, we examine individual-level and contextual factors affecting perceptions of justice with regard to the environment. Specifically, we examine decision-making procedures pertaining to environmental resource use and harms across groups of people; the distribution of environmental harms; and the direct treatment of the natural environment (i.e., procedural environmental justice, distributive environmental injustice, and ecological injustice, respectively). To test our hypotheses, we use data from a survey administered to a cohort of first-year college students at a southeastern university. Results demonstrate that environmental identity and perceptions of the extent to which the university context encourages sustainability consistently enhance perceptions of all three types of justice. Other factors differentially affect each type of justice. We discuss the importance of the patterns that emerge for environmental and sustainability education and speculate on the implications of moving from thinking about (in) justice related to the environment as an individual issue to one of the collectivity.

AB  - Parks are important resources for facilitating community health. Using an environmental justice framework, this study in Kansas City, Missouri examined disparities by income and race/ethnicity for bordering land uses, densities of incivilities (e.g., vandalism, litter), unhealthy retail establishments in neighborhoods surrounding parks. Low and medium income and high minority park neighborhoods were more likely to be surrounded by higher densities of incivilities and to have a moderate density of FF restaurants. Low-income park neighborhoods were five times more likely to have a moderate density of other unhealthy establishments compared to parks in high-income areas. Future research and environmental justice efforts should explore policies that reduce unhealthy characteristics of park neighborhoods to encourage increased usage of these important community settings.

AB  - In conceptualizing and addressing problems of risk society, significant strands of theorization address key problems of modernity in the anthropocene world focusing on issues of science, technocracy, reflexivity, social organization, conflict and the environmental impact of our production and distribution systems. However, classical problems of inequality, social justice and an all-pervasive uncertainty affecting vulnerable populations are inadequately incorporated into such strands. Drawing from long-term research on flood-related disasters in the city of Mumbai and ongoing research on climate uncertainty and the impacts of new coastal claims on socio-environmental systems in India, this article argues for a reconceptualization of justice and governance from a disaster risk reduction perspective. A range of ongoing empirical and analytical work from Asia and beyond are referenced while deploying and advancing insights from research in the areas of environmental justice, feminist theorizations of justice and key Indian contributions on niti and nyaya - the distinction between appropriate social and organization arrangements for ensuring justice, and the actual state of realization of justice. In addressing disasters in an anthropocene world, it is argued that the most vulnerable are also subjected to the most abject living conditions that make them vulnerable to disasters and exclude them from forms of disaster justice; such exclusions derive from highly unequal social and political arrangements that in turn define governance in general and governance for disaster mitigation in particular; they contribute to cascading uncertainties and vulnerabilities, exacerbate existing inequalities and processes of marginalization and pose questions for how we define and make a case for disaster justice. A case is made for a more integrated approach to disaster justice that does not neglect problems of power, discrimination or diversity in governing disasters.

AB  - In the WHO European Region the topic of contaminated sites is considered a priority among environment and health themes. Communities living in or close to contaminated sites tend to be characterized by a high prevalence of ethnic minorities and by an unfavorable socioeconomic status so rising issues of environmental justice. A structured review was undertaken to describe the contents of original scientific studies analyzing distributive and procedural justice in industrially contaminated sites carried out in the WHO European Region in the period 2010-2017. A systematic search of the literature was performed. In total, 14 articles were identified. Wherever assessments on environmental inequalities were carried out, an overburden of socioeconomic deprivation or vulnerability, with very few exemptions, was observed. The combined effects of environmental and socioeconomic pressures on health were rarely addressed. Results show that the studies on environmental and health inequalities and mechanisms of their generation in areas affected by industrially contaminated sites in the WHO European Region are in their early stages, with exemption of UK. Future efforts should be directed to improve study strategies with national and local assessments in order to provide evidence for equity-oriented interventions to reduce environmental exposure and related health risks caused by industrial contamination.

AB  - Objectives: descriptive evaluation of distributional justice in the epidemiological surveillance system of populations residing in Italian National priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) of SENTIERI project. Analysis of the feasibility of monitoring different Environmental Justice dimensions in SENTIERI. Design: descriptive study and ecological meta-analysis. Setting AN PARTICIPANTS: residents in 298 municipalities included in 44 NPCSs in SENTIERI. Description of their level of deprivation and mortality analysis by deprivation level in the first period evaluated in SENTIERI, years 1995-2002. Main outcome measures: an index of multiple deprivation at municipality level DI-SENTIERI, built using 4 indicators based on variables from the Italian 2001 Census, was used to describe deprivation in communities living in NPCSs. The risk of mortality for all causes and all tumors in the pool of NPCSs municipalities by deprivation level was assessed using meta-Standardized Mortality Ratios (meta-SMRs). Results: sixty percent of municipalities (No. 179) in NPCSs belong to the two more deprived quintiles. The socioeconomic disadvantage of communities resident in NPCS has a North-South gradient: the proportion of municipalities belonging to the two more deprived quintiles is 29% in the North, 68% in the Centre, 92% in the South. Meta-SMRs for all causes in less deprived municipalities were 98 (90% CI 95-100) in men e 101 (90% CI 97-104) in women, the values for all cancers were 99 (90% CI 94-103) in men and 100 (90% CI 95-105) in women. The corresponding estimates in more deprived municipalities were, respectively in men and women, 103 (90% CI 101104) and 102 (90% CI 100-104) for all causes, 104 (90% CI 102-106) and 102 (90% CI 100-104) for all cancers. Conclusions: residents in NPCSs are exposed to environmental stressors and are generally more deprived. The socioeconomic disadvantage is mostly affecting Central and Southern Italy populations. Furthermore, in these deprived communities the risk of mortality for all diseases and all cancers is higher. Populations living in NPCSs are affected by distributional injustice. To monitor the different dimensions of Environmental Justice, the DI-SENTIERI should be developed and other socioeconomic indicators implemented.

AB  - Objective. Although previous environmental justice research has focused on analysis of the disproportionate burden of environmental hazards on minority residents, few studies have examined demographic inequities in health risks among children. This article evaluates the demographic distribution of potentially hazardous facilities and health risks associated with ambient air toxics exposures among public schoolchildren in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Methods. We combine Geographic Information System analysis with multivariate statistics to compare enrollment and demographic information for students who attend district schools with the spatial pattern of land use, locations of toxic emissions and facilities, and calculated indices of estimated lifetime cancer risk and respiratory hazards associated with exposures to toxic air emissions. Results. District schools are more likely to be located in census tracts containing potentially hazardous facilities; however, these tracts actually have slightly lower cancer and respiratory health risks associated with air toxics when compared to other tracts in the district. Demographic comparisons among school sites indicate that minority students, especially Latinos, are more likely to attend schools near hazardous facilities and face higher health risks associated with outdoor air toxics exposure. Conclusions. These patterns of hazard exposure and health risk should be considered both in the process of siting new schools to house the rapidly growing regional student population and in remediation efforts at existing schools.

AB  - Objectives. We examine the spatial distribution of toxic air releases and residential demographics in California using 2000 Census data and coeval Information from the Federal Toxic Release Inventory for evidence of disproportionate exposure. Methods. We use spatial analysis using GIS, and multivariate regression analysis, including ordered and multinomial logit regressions, in our study. Results. Analytical results suggest a pattern of disproportionate exposure based on race, with the disparity most severe for Latinos, which holds in a series of multivariate regressions, including attempts to test for varying levels of pollution risk and to control for spatial dependence. Conclusions. The study corroborates earlier research focused in the Los Angeles area, and suggests that recent concerns about environmental inequities affecting Latinos in California may be well founded.

AB  - Managing for social and environmental justice in water allocation is a necessary yet challenging goal. Often, what can appear as a just or equitable outcome for a specific location or group of stakeholders can also result in injustices at other locations or for other stakeholders. This paper describes a conceptual framework, The Cycles and Spirals of Justice, that helps make sense of the relationship between justice and injustice in the context of water-allocation decision making by explicitly utilizing a landscape-ecology understanding of scale and levels. The framework is illustrated using a case study from the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia and describes how justice and injustice are part of a cycling continuum of justice for whom and how this plays out in a multi-level system where the problem of scale can surface.

AB  - In this reflection, through observation of citizen participation in several local Montreal municipal councils, I examine whether and how people discuss environmental issues. More specifically, I seek to determine whether the politicization of environmental issues favours the expression of environmental justice. I use this term to refer to the social dimension of environmental questions, given that people of different social classes or identities are not affected by environmental issues in the same way. Does the politicization of environmental issues reproduce an unjust social order or does it encourage the struggle against inequalities? The answer reached here underlines the predominance of politicization through the challenging of democratic processes rather than a substantive politicization (where citizens debate the content of issues and discuss values or identities), which hinders the emergence of environmental justice. This study makes two contributions. First, it points out that, beyond conflict, addressing the avenues that conflict takes is vital. Second, while most analyses consider environmental justice within civil society organizations and on the "margins", this reflection tackles environmental justice within institutions themselves, namely the favoured places of production of social norms. Apprehending the role of institutions in the politicization of environmental issues is, thus, crucial to highlighting some aspects of social framing and the place of environmental issues in society.

AB  - On May 24-25, 2005 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the University of Michigan sponsored a technical workshop on the topic of connecting social and environmental factors to measure and track environmental health disparities. The workshop was designed to develop a transdisciplinary scientific foundation for exploring the conceptual issues, data needs, and policy applications associated with social and environmental factors used to measure and track racial, ethnic, and class disparities in environmental health. Papers, presentations, and discussions focused on the use of multilevel analysis to study environmental health disparities, the development of an organizing framework for evaluating health disparities, the development of indicators, and the generation of community-based participatory approaches for indicator development and use. Group exercises were conducted to identify preliminary lists of priority health outcomes and potential indicators and to discuss policy implications and next steps. Three critical issues that stem from the workshop were: (a) stronger funding support is needed for community-based participatory research in environmental health disparities, (b) race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position need to be included in environmental health surveillance and research, and (c) models to elucidate the interrelations between social, physical, and built environments should continue to be developed and empirically tested.

AB  - Little progress has been made to advance U.S. federal policy responses to growing scientific findings about cumulative environmental health impacts and risks, which also show that many low income and racial and ethnic minority populations bear a disproportionate share of multiple environmental burdens. Recent scholarship points to a "standard narrative" by which policy makers rationalize their slow efforts on environmental justice because of perceived lack of data and analytical tools. Using a social constructivist approach, ethnographic research methods, and content analysis, we examined the social context of policy challenges related to cumulative risks and impacts in the state of Maryland between 2014 and 2016. We identified three frames about cumulative impacts as a health issue through which conflicts over such policy reforms materialize and are sustained: (a) perceptions of evidence, (b) interpretations of social justice, and (c) expectations of authoritative bodies. Our findings illustrate that policy impasse over cumulative impacts is highly dependent on how policy-relevant actors come to frame issues around legislating cumulative impacts, rather than the "standard narrative" of external constraints. Frame analysis may provide us with more robust understandings of policy processes to address cumulative risks and impacts and the social forces that create health policy change.

AB  - In recent years, a large number of studies have investigated the sociogeographical arrangements of health-related characteristics across urban areas. Drawing on theories of "environmental justice," researchers have been concerned with whether there is a social gradient in the spatial distribution of environmental "goods" and "bads." The accompanying article by King and Clarke (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;181(1):17-25) makes an important entry into these debates, as it describes the results of the first national-level US study to examine the relationship between urban form (particularly neighborhood walkability) and various area-level sociodemographic measures. Like many studies in this field, King and Clarke's work was constrained by the availability of certain area-level measures, and they had to rely on data from only a single point in time (2000-2001). For this reason, their results can provide few insights into the processes leading to the geographical arrangement of health-related resources across US cities. The emerging field of "historical geographic information systems" offers possibilities to researchers interested in relationships between place and health. Integrating spatial data from various historical sources can enable the reconstruction of past urban environments. These spatial data, accrued over time and appended with detailed cohort information, will offer analytical opportunities for better understanding how place-based factors influence health and well-being over the life course.

AB  - In this study, we aim to illustrate how novel technologies and methodologies can be used to enhance neighborhood level studies of ambient particulate matter (PM). This is achieved by characterizing temporal and spatial features of PM levels and by assessing patterns in particle size composition using simultaneous measures across multiple size fraction ranges in Charleston, SC, USA. The study is conducted in three stages: (1) we monitor real-time PM concentrations for the following: PM <= 15 mu m, PM <= 10 mu m, PM <= 4 mu m, PM <= 2.5 mu m, and PM <= 1 mu m at five locations during February-July, 2016; (2) we apply a generalized additive model (GAM) to assess temporal and spatial trends in PM2.5 after controlling for meteorology, instrument, and temporal confounders; and (3) we employ a self-organizing map (SOM) to identify hourly profiles that characterize the types of size fraction distribution compositions measured at our sites. Monitoring results found that average PM2.5 levels during our 'snapshot' monitoring were 6-8 mu g/m(3) at our sites, with 95th percentiles ranging from 9 to 13 mu g/m(3). GAM results identified that temporal peaks for PM2.5 occurred during the early morning hours (6-8 am) across all sites and that the marginal means for four of our inland sites were significantly different (higher) than a waterfront site. SOM results identified six hourly profiles, ranging from hours when all size fractions were relatively low, to hours dominated by single size fractions (e.g., PM1), and to hours when multiple size fractions were relatively high (e.g., PM15-10 and PM10-PM2.5). Frequency and duration distributions show variability in the occurrence and persistence of each hourly type. Collectively, our findings reveal the complexity of PM behavior across a relatively small geographic region and illustrate the potential usefulness of using size fraction composition to better understand air quality. However, it is important to note that this study only presents a snapshot of air quality and that longer monitoring periods are recommended for more definitive characterizations.

AB  - In a number of environmental-justice studies it has been noted that the exposure to an array of air pollutants varies between different social groups. This inequality in exposure is one possible explanation for the variations in pollution-related health outcomes such as lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Previous environmental-justice studies that have focused upon air pollution have tended to be concerned with exposure to industrial and vehicle pollution and rely upon simple estimates of exposure, ignoring the complex interaction of emissions, topography, and meteorology that determine pollution levels in many urban areas. In this paper we use accurate and geographically detailed estimates of pollution calculated from an atmospheric dispersion model to examine issues of environmental justice related to air pollution sourced from domestic heating in Christchurch, New Zealand, a city with particularly high levels of particulate pollution during winter months. We consider whether there is a social gradient in exposure to air pollution in Christchurch by comparing estimates of particulate pollution for small areas across the city to a range of demographic and socioeconomic indicators including age, ethnicity, income, and deprivation. Furthermore, we examine whether there is a social gradient in exposure to extreme pollution episodes. We demonstrate that different social groups in the Christchurch population are exposed to different levels of both ambient air pollution and extreme air-pollution episodes. In particular, pollution is significantly higher among more disadvantaged communities. We also find evidence which suggests that the groups responsible for producing a large proportion of the pollution in Christchurch are not the same groups exposed to high levels of particulate air pollution.

AB  - In this commenting article, I present several critical remarks about Lena Dominelli's contribution to the issue of climate change and its implications for social work. 1 In my view, her article lacks three important considerations. First, I argue that the issue of climate change should be addressed as part of a broader, fundamental challenge: the transition of the growth-based economic system upon which our society is built. Second, within a context of social and ecological injustice, dealing with climate change inevitably requires a dimension of social struggle. Third and lastly, I emphasise social work's role in challenging the social, political and economic structures and processes that bring about climate change.

AB  - In this paper I expand upon the recent use of the term Critical Environmental Justice Studies. This concept is meant to capture new developments in Environmental Justice (EJ) Studies that question assumptions and gaps in earlier work in the field. Because this direction in scholarship is still in its formative stages, I take this opportunity to offer some guidance on what Critical Environmental Justice (CEJ) Studies might look like and what it could mean for theorizing the relationship between race (along with multiple additional social categories) and the environment. I do so by (1) adopting a multi-disciplinary approach that draws on several bodies of literature, including critical race theory, political ecology, ecofeminist theory, and anarchist theory, and (2) focusing on the case of Black Lives Matter and the problem of state violence.

AB  - In this paper I ask how might environmental justice studies scholarship be recast if we consider the phenomenon of environmental injustice as a form of criminalisation? In other words, since environmental injustice is frequently a product of state-sanctioned violence against communities of colour, then what are the implications of reframing it as a practice of treating those populations as criminally suspect and as deserving of state punishment? Moreover, how are the targets and survivors of environmental injustice/racism enlisted in generative ways that resist that criminalisation and support abolition? I answer these questions through a consideration of how struggles inside and outside of carceral spaces represent urgent and timely opportunities to rethink the possibilities of environmental justice theory and politics by linking them to practices and visions of abolition ecology and critical environmental justice.

AB  - Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a relatively new approach to ocean management and has been widely implemented worldwide. Ideally, MSP should be established as a public process that analyzes and distributes human activities across space and time to achieve ecological, economic and social goals, which historically have been accomplished exclusively in the political arena. However, in most cases MSP seems to be driven primarily by economic interests rather than by sociocultural goals. In this paper, we discuss how integrating the missing sociocultural layers into MSP can help to reduce governance rigidity, promote adaptability in decision-making, support environmental justice, and improve MSP acceptance and uptake. In particular, we focus on identifying possible points of connection between MSP and frameworks based on social-ecological system theory, including co-management and other democratic and empowering alternatives. We conclude by proposing a new definition of the MSP process that is more inclusive, and mindful of users' rights and sociocultural objectives. If we bridge the gap between the dominant economic rhetoric and a de facto sociocultural-ecological system approach, we are likely to improve the chances of the MSP process succeeding on both the human and nature fronts.

AB  - In this article, I expand the existing discourse on climate justice by drawing out the implications of taking animal rights seriously in the context of human-induced climate change. More specifically, I argue that nonhuman animals are owed adaptive assistance to help them cope with the ill-effects of climate change, and I advance and defend four principles of climate justice that derive from a general duty of adaptation. Lastly, I suggest that even if one can successfully argue that the protection of human interests in adaptation ought to be prioritised, nonhuman animal rights will continue to place significant constraints on climate change action.

AB  - Over the past decades, transport researchers and policy-makers have devoted increasing attention to questions about justice and equity. Nonetheless, there is still little engagement with theories in political philosophy to frame what justice means in the context of transport policies. This paper reviews key theories of justice (utilitarianism, libertarianism, intuitionism, Rawls' egalitarianism, and Capability Approaches (CAs)) and critically evaluates the insights they generate when applied to transport. Based on a combination of Rawlsian and CAs, we propose that distributive justice concerns over transport disadvantage and social exclusion should focus primarily on accessibility as a human capability. This means that, in policy evaluation, a detailed analysis of the distributional effects of transport policies should take account of the setting of minimum standards of accessibility to key destinations and the extent to which these policies respect individuals' rights and prioritise disadvantaged groups, reduce inequalities of opportunities, and mitigate transport externalities. A full account of justice in transportation requires a more complete understanding of accessibility than traditional approaches have been able to deliver to date.

AB  - In the United States, people of color from low income and working-class backgrounds are at disproportionate risk to pollution and other environmental stressors. These environmental justice communities (EJCs) can also experience increased risk when a natural disaster collides with a preexisting environmental risk. The current research is an exploratory field study that examines perceptions of environmental risk after a natural disaster and how meaningful a public apology would be in three communities. Residents (N = 161) in two EJCs and a community without documented risks reported their environmental concerns and perceptions of public apologies. Overall, EJC residents reported greater concern about chemical hazard exposure than did residents with decreased risk. Furthermore, chemical exposure concerns facilitated public apology meaningfulness within the EJCs, but not in the decreased risk community.

AB  - Perceptions of sea-level rise in urban, environmental justice (EJ) communities are poorly understood. These communities' long-term vulnerability may increase as a result of the interaction of sea-level rise and legacy pollution. This article presents research on experience and perceptions of sea-level rise, flooding, legacy pollution/contamination, and health in an EJ community in northern Delaware. The community is in close proximity to documented brownfields and other hazardous sites, and is located where there are long-term projections of water inundation due to sea-level rise. Researchers administered quantitative surveys at local events that measured knowledge and concern for these issues; conducted focus groups that enabled a deeper understanding of survey results; and examined community perceptions relative to existing policy tools, including sea-level rise inundation maps and documentation of contaminated sites. The mixed-method approach created a baseline of perceptions on pollution, flooding, a health-environment connection, and sea-level rise. Key findings include the value of experiential knowledge of local flooding to improve efficacy of future policy prescriptions, and how a lack of knowledge of sea-level rise, coupled with great concern for it, might be explained by longtime familiarity with flooding issues in the community.

AB  - Population disaggregation methods are a land management tool that is necessary to robustly assess the exposure of populations to natural hazards. The aim of these methods is to translate population values from large spatial units to smaller spatial units. Due to their improvement, the accuracy in quantifying the population exposed to natural hazards has increased significantly in recent years. However, in the case of floods, where the actual exposure to the hazard depends on the height of the buildings, there is a methodological deficiency with regard to reaching the necessary level of detail. This is a methodological challenge that is exacerbated in urban areas specialising in tourism, where there are a large number of dwellings dedicated to the housing of tourists. In this paper we propose a 3D cartographic dasymetry (DDF) method that, based on cadastral information and the population and housing census, manages to solve these problems of flood hazard exposure assessment reasonably well. For validation, the results are compared with three widely used 2D methods. Our work shows that the proposed method offers better outputs for use in high-precision work; but also, when such detail is not necessary, more basic methods achieve results with only marginal differences.

AB  - In the global map of environmental injustices (http://www.ejatlas.com), the Andean countries (AC) report many ecological distribution conflicts. Our hypothesis is that the patterns of such conflicts are explained by the structural shifts of the economies and the concomitant changes in their metabolic profiles. Since the 1990s, these countries went through a strong reprimarization process, which changed their social metabolism as well as intensified environmental pressures and conflicts. In monetary terms, in the AC group of countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia), the primary sector increased its importance both in exports as well as in GDP. In the metabolic dynamics, the Domestic Extraction of materials (measured in tons) increased by a factor of 3.4 after jumping from 336 to 1145 MT between 1970 and 2012. This was driven by the fossil fuel and mining sectors. This reality was reflected in the environmental conflicts. Mining, fossil fuels, bio-mass and hydropower plants are the most conflictive sectors. The research in this article relies on a study of material flow analysis for the four AC carried out by the authors as well as 244 environmental conflicts reported in the EJAtlas until August 2016. The shifts in the metabolic-economic patterns help explain the dynamics and characteristics of the environmental conflicts in the AC. Such conflicts produce social mobilizations, which if successful, might help move society towards sustainability and environmental equity.

AB  - It is widely held that environmental risks which are distributed unequally along racial or socioeconomic lines are necessarily distributed unjustly. While disproportionality may result from the perpetration of procedural injustices-what might be termed environmental racism, the question I am concerned with is whether disproportionality, in and of itself, constitutes injustice. I examine this question from the perspective of three prominent theories of justice that largely capture the range of our intuitions about fairness and justice-utilitarianism, natural rights theory, and (Rawlsian) contractarianism. While each of these theories provides clear grounds for objecting to the imposition of risk on individuals without their consent, none provides grounds for thinking that eliminating disproportionalities along racial or socioeconomic lines, in and of itself, is called for as a matter of justice. As a result, I suggest that the concern of environmental justice should lie with identifying (and protecting) those at greatest risk, rather than identifying correlations between average risk levels and morally arbitrary characteristics possessed by individuals, such as race or socioeconomic status.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) emissions pose a global problem that requires global cooperation for a solution. However, neither emissions nor regulations are uniform world-wide, and hence the impacts of regulations are also likely to vary regionally. We report here an approach to model the effectiveness of regulations at different scales (local, regional, global) in reducing Hg deposition and fish Hg concentrations in the Laurentian Great Lakes (GL) region. The potential effects of global change on deposition are also modeled. We focus on one of the most vulnerable communities within the region, an Indigenous tribe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) with a high fish consumption rate. For the GL region, elements of global change (climate, biomass burning, land use) are projected to have modest impacts (<5% change from the year 2000) on Hg deposition. For this region, our estimate of the effects of elimination of anthropogenic emissions is a 70% decrease in deposition, while our minimal regulation scenario increases emissions by 35%. Existing policies have the potential to reduce deposition by 20% with most of the reduction attributable to U.S. policies. Local policies within the Great Lakes region show little effect, and global policy as embedded in the Minamata Convention is projected to decrease deposition by approximately 2.8%. Even within the GL region, effects of policy are not uniform; areas close to emission sources (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania) experience larger decreases in deposition than other areas including Michigan's UP. The UP landscape is highly sensitive to Hg deposition, with nearly 80% of lakes estimated to be impaired. Sensitivity to mercury is caused primarily by the region's abundant wetlands. None of the modeled policy scenarios are projected to reduce fish Hg concentrations to the target that would be safe for the local tribe. Regions like Michigan's UP that are highly sensitive to mercury deposition and that will see little reduction in deposition due to regulations require more aggressive policies to reduce emissions to achieve recovery. We highlight scientific uncertainties that continue to limit our ability to accurately predict fish Hg changes over time. Environmental significance Here, we project the responses within the Great Lakes region of rates of atmospheric deposition and fish mercury concentrations to changes in policy at multiple jurisdictional scales and to global change. We demonstrate that even within this region, responses to policy and global change drivers vary spatially with the largest reductions in deposition occurring in closer proximity to major Hg emission sources. Projected responses to atmospheric deposition are greater for U.S. policies than for either local or global Hg control policies. We focus further on the environmental justice implications of policy changes for fish mercury contamination facing one of the most vulnerable communities within the region, a tribe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula with a high fish consumption rate. The Upper Peninsula is shown to be a highly sensitive landscape that readily converts atmospherically deposited Hg to bioaccumulated methylmercury, but one that will respond little to any of the policies evaluated. Thoughtful and more aggressive policy changes would be required to alleviate the existing environmental injustice.

AB  - INEA has featured many articles covering the dilemmas, puzzles, and tensions related to global biodiversity governance; this coverage was infrequent in earlier issues but has steadily increased as both environmental diplomacy and international law on biodiversity conservation and environmental justice have expanded. Using the definition found in the Convention on Biological Diversity, we scanned INEA articles and derived several lessons learnt over the 2000-2020 period. These include: implementation remains a central challenge, but challenge should not be conflated with ineffectiveness; multilateral environmental agreements are vital for success; coordination and policy coherences are often lacking, insufficient, or superficial; institutional change and policy reform within existing institutions are incremental at best; understanding local political dynamics is critical; equity concerns remain central to biodiversity policy development at all levels; the role of non-state actors and private voluntary standards fluctuates; tensions over state sovereignty and collective action and the commons have often been visible but as often lurk in the shadows of environmental diplomacy and most ongoing discussions of global biodiversity governance. After elaborating on each of these lessons, we offer some insights on research gaps and potential thematic directions for future contributors to INEA.

AB  - Inclusive approaches have been applied in many areas, including human resources, international development, urban planning, and innovation. This paper is a systematic literature review to describe the usage trends, scope, and nature of the inclusive approach in the climate change adaptation (CCA) context. We developed search algorithms, explicit selection criteria, and a coding questionnaire, which we used to review a total of 106 peer-reviewed articles, 145 grey literature documents, and 67 national communications to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); 318 documents were reviewed in total. Quantitatively, the methodology reveals a slight increase in usage, with a focus on non-Annex 1 countries, gender issues, and capacity building. Qualitatively, we arranged the key insights into the following three categories: (1) inclusion in who or what adapts; (2) motivating inclusive processes; and (3) anticipated outcomes of inclusive CCA. We conclude, with the observation, that many issues also apply to Annex 1 countries. We also argue that the common language nature of the word `inclusive' makes it applicable to other CCA-relevant contexts, including government subsidies, science policy, knowledge integration and mobilization, performance measurement, and the breadth of the moral circle that a society should adopt.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, transnational space has emerged as a key locus of social transformation. Activist networks and movement coalitions span the globe in an attempt to build an alternative politics. Many transnational activist networks (TANs), however, are meeting sites of two very different entities-movements and organizations-and must thus contend with a crucial divide in the political arena. While social movements usually act extra-institutionally and are often bound together by strong emotions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), by virtue of their legally encoded form, often proceed within prescribed channels and must remain accountable to outside stakeholders. What happens when social movements encounter organizations? Can the tensions between social movements and NGOs be harnessed to create a lasting convergence aimed at building a more equitable democratic politics? My aim in this article is to contribute to a further texturing of our ideas of transnational space by raising some questions and concerns regarding the `actually existing democracies' being enacted there. I focus on the tension between the more emotive aspects of mobilization and the inevitable day-to-day bureaucratic procedures meant to ensure transparent and equitable democratic practice. These two forces, though complementary parts of any well-functioning TAN, are also forces of attrition. How close they are, and how they can both focus activists' energy and grind that energy to a halt, is shown by the example of the Amazon Alliance, a network of indigenous activists and conservation, human rights and environmental justice organizations, working to protect indigenous territories and the Amazonian ecosystem.

AB  - Objective. This study is intended to enhance the discussion of environmental equity by offering a methodology that is based on chemical-specific risk zones that reflect inventories of chemical facilities, risk dispersion modeling, local weather conditions, and the unique chemical processes of each site. The central question concerns whether the racial makeup of a community near a chemical-processing site is characteristic of the city, county, or community as a whole. In essence, does the racial makeup of a community vary by distance from a chemical-processing facility? Methods. A comparison of the racial makeup of the community was examined for 13 chemical-processing sites submitting off-site consequence data under the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan, by clusters of the sites, and for all sites in the community. Instead of relative ratios, we look at odds ratios. The odds ratio compares the odds of being African American to the odds of being non-African American at two given distance classes. In this way we may make inferences about how much higher (or lower) are the odds of an African American (relative to a non-African American) living in a closer distance class (as opposed to a further distance class). Results. The results show that as one moves further from a facility, the characteristics of the community reflect less and less the makeup near the site. The percentage of African Americans living near a chemical-processing site tends to be much higher when compared to population characteristics further from the site. Conclusions. The study shows that distance does make a significant difference in the racial characteristics of the population from a chemical-processing site. Using data reflecting accidental-release scenarios, weather conditions, and the chemical process from the local community provides a more realistic basis for determining vulnerability zones.

AB  - In this paper, we put forward a new research agenda for ecological economics, based on three realisations. We then show how these can be connected through research and used to generate insights with the potential for application in broader, systemic change. The first realisation is that the core ambition of ecological economics, that of addressing the scale of human environmental resource use and associated impacts, often remains an aspirational goal, rather than being applied within research. In understanding intertwined environmental and social challenges, systemic approaches (including system dynamics) should be revitalised to address the full scope of what is possible or desirable. The second realisation is that the focus on biophysical and economic quantification and methods has been at the expense of a comprehensive social understanding of environmental impacts and barriers to changeincluding the role of power, social class, geographical location, historical change, and achieving human well-being. For instance, by fetishising growth as the core problem, attention is diverted away from underlying social driversmonetary gains as profits, rent, or interest fuelled by capitalist competition and, ultimately, unequal power relations. The third realisation is that ecological economics situates itself with respect to mainstream (neoclassical) economics, but simultaneously adopts some of its mandate and blind spots, even in its more progressive camps. Pragmatic attempts to adopt mainstream concepts and tools often comfort, rather than challenge, the reproduction of the very power relations that stand in the way of sustainability transitions. We consider these three realisations as impediments for developing ecological economics as an emancipatory critical research paradigm and political project. We will not focus on or detail the failings of ecological economics, but state what we believe they are and reformulate them as research priorities. By describing and bringing these three elements together, we are able to outline an ambitious research agenda for ecological economics, one capable of catalysing real social change.

AB  - Indigenous rights in Australia have undergone enormous transition since the groundbreaking decision in Mabo vs. Queensland in the Australian High Court. This paper explores these changes with a particular emphasis on Aboriginal water rights-an important, and more complicated, corollary to land rights. Mabo opened many possibilities that Aboriginals could claim water rights for everything from irrigation to fishing and spiritual uses. Since 2000 claims of this nature have been made in the federal court system and have challenged the total scope of water law on this the driest inhabited continent on earth. Water law in Australia is primarily a function of state government and these policies have had differential impact on Aboriginal rights which will be explored in this paper.

AB  - In this paper, we reflect on and explore what remains to be done to make the concept of supportive environments-one of the Ottawa Charter's five core action areas-a reality in the context of growing uncertainty about the future and accelerated pace of change. We pay particular attention to the physical environment, while underscoring the inextricable links between physical and social environments, and particularly the need to link social and environmental justice. The paper begins with a brief orientation to three emerging threats to health equity, namely ecological degradation, climate change, and peak oil, and their connection to economic instability, food security, energy security and other key determinants of health. We then present three contrasting perspectives on the nature of social change and how change is catalyzed, arguing for an examination of the conditions under which cultural change on the scale required to realize the vision of 'supportive environments for all' might be catalyzed, and the contribution that health promotion as a field could play in this process. Drawing on sociological theory, and specifically practice theory and the work of Pierre Bourdieu, we advocate rethinking education for social change by attending more adequately to the social conditions of transformative learning and cultural change. We conclude with an explication of three key implications for health promotion practice: a more explicit alignment with those seeking to curtail environmental destruction and promote environmental justice, strengthening engagement with local or settings-focused 'communities of practice' (such as the Transition Town movement), and finding new ways to creatively 'engage emergence', a significant departure from the current dominant focus on 'risk management'.

AB  - It is now widely recognized that climate change is likely to have detrimental impacts across the Caribbean region, with the burden likely to fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable segments of society. It is therefore an appropriate time to ask whether the frameworks that lie behind climate change discourse and policy are consistent with the demands of social and environmental justice. In this paper, we use climate justice as a lens for evaluating three prominent frameworks for addressing climate change, those of adaptation, resilience, and vulnerability. Each of these discursive frameworks, we argue, can contribute to our understanding of climate change, but they do not all incorporate justice concerns to the same degree. In order to illustrate this, we examine the justice implications of using each of the three frameworks to assess a case study of agricultural transformation in Southwestern Jamaica. Farmers in this region have adapted to changing climate conditions in a variety of ways, including the use of new agricultural technology. The ability of many farmers to take advantage of such innovations, however, is constrained by the underlying landscape of vulnerability within the region. After interpreting this example from the perspectives of adaptation, resilience and vulnerability, we conclude that all three paradigms are capable of calling attention to climate justice issues, but only in the vulnerability perspective are such issues intrinsic. We believe, therefore, that a greater attention to vulnerability within Caribbean climate policy holds the potential to advance the goals of climate justice within the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Loss of land due to coastal erosion is a problem in the Mediterranean region and worldwide. Following a review of environmental justice (EJ) issues among different sectors of activity and contexts, this article describes research that examines the sociodemographic characteristics of populations destined to be effected by erosion in the city of Netanya, Israel. It also examines the availability of open space serving as an alternative to that expected to erode. Results provide a basis for which to explore the EJ implications of coastal erosion. The study finds that seashore dwellers in the case study area are generally mixed populations, not particularly strong or weak as defined herein. Also, planners and city managers have increasingly provided residents in close proximity to the shore with alternative open space. This work highlights the complexities of considering coastal erosion from a justice perspective. Although coastal erosion does not fit the typical EJ paradigm, the use of this analytical approach in the future at appropriate temporal and spatial intervals is recommended.

AB  - ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to identify Latina youths' perceptions of local assets and concerns related to children's environmental health (EH) in an agricultural community. Design and SampleFour photovoice sessions were used to elicit 6 promotores' and 5 middle school students' perspectives on problems and strengths related to children; environment; and health. MeasuresData collection was diverse and included a demographic and evaluation questionnaire, photographs, audio recordings of group photo-sharing sessions, and field notes. ResultsParticipants identified three themes that reflected group discussion during two photo-sharing sessions: a lack of structured youth activities; poverty and stress; and benefits and detriments of agricultural work. Community assets related to creating a healthy environment for youth were identified and included the clinic, churches, and youth programs. ConclusionsFindings from this study reinforce that social background and position affect how EH issues are defined and may be addressed. Participant perspectives are valuable to nurses because they offer a lens through which to see the complexities of EH from the viewpoint of those most directly affected. Leadership training and opportunities to serve on coalitions and neighborhood councils are recommended approaches to meaningfully involving youth in environmental justice initiatives.

AB  - In this article, on behalf of The Shadow Places Network, we outline a working manifesto of politics and practice. We mobilise the format of the manifesto to speak to an uncertain and damaged future, to begin to imagine other possible worlds. For feminist philosopher Val Plumwood, whose thinking inspires this network, shadow places are the underside of the capitalist fantasy, 'the multiple disregarded places of economic and ecological support'. In turning towards shadow places, and the unjust and unsustainable processes that produce them, we call for an environmental humanities that reaches beyond abstraction, fosters new responsibilities, considers the uncomfortable, and generates reparative possibilities and alternative futures. We aim to continue to trace out a world of shadow places. We acknowledge that these shadow places cannot be known in full, but through a willingness to engage in careful conversation with the beings and places harmed by (or strategically shielded from) processes of the Anthropocene, we can learn how to relate to each other and these places in more just ways. Recognising that shadow places are impermanent and contingent, this working manifesto does not look to predetermine or prescribe but rather invites conversation, encounter and exchange. In so doing we choose to contribute to making different worlds possible by pursuing new collaborations, new methods and new politics.

AB  - In this article, I explore how the discursive context shapes the outcome of protest actors' framing strategies in conflicts over large-scale land transformations. I use the discursive opportunity structures (DOS) concept to show that the outcome of framing strategies is influenced by national and transnational discursive structures. These differ depending on the specific purpose of land valorisation. Further factors influencing the outcomes are counter frames of the opponents, quality of framing strategies and frictions within movements. Empirically, I compare framing strategies used by protest actors in conflicts around a gold mine and an agro-industrial project in Senegal.

AB  - Opinions tribunals dealing with environmental issues have multiplied over the last several years as a consequence of the rise of international environmental law and its promotion by international networks. Drawing on an ethnographic investigation of one of those tribunals-the International Monsanto Tribunal- this article reflects on the many objectives they often pursue: strengthening political positions, publicizing environmental and health social struggles, and promoting legal theories. In our case, we show that articulating those objectives involved intense work to stage the tribunal's legitimacy. We analyze this work and how it was put to the test during and after the sessions of the tribunal. Our article broadly suggests that environmental opinion tribunals are political arenas where rights and identities are not only asserted but also negotiated and legitimized.

AB  - Increases in data availability coupled with enhanced computational capacities are revolutionizing conservation. But in the excitement over the opportunities afforded by new data, there has been less discussion of the justice implications of data used in conservation, that is, how people and environments are represented through data, the conservation choices made based on data, and the distribution of benefits and harms arising from these choices. We propose a framework for understanding the justice dimensions of conservation data composed of five elements: data composition, data control, data access, data processing and use, and data consequences. For each element, we suggest a set of guiding questions that conservationists could use to think through their collection and use of data and to identify potential data injustices. The need for such a framework is illustrated by a synthesis of recent critiques of global conservation prioritization analyses. These critiques demonstrate the range of ways data could serve to produce social and ecological harms due to the choice of underlying data sets, assumptions made in the analysis, oversimplification of real-world conservation practice, and crowding out of other forms of knowledge. We conclude by arguing that there are ways to mitigate risks of conservation data injustices, through formal ethical and legal frameworks and by promoting a more inclusive and more reflexive conservation research ethos. These will help ensure that data contribute to conservation strategies that are both socially just and ecologically effective.

AB  - Owing to recent changes in the structure of the aerospace sector and its relationship to government, the landscape of the space industry is now experiencing the emergence of a commercialization paradigm. Private space endeavors may soon be able to target the novel market segments of space research and exploration, space resources utilization, and human access to space and to further stimulate the growth of a new space economy. Thus, the interdisciplinary field of planetary protection has to keep abreast of these advances to avoid unnecessary complications that might hinder the useful reinvigoration of economic interest in the space sector. Planetary protection is defined as a set of guidelines that aim to prevent the forward contamination of celestial bodies with biological material from Earth and the backward contamination of the terrestrial biosphere with extraterrestrial biological material. The possession of the technical capabilities for access to space by more than one private entity is now formulating the public perception of a so-called "Mars Race" that raises significant questions with respect to potential forward and backward contamination issues. This work outlines an environmental economics approach to backward contamination. Specifically, the commercial activities on Mars that may pose backward contamination risks are those that require the return of people, material, vehicles, or other equipment back to Earth, such as the potential business cases of Mars tourism and commercial sample return. Although these activities do not seem to pose a realistic planetary protection risk at present, it would be prudent to consider them during policy-making. Earth-return missions from Mars are expected to generate vigorous public interest worldwide in the environmental, health, and safety risks related to a potential backward contamination incident. As these kinds of missions also involve a post-reentry phase on Earth for the recovery, transfer, reception, and distribution of the samples and for the handling of returned people and equipment, quarantine issues that have not been raised since the Apollo era may become relevant again. In the case of this kind of post-reentry commercial activities, various jurisdictions and laws pertain to the matter. However, public perception will play a key role, as it has done in other industrial development projects with a need for social responsibility. Drawing from terrestrial analogies of siting noxious facilities and other development cases with strong environmental justice characteristics, this work will explore the application of environmental economics as an approach to equitably balance the benefits and costs of future commercial space endeavors with a backward contamination risk.

AB  - Local food systems are increasingly receiving political support across the globe. As part of this trend, food policy councils (FPCs) are generally considered to be ideal governance platforms in the transition to just, sustainable and democratic localized food systems. However, insight into the governance processes to transform local food systems is lacking. This article analyzes the politics of localizing food systems at play in the FPCs of Ghent (Belgium) and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, USA). The focus is on the development of urban agriculture in both cities, and includes an analysis of the politics of scale through three scalar practices of scale framing, scale negotiating, and scale matching. This analysis reveals that differences in the way in which the politics of scale are played out in both FPCs resulted in the creation of different opportunities and constraints for urban agriculture development. The article shows that attention for politics of scale in FPCs can help identify dynamics of socio-political inclusion and exclusion and power struggles in the governance of urban agriculture. The article formulates two governance principles: understanding local food systems as multi-scalar issues, and the explicit adoption of procedural justice as a core objective in governance processes.

AB  - Justice has long been central to geographic research but attention to the concept itself has been less explicitly theorized within the discipline. This article specifically traces the ways in which justice has been theorized within human geography. The review identifies commonalities among justice applications within geography, suggesting a shift beyond distributive and ideal theories of justice toward those explicating injustices coming more from bottom-up approaches. At the same time, it identifies the tendency of geographers to approach the concept of justice through normative-political approaches rather than normative-analytical justifications of socio-spatial phenomena. The paper illustrates the value of both approaches to justice theorizing but cautions that geographers should continue to justify the use of the concept within their work to avoid attenuating it. In ending, the paper illustrates how justice-oriented geographers can continue to identify why justice is central to their scholarship.

AB  - This article reviews loss-and-damage scholarship, to explore the potential impact of separating 'loss' and 'damage', both in the context of research and policy. A key result presented in the article is that treating 'loss' and 'damage' separately would be most beneficial with regard to loss, in that the political hurdles that currently mar the loss-and-damage debate mainly derive from disagreement over financing responsibilities with regard to damages, which unduly slows progress on the urgent task of understanding how to manage loss. In this context, the article provides elements for separate definitions of 'loss' and 'damage', and suggests a possible categorisation of loss-and-damage scholarship.

AB  - In this paper I examine the ways in which economic and political restructuring is impacting environmental rights as conceptualized and practised by environmental justice activists in California and the Southwestern USA. Using his young's framework, I argue that the recent gains of the environmental justice movement have been based largely on procedural justice, which is insufficient to ensure universal environmental quality, a stated goal of the movement. The limits of procedural justice have become apparent through the processes of restructuring, internationalization, and immigration, all of which are creating a new landscape for activists-Activists in California find that their rights are being contracted, because of deregulation and capital flight, and at the same time are expanding to include residents of Mexico. Given these global realities, procedural justice must also be accompanied by efforts to address both uneven development and a lack of democracy over Private production decisions.

AB  - In this report I argue that environmental racism is constituent of racial capitalism. While the environmental justice movement has been a success on many levels, there is compelling evidence that it has not succeeded in actually improving the environments of vulnerable communities. One reason for this is because we are not conceptualizing the problem correctly. I build my argument by first emphasizing the centrality of the production of social difference in creating value. Second, I review how the devaluation of nonwhite bodies has been incorporated into economic processes and advocate for extending such frameworks to include pollution. And lastly, I turn to the state. If, in fact, environmental racism is constituent of racial capitalism, then this suggests that activists and researchers should view the state as a site of contestation, rather than as an ally or neutral force.

AB  - In this article, we rethink the spatial and racial politics of the environmental justice movement in the United States by linking it to abolitionist theories that have emerged from the Black Radical Tradition, to critical theories of urban ecology, and to decolonial epistemologies rooted in the geopolitics of Las Americas. More specifically, we argue that environmental justice organizing among multi-racial groups is an extension of the Black Radical Tradition's epistemic legacy and historical commitment to racial justice. The article is divided into two parts. First, we review how this remapping of environmental justice through the lens of the Black Radical Tradition and decolonial border thinking reshapes our understanding of anti-racist organizing. Part of our remapping includes an examination of African American and Latinx social movement organizing to reveal how such geographies of interracial solidarity can reframe abolitionist politics to take nature and space seriously. In the second part of the article, we present a series of maps that illustrate the geography, temporality, and inter-racial solidarity between Chicanx social movement organizations and the Black Radical Tradition. Our mapping includes identifying sites of interracial convergence that have explicitly and implicitly deployed abolitionist imaginaries to combat the production of racialized capitalist space. We use environmental justice to argue for a model of abolitionist social movement organizing that invites interracial convergence by imagining urban political ecologies that are free of the death-dealing spaces necessary for racial capitalism to thrive.

AB  - Palm Oil is a highly successful flex crop that has become a development engine in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. If the industry-led stakeholder initiative, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is to be believed, there is also a mechanism in place that can guarantee sustainable production along the supply chain. But what counts as sustainable and what does this mean on the ground in producing countries like Malaysia and Indonesia? This article argues that the form of sustainability offered by certification schemes such as the RSPO fetishes the commodity palm oil in order to assuage critical consumer initiatives in the North. This technical-managerial solution is part of a larger project: the "post political" climate politics regime (Swyngedouw) that attempts to "green" the status quo. But certification obscures the problem that it is not the commodity itself but the social relations of nature in the production of the commodity that need to become sustainable. It will be shown that despite certification, these social relations of nature are contested in Southeast Asia. Social and political struggles over land rights, workers' rights and environmental justice are repoliticising debates over palm oil, opening up trajectories of eco-social transformation that make alternative sustainability futures for palm oil possible.

AB  - Introduction: Bikeshare is becoming more and more popular around the world. Many cities in the United States have implemented their own bikeshare systems or are considering having one. Among many other benefits by bikeshare, physical health improvement has been mentioned as one of them as a common sense. However, not enough attention has been paid to potential health impacts when using bikeshare. This is not even to mention how the health impact is distributed among different groups. To address this research gap, we conducted a preliminary study to analyze the uneven distribution of health impacts by making bikeshare trips. Method: In our research, we chose the Divvy bikeshare system in Chicago since it is currently one of the biggest systems in the USA and its trip data are open. By incorporating emission and air dispersion modeling tools, we first estimated the high-resolution air pollution concentration level in the city. Then, we quantified the trip-based PM2.5 exposure by including every trip route and duration time. Finally, we conducted a spatial analysis for health exposure related to bikeshare trips in disadvantaged areas. Results: In Chicago, most of routes with high PM2.5 exposure index are distributed in the southwest of Chicago, where there are more minority populations or low-income communities. From the station level, most of the stations in disadvantaged areas have a high level of PM2.5 exposure index on average. Conclusions: Our research has clearly shown that users from disadvantaged areas are more likely to take a risk of absorbing more PM2.5, especially when traveling to other areas with more job opportunities and other essential services by bikeshare. In summary, our research points out an ignored aspect in planning bikeshare. Bicycle infrastructure design and air pollution control should be integrated into the process of bikeshare promotion in disadvantaged areas.

AB  - People of different ages are not tolerant to the same distance. Existing green space accessibility researches are often based on distance measurement, and less consideration is given to differences between different groups of people. We proposed a revised Gaussian 2-Step Floating Catchment Area Method (G2SFCAM) with age information considered to evaluate the spatial accessibility to urban green space at an administrative grid level. Precise population data of residential building scale and actual road network were used for a detailed evaluation. This Age-based 2SFCAM Model was tested in Yichang, China. Both results derived using G2SFCAM and Age-based 2SFCAM were compared. Results indicate that the proposed Age-based 2SFCAM method shows a more realistic estimation and reflects spatial differentiation of green space accessibility. This research helps balancing the rights of people of all ages to access the urban green spaces, and thus promotes health equality and environmental justice in urban planning and management.

AB  - Partnerships between academic researchers and community organizations are frequently formed to address environmental health concerns in underserved communities. Although such participatory approaches to research combine valuable assets of both partners, they are often difficult to maintain. We describe a partnership formed to investigate migrant and seasonal farmworker exposure to pesticides in North Carolina and to develop effective interventions to reduce exposure. North Carolina ranks fifth in the United States in the number of farmworkers; most are from Mexico, and a significant minority come to the United States on work contracts. Several barriers to establishing effective collaboration were recognized in this partnership, including stereotypes, cultural differences, competing demands for time and attention, and differences in orientation to power structures. To overcome these barriers, members of the partnership took actions in three domains: clarifying the different goals of each partner, operationalizing a model of participation that could involve many different community segments developing cultural sensitivity. By taking these actions, the work of the partnership was accomplished in ways that met the criteria for success of both academic researchers and community members. This approach can be used by others to develop collaborative relationships to investigate environmental health issues within a community-based participatory framework.

AB  - Participatory GIS (PGIS) emerged from the contentious GIS debates of the 1990s as a means of political intervention in issues of social and environmental justice. PGIS has since matured into a distinct subfield in which GIS is used to enhance the political engagement of historically marginalized people and to shape political outcomes through mapping. However, this has proven to be difficult work. We suggest that this is because PGIS, particularly in its community development incarnations, though well-intentioned in endeavoring to enhance the voices of the excluded, is inherently limited because it primarily aims to enhance the inclusion and participation of the historically marginalized by working within established frameworks of institutionalized governance in particular places. This, we suggest, has left this mode of PGIS ill-equipped to truly challenge the political-economic structures responsible for (re)producing the very conditions of socio-economic inequality it strives to ameliorate. As a result, we argue that PGIS has become de-politicized, operating within, rather than disrupting, existing spheres of political-economic power. Moving forward, we suggest that PGIS is in need of being retheorized by engaging with the emergent post-politics literature and related areas of critical social and political theory. We argue that by adopting a more radical conception of democracy, justice, and 'the political', PGIS praxis can be recentered around disruption rather than participation and, ultimately, brought closer to its self-proclaimed goal of supporting progressive change for the historically marginalized.

AB  - In the efforts to decarbonize the electricity sector, energy efficiency approaches have consistently shown co-benefits that merit investment and further development. Tools that can help decision-makers evaluate the eco-nomic and environmental impacts could accelerate the adoption of energy efficiency measures and support the development of targeted incentives, both spatial and temporally. In this work, a unified, corrected, and high -resolution electricity consumption framework is first developed to produce new data insights with an increased spatial and temporal resolution, allowing the possibility of performing detailed energy policy sce-narios. A case scenario for Mexico is constructed, where the impacts in the electrical grid from a suite of energy efficiency measures are quantified at high spatial and temporal resolution. The novel data sets are used to model electricity-reduction approaches in great detail for the most electricity-consuming economic activities in the country. It is shown that commercial electricity consumption is underestimated by up to 3 x in government reports and that US$ 11B could be saved in the wholesale electricity market -equating to 142 MtCO2eq of avoided emissions- if a 12% electricity reduction target is implemented to the top-20 most demanding eco-nomic activities over the years 2021-2035. Potential priorities for incentives are identified based on criteria suited for different stakeholders, including economic and environmental justice dimensions.

AB  - In Los Angeles, water managers and environmentalist NGOs champion green infrastructure retrofits, installations intended to maximize the water-absorbing capacity of the urban landscape. In such arrangements, the work of water management is necessarily spread among a more-than-human community, including (but certainly not limited to) humans, plants, soils, and gravels. This article analyzes the human labor within these collaborations, tracking when and how this work gets enrolled in networks of water management and circuits of value. I develop the term ecosystem duties to characterize these exertions and as a useful analytic for assessing emergent dynamics of environmental justice.

AB  - Knowledge is recognised as having more value when it is created and shared amongst stakeholders. Applying knowledge management principles can assist tourism organisations in achieving a competitive advantage. Importantly though, one-way, top-down transfer of knowledge, particularly in developing countries, can result in ignoring valuable local knowledge and compromise sustainable development objectives. Certainly, when considering the context of sustainable tourism, relying solely on more powerful stakeholders' knowledge inputs to make decisions can result in injustice and undermine sustainability values. Given the importance of justice principles to sustainable tourism, this study applies the concept of organisational justice with a focus on the three dimensions of distributive, procedural and interactional justice to examine local knowledge sharing in tourism development. To address issues of justice and fairness in the context of sustainable tourism development, this study proposes a safe space framework to facilitate knowledge sharing in a local context that is based on recognition of diversity in social patterns and embedding multiple forms and sources of knowledge. This conceptual paper contributes to the framing of justice principles with regards to local knowledge sharing and discusses practical implications for how different claims of justice by local actors can be addressed in sustainable tourism development.

AB  - Policy makers, academics, and conservationists often posit that poor coordination between different land use sectors, and between levels of governance, as an underlying challenge for reducing deforestation and forest degradation. This paper analyzes this argument using data from interviews with over 500 respondents from government, nongovernmental organizations, private companies, local and indigenous communities, activists, and individuals involved in 35 diverse land use initiatives in three countries: Peru, Indonesia, and Mexico. We find that while there is strong evidence of widespread coordination failures between sectors and levels, more fundamental political issues preclude effective coordination. We argue that political coalitions act to oppose environmental objectives and to impede their opponents from participating in land use governance. Moreover, we find that where coordination between actors does occur, it does not necessarily produce environmentally sustainable and socially just land use outcomes. Where we do find successful initiatives to reduce deforestation and benefit local people, effective coordination between well-informed actors is often present, but it does not occur spontaneously, and is instead driven by political organizing over time by activists, local people, nongovernmental organizations, and international donors. We suggest that the global environmental community must recognize explicitly these political dimensions of land use governance in order to successfully collaborate with local people to reduce deforestation.

AB  - Political traction for nature-based solutions is rapidly growing as governments recognize their role in addressing the simultaneous climate and biodiversity crises. While there has been recognition of the role of Indigenous Peoples in nature-based solutions, there has also been limited academic review on their relationship. This paper explores how the Government of Canada's conceptualization of nature-based solutions either support or prevent Indigenous sustainable self-determination. Drawing on past policy frameworks, we construct a novel four-dimensional sustainable self-determination policy lens focused on: Indigenous knowledge systems; Indigenous jurisdiction over land; the full and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples; and Indigenous Peoples as rights-holders to review a total of nine federal climate policy, planning, and science documents. Our analysis shows that while there is growing recognition of Indigenous rights, inclusion of Indigenous knowledge, and commitments to include the participation of Indigenous Peoples in the implementation of certain climate activities, there is a clear unwillingness to recognize Indigenous jurisdiction and Indigenous understandings of land as systems of reciprocal relations. Reframing nature-based solutions in the context of Canadian and international climate policy is essential not only to advance the self-determination of Indigenous Peoples, but also to create the ceremonial ground for Indigenous visions of nature-based solutions in order to address these joint crises. Key policy insights Despite a growing recognition of the role of nature-based solutions in climate policy, there is limited discussion of how current framings support or prevent Indigenous self-determination. Without such consideration, and the appropriate protection and recognition of Indigenous rights and jurisdiction, nature-based solutions risk perpetuating a form of climate colonialism that facilitates further violence and land dispossession against Indigenous Peoples. Framings of nature-based solutions could benefit from Indigenous ontologies to reframe discussions on the reciprocal connection between humans and nature, advancing a relational framework of nature-based solutions. A novel sustainable self-determination policy lens may assist Parties consider how, and in what capacity, they are considering the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as required by the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

AB  - In recent years, scholars have noted a broadening of environmental justice research, both geographically and conceptually, to include global issues that expand beyond the spatial distributions of environmental 'goods' and 'bads' to include other dimensions including recognition, participation, and capabilities. The purpose of this report is to consider how this broadening has influenced research topics and themes, the geographic locations of researchers, and the future course of environmental justice research. We searched for articles identifying environmental justice as a keyword from 2000 to 2009 in Scopus, Web of Science, and GeoBase. While the number of articles published looking at environmental justice has increased over the past decade, our search contradicts the previous claims that environmental justice research has greatly expanded conceptually or geographically beyond its traditional origins. Our findings show that environmental justice research remains firmly rooted in the United States, focusing on the distributional aspects of environmental harms. We introduce alternative research methodologies that can be used to inform a more holistic and just approach to research in this area.

AB  - Most fossil fuel resources must remain unused to comply with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Scholars and policymakers debate which approaches should be undertaken to Leave Fossil Fuels Underground (LFFU). However, existing scholarship has not yet inventoried and evaluated the array of approaches to LFFU based on their effectiveness, equity, or feasibility. Hence, this review article asks: What lessons can we learn from reviewing scholarship on proposed approaches to leaving fossil fuels underground (LFFU)? We identify 28 unique LFFU approaches, of which only 12 are deemed environmentally effective (e.g., fossil fuel extraction taxes, bans and moratoria, and financial swaps); eight involve moderate-to-high (non-)monetary costs, and only four are deemed entirely just and equitable. Of the 12 environmentally effective approaches: only three were deemed cost-effective (regulating financial capital for fossil fuel projects, removing existing fossil fuel subsidies, and bans & moratoria); merely four were deemed equitable (asset write-offs, retiring existing fossil infrastructure, pursuing court cases/litigation, and financial swaps); and all were deemed institutionally problematic in terms of their feasibility (six were challenging to implement as they threatened the vested interests of powerful stakeholder groups). Moreover, the reviewed scholarship draws heavily on empirical studies of how these LFFU approaches can be optimized in European, North American, and Chinese contexts; fewer studies have explored the effectiveness and fairness of LFFU approaches in the South and/or in a North-South context. Future research should particularly focus on North-South fossil fuel financial flows, which have received comparatively little attention.

AB  - It is well established that low-income and communities of color often receive delayed disaster recovery while disproportionately impacted from disasters. Governments have more recently employed equity principles into their policies and frameworks to improve resiliency of such communities to disasters. However, although many city agencies have an overlying goal to advance racial equity, the reality of coordination efforts may reveal shortcomings that perpetuate inequitable outcomes in the decision-making process of city stakeholders. This study assessed internal stakeholder interviews from city agencies, social services, and a nonprofit in summer of 2018 to identify obstacles and opportunities for building community resilience in Southeast Austin. An inductive qualitative analysis was then performed to extract emergent themes from the interviews. Key recommendations for improving equitable community resilience planning were developed such as, increased internal coordination and collaboration, and improved external communication and engagement. This study contributes to understanding the relationship of equity in community resiliency planning and represents an important contribution to understanding the influential factors that shape a decision-makers role in planning efforts. Improving such understandings can support more collaborative and participatory decision-making processes between affected community members and city agencies.

AB  - It is increasingly recognized that socio-environmental justice will not be achieved through liberal and cosmopolitical forms of activism alone. Instead, more diverse and inclusive solidarities must be achieved across political ideologies for transformative change. By engaging with one constituency often overlooked by mainstream environmentalistsrural, conservative Americanswe argue for a situated solidarity that can be forged among people whose views of nature, community, and politics differ significantly. This framework rejects totalizing expressions of global ambition that erase important place-based differences. To explore this ethic, we examine a localized anti-fracking campaign in western North Carolina to determine how place-based forms of environmental resistance can be brought in closer connection with the cosmopolitical movement for climate and energy justice. This requires that cosmopolitical movements make room for more customary forms of cultural politics, while conservative movements look beyond their own place-based struggles to resist mutually experienced forms of oppression.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) or sections of the ocean set aside where human activities such as fishing are restricted have been growing in popularity as a marine conservation tool. As a result, it is important to examine the socioeconomic consequences of MPAs and how they may affect nearby communities. This study explores social and equity issues surrounding the designation of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, an MPA that includes protections around the three most northern islands in the US territory of the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI). We gathered oral history interviews with 40 individuals from CMNI and Guam who had connections to the waters in the newly-designated MPA and reviewed key documents in order to (1) document historical and current use of the waters in the MPA and (2) consider the implications that proposed fishing regulations in the MPA may have for the local communities. Our study documented 129 trips to visit the waters in the MPA in living memory. We found that due to distance, trips to the MPA waters were rare but culturally significant events that provided residents from CNMI and Guam with connections to their indigenous roots. Regulation of fishing in the new MPA has the potential to directly and indirectly restrict local access to these culturally important waters. This research highlights the importance of better collaboration with local partners and better consideration of social and equity concerns in the siting and regulation of MPAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Noise action planning according to the EU Environmental Noise Directive aims to improve people's health. Although health inequalities exist, the Directive does not address social inequalities in residential exposure to road traffic noise. In multivariate regression analyses based on two urban study populations, we assess the relationship between objective and subjective indicators of residential exposure to road traffic noise as an issue of environmental justice. Residential neighbourhood satisfaction, socio-demographic and -economic, health-related and noise-related attitudinal factors were included as covariates additionally explaining the subjective response to road traffic noise (noise annoyance). Our results underline the need to select, operationalise and examine noise-related indicators very carefully, as objective noise exposure predicts noise annoyance insufficiently. Otherwise, urban environmental planning might miss environmentally unjust situations and fail to initiate distributive and procedural environmental justice.

AB  - Intake fraction (iF), the proportion of emissions inhaled by an exposed population, is useful for prioritizing sources with the greatest impact on population exposure per unit emissions. This article reports T estimates for urban winter wood smoke emissions. We used two approaches, incorporating spatiotemporal statistical models for (1) winter wood smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions and concentration and (2) concentrations of levoglucosan (a wood smoke particulate marker). Empirical data used in our models were measured in Vancouver, Canada during 2004-2005. We used Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty. The estimated geometric mean iF (units: per million) is 13 (one geometric standard deviation range: 6.6-24) for wood smoke PM2.5 and 15 (4.5-50) for levoglucosan. These iF estimates are comparable to or slightly larger than iF values for urban vehicle emissions reported in the literature. On average, higher-income areas have lower wood smoke PM2.5 concentrations and intake. Our results emphasize the importance of urban wood smoke as a source of PM2.5 exposure and highlight the comparatively large population exposure and potential environmental justice benefits from reducing wood smoke emissions.

AB  - This article reviews the growing environmental justice literature documenting access to urban parks across socioeconomic and ethnic groups. The extensive public health and sustainability benefits of parks, combined with the long history of discrimination against people of color in the United States and elsewhere, motivate an update of the literature on access to parks. Although a few reviews showed evidence of inequity in, park provision, no previous review fully conceptualized and analyzed different components of access to parks. To address this gap, I conducted an analytical literature review focusing on three groups' of parameters: park proximity, park acreage, and park quality. Based on a sample of 49 empirical studies mostly focusing on cities in developed countries, my review shows fairly inconclusive findings for park proximity, but striking inequities for park acreage and park quality. Low socioeconomic and ethnic minority people have access to fewer acres of parks, fewer acres of parks per person, and to parks with lower quality, maintenance, and safety than more privileged people. These demographic inequities often reflect geographical divides between inner-cities and suburbs. These findings are particularly concerning for public health because large, high-quality, well-maintained, and safe parks can better foster physical activity and its associated benefits than small parks with few amenities. Also, identifying inequities in access to parks based on proximity, acreage or quality can help develop targeted landscape planning strategies to address specific inequities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Like other urban amenities, parks are unevenly distributed throughout cities, with advantaged groups enjoying better access to better parks than more disadvantaged residents. Although such inequities are well documented, we know less about the mechanisms that shape them. We conduct a case study in Denver that includes a GIS analysis and interviews with local planners and historians. We find that while park funding systems have tended to steer investments into richer neighborhoods, racially discriminatory land use and housing policies that shape where low-income people of color can live have produced some of the deepest and most persistent inequities in access to parks. Recent improvements in park access for low-income people of color are based less on equity-oriented efforts by public agencies and more on residential location choices of affluent white residents.

AB  - Policy advocacy to address socioeconomic and racial/ethnic inequities in access to urban green space (e.g., parks) in the U.S. and elsewhere are often stymied by two dominant narratives on green space reinforced by politicians, business leaders, and mainstream media. The first argues that green space is "nice to have" but not necessary, and the second frames green space as "universally good" for economic development. In this paper, we study counter-narratives to push for equitable green space policy relying on qualitative research with 30 U.S. policy advocates about their experiences with green space equity work. We find that counter-narratives to the "nice to have" narrative could frame green space as essential, multifunctional, and resilient infrastructure. Also, counter-narratives to the "universally good" narrative could describe green space as a setting for equitable development, cultural representation and inclusiveness, and healing for people of color. Further, counter narratives should be tailored to specific policy campaigns by targeting audiences, seizing historical opportunities (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), and centering the stories of disadvantaged people. These findings can be interpreted through the lens of structural racism and can provide pathways forward for advocates seeking to achieve green space equity through policy change and power building.

AB  - Objective Arthur Okun made plain the fundamental conflict between efficiency and equity that arises in the pursuit of policy goals (<link rid="b14">Okun, 1974). Although Okun was speaking about government tax and spending policy, the potential conflict between efficiency and equity is also manifest at the nexus of two of the most far-reaching changes in the environmental policy arena: the adoption of market-like tools for pollution control and the quest for environmental justice. The article assesses this potential tradeoff by determining whether the pursuit of efficiency through the Clean Air Act Amendment's (CAA) sulfur dioxide allowance trading program (ATP) inadvertently transfers pollution into poor and minority communities. Methods I employ Probit, Tobit, and GLS models using data for all SO2 trading activity between January 1995 and March 2009 to estimate whether allowance trading concentrates SO2 emissions in poor communities and communities of color. When using these models, I control for sample selectivity and for possible bias stemming from the modifiable areal unit problem. Results The ATP does not concentrate sulfur dioxide emissions in black or Hispanic communities. To the contrary, communities with high percentages of black and Hispanic residents experience fewer imports of sulfur dioxide. Allowance trading does transfer SO2 emissions into poorly educated communities. Conclusions There is no inherent tradeoff between efficiency and equity when using market-based instruments for pollution control. Policymakers, however, might make an effort to design and implement future emissions trading programs in a manner that reduces the monitoring costs of tracking emissions trading. By reducing monitoring costs, policymakers may prevent the concentration of emissions in poorly educated communities while preserving the efficiency benefits of these instruments.

AB  - One of the most salient debates in environmental policy centers around perceived racial and class biases in exposure to environmental hazards. As with most aspects of environmental policy, states are at the forefront in dealing with these new issues. However we have only a cursory understanding of the actions being taken by state governments to address environmental justice issues. Equally important, scholars and practitioners have yet to take stock of the likely consequences of federal policy directions to the states in this area on the distribution of environmental hazards or on the distribution of authority between the federal and state governments. We address the first shortcoming using true original surveys of state environmental justice activities, and the second through a detailed discussion of current federal efforts aimed at promoting environmental justice in the states.

AB  - People with low income often experience higher exposures to air pollutants. We compared the exposure to particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10), Black Carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (PNCs; 0.02-1 mu m) for typical commutes by car, bus and underground from 4 London areas with different levels of income deprivation (G(1) to G(4), from most to least deprived). The highest BC and PM concentrations were found in G(1) while the highest PNC in G(3). Lowest concentrations for all pollutants were observed in G(2). We found no systematic relationship between income deprivation and pollutant concentrations, suggesting that differences between transport modes are a stronger influence. The underground showed the highest PM concentrations, followed by buses and a much lower concentrations in cars. BC concentrations in the underground were overestimated due to Fe interference. BC concentrations were also higher in buses than cars because of a lower infiltration of outside pollutants into the car cabin. PNCs were highest in buses, closely followed by cars, but lowest in underground due to the absence of combustion sources. Concentration in the road modes (car and bus) were governed by the traffic conditions (such as traffic flow interruptions) at the specific road section. Exposures were reduced in trains with nonopenable windows compared to those with openable windows. People from less income -deprived areas haVe a predominant use of car, receiving the lowest doses (RDD < 1 mu g h(-1)) during commute but generating the largest emissions per commuter. Conversely, commuters from high income -deprived areas have a major reliance on the bus, receiving higher exposures (RDD between 1.52 and 3.49 mu g h(-1)) while generating less emission per person. These findings suggest an aspect of environmental injustice and a need to incorporate the socioeconomic dimension in life -course exposure assessments. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Local-scale opportunities to address challenges of the water food nexus in the developing world need to be embraced. Borehole-garden permaculture is advocated as one such opportunity that involves the sustainable use of groundwater spilt at hand-pump operated borehole supplies that is otherwise wasted. Spilt water may also pose health risks when accumulating as a stagnant pond. Rural village community use of this grey-water in permaculture projects to irrigate borehole gardens is proposed to primarily provide economic benefit whereby garden-produce revenue helps fund borehole water-point maintenance. Water-supply sustainability, increased food/nutrition security, health protection from malaria, and business opportunity benefits may also arise. Our goal has been to develop an, experience-based, framework for delivery of sustainable borehole-garden permaculture and associated benefits. This is based upon data collection and permaculture implementation across the rural Chikwawa District of Malawi during 2009-17. We use, stakeholder interviews to identify issues influencing uptake, gathering of stagnant pond occurrence data to estimate amelioration opportunity, quantification of permaculture profitability to validate economic potential, and critical assessment of recent permaculture uptake to identify continuing problems. Permaculture was implemented at 123 sites representing 6% of District water points, rising to 26% local area coverage. Most implementations were at, or near, newly drilled community-supply boreholes; hence, amelioration of prevalent stagnant ponds elsewhere remains a concern. The envisaged benefits of permaculture were manifest and early data affirm projected garden profitability and spin-off benefits of water-point banking and community micro-loan access. However, a diversity of technical, economic, social and governance issues were found to influence uptake and performance. Example issues include greater need for improved bespoke garden design input, on-going project performance assessment, and coordinated involvement of multi-sector governmental-development bodies to underpin the integrated natural-resource management required. The developed framework aims to manage the identified issues and requires the concerted action of all stakeholders. Based on the probable ubiquity of underlying issues, the framework is expected to be generalizable to the wider developing world. However, this particular application of permaculture represents a fraction of its greater potential opportunity for rural communities that should be explored. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Parks are increasingly understood to be key community resources for public health, particularly for ethnic minority and low socioeconomic groups. At the same time, research suggests parks are underutilised by these groups. In order to design effective interventions to promote health, the determinants of park use for these groups must be understood.This study examines the associations between park features, park satisfaction and park use in a deprived and ethnically diverse sample in Bradford, UK. 652 women from the Born in Bradford cohort completed a survey on park satisfaction and park use. Using a standardised direct observation tool, 44 parks in the area were audited for present park features. Features assessed were: access, recreational facilities, amenities, natural features, significant natural features, non-natural features, incivilities and usability. Size and proximity to the park were also calculated. Multilevel linear regressions were performed to understand associations between park features and (1) park satisfaction and (2) park use. Interactions between park features, ethnicity and socioeconomic status were explored, and park satisfaction was tested as a mediator in the relationship between park features and park use.More amenities and greater usability were associated with increased park satisfaction, while more incivilities were negatively related to park satisfaction. Incivilities, access and proximity were also negatively associated with park use. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status had no moderating role, and there was no evidence for park satisfaction as a mediator between park features and park use.Results suggest diverse park features are associated with park satisfaction and park use, but this did not vary by ethnicity or socioeconomic status. The reduction of incivilities should be prioritised where the aim is to encourage park satisfaction and park use.

AB  - In theory and practice, there remains much hope that through greater human-place connections, more ecologically sustainable cities can be achieved. Yet ideas about place remain fluid, at once appealing and ambivalent. Since the 1970s, emphasis has shifted from bounded views of place to relational and progressive conceptualisations. More recently, geographers and other scholars have emphasised that humans are engaged in complex human-nonhuman entanglements. In the context of arguments and empirical moves to make more sustainable and resilient cities, these shifts have implications for the ethics and politics of place, sense of place, and place-based practices. Continuing empirical work by geographers (and other urban scholars) to explore how place is understood, made, and experienced in more-than-human worlds therefore remains important. However, we also need to consider reframing existing conceptualisations of place. This paper reviews shifting ideas of place and reiterates the continuing importance of rethinking place and place experience in urban theory, urban dwelling, and design. The paper draws together insights from post-phenomenology, more-than-human thinking, non-representational theory, urban political ecology, and environmental justice to form a loose theoretical framework that can inform place scholarship. In particular, this framework focuses attention on the ethics and politics of the material, temporal, and discursive particularities of the socioecological entanglements that are understood to make place experience.

AB  - It is vital for climate justice to pursue a pathway to zero carbon emissions by 2050 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change on people and their human rights. But can such a pathway be achieved without undermining human rights and restricting the right to development? This Perspective discusses the risks of action and inaction to identify a fair and just transition. It compares the risks posed to human rights from climate impacts with the risks posed by climate action and suggests that rights-informed climate action can maximize benefits for people and the planet.

AB  - In June 2015, the G7 agreed to two global mitigation goals: 'a decarbonization of the global economy over the course of this century' and 'the upper end of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendation of 40%-70% reductions by 2050 compared to 2010'. These IPCC recommendations aim to preserve a likely (>66%) chance of limiting global warming to 2 degrees C but are not necessarily consistent with the stronger ambition of the subsequent Paris Agreement of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels'. The G7 did not specify global or national emissions scenarios consistent with its own agreement. Here we identify global cost-optimal emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models that match the G7 agreement. These scenarios have global 2030 emissions targets of 11%-43% below 2010, global net negative CO2 emissions starting between 2056 and 2080, and some exhibit net negative greenhouse gas emissions from 2080 onwards. We allocate emissions from these global scenarios to countries according to five equity approaches representative of the five equity categories presented in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (IPCCAR5): 'capability', 'equality', 'responsibility-capability-need', 'equal cumulative per capita' and 'staged approaches'. Our results show that G7 members' Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDCs) mitigation targets are in line with a grandfathering approach but lack ambition to meet various visions of climate justice. The INDCs of China and Russia fall short of meeting the requirements of any allocation approach. Depending on how their INDCs are evaluated, the INDCs of India and Brazil can match some equity approaches evaluated in this study.

AB  - In 2020, the world was hit by COVID-19. Big data expeditiously travel around the world, having a performative effect on the way individuals, private enterprises, and local governments make decisions regarding the pandemic. As collective actions, symbolisms, and representations are (re)created or (re)constituted in the contexts of the pandemic, "new" questions can be formulated and "old" ones revisited regarding ecological justice in environmental education (research). Framing the special issue (SI) as an assemblage, we, as editors, challenged the authors to constantly return to the question of "What is in it for Nature?", while presenting their findings on what pandemics reveal about the politics of global environmental issues. As individual contributions, each paper of the SI targets a particular context of the pandemic to (re)visit environmental (in)justice. As an assemblage, the SI assesses where we, as an international community, currently stand in relation to "new" and "old" issues of environmental justice.

AB  - In this article, I argue that some of the campaigns that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) carried out in the USA are white normative and that the presence of this normative whiteness is symptomatic of the same larger problem in animal advocacy. I contend that PETA's campaigns are white normative for two sets of reasons. First, PETA's campaigns promote racist hierarchies; second, their campaigns contribute to black people's disengagement from animal justice, undermining the pursuit of black justice. Further, I argue that, even though PETA's campaigns are symptomatic of how many animal advocates are white normative, this does not need to be the case, for there are advocacy alternatives that resist normative whiteness.

AB  - Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) is not only a prominent, globally promoted policy to foster nature conservation, but also increasingly propagated as an innovative and self-sustaining governance instrument to support poverty alleviation and to guarantee water, food, and energy securities. In this paper, we evaluate a PES scheme from a multi-scalar and political-ecology perspective in order to reveal different power dynamics across the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus perspective. For this purpose, we analyze the PES scheme implemented in the Hidrosogamoso hydropower project in Colombia. The paper shows that actors' strongly divergent economic and political power is determinant in defining how and for whom the Nexus-related water, food, and energy securities are materialized. In this case, the PES scheme and its scalar politics, as fostered by the private/public hydropower alliance, are instrumental to guaranteeing water security for the hydropower scheme, which is a crucial building-block of Colombia's energy security discourse. For this, the water and food securities of the adjacent, less powerful communities are sacrificed. Examining the on-the-ground politics of WEF Nexus is key to understanding their impact on equitable and sustainable governance of water, energy, and food in the everyday lives of millions of resource users. We conclude that politicizing the Nexus can help to trace both the flows of resources and the flows of power.

AB  - Many municipalities are setting ambitious tree canopy cover goals to increase the extent of their urban forests. A historical perspective on urban forest development can help cities strategize how to establish and achieve appropriate tree cover targets. To understand how long-term urban forest change occurs, we examined the history of trees on an urban college campus: the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA. Using a mixed methods approach, including qualitative assessments of archival records (1870-2017), complemented by quantitative analysis of tree cover from aerial imagery (1970-2012), our analysis revealed drastic canopy cover increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries along with the principle mechanisms of that change. We organized the historical narrative into periods reflecting campus planting actions and management approaches; these periods are also connected to broader urban greening and city planning movements, such as City Beautiful and urban sustainability. University faculty in botany, landscape architecture, and urban design contributed to the design of campus green spaces, developed comprehensive landscape plans, and advocated for campus trees. A 1977 Landscape Development Plan was particularly influential, setting forth design principles and planting recommendations that enabled the dramatic canopy cover gains we observed, and continue to guide landscape management today. Our results indicate that increasing urban tree cover requires generational time scales and systematic management coupled with a clear urban design vision and long-term commitments. With the campus as a microcosm of broader trends in urban forest development, we conclude with a discussion of implications for municipal tree cover planning.

AB  - Objective: This study had two purposes: (1) to characterize the density of liquor stores and bars that individuals face according to race, economic status, and age in the urban United States and (2) to assess alternative measures of retailer density based on the road network and population. Method: We used census data on business counts and sociodemographic characteristics to compute the densities facing individuals in 9,361 urban zip codes. Results: Blacks face higher densities of liquor stores than do whites. The density of liquor stores is greater among nonwhites in lower-income areas than among whites in lower- and higher-income areas and nonwhites in higher-income areas. Nonwhite youths face higher densities of liquor stores than white youths. The density of liquor stores and bars is lower in higher-income areas, especially for nonwhites. Conclusions: Mismatches between alcohol demand and the supply of liquor stores within urban neighborhoods constitute an environmental injustice for minorities and lower-income persons, with potential adverse consequences for drinking behavior and other social ills. Our results for bars are sensitive to the measure of outlet density as well as population density. Although neither measure is clearly superior, a measure that accounts for roadway miles may reflect proximity to alcohol retailers and thus serve as a useful refinement to the per-capita measure. If so, alcohol Policy might also focus on density per roadway mile. Further research on the existence, causes, and consequences of environmental injustice in alcohol retailing is warranted.

AB  - Mounting evidence over the past several decades has demonstrated inequitable distribution of pollutants of ambient origin between sociodemographic groups in the United States. Most environmental inequality studies to date are cross-sectional and used proximity-based methods rather than modeled air pollution concentrations, limiting the ability to examine trends over time or the factors that drive exposure inequalities. In this paper, we use 1 km(2) modeled PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations in Massachusetts over an 8-year period and Census demographic data to quantify inequality between sociodemographic groups and to develop a more nuanced understanding of the drivers and trends in longitudinal air pollution inequality. Annual-average population-weighted PM2 5 and NO2 concentrations were highest for urban non-Hispanic black populations (11.8 mu g/m(3) in 2003 and 8.4 mu g/m(3) in 2010, vs. 11.3 mu g/m(3) and 8.1 mu g/m(3) for urban non-Hispanic whites) and urban Hispanic populations (15.9 ppb in 2005 and 13.0 ppb in 2010, vs. 13.0 ppb and 10.2 ppb for urban non-Hispanic whites), respectively. While population groups experienced similar absolute decreases in exposure over time, disparities in population-weighted concentrations increased over time when quantified by the Atkinson Index, a relative inequality measure. Exposure inequalities were approximately one order of magnitude greater for NO2 compared to PM2.5, were more pronounced in urban compared to rural geographies, and between racial/ethnic groups compared to income and educational attainment groups. Our results also revealed similar longitudinal PM2.5 and NO2 inequality trends using Census 2000 and Census 2010 data, indicating that spatio-temporal shifts in air pollution may best explain observed trends in inequality. These findings enhance our understanding of factors that contribute to persistent inequalities and underscore the importance of targeted exposure reduction strategies aimed at vulnerable populations and neighborhoods.

AB  - Law can often be used to reduce or even eliminate the harm from pollution by manipulating "exposure allocation," or how pollution is allocated across a target population. Opportunities for exposure allocation arise whenever the relationship between exposure to a pollutant and harm is nonlinear, as is the case for many pollutants. For these pollutants, exposure allocation presents the potential for reducing the harm from pollution even when it is not possible to reduce either the total amount of pollution emitted or the total amount of exposure. After identifying the conditions under which changing exposure allocations can improve health and save lives, this Article identifies legal strategies for managing exposure allocation to minimize the harm caused by pollution.

AB  - Latin America hosts a diversity of ecological worldviews and practices rooted in Amerindian cultures (e.g., Aymara, Quechua, U'wa, and Waorani) and schools of thought (e.g., geoculture, decoloniality, liberation philosophy and ecotheology) that have actual and potential value for Earth Stewardship. However, global discourses do not adequately include the diversity of languages and ethics rooted in the heterogeneous biocultural mosaic of Latin America and other regions. This is due in part to the limited inter-linguistic and inter-cultural dialogue among academics, educators, and policy makers that reside in different regions of the world. To contribute to solving this deficit, this chapter couples the conceptual frameworks of Earth stewardship and the biocultural ethic to foster: (i) inter-cultural dialogues and negotiations that fracture the current homogeneity of neoliberal global discourses through the acknowledgement and inclusion of the diversity of ecological worldviews, values, and languages, and (ii) forms of biocultural interspecies co-inhabitation embedded in the diversity of habitats and life habits. A basic principle of the biocultural ethic is that life habits are interrelated with the communities of co-in-habitants and their habitats. These "3Hs" of the biocultural ethic offer a conceptual framework that can be coupled with three terms that identify Earth Stewardship: the habitats of the Earth, the habit of stewardship, and the communities of co-inhabitants including the stewards. This coupling makes explicit the participation of diverse stewards. To better recognize the stewards' diversity is essential to identify their differential responsibility in the genesis of global environmental change, at the same time that to visualize and value a plethora of ways of conceiving and practicing Earth stewardship.

AB  - Just participation in conservation decision-making is a moral imperative and critical to achieving social and ecological goals. However, understanding of what constitutes a just decision-making process in conservation remains limited. Integrating key literature from environmental justice, psychology of justice, and participatory conservation, we identify 11 procedural justice criteria, many of which have been overlooked in conservation literature. We develop a framework to help promote procedural justice in conservation decision-making which organizes the criteria into three key domains (Process properties, Agency of participants, Interpersonal treatment), which are underpinned by the justice dimension of recognition. We highlight seven policy levers that can be used to enhance procedural justice (e.g., scalar and contextual fit, conflict resolution, facilitation). However, advancing just decision-making using this framework requires addressing a number of key challenges, in particular those related to broader structural power inequalities, and elucidating and accounting for plural and situated conceptions of procedural justice. We outline a number of pathways to overcome these challenges, including promoting knowledge coproduction and self-reflexivity.

AB  - In recognition of the importance of equitable climate adaptation, municipalities have increasingly utilized participatory planning processes that engage communities. However, while climate adaptation planning has become more open to public input, these processes still do not ensure equitable outcomes. This study examined equity concerning climate adaptation planning processes in New York City with a focus on the relationship between community-based organizations and participatory planning. The two planning processes studied here were the OneNYC comprehensive resilience plan and the Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency policy. 57 organizations responded to a survey investigating awareness of, participation in, and barriers to engagement with planning. These variables were compared to characteristics of each organization such as the issues they work on and the demographics of their local community boards. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrating the roles that community-based organizations have played in climate adaptation planning in New York City. The results of the study demonstrated the existence of multiple barriers to engagement such as the absence of clarity about ongoing processes and a low understanding of how a climate adaptation plan may help an organization achieve its goals. This study has demonstrated that climate change adaptation planning processes should be revised in multiple ways to increase climate justice. The proposed changes are urgently needed because without equitable processes, there will be significant gaps in any cities' climate resilience.

AB  - In the United States, pediatric asthma is distributed geographically across lines of racialized segregation. We draw on emplacement, or the theory that embodied experiences and the material world are mutually informed, to situate such geographic trends within the narratives of 41 caregivers of children with asthma. Results suggest that caregivers identified and managed asthma-related risk with regard to the relational and structural conditions of three categories of locations: (1) houses, (2) neighborhoods, and (3) schools and other childhood institutions. Within each type of location, caregivers used emplaced knowledge and emplaced caregiving tactics to respond to asthma-related risk. Based on our findings, we identify critical intervention topics that are consistent with families' everyday lived experiences of place.

AB  - Indigenous and rural communities have developed strategies aimed at supporting their livelihoods and protecting biodiversity. Motivational factors underlying these local conservation strategies, however, are still a largely neglected topic. We aimed to enrich the conceptualization of community-based conservation by exploring trigger events and motivations that induce local people to be engaged in practical institutional arrangements for successful natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. By examining the history and development of three community conservation initiatives in Brazil, Mexico, and Bolivia, we have illustrated and discussed two main ways of understanding community-based conservation from the interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. First, incentive-based conservation policies can stimulate people's economic interests and mobilize individual and collective behavior toward the formalization of conservation-oriented actions. Second, environmental justice concerns, such as international and national movements for the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights, can support local people's sense of autonomy and result in increased control over their territory and resources, as well as a renewed conservation commitment. The results are useful from a policy perspective because they provide insight into the governance of conservation development by bridging the gap between communities' culturally based motivations for conservation, which are still embedded in customary institutions, and broader political and socioeconomic contexts.

We show that European UGS scholarship primarily focuses on functional values and managerial aspects of UGS, while paying less attention to equity in the enjoyment of and decision-making around UGS. On this basis we discuss potentials for European urban green space research to take up a more explicit environmental justice framing to shed much-needed light on injustices in European cities and inspire change in policy and practice.

AB  - In the last decade, unconventional oil and gas (UOG) has changed the world's energy landscapes, often outpacing governments' efforts to regulate it. Yet, few studies focus on the processes of governance, particularly on questions of procedural equity. Here we examine the process of the 2014 Colorado Oil and Gas Task Force (TF), which was established to address regulatory conflicts over drilling, particularly along the Northern Colorado Front Range. The TF aimed to create a level playing field for influencing decision-making. However, we find that several power mechanisms were deployed by the state and the industry, ensuring that those with the least opportunity to meaningfully influence outcomes were also most likely to be impacted by the TF's regulatory recommendations had the least opportunity to meaningfully influence the process and its outcomes. Thus we advance existing literature on procedural injustice by focusing on the underlying power mechanisms that help structure procedural injustice in these processes.

AB  - Planners require definitions of transportation accessibility that combine physical connectivity with the interlocking socio-spatial constraints that shape how potential travelers (especially lower income travelers) differentially access the benefits of the transportation system. We propose a framework that modifies physical accessibility - traditional impedance-based accessibility measures - with experienced accessibility reflective of individual constraints related to social, demographic, and economic variables. Our methodology begins with measuring key non-linear correlations between accessibility and constraints that ultimately drive a k-means cluster analysis to comprehensively group census tracts by constraint variables. We then juxtapose the clusters against empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) of their accessibility to develop an equity-driven planning framework that defines key areas for transport intervention. This approach provides greater insight into the constraints individuals face, their true ability to engage with the transportation system, and the effect that interventions would have on their access to the needs of daily life.

AB  - Low-income households may be disproportionately affected by ozone pollution and ozone policy. We quantify how three factors affect the relative benefits of ozone policies with household income: (1) unequal ozone reductions; (2) policy delay; and (3) economic valuation methods. We model ozone concentrations under baseline and policy conditions across the full continental United States to estimate the distribution of ozone-related health impacts across nine income groups. We enhance an economic model to include these impacts across household income categories, and present its first application to evaluate the benefits of ozone reductions for low-income households. We find that mortality incidence rates decrease with increasing income. Modeled ozone levels yield a median of 11 deaths per 100 000 people in 2005. Proposed policy reduces these rates by 13%. Ozone reductions are highest among low-income households, which increases their relative welfare gains by up to 4% and decreases them for the rich by up to 8%. The median value of reductions in 2015 is either $30 billion (in 2006 U.S. dollars) or $1 billion if reduced mortality risks are valued with willingness-to-pay or as income from increased life expectancy. Ozone reductions were relatively twice as beneficial for the lowest- compared to the highest-income households. The valuation approach affected benefits more than a policy delay or differential ozone reductions with income.

Using a variety of techniques, including geographic information systems (GIS) mapping, univariate comparisons, and legit, ordered legit, and tobit regression analysis, the authors find that, even controlling for other factors such as income and the extent of manufacturing employment and land use, minority residents tend to be disproportionately located in neighborhoods surrounding toxic air emissions. The results generally support the propositions of the proponents of "environmental justice "; in the conclusion, they consider what this might mean for urban land use and environmental policy.

AB  - In conservation, trust and justice are increasingly recognized as both intrinsically valuable and critical for successful socioecological outcomes. However, the interdependence between these concepts has not been explored. The conservation trust literature provides examples of efforts to build trust between conservationists and local actors; yet, these interventions are often conceived to incentivize local cooperation within dominant paradigms. We argue that when trust building is promoted as a technical fix that does not plan in advance to address power asymmetries in conservation practice, inequities may inadvertently be re-embedded. Therefore, we conceptualized a framework that joins trust, justice, and power so that critical analyses of conservation partnerships can be more effectively undertaken. We drew on environmental justice theory to better calibrate the trust literature for the historical-political settings of conservation, especially in the Global South. Justice and trust share strong theoretical links where perceptions of justice shape a willingness to trust, and, equally, trust is a precondition for justice to be perceived. Different forms of trust connect to varied domains of justice and power in different ways, which mediates the outcomes of interventions. We applied our framework to case studies to explore how these interdependences play out in practice. Failure of agencies to attend to issues of maldistribution, misrecognition of cultural values and knowledge, and exclusion from participation strongly compromised trust. Moreover, the ways in which nature-dependent communities and marginalized conservation workers are trusted, or the conditions under which they give trust, can lead to partnerships being perceived as just or unjust. Focusing on trust and justice can help identify power dynamics so they can be addressed more readily and create space for alternative understandings of partnerships.

AB  - Over the past three decades, an array of legislation with attendant regulations has been implemented to enhance the quality of the environment and thereby improve the public's health. Despite the many beneficial changes that have followed, there remains a disproportionately higher prevalence of harmful environmental exposures, particularly air pollution, for certain populations. These populations most often reside in urban settings, have low socioeconomic status, and include a large proportion of ethnic minorities. The disparities between racial/ethnic minority and/or low-income populations in cities and the general population in terms of environmental exposures and related health risks have prompted the "environmental justice" or "environmental equity" movement, which strives to create cleaner environments for the most polluted communities. Achieving cleaner environments will require interventions based on scientific data specific to the populations at risk; however, research in this area has been relatively limited. To assess the current scientific information on urban air pollution and its health impacts and to help set the agenda for immediate intervention and future research, the American Lung Association organized an invited workshop on Urban Air Pollution and Health Inequities held 22-24 October 1999 in Washington, DC. This report builds on literature reviews and summarizes the discussions of working groups charged with addressing key areas relevant to air pollution and health effects in urban environments. An overview was provided of the state of the science for health impacts of air pollution and technologies available for air quality monitoring and exposure assessment. The working groups then prioritized research needs to address the knowledge gaps and developed recommendations for community interventions and public policy to begin to remedy the exposure and health inequities.

AB  - In accordance with Article 15 of the Aarhus Convention, the first meeting of the parties to this Convention established a non-judicial and consultative Compliance Committee to consider, among other matters, individual cases concerning compliance by parties with their obligations. The Committee is traditionally viewed as a non-judicial, soft mechanism and its rulings as non-binding, soft law. In recent years, however, to support the claim that rulings of the Committee have an impact and legal effects, some scholars have departed from the traditional perspective and characterized the Committee as a more judicialized mechanism, which issues legally binding rulings. This characterization assumes a correlation between judicialization and binding effect on the one hand, and legal effect on the other. The latter claim, however, has not been supported by a systematic assessment of the impact of the Committee's rulings on domestic practice. Against this background, the article assesses the impact of Article 9-related rulings of the Committee, issued between 2004 and 2012, on national legal orders. The assessment reveals that in fewer than 41% of the cases parties recorded some degree of compliance with the rulings of the Committee, whereas in 59% they recorded no progress. The quantitative assessment and respective qualitative insights, among other factors, suggest that the normative character of the Committee and its rulings play an auxiliary role in the process of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Aarhus Convention. The decision of parties to comply is determined typically by the substance of the rulings as they stand in relation to domestic circumstances rather than by the institutional features of the Committee and binding effect of its rulings.

Four measures of stream health were considered: the Index of Biological Integrity, Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, Family Index of Biological Integrity, and number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa. The stream health indicators were predicted using nine socioeconomic variables that capture vulnerability in population. The results of spatial clustering showed that incorporating clustering configuration improves the model prediction. A total of 510 Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFAs) and 85 multivariate regression models were developed for each spatial cluster within the watershed and compared with the model performance without spatial clustering (at the watershed level). In general, watershed level CFAs outperformed cluster level CFAs, while the reverse was true for the regression models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In May 2008, the city of Chaiten was completely evacuated due to the probability of a volcanic eruption. Few days later, the eruption caused severe flooding that almost destroyed the entire city. In the following months, the state developed plans for the relocation of Chaiten, and strategies to promote resilience and the recovery of population. However, plans and strategies resulted in unexpected results impacting people's ability to resist, adapt to, and recover from future disasters. This paper explores a potential asymmetric relationship in the distribution of environmental risks and resilience within Chaiten. Such relationship can be partially explained by the volcanic eruption, but more importantly, by unforeseen effects of decision making and policies implemented for the recovery of the affected population. Effects of the implemented benefit schemes and decision making related to the inhabitability/relocation of Chaiten can offer some explanation about the current situation of Chaiten; a highly segregated and environmentally unjust city where public policies' outputs are unevenly distributed. In this sense, this paper examines how plans and policies developed towards increasing resilience among population may, inversely, impact negatively on environmental justice, that is, on the distribution of environmental risks, exposure and disaster impacts.

AB  - In May 2008, the remote city of Chaiten in Chile was evacuated due to the risk of a volcano eruption. Few days later, severe floods drove to the destruction of the almost entire city. In the months following the disaster, the Government developed projects that failed to relocate the city to a safer location as well as strategies to support the affected population aimed to improve community resilience. Contradictory institutional policies as well as the unforeseen effects of implemented bond schemes have resulted in a highly segregated and environmentally unjust city where public policies' outputs are unevenly distributed. Thus, this paper addresses how some related processes of increasing resilience may impact negatively upon environmental justice, hence exploring a potential inverse relationship between resilience and environmental justice. Five years on, nearly half of the population have returned to Chaiten despite the refusal of the authorities. While northern Chaiten concentrates most of the population and investment, 160 families living in the southern Chaiten bear the lack of potable water and other basic services, and are more vulnerable to future disaster impacts. Split in two due to both geography and policies, Chaiten faces now two realities. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier BA/.

AB  - In the last few decades, there has been an increase in community-based participatory research being conducted within the United States. Recent research has demonstrated that working with local community organizations, interest groups, and individuals can assist in the creation of, and sustainability in, health initiatives, adoption of emergency protocols, and potentially improve health outcomes for at-risk populations. However little research has assessed if communal concerns over environmental contaminants would be confirmed through environmental research. This cross-sectional study collected survey data and performed surface water analysis for heavy metals in a small neighborhood in Houston, TX, which is characterized by industrial sites, unimproved infrastructure, nuisance flooding, and poor air quality. Surveys were completed with 109 residents of the Manchester neighborhood. Water samples were taken from thirty zones within the neighborhood and assessed for arsenic (As), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), and mercury (Hg). Survey results showed that the vast majority of all respondents were concerned over proximity to industry and waste facilities, as well as exposure to standing surface water. Barium was discovered in every sample and many of the zones showed alarming levels of certain metals. For example, one zone, two blocks from a public park, showed levels of arsenic at 180 (g/L), barium at 3296 (g/L), chromium at 363 (g/L), lead at 1448 (g/L), and mercury at 10 (g/L). These findings support the hypothesis that neighborhood members are aware of the issues affecting their community and can offer researchers valuable assistance in every stage of study design and execution.

AB  - Mushrooming opposition to coal mining and transportation in the United States (US) connects with both environmental justice and climate justice movements. Artistic expressions are part of the strategic toolkit of these movements. Art's capacity to foster cultural, cognitive and psychological changes is amply recognized by academics as well as by public in general. Nevertheless, the theoretical question of how art is linked to activist strategies and to socio-spatial transformations in environmental conflicts remains unexplored. This paper contributes to filling this gap by examining the emblematic struggle to stop the construction of a coal-export terminal in Oakland, CA. Our data includes 32 in-depth interviews of activists, artists and legal experts linked to the conflict surrounding this coal-export terminal. Non-participant observation and secondary data collection helped to contextualize the interviews. The results offer a timeline of the movement, a map of artistic expressions, and network analyses around the effects of environmental artistic activism. We demonstrate that creative activism has critical relevance for facilitating engagement, education and outreach of the anti-coal movement. Arts and its spatial impact benefited the movement by expanding its scale and making it more inclusive regarding demographics, including particularly women and youth of color. The use of the arts raised environmental and political awareness and enhanced public participation in decision making. The paper connects the literatures of environmental justice, environmental humanities and human geography. We contribute to the yet underdeveloped dialogue discussing the capacity of art to influence socio-ecological structures and socio-spatial dynamics in cases of environmental justice conflict.

AB  - Popularly referred to as the "Blue-Green conflicts," the tensions between labor and environmental movements have received extensive scholarly attention as it exposes the trade-off between the economy and the environment. The jobs versus the environment trade-off has been a focal point of tension in the relationship between trade-unions and green movements across the globe. In this article, I critically review the existing literature on labor and environmental conflicts from a Global South standpoint. The review exposes how the extant literature on labor-environmental relations almost exclusively focuses on cases and settings in the Global North, thereby centering the process of inquiry entirely around western social contexts and movements. In this article, I demonstrate why the conception of environmentalism as a middle-class phenomenon within the extant literature is problematic as; (a) it fails to consider the poor and working-class environmental movements in countries in the Global South, and (b) it completely overlooks the environmental justice movements and other working-class environmental movements in the Global North itself. The review highlights the need to bring postcolonial movements and settings to the center of sociological analysis to decolonize the research on social movements.

AB  - Indigenous peoples, who depend on their environment for livelihoods and are often subject to poverty and socio-economic marginalization, are some of the most vulnerable to climate change. While the rights of Indigenous peoples are recognized internationally, these are not translated into adaptation responses. Using insights from theories of environmental justice in the case of Uganda's Batwa community, we assess how justice-related factors impact their adaptive capacities and whether these are incorporated in the design and implementation of adaptation responses. Our findings reveal a multi-dimensional range of systemic injustices experienced by Batwa, resulting from their continued social-economic, cultural and political marginalization. Additionally, a variety of projects are happening locally in relation to 'adaptation' but not labelled as such, suggesting how Batwa's vulnerability is rooted in wider aspects of livelihoods and development. Most projects tend to focus on distribution of material benefits, while less attention is paid to the more intricate issues of compensation, political discrimination and uneven participation. This depoliticized and compartmentalized approach suggests a slow and incomplete way of operationalizing justice. Hence, we call for sincere efforts to address recognition, rights, and disproportionate levels of disadvantage for Indigenous communities, including their constitutional recognition, financial redress and participation in decision-making.

AB  - Policies and projects aimed at Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, and the sustainable management of forests and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD + ), have been regarded as an opportunity to improve forest governance while supporting rural livelihoods. However, now that REDD + policies are being increasingly implemented, a number of justice-related challenges have emerged, including how social heterogeneity should be approached to avoid deepening the unequal access to land, resources and livelihood opportunities or even violating human rights in rural contexts. Applying an environmental justice lens, this article analyses the experience of three local communities in Nepal participating in REDD + pilot projects, focusing on how indigenous peoples, women and Dalits have participated in and been affected by such initiatives. Our research shows that the studied REDD + pilot activities in Nepal have been, to some extent, able to recognise, empower and benefit certain social groups, indigenous women in particular, whilst Dalits (particularly Dalit women) had a different experience. REDD + projects have had limited impact in addressing more entrenched processes of political discrimination, male dominance in decision-making, and uneven participation driven by spatial considerations or specific social targeting approaches. While the projects examined here have been partially just, and rather sensitive to existing patterns of social differentiation, the complexity of social differentiation still makes it difficult to operationalise environmental justice in REDD + implementation. Hence, we conclude that deficits in distributive, recognition and procedural justice cannot be resolved without first addressing wider issues of social injustices throughout Nepal, historically inherited along the dimensions of class, caste, ethnicity, gender, and spatiality.

AB  - In the first decade of Scottish devolution, environmental justice became a significant component of environmental policy for the Scottish Executive, especially under First Minister Jack McConnell. This paper analyses how a discourse developed within policy narratives which separated environmental justice from economic growth and the interests of capital. In particular, it explores the role which research has played in justifying this discourse. By contrast, an alternative discourse has developed through reflexive and dialogical research associated with the praxis of the environmental organization Friends of the Earth Scotland. This alternative discourse is embedded in the embryonic environmental justice movement in Scotland, and identifies environmental justice as a social conflict which exposes negative externalities at the heart of economic development.

AB  - Moving toward a sustainable global society requires substantial change in both social and technological systems. This sustainability is dependent not only on addressing the environmental impacts of current social and technological systems, but also on addressing the social, economic and political harms that continue to be perpetuated through systematic forms of oppression and the exclusion of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities. To adequately identify and address these harms, we argue that scientists, practitioners, and communities need a transdisciplinary framework that integrates multiple types of knowledge, in particular, Indigenous and experiential knowledge. Indigenous knowledge systems embrace relationality and reciprocity rather than extraction and oppression, and experiential knowledge grounds transition priorities in lived experiences rather than expert assessments. Here, we demonstrate how an Indigenous, experiential, and community-based participatory framework for understanding and advancing socio-technological system transitions can facilitate the co-design and co-development of community-owned energy systems.

AB  - Inequalities in exposure to environmental hazards and access to environmental amenities have been documented in many cities, in relation to residential segregation of low-income or minority groups. The literature on residential segregation measurement, however, has not yet been considered a source of insights for the measurement of environmental inequalities. Here, we propose two segregation-based indices-the Environmental Dissimilarity gap index (Delta EDK) and the Environmental Centralization index (ECd)-and a randomization method to make robust environmental inequality assessments. In addition, to help policy-makers target local policies better, we developed an original approach to identify and map hotspots that have a large influence on environmental inequalities. These methods are applied in Grenoble, France, to study the distribution of green spaces and industrial risks between poor and non-poor households.

AB  - In this research article, I emphasize the meaning of procedural rights for just transition to Green Economy. I argue that different justice arguments play a role in the context of Green Economy policies but can be traded-off against one another. Whereas intergenerational and international injustice can be diminished by zero-carbon policies, Green Economy transition processes can exacerbate already existing intrasocietal injustices. This is even more the case if vulnerable societal groups cannot participate and are not adequately represented in repressive political systems. In such cases, installing procedural justice mechanisms and comprehensively considering different justice concerns in Green Economy policies can lead to more sustainable outcomes. My empirical analysis focuses on Ethiopia as a case study placing an emphasis on the hydroelectric Gibe III dam. Empirically, it is based on a content analysis of policy documents and field research comprising expert interviews with governmental representatives, international organizations and civil society.

AB  - In this paper we use the lens of political ecology to shed light on the causes and effects of pro-poor REDD+ induced land use conflicts. We build our study on recent theoretical work on territorialisation in nature conservation to analyse the conflicts and outcomes of the TFCG/Mjumita REDD+ project in Lindi, Tanzania. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork in two case study villages we argue that conservation organisations increasingly make use of participatory tools, FPIC procedures and good governance principles to include local populations in the creation of what we call market-based conservation territories (MBCT). In contrast to project developer's claims of win-win benefits, we highlight the mixed outcomes of MBCTs and argue that their performance-driven nature and reliance on formal governance arrangements lead to the enclosure of common forests. This inevitably causes conflicts between and within villages over the meaning, ownership and access to forest resources, especially given the importance of customary relations in tropical rural contexts. We argue that despite the extensive community engagement strategy and genuine pro-poor approach of the REDD+ project, project proponents were unable to prevent land use conflicts and risks of economic and physical displacement. The specific social, economic and political conditions shaped the implementation of the project which led to negative consequences to some stakeholders despite genuinely noble intentions. Therefore, we argue that in order to achieve more positive results when creating MBCT, project developers must better acknowledge the inherent tradeoffs of markets in conservation and take the limitations and realities of local governance context better into account. We suggest a more explicit assessment of social and environmental justice in the project and more context-specific efforts to prevent social harm from conservation. Theoretically, our study contributes to a better understanding of territorialisation processes under the current trend of market-based conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It has often been said that 'fairness lies in the eye of the beholder'. Contrary to decision criteria such as economic efficiency, the notion of fairness or equity cannot be given a definition independent from context. Economists have thus long shied away from including concerns about justice in their policy recommendations. Here we take context-dependence as a starting point and turn it into an advantage. We first establish that it is not random but highly structured by both social position-dependent and non-positional dimensions of context, and these can also interact in specific ways. We use laboratory experiments to explore the role of wealth and need (in the form of 'mouths to feed') and that of real financial incentives, veil-of-ignorance and equity-efficiency trade-offs. We also find that the very definition of equity norms is context-dependent in terms of implicit parameters and sub-rules. Insights from these results led to the construction of an 'equity metric' that is able to represent a collective's heterogeneous equity preferences that minimise total 'perceived inequity'. Although it has some inherent limitations, our metric increases the likelihood for equity and a competing policy goal to correlate positively, thereby reducing tensions and allowing higher achievements of both.

AB  - One significant challenge for the operationalization of water justice arises from the many dynamic scales involved. In this paper we explore the scalar dimension of justice in water governance through the insights derived from empirical research on hydropower production in the Swiss Alps and the application of the geographical concept of politics of scale. More specifically, we investigate how different actors frame the justice problem, the scales that they invoke and which actors consequently get included or excluded in their justice assessments. This study shows that there is no ideal scale for justice evaluations; whichever scale is used, some actors and justice claims are included whereas others are excluded. This is particularly true when using Fraser's trivalent concept of justice, taking into account issues of distribution, recognition and participation where each calls for its own set of scales. Moreover, focusing on the politics of scale framing, our study reveals that the justice claim itself can become a power element. Consequently, to achieve more just water governance, there is not only a need for debate and negotiations about the conceptions and meanings of justice in a specific context, there is also a need for debate about the relevance and implications of divergent scales involved in justice claims.

AB  - This article reviews the burgeoning emerging literature on sustainable degrowth. This is defined as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that increases human well-being and enhances ecological conditions at the local and global level, in the short and long term. The paradigmatic propositions of degrowth are that economic growth is not sustainable and that human progress without economic growth is possible. Degrowth proponents come from diverse origins. Some are critics of market globalization, new technologies or the imposition of western models of development in the rest of the world. All criticize GDP accounting though they propose often different social and ecological indicators. Degrowth theorists and practitioners support an extension of human relations instead of market relations, demand a deepening of democracy, defend ecosystems, and propose a more equal distribution of wealth. We distinguish between depression, i.e. unplanned degrowth within a growth regime, and sustainable degrowth, a voluntary, smooth and equitable transition to a regime of lower production and consumption. The question we ask is how positive would degrowth be if instead of being imposed by an economic crisis, it would actually be a democratic collective decision, a project with the ambition of getting closer to ecological sustainability and socio-environmental justice worldwide. Most articles in this issue were originally presented at the April 2008 conference in Paris on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity. This conference brought the word degrowth and the concepts around it into an international academic setting. Articles of this special issue are summarized in this introductory article. Hueting, d'Alessandro and colleagues, van den Bergh, Kerschner, Spangenberg and Alcott discuss whether current growth patterns are (un)sustainable and offer different perspectives on what degrowth might mean, and whether and under what conditions it might be desirable. Matthey and Hamilton focus on social dynamics and the obstacles and opportunities for voluntary social action towards degrowth. Lietaert and Cattaneo with Gavalda offer a down-to-earth empirical discussion of two practical living experiments: cohousing and squats, highlighting the obstacles for scaling up such alternatives. Finally van Griethuysen explains why growth is an imperative in modern market economies, raising also the question whether degrowth is possible without radical institutional changes.

AB  - Objectives: The deprivation amplification hypothesis postulates that the socially disadvantaged are exposed to further structural deprivation by their residential environment such that social inequalities are therefore amplified. To date, no publication has investigated deprivation amplification solely using playgrounds; the present health geography study investigates this hypothesis with regard to the availability of playgrounds in a typical large German city. Study design: Between July 2016 and January 2017, all playgrounds in the city of Mannheim, Germany, were identified and evaluated by systematic audits. The playground attributes such as availability, accessibility, surface area, and provided amenities were operationalized using well-established, validated instruments. Methods: Geo-information about playgrounds was digitalized in ArcGIS 10.2-10.4 and linked to socioeconomic indicators on the meso-level, that is, on the level of 44 social areas. Availability and accessibility of playgrounds were quantified by calculating kernel density and Euclidean distance, respectively. Playground surface area and equipment provided were linked to the number of children and adolescents in the particular social area. The association between availability and accessibility of playgrounds and area-level indicators were assessed using bivariate and multiple Poisson regressions on the meso-level. Results: In the city of Mannheim, which covers 145 km(2) and is home to 311,000 inhabitants, 271 playgrounds were identified. Bivariate and multiple analyses showed no association between availability and accessibility of playgrounds and area-level indicators. However, significant negative associations were found in the bivariate analyses between playground area and amenities provided per child and various area-level indicators, but not in multiple models. Conclusions: Children are provided with different opportunities to play and to be physically active, depending upon the population density of their social neighborhood. At least in our study area, many socially disadvantaged families are forced to move to densely populated areas for economic reasons. Against that background, the phenomenon of 'deprivation amplification' was not confirmed for availability and accessibility of playgrounds but for playground area and number of amenities provided.

AB  - Marginalized individuals are less likely to participate or have their interests represented in political processes than historically privileged individuals. Interest groups are considered the best means to address this gap, but there is little research on the role of interest groups in mobilizing people to participate in political processes and none on marginalized communities in particular. This paper is the first to test hypotheses about organizational strategies used to mobilize vulnerable communities for political participation around unconventional oil and gas policies in California and Colorado. Based on a survey of interest groups in both states, the results show that interest groups working in vulnerable communities do more outside advocacy (i.e., connecting residents to representatives) and use more personal communication methods (i.e., door-to-door canvassing) than interest groups working in historically privileged communities. However, organizational strategies in general are not well predicted by the target community's composition, suggesting that decisions around mobilization strategies are driven by other factors.

AB  - In northern Tanzania in the late 1980s and 1990s, rural communities displaced by the creation of wildlife protection areas advanced a number of grievances centered on equitable access to resources and compensation for wildlife-induced property loss and injuries, only to find their concerns largely ignored by policymakers. Instead, the country's elite cadre of wildlife managers has formed a consensus around the idea that community concerns can best be addressed through the market by redistributing wildlife-sector revenues. This article explores three different initiatives whose proponents enjoy different levels of tenure security vis-a-vis wildlife resources. A comparison of these programs demonstrates that they stress quite different and sometimes competing and contradictory rationales for pursuing revenue-sharing strategies, with varying degrees of emphasis on the environmental justice claims of Tanzania's rural citizens.

AB  - Objective: Previous studies have demonstrated associations between race-based residential segregation, neighborhood socioeconomic and physical environmental characteristics, and mortality. Relatively few studies have examined independent and joint effects of these multiple neighborhood characteristics and mortality, including potential mediating pathways. In this study we examine the extent to which associations between race-based residential segregation and all-cause mortality may be explained by multiple socioeconomic indicators and exposure to air pollutants. Methods: Drawing on data from multiple sources, we assessed bivariate associations between race-based residential segregation (operationalized as percent non-Hispanic Black), education (percent with graduate equivalency degree), poverty (percent below poverty), income inequality (GINI coefficient) and air pollution (ambient PM2.5) and age adjusted all-cause, all race mortality (henceforth all cause mortality) at the census tract level in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. We used inequality curves to assess the (in)equitable distribution of economic and environmental characteristics by census tract racial composition. Finally, we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine independent and joint associations among percent NHB, education, income inequality, and air pollution to all-cause mortality, and test for mediating effects. Results: Bivariate associations between racial composition, education, poverty, income inequality, PM2.5 and allcause mortality were statistically significant. Census tracts with higher concentrations of NHB residents had significantly lower educational attainment, higher poverty, and greater exposure to PM2.5. In multivariate models, education, income inequality and PM2.5 fully attenuated associations between racial composition and all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that race-based residential segregation is associated with heightened all-cause mortality, and that those effects are mediated by education, income inequality, and exposure to air pollution at the census tract level. Public health and cross-sector interventions to eliminate race-based residential segregation or to eliminate the maldistribution of educational and economic resources, and environmental exposures, across census tracts could substantially reduce regional inequities in all-cause mortality.

AB  - Many cities, especially in the U.S. Rust Belt, have experienced long-term declines in population which has the potential to alter social-ecological patterns and, as a result, environmental justice indicators. Housing vacancy, in particular, is intricately tied to changes in both economic and environmental systems. Vacancy may drive increases in volunteer vegetation, creating a potential disamenity and artificially producing outcomes that suggest more equitable relationships between greenness and social variables. Toledo is a shrinking city in northwest Ohio whose population peaked in 1970 at 383,818 before declining by more than 100,000 people. We examined satellite imagery from 1980, 2000, and 2014 to assess changes in greenness (NDVI: normalized difference vegetation index) and its association with housing vacancy statistics to determine whether the relationship between greenness and housing vacancy changed. We observed a weakening relationship between vacancy and NDVI. Specifically, there was a significant negative relationship in 1980; whereas, in 2014 there was no statistical relationship. As vacancy is highly correlated with vulnerable populations, this changing trajectory has implications for environmental justice indicators. Our results highlight a key limitation of using vegetation quantity as an indicator of environmental amenities and suggest more nuanced approaches to evaluating environmental justice indicators are needed.

AB  - Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic many municipalities closed or limited access to parks. A few also added new shared streets for citizens to recreate. This large and unprecedented change in the ability of residents to use green space provides an important case for assessing how emergency planning processes might differentially impact minority groups. Methods: Using the case of park closures and shared streets expansion in Denver, Colorado in March and April of 2020, this analysis evaluates how walking time and density of use at parks changed for different minority and income groups based on estimating park visits for residential blocks. Results: The analysis demonstrates that minority and low income groups were not disproportionately impacted by initial closures. Shared streets provide net decreases across the city in terms of travel time and density for recreational space usage, though there is some indication benefits were not equally distributed. Conclusion: The result emphasizes the importance of modern planning efforts and community engagement in ensuring equitable urban resilience while highlighting the potential for shared streets to provide more recreational accessibility if they can be equitably located.

AB  - One major feature of recent global environmental changes is the increasing number of local environmental conflicts throughout the world. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and dynamic framework to capture the socio-political transformations that place-based environmental resistance movements produce. Indeed, these conflicts are most often considered by dominant actors as a manifestation of the NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) phenomenon. In order to advance a framework capable of capturing the complexity of the socio-political effects of local environmental resistance movements, the goal of this paper is to further pursue the development of the concept of "enlightened resistance", which analyzes place-based struggles through four types of capital - social, knowledge, patrimonial and political - each with societal implications. This goal is mainly achieved through new conceptual and methodological developments in the framework which evolves towards an "enlightening resistance" framework, and through its application to three case studies from a comparative perspective. The authors develop a set of criteria in order to compare their case studies according to the four types of societal transformations that characterise the enlightening resistance framework. They argue here that this dynamic framework may be useful to the environmental justice movement to strengthen its capacity to assess the socio-political impacts of local environmental resistance movements.

AB  - Island communities are the targets for a wide range of interventions designed to help them adapt to climate change. A growing body of research explores the equity and justice implications of adaptation policies and programmes, revealing they often exacerbate, rather than alleviate, inequality within at-risk communities. This paper pushes beyond existing understandings of climate justice, which prioritise its distributive and procedural aspects. Through household surveys, interviews and participant observation, the paper presents a case study of a major adaptation project in a small island community in the Philippines, paying particular attention to its equity implications at the local level. It describes how local politics and power relations distorted the well-intentioned aims of the project and resulted in the project exacerbating, rather than alleviating, pre-existing inequality. Climate change adaptation is a deeply political process that is easily subverted by the interests of the powerful. To mitigate the influence of power and politics in future climate adaptation projects, we present an expanded multidimensional framework for assessing adaptative justice that incorporates the neglected aspects of recognition and structure.

AB  - It is important to understand environmental and conservation consciousness, commonly referred to as 'environmentalism', considering the crisis of global environmental change. Environmentalism of the North has been characterized as focused on 'pristine' landscapes of wilderness. In contrast, discussions on environmentalism of the South focus on indigenous and long-settled communities with intrinsic associations to nature, keeping social justice at the core. In an increasingly globalized world characterized by migration, teleconnections and changing ecologies, environmental placemaking helps us move beyond these dichotomies to understand the dynamic process by which diverse social and ecological practices, meanings and attachments to nature can be collectively harnessed for conservation. We discuss the growing body of literature that examines environmental placemaking and argue that this literature contributes significant explanatory power to land change science, by helping understand the motivations that act as precursors to shape both proximate drivers of land change, and responses to them.

AB  - Individual-level Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) case data suggest that certain populations may be more impacted by the pandemic. However, few studies have considered the communities from which positive cases are prevalent, and the variations in testing rates between communities. In this study, we assessed community factors that were associated with COVID-19 testing and test positivity at the census tract level for the Seattle, King County, Washington region at the summer peak of infection in July 2020. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to estimate confirmed case counts, adjusted for testing numbers, which were associated with socioeconomic status (SES) indicators such as poverty, educational attainment, transportation cost, as well as with communities with high proportions of people of color. Multivariate models were also used to examine factors associated with testing rates, and found disparities in testing for communities of color and communities with transportation cost barriers. These results demonstrate the ability to identify tract-level indicators of COVID-19 risk and specific communities that are most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, as well as highlight the ongoing need to ensure access to disease control resources, including information and education, testing, and future vaccination programs in low-SES and highly diverse communities.

AB  - In countries like Sierra Leone, where stock assessments based on fisheries-independent data and complex population models are financially and technically challenging, catch statistics may be used to infer fluctuations in fish stocks where more precise data are not available. However, FAO FishStat, the most widely-used time-series data on global fisheries 'catches' (actually `landings'), does not account for Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) catches and relies on statistics provided by the national agencies of each member country. As such, reported FishStat data is vulnerable to changes in monitoring capacity, governmental transitions, and budgetary constraints, and may substantially underestimate the measure of extracted marine resources. In this report, Sierra Leone's total catches by all marine fishing sectors were estimated for the period 1950-2015, using a catch reconstruction approach incorporating national data, expert knowledge, and both peer-reviewed and grey literature. Results demonstrate that a substantial amount of marine resource exploitation is not represented in official statistics, and reconstructed catches represent more than 2.25 times the recorded FAO Fishstat values. Notably, foreign fleets take the vast majority of industrial catch in Sierra Leone's EEZ, indicating that most of the resource catch and revenue is diverted to foreign companies and export markets. While foreign actors dominate the industrial sector, the small-scale sector represents the majority of domestic catch. Illegal fishing is also a substantial challenge in Sierra Leone, and extracts a large amount of the country's marine fish resources. Reconstructing catches in Sierra Leone also highlights the impacts of various historical events such as Sierra Leone's civil war and post-war reconstruction on the development of the fisheries sector. The results found in the reconstruction present a large discrepancy from FishStat data, with considerable implications for assessment of stocks and management of Sierra Leone's marine resources.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze a major controversy regarding the allocation of water for Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches during a period of extreme drought in the state of Maharashtra in India. We use a discursive approach to public policy to understand water policy production and to analyze the competing narratives on water advanced by opposing discourse coalitions during the 'IPL vs. drought' controversy. We find that the neoliberal view of 'water as an economic good' is dominant and institutionalized in the water allocation priorities determined by the Maharashtra State government. This is resisted by civil society actors like Loksatta and by the Indian judiciary, who view 'water as a Human Right.' Our reading of the 'IPL vs. drought' public interest litigation (PIL) shows that Loksatta's decision to target water allocation for the IPL through the Courts leverages the popularity of the IPL in the Indian media, as well as the uneven unfolding of neoliberalism across institutions of the state in India. At the same time, Loksatta's PIL focuses solely on the IPL and does not pay attention to the water allocation to larger users like industry and sugarcane cultivation that best represent the institutionalization of the neoliberal view of water in Maharashtra. We argue that the focus on the IPL makes it the site of contesting water policy on ideological grounds. We conclude by examining the challenge provided by Loksatta's PIL to the dominant neoliberal view of water in Maharashtra.

AB  - Oilfield-adjacent communities often report symptoms such as headaches and/or asthma. Yet, little data exists on health experiences and exposures in urban environments with oil and gas development. In partnership with Promotoras de Salud (community health workers), we gathered household surveys nearby two oil production sites in Los Angeles. We tested the capacity of low-cost sensors for localized exposure estimates. Bilingual surveys of 205 randomly sampled residences were collected within two 1500 ft. buffer areas (West Adams and University Park) surrounding oil development sites. We used a one-sample proportion test, comparing overall rates from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) of Service Planning Area 6 (SPA6) and Los Angeles County for variables of interest such as asthma. Field calibrated low-cost sensors recorded methane emissions. Physician diagnosed asthma rates were reported to be higher within both buffers than in SPA6 or LA County. Asthma prevalence in West Adams but not University Park was significantly higher than in Los Angeles County. Respondents with diagnosed asthma reported rates of emergency room visits in the previous 12 months similar to SPA6. 45% of respondents were unaware of oil development; 63% of residents would not know how to contact local regulatory authorities. Residents often seek information about their health and site-related activities. Low-cost sensors may be useful in highlighting differences between sites or recording larger emission events and can provide localized data alongside resident-reported symptoms. Regulatory officials should help clarify information to the community on methods for reporting health symptoms. Our community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership supports efforts to answer community questions as residents seek a safety buffer between sensitive land uses and active oil development.

AB  - In this chapter, we describe how social epidemiology has been proficient at describing patterns in neighbourhood health inequalities and even in modelling them in a sophisticated fashion, but has been less capable at fostering an understanding of how these effects relate to the social mechanisms of causation that underlie such inequalities at multiple levels - including with respect to neighbourhoods and more macrosocial contexts. We argue that this paradigm has to be shifted to improve the translation of research about neighbourhoods and health into effective health equity interventions, and we outline some specific ways for social epidemiologists to supplement their approach to research. We thereby problematize the social epidemiologic treatment of neighbourhoods as simple containers as a way of clarifying how neighbourhood effects may reflect complex fundamental and proximate causes of health disparities. We also describe four assumptions of commonly used, multilevel models that ought to be closely considered when using this approach to study social mechanisms of causation. Finally, we argue that more diverse use of theory in the study of neighbourhood effects can help social epidemiologists embrace complexity in their research, and we review key recent (and not so recent) geographic perspectives on neighbourhoods and health that can be utilized to put "space in its place" and to better understand why some neighbourhoods are less healthy than others.

AB  - In, this article, I make the case for an explicit extension of environmental justice research to the rural urban interface or fringe. A more systematic exploration and synthesis of the blurred boundaries and transitional character of the interface might advance the empirical scope of environmental justice research while contributing to the environmental justice literature's evolving treatment of space, ecology, and oppression. I subsequently synthesize previous research to outline some fringe characteristics, which signal the interface as a distinct geographical space deserving of closer attention in environmental justice studies, before proposing a few unique dimensions of injustice on the interface. In light of these new facets of rural-urban injustice, I finally outline some preliminary empirical and conceptual questions the interface might pose to environmental justice studies more broadly.

AB  - Nutrient pollution from farm fertilizers and manure is a global concern. Excess nitrogen and phosphorous has been linked to algal blooms and a host of other water quality issues. In the U.S., most animal production occurs in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) housing a significant number of animals in a confined space. CAFOs tend to cluster in space and thus generate large quantities of manures within a small area. Liquid manure from CAFOs is often stored in open-air lagoons and then applied via irrigation to crops on nearby 'sprayfields'. The full scope and extent of CAFO impacts remain unclear because of the paucity of public information regarding animal numbers, barn and lagoon locations, and manure management practices. Where and when manure is applied on the landscape is key missing data that is needed to better understand and mitigate consequences of CAFO management practices. The aim of this study was to detect land applications of liquid manure using a remote sensing approach. We used random forest models incorporating C-Band synthetic-aperture radar, multispectral imagery, and other predictors to examine soil moisture conditions indicating probable liquid manure applications across known sprayfields in eastern North Carolina. Our models successfully distinguished saturated and unsaturated soils within corn, soybean, grassland, and 'other' crops, with 93-98% accuracy against validation for clear weather periods during the dormant, early, and late growing seasons. A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that the mean soil saturation frequency was significantly higher on sprayfields than non-sprayfields of the same crop type (p < 2.2e-16). We also found that manure applications were concentrated within similar to 1 km from the point of generation. This is the first application of satellite-based radar for identifying the location and timing of manure applications over broad areas. Future work can build on these methods to further understand manure management at CAFOs, as well as to improve pollution source tracking and modeling.

AB  - Pacific Islands often exemplify climate change vulnerability, yet little scholarship has probed how these representations translate to the media. This study examines newspaper articles about Pacific Islands and climate change in American, British, and Australian newspapers from 1999 to 2018, analyzing volume, content, and dominant narratives. These quantitative results are complemented by semi-structured interviews with journalists as well as Pacific stakeholders who engage with the media. Reporting on Pacific Islands and climate change focuses heavily on who and what are at risk from climate impacts; reporting on solutions is less frequent and dominated by discussions of migration. This overemphasis on vulnerability potentially downplays the importance of the resiliency and action of Pacific Island communities and positions the Pacific as a site for climate catastrophe, rather than climate justice. However, recent reporting may be moving away from overarching narratives of vulnerability, motivating continued research into these depictions and how they promote or discourage climate action.

AB  - Mott Haven, a low-income neighborhood in New York City, suffers from increased air pollution and accommodates several industrial facilities and interstates. In 2018, a large delivery service warehouse opened. Our objectives are to characterize black carbon (BC), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and noise in the community; model changes in traffic due to the facility opening; and estimate associated BC and noise changes. BC, PM2.5, and noise were measured at eight sites pre-opening, and traffic counted continuously at two sites (June 2017-May 2019). An interrupted time series model was used to determine facility-related changes in traffic. Post-opening changes in traffic-related BC/noise were estimated from regressions of BC/noise with traffic flow. Mean (SD) pre-warehouse measures of BC and PM2.5 were 1.33 mu g/m(3) (0.41) and 7.88 mu g/m(3) (1.24), respectively. At four sites, equivalent sound levels exceeded the EPA's recommended 70 dBA limit. After the warehouse opening, traffic increased significantly, predominantly at night. At one site, the greatest change for trucks occurred 9PM-12AM: 31.7% (95%CI [23.4%, 40.6%]). Increased traffic translated into mean predicted increases of 0.003 mu g/m(3) (BC) and 0.06 dBA (noise). Though small, they negate the substantial decrease the community seeks. Our findings can help communities and policymakers better understand impacts of traffic-intensive facilities.

AB  - Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental risk that caused over 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016. In this article, we investigate how groups with lower social-economic status are disproportionally affected by outdoor air pollution. Based on a comparative case study of two heavily polluted urban areas around Beijing and Delhi, we find that people's economic welfare and political rights are affected disproportionally not only by toxic air pollutants, but also through various policy interventions, market activities, and social practices designed to reduce or adapt to air pollution. Drawing on the concepts of environmental justice and just transitions, we present an analytical framework for investigating the links between outdoor air pollution and social inequalities. The framework enables a better understanding of structural constraints, political constraints and protective constraints in the context of outdoor air pollution and their impacts on social vulnerabilities with particular relevance to fast industrialising countries. We also provide recommendations on how to design and implement air pollution policies and social interventions in a socially inclusive manner.

AB  - In order to determine whether principles of environmental justice have been violated, a large number of empirical studies have been carried out to ascertain whether minority and low-income populations are disproportionately exposed to industrial pollution. This study provides a comparative evaluation of two commonly employed proximity measures in GIS-based environmental equity assessment, examining their influence on the results of the analysis, and proposes a methodology for evaluating the significance of these results. 1990 census data on population characteristics and data from the 1995 EPA's toxic release inventory (TRI) for the City of Minneapolis, MN are used. These results also allow a preliminary assessment of environmental equity/inequity in potential exposure to airborne toxic chemicals for racial minorities, poor people and children in Minneapolis. In the third part of the paper we develop and employ a geographic randomization methodology for assessing the significance of these results.

AB  - Inequality indexes have long been used to analyze distributions of income. Studies have recently begun to use these tools to evaluate the equity of distributions of environmental harm. In response, issues have been raised regarding the appropriateness of using income-based measures in the context of undesirable outcomes. We begin from first principles, identifying a theoretical preference structure under which income-based tools can be appropriate for ranking distributions of "bads." While some critiques of existing applications are valid, they are not a justification for rejecting the approach altogether. Instead, we show how standard income-based measures can be adjusted to accommodate bad outcomes. Rather than inequality indexes, we argue that equally distributed equivalents (EDEs) are well-suited for this purpose since they account for levels and dispersion of outcome distributions. The Kolm-Pollak EDE is particularly useful, having the advantage of consistently evaluating both bads and their complementary goods (e.g., mortality risk and survival probability). As an illustration, we show how these tools can inform an environmental justice analysis of a proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule addressing indoor air pollution.

AB  - Little is known about urban forest planning, management and its benefits in emerging countries. The uneven distribution of tree canopy cover and parks in urban area is related to environmental justice, especially with disadvantaged socio-economic and marginated communities. However, the inequity of urban forest in many cities of emerging countries where often found irregular and unregulated land use patterns and social and socioeconomic inequities, is hardly highlighted. This study explores the inequity of distribution of tree canopy cover and public park in Cali, Colombia. Utilizing the traditional socio-economic indices, the stratification, linear regression analysis is conducted to describe relationship between total tree canopy cover, tree canopy cover of various land use types, number of parks and park area per capita. The result demonstrates that lower income communities have lower tree canopy cover, fewer parks and smaller park area than higher income communities. This paper discusses importance of accounting for urban forests and ecosystem service in city planning efforts and better strategies of reducing inequity in emerging countries. Addressing the inequity of urban forest could be a better strategy to create resilient, sustainable, safe and livable cities in emerging countries.

AB  - Numerous studies have linked air pollution with adverse birth outcomes, but relatively few have examined differential associations across the socioeconomic gradient. To evaluate interaction effects of gestational nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and area-level socioeconomic deprivation on fetal growth, we used: (1) highly spatially-resolved air pollution data from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS); and (2) spatially-stratified principle component analysis of census variables previously associated with birth outcomes to define area-level deprivation. New York City (NYC) hospital birth records for years 2008-2010 were restricted to full-term, singleton births to non-smoking mothers (n=243,853). We used generalized additive mixed models to examine the potentially non-linear interaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and deprivation categories on birth weight (and estimated linear associations, for comparison), adjusting for individual-level socio-demographic characteristics and sensitivity testing adjustment for co-pollutant exposures. Estimated NO2 exposures were highest, and most varying, among mothers residing in the most-affluent census tracts, and lowest among mothers residing in mid-range deprivation tracts. In non-linear models, we found an inverse association between NO2 and birth weight in the least-deprived and most-deprived areas (p-values < 0.001 and 0.05, respectively) but no association in the mid-range of deprivation (p = 0.8). Likewise, in linear models, a 10 ppb increase in NO2 was associated with a decrease in birth weight among mothers in the least-deprived and most-deprived areas of -16.2 g(95% CI: -21.9 to -10.5) and -11.0 g(95% CI: -22.8 to 0.9), respectively, and a non-significant change in the mid-range areas [beta=0.5 g (95% CI: -7.7 to -8.7)]. Linear slopes in the most- and least-deprived quartiles differed from the mid-range (reference group) (p-values <0.001 and 0.09, respectively). The complex patterning in air pollution exposure and deprivation in NYC, however, precludes simple interpretation of interactive effects on birth weight, and highlights the importance of considering differential distributions of air pollution concentrations, and potential differences in susceptibility, across deprivation levels.

AB  - In this article we focus upon a division between generalized schools of philosophical and ethical thought about culture and conservation. There is an ongoing debate playing out over conservation between those who believe conservation threatens community livelihoods and traditional practices, and those who believe conservation is essential to protect nonhuman species from the impact of human development and population growth. We argue for reconciliation between these schools of thought and a cooperative push toward the cultivation of an environmentally-focused perspective that embraces not only social and economic justice but also concern for non-human species. Our goal is to underline the ethics and tangible benefits that may result from combining the cultural data and knowledge of the social sciences with understanding of environmental science and conservation. We highlight instances in which social scientists overlook their own anthropocentric bias in relationship to ecological justice, or justice for all species, in favor of exclusive social justice among people. We focus on the polemical stances of this debate in order to emphasize the importance of a middle road of cooperation that acknowledges the rights of human and nonhuman species, alike. In conclusion, we present an alternative set of ethics and research activities for social scientists concerned with conservation and offer ideas on how to reconcile the conflicting interests of people and the environment.

AB  - In his article on siting a monitored retrievable storage (MRS) facility for spent nuclear fuel on Mescalero Apache land, Noah Sachs supports some aspects of the project and criticizes others. Mile some of his criticisms are defensible, most of his arguments supporting the facility are problematic. He argues (1) that paternalistic arguments against the Mescalero MRS are flawed; (2) that because siting the MRS does not amount to exploitation and bribery of the Mescalero, it does not violate environmental justice, and (3) that siting the Mescalero facility does not represent a more serious inequity than siting it elsewhere in the East. This essay shows that all three claims are ethically and factually questionable. Instead it argues (1) that paternalistic arguments against the Mescalero MRS are ethically justified; (2) that siting the MRS amounts to environmental injustice; and (3) that siting the Mescalero facility represents a more serious inequity than locating it in the East. The essay also argues that errors (1), (2), and (3) arise because of historical, scientific, and ethical flaws in the analysis.

AB  - Nearly 25 percent of US children live within 2 km of toxic-waste sites, most of which are in urban areas. They face higher rates of cancer than adults, partly because the dominant contaminants at most US hazardous-waste sites include genotoxic carcinogens, like trichloroethylene, that are much more harmful to children. The purpose of this article is to help protect the public, especially children, from these threats and to improve toxics-remediation by beginning to test our hypothesis: If site-remediation assessments fail data-usability evaluation (DUE), they likely compromise later cleanups and public health, especially children's health. To begin hypothesis-testing, we perform a focused DUE for an unremediated, Pasadena, California toxic site. Our DUE methods are (a) comparing project-specific, remediation-assessment data with the remediation-assessment conceptual site model (CSM), in order to identify data gaps, and (b) using data-gap directionality to assess possible determinate bias (whether reported toxics risks are lower/higher than true values). Our results reveal (1) major CSM data gaps, particularly regarding Pasadena-toxic-site risks to children; (2) determinate bias, namely, risk underestimation; thus (3) likely inadequate remediation. Our discussion shows that if these results are generalizable, requiring routine, independent, DUEs might deter flawed toxic-site assessment/cleanup and resulting health threats, especially to children.

AB  - Most hazardous-waste sites are located in urban areas populated by disproportionate numbers of children, minorities, and poor people who, as a result, face more severe pollution threats and environmental-health inequalities. Partly to address this harm, in 2017 the United Nations unanimously endorsed the New Urban Agenda, which includes redeveloping urban-infill-toxic-waste sites. However, no systematic, independent analyses assess the public-health adequacy of such hazardous-facility redevelopments. Our objective is to provide a preliminary data-quality assessment (PDQA) of urban-infill-toxic-site testing, conducted by private redevelopers, including whether it adequately addresses pollution threats. To this end, we used two qualitative, weight-of-evidence methods. Method 1 employs nine criteria to select assessments for PDQA and help control for confounders. To conduct PDQA, Method 2 uses three US Environmental Protection Agency standards-the temporal, geographical, and technological representativeness of sampling. Our Method 1 results reveal four current toxic-site assessments (by CBRE/Trammell Crow, the world's largest commercial developer); at all of these sites the main risk drivers are solvents, volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene. Our Method 2 results indicate that all four assessments violate most PDQA standards and systematically underestimate health risk. These results reveal environmental injustice, disproportionate health threats to children/minorities/poor people at all four sites. Although preliminary, our conclusion is that alleviating harm and environmental-health inequalities posed by urban-infill-toxic-site pollution may require improving both the testing/cleanup/redevelopment requirements of the New Urban Agenda and the regulatory oversight of assessment and remediation performed by private redevelopers.

AB  - Many policies on disaster governance and community resilience aim at enhancing justice outcomes at the local community level. In so doing, they tend to focus on equal distribution of a set of rights and goods among the communities. However, these rights and goods are defined by an underlying value structure, and such structures tend to mirror the interests of the powerful groups in the community. The fundamental problem is that the equality of the rights and redistribution of the goods cannot remedy disaster injustices. Taking a case study from Nepal's earthquake 2015, this paper aims to link key works on disasters with justice theories - an attempt, which could help strengthen the conceptual foundations of policy responses to disaster recovery. We use the Nepal case of earthquake recovery to demonstrate the relevance of disaster justice lens which emphasizes the role of disaster justice champions, critical politics of knowledge, accountability, representation and disaster justice convictions. We demonstrate that the platform of critical knowledge politics is important where civic science and traditional science is deliberated, interrogated, negotiated and integrated. We argue that only when disaster justice champions with convictions of priority to the disadvantaged effectively utilizes the platform of critical knowledge politics, it is possible to influence political deliberations and decision making that can potentially enhance disaster justice in practice. Finally, and in a more theoretical sense, we argue that in order to enhance disaster justice, responses need to be informed by the understanding of justice as redistribution' as well as justice as recognition'.

AB  - Individuals' perceived fairness or justice beliefs are related to health in numerous ways. However, environment justice research to date has given little attention to perceived fairness of environmental exposures as experienced by individuals. This study explored the feasibility of a bottom-up digital participatory (via mobile phones) approach using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture individuals' subjective experience of environmental exposures and the subjective evaluation of fairness by those affected in the context of Nepal. In total, 22 individuals participated in the study for 28 days. The results show high rates of study retention and adherence. Individuals' justice perception was found to vary within and between individuals, but also substantially depending on the types of environmental exposures. Nevertheless, the study indicates that uncertainties are inevitable as study design and timing may conflict participants' daily lives and priorities. The method allows us to consider multiple geographic contexts of individuals' everyday lives beyond residential environment. This pilot study proved the possibility to assess perceptions of environmental justice issues and demonstrated the necessary steps to using digital participatory method for assessing subjective perception of fairness of individuals.

AB  - Near-freeway environments are important from public health and environmental justice perspectives. This study investigated the spatial profile of and correlations between noise levels and particulate matter concentrations near two major freeways in Los Angeles, CA. Five minutes averages of A-weighted equivalent continuous sound level (LeqA), ultrafine particle (UFP) number concentrations, and fine particle (PM2.5) mass concentrations were measured concurrently at increasing distances from the freeways on four streets with or without sound wall. Under upwind conditions, UFP showed relatively low concentrations and no obvious gradient, while LeqA showed decay with increasing distance as it did under downwind conditions. Moderate correlations between LeqA and UFP were observed under downwind conditions on all four streets. The presence of a sound wall changed the linear relationship between LeqA and UFP. These data may be used to study the independent and synergistic health impacts of noise and air pollutants near roadways. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. The controversial expansion of a hazardous waste facility in a poor, minority neighborhood in Phoenix illustrates the unanticipated consequences of siting hazardous facilities in vulnerable communities, and the need to recognize neighborhood health/safety issues such as drug-related crime as environmental justice struggles. Methods. Qualitative methods include participant observation, document analysis, Census data, GIS mapping, and interviews. Results. South Central Phoenix's history reveals a disproportionate share of poverty, pollution, and drug crimes. Most commercial hazardous waste facilities in Phoenix were sited in minority areas. Residents contended that the siting, permitting process, and expansion of the facility and the drug crimes that later occurred there were all due to environmental racism. Conclusions. The expansion of the facility exacerbated environmental injustice in Phoenix through distributional and participative injustice, and was criminogenic. The dual impact on the community of hazardous waste and drug crime argues for a more holistic understanding of environmental justice.

AB  - In Hayden, a formely company-owned copper smeller town located in rural Arizona, pollution with toxic heavy metals and acids persisted for 90 years. Despite new environmental laws, the waning economic power of copper; and accumulating epidemiological evidence of health damage, Hayden residents received little help from state regulators. Environmental injustice in Hayden occurred through unequal power relations between copper workers and the multinational corporations that controlled U.S. copper production. Latino workers were subordinated and the labor,force divided while corporations were able to mobilize bias and obtain favorable treatment from state government. But by the end of the 20th century, the relative power of copper corporations had declined while public awareness of environmental health and justice issues had increased, leading to a lawsuit by Hayden residents but not a reduction in the mobilization of bia's.

AB  - Objective. Few researchers have investigated who lives near the worst polluting facilities. In this study, we test for disparate impact from hazardous industrial and infrastructure facilities on racial/ethnic minorities, the disadvantaged, the working class, and manufacturing workers in the nine-county Philadelphia MSA. Methods. Hazard Scores for Philadelphia-area facilities in EPA's Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) database were calculated and facilities mapped onto Census block group maps. One-kilometer buffer zones around facilities were created and intersected with Census data on population inside and outside buffers. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation, we tested for relationships between Hazard Scores and characteristics of people near facilities using multivariate regression. Results. Hazard Scores rose along with percents black, Hispanic, disadvantaged, and employed in manufacturing in some (but not all) counties. Conclusions. Among those living near polluting facilities, minorities, the poor, and manufacturing workers lived near the most hazardous, constituting a disparate impact on these groups.

AB  - Minority status and low-income are two important criteria on which environmental-justice areas are being identified. These unique areal characteristics have been of particular interest to traffic safety analysts in investigating pedestrian safety planning factors in deprived areas. In this study, a pedestrian crash model was developed for these areas explicitly accounting for the spatial autocorrelations of different zonal factors commonly used in the traditional transportation planning models. It was found that the Bayesian Poisson-lognormal model with a spatial effect term performed the best compared to the models without accounting for spatial autocorrelations.

AB  - In Vietnam, villagers involved in a REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) pilot protect areas with rocks which have barely a tree on them. The apparent paradox indicates how actual practices differ from general ideas about REDD+ due to ongoing conflict over forest, and how contestations over the meaning of justice are a core element in negotiations over REDD+. We explore these politics of justice by examining how the actors involved in the REDD+ pilot negotiate the particular subjects, dimensions, and authority of justice considered relevant, and show how politics of justice are implicit to practical decisions in project implementation. Contestations over the meaning of justice are an important element in the practices and processes constituting REDD+ at global, national and local levels, challenging uniform definitions of forest justice and how forests ought to be managed.

AB  - Nowadays, agricultural landscapes of suburban zones may undergo rapid urbanization that destroys their identity. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for areas connected compositionally with historical residences. The aim of the research is to determine a framework for urban policies appropriate for cultural landscapes of agricultural origin associated with significant historic palace-garden complexes. As an example of such a landscape, the area around the historic Wilanow residence was chosen for study. The research focused on the degree of preservation of the agricultural surroundings of this historic site, the directions of contemporary urban policies towards it, and its potential to provide cultural ecosystem services to local residents and tourists. The research showed that the character of the landscape under study is changing-apart from cultivated fields, wastelands have appeared, indicating a gradual abandonment of agricultural use. The analysis of local spatial development plans confirmed that many fragments of the landscape are not sufficiently protected, which causes their degradation. The study of the potential of this area to provide cultural ecosystem services using statistical methods proved its many values: aesthetic, cultural, educational, spiritual, recreational, and touristic which predestine it to perform Urban Green Spaces and Informal Green Spaces functions. The research was compared to the findings of other authors, studying analogous landscapes. Based on our results, general guidelines were developed for further protection and maintaining function of cultural landscapes of agricultural origin associated with significant historic palace-garden complexes in similar situations to that of Wilanow.

AB  - In policy and activist discourses there is often an expectation that community wind energy projects will avoid the conflicts and local opposition often associated with private-developer-led developments. However, the empirical validity of this assertion has not been widely investigated. In previous research on private-developer wind projects, the fairness of decision-making processes ('procedural justice') during project implementation has been identified as an important factor in shaping local acceptance, but has not been deeply studied in relation to community-led schemes. Using in-depth qualitative research of a proposed community wind project in South Yorkshire, this paper examines stakeholder interpretations of procedural justice during the design and siting of this scheme. Although the project leaders explicitly aimed for a fair and 'democratic' implementation process, considerable conflict emerged over whether this goal was achieved. The analysis shows that these conflicting views were the result, firstly, of different normative expectations of what 'procedural justice' actually meant and involved, and, secondly, of contrasting stakeholder experiences of the decision processes that were utilised. It cannot be assumed that community wind projects will always be considered procedurally just at the local level, with much resting on the details of how they are undertaken. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the topics they list as neglected are (a) the place of the upper class in environmental research and (b) the luck of both a global and a historical perspective. This article represents a furtherance of suggestions concerning their proposed agenda. Specifically the article examines patterns of environmental crime among the largest multinational corporations, both in the United States and around the world as well as the environmental deviance committed by the federal government This examination demonstrates that environmental crimes are part of an entire pattern of criminal activity that takes place within a political economy dominated by large corporations and upper-class stockholders. The article closes with suggestions for research into these patterns.

AB  - Normative judgments on sustainability underpin concepts that shape the supply scenarios of timber consumption. The modern understanding of sustainable forest management is shaped by a diverse spectrum of social demands, going beyond the principle of sustainable yield management. Rival stakeholders compete to incorporate their ideas and interpretations of sustainable forest management into policy institutions. Environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) have emerged as one of the dominant stakeholders in the forest-based sector. We set out to explore ENGO-specific conceptualizations of sustainable forest management and investigate differences in understanding among various ENGOs. By conducting a frame analysis of ENGO press releases, we identified two master frames: environmental justice and environmentalist frames. A difference in the emphasis placed on procedural and distributive justice as well as a different standpoint in the commons versus commodity debate emerged as the main divergences between the master frames. The results of our study demonstrate how the differences between the master frames underpin different conceptualizations of sustainable forest management. On the one hand, the ENGOs associated with the environmental justice master frame advocate for the broader implementation of community forest management based on power-sharing. On the other hand, the ENGOs associated with the environmentalist master frame promote a wide range of approaches associated with ecosystem management and social forestry paradigms. Moreover, the ENGOs associated with the environmentalist master frame challenge the concept of sustainable forest management as defined by the Helsinki and Montreal process by advocating for ecosystem management. The ENGOs associated with the environmental justice master frame reject the mainstream concept of sustainable forest management in any guise. Future research on ethical issues underlying forestry concepts may provide more conceptual and operational clarity for both forest managers and policy-makers.

AB  - In this commentary, I point out that Buscher and other critics of the nonhuman turn ignore insights offered by Feminist, Black and Indigenous scholarship that help rethink the human and alternate worldmaking possibilities. The healthy corrective to the somewhat apolitical celebration of liveliness and entanglements in Western new materialist and posthumanism literature, that Buscher and others seek, already exists in Feminist, Black and Indigenous scholarship and practices, and in activism for environmental and climate justice around the world. In these times of deep ecological crises and precarity, we would do well to turn to the wisdom of Indigenous Peoples and other land-based cultures that embody and live by some of the central propositions of the "nonhuman turn". I argue that the central propositions of nonhuman turn - relationality and interdependence; decentering and rethinking the human; honouring the agency, intelligence and subjecthood of other beings - offer alternate ways of doing politics and of imagining and enacting pluriversal, postcapitalist worlds. If this is not grounds for radical ecopolitics, then what is?

AB  - Occupying an important place in the sustainable development discourse, bioenergy was widely touted as the 'fuel of the future' at the beginning of the 21st century. However, in recent years, many adverse impacts of commercial bioenergy projects have come to the forefront. These include limited ecological benefits, heightened food insecurity across many developing countries as well as exploitation of local residents by bioenergy producers. There remains a dearth of empirical evidence devoted to investigating bioenergy's potential as a sustainable energy alternative in developing countries. It is against this background that our paper is aimed at making two contributions: one, to' provide a ground level empirical data on bioenergy initiatives in the Indian Punjab region and, two, to examine the theoretical contribution of eco-socialist perspective to assess the sustainability potentials of bioenergy in developing economies. The eco-socialist perspective treats environmental degradation as a 'systemic issue' and considers the power and class structures in capitalism as the central explanatory parameters in explaining the process of environmental degradation. As a part of the transition from capitalism to eco-socialism, the eco-socialists advocate for a participatory approach to environmental decision making to ensure that ecological justice emerges as the central parameter of sustainable development. The theoretical framing of the case study research on bioenergy projects in the region of Punjab, India was informed by the eco-socialist vision. The case study employed a 'multiple stakeholder' approach to explore the opportunities and contestations surrounding bioenergy projects in Punjab. Identifying key flaws as well as the promises of bioenergy in Punjab that were investigated, our research revealed that in order to be a sustainable energy alternative that meets the objective of ecological and social justice, bioenergy policies need to address the needs of local communities and be cognizant of the inherent socio-economic embeddedness of these initiatives.

AB  - In addition to global and regional drivers of urbanization, neighborhood development in urban areas across the United States has been shown to be influenced by various local socio-economic factors. These factors, despite varying across socio-economic groups, have large implications regarding a population's vulnerability to extreme climate events, including heat waves resulting in adverse health impacts. Additionally, the demographics of an urban area can shape its infrastructural characteristics, causing different populations groups to face varying levels of risks and benefits. As a result, the urban morphology and socio-economic characteristics of a city are deeply intertwined; however, their interactions on a finer scale are not yet fully understood. This research aims to better understand the relationships between various socio-economic factors and the built environment of a city, considering variability in building types, and temperature patterns. This research focuses on the city of Las Vegas, NV, and uses spatial data analysis to understand the correlation between of socio-economic characteristics, building morphology, building characteristics, and temperature data to understand the correlation between these various factors. Results of these research shows there is a distinct pattern of clustering of socio-economic characteristics with the city and there is a distinct correlation between age and cost, socio-economic characteristics, and locations of high heat distribution within the city.

AB  - Large disparities in industrial air pollution exist between metropolitan areas in the United States, but we have little measurable sense of what shapes this inequality. Using data on industrial air pollution and social capital organizations, I show how metropolitan areas higher in "connected" social capital - where members have social ties that extend to other organizations in a metropolitan area - are associated with less pollution. Conversely, metropolitan areas higher in "isolated" social capital - where members' social ties are comparably insular - are associated with greater pollution. Implications center on how community connectedness links with environmental inequalities.

AB  - Informed by ecocriticistn, this article conducts a comparative examination of two contemporary animated children's films, Princess Mononoke (1997) and Fern Gully (1992). While both films advocate for the prevention of deforestation, they are, to varying degrees, antithetical to environmentalism. Both films reject the principles of deep ecology in displacing responsibility for environmental destruction on to 'super-natural' forces and exhibit anthropocentric concern for the survival of humans. We argue that these films constitute divergent methodological approaches for environmental consciousness-raising in children's entertainment. The western world production demonstrates marked conservatism in its depiction of identity politics and 'cute' feminization of nature, while Hayao Miyazaki's film renders nature sublime and invokes complex socio-cultural differences. Against FernGully's 'othering' of working-class and queer characters, we posit that Princess Mononoke is decidedly queer, anti-binary and ideologically bi-partisan and, in accord with the underlying principle of environmental justice, asks child audiences to consider compassion for the poor in association with care for nature.

AB  - In the United States, water conservation-oriented rates (WCOR) are an increasingly vital tool for promoting water conservation and mitigating urban drought. Our models prove that one type of WCOR, drought demand rates (DDR), can produce with minimal regulation the quadruple objectives of conservation rates: (1) improving efficiency; (2) providing revenue neutrality; (3) assuring distributional equity and (4) guaranteeing the conservation of water. We demonstrate that such rates can also reduce days that urban streams drop below 'critical flow' levels, providing a voice for nature. Our study is situated in northern New Castle County (NCC), Delaware (DE), USA, and the lessons garnered have relevance for industrialized communities seeking a 'soft-path' to drought mitigation.

AB  - Over the last decade, an increasing number of path-breaking cases have been filed throughout the world, seeking to hold fossil fuel industry companies and governments accountable for their actions and inactions that have contributed to the climate crisis. This Article focuses on an important subset of those cases-namely, the recent surge of cases brought by states, cities, and counties all over the United States alleging that the largest fossil fuel industry actors, including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Chevron, are liable in state tort law for harms caused by climate change. The Article begins with a synthesis of the history of U.S. climate tort litigation, grouping the cases into two waves. The current state tort cases are in the second wave and represent an attempt to avoid the legal pitfalls that plagued the first. The Article then undertakes the first close examination of the defendants response to the second-wave climate tort cases; namely, that the federal common law of nuisance preempts all the plaintiffs state tort claims. Unsurprisingly, the issue has divided the courts that have decided it, as the Supreme Court case law is sparse and unclear. The Article identifies the doctrinal problem in the case law, and then argues that the only way to bring coherence to the law while adhering to federalism principles is to disallow preemption of state tort law by federal common law in these cases. Finally, the Article offers a new perspective on why that is also the right result as a policy matter. The second-wave climate tort suits are part of a larger global movement of resorting to the courts to demand climate justice after decades of inaction by policymakers. The current era of climate disruption and its catastrophic threats demand not only new and improved legal and policy mechanisms, but also the use of current ones-including state tort law-to the fullest extent possible.

AB  - In the early 1990s, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) started a grant program to assist communities redevelop brownfields, which are abandoned or underutilized sites that have real or perceived contamination. In addition to determining if the communities receiving the grants were the most distressed cities in the United States, we also evaluate the U.S, EPA program in terms of environmental justice at the macro scale. Using 1990 U.S. Census of Housing and Population data and a matched-cities methodology, we compared the brownfields pilot cities to other communities in the United States. We found that regardless of intent, the U.S. EPA program is environmentally just by disproportionately awarding grants to the most economically distressed cities. We also found that the cities that received funding in the early years of the program were more economically distressed than cities receiving the funding more recently.

AB  - Many communities are located near multiple sources of pollution, including current and former industrial sites, major roadways, and agricultural operations. Populations in such locations are predominantly low-income, with a large percentage of minorities and non-English speakers. These communities face challenges that can affect the health of their residents, including limited access to health care, a shortage of grocery stores, poor housing quality, and a lack of parks and open spaces. Environmental exposures may interact with social stressors, thereby worsening health outcomes. Age, genetic characteristics, and preexisting health conditions increase the risk of adverse health effects from exposure to pollutants. There are existing approaches for characterizing cumulative exposures, cumulative risks, and cumulative health impacts. Although such approaches have merit, they also have significant constraints. New developments in exposure monitoring, mapping, toxicology, and epidemiology, especially when informed by community participation, have the potential to advance the science on cumulative impacts and to improve decision making.

AB  - Introduction: While bikeshare programs represent a promising platform for promoting physical activity and health, critics are concerned about their equity. In 2018, Greater Boston launched a low-income bikeshare membership program and expanded the number of available stations. This study examines: 1) changes in equity of station access and 2) changes in equity of bikeshare use as a result of the equity initiative. Methods: We used publicly available trip history data to identify stations and trips during the preintervention (July 2013-December 2017) and intervention (January 2018-July 2019) periods. Using five transit and environmental justice indicators, we categorized census block groups by bikeshare need, then examined the number of block groups with full access to a station before and during the intervention. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the change in probability of a trip starting or ending in a high need block group during the intervention period. Results: Following the implementation of Boston's equity initiative, bikeshare access and use increased across the city, although gains were smallest for communities most in need of access to alternative transportation options. Conclusions: Boston's bikeshare system is an important public health and physical activity promotion opportunity. However, further improvements are needed to promote equity in access and use.

AB  - In this study, we utilize a large and diverse expert interview exercise (N = 125) to critically examine the whole systems justice issues associated with ten negative emissions and ten solar geoengineering technologies. We ask: What equity and justice concerns arise with these 20 options? What particular vulnerable groups could be affected? What risks do these options entail for communities or the climate? Utilizing a "claims making" approach, we examine existing and prospective injustices across a pluralistic whole systems framework analyzing (i) resource extraction issues including minerals, chemicals, and fertilizers (ii) manufacturing, labor and ownership concerns, (iii) transportation-network and land-grabbing dynamics, (iv) unfair and exclusionary policymaking and planning, (v) operational injustices resulting from deployment and use, and (vi) waste flows, liabilities and disposal requirements. We then explore how these potential concerns culminate in a milieu of injustice cutting across the dimensions of distribution (who gets what), recognition (who counts), participation (who gets heard), capabilities (what matters), and responsibility (who does what). We conclude with insights for both policy and future research.

AB  - Modern energy systems have tended towards centralized control by states, and national and multinational energy companies. This implicates the power of elites in realizing low-carbon transitions. In particular, low-carbon transitions can create, perpetuate, challenge, or entrench the power of elites. Using a critical lens that draws from geography, political science, innovation studies, and social justice theory (among others), this article explores the ways in which transitions can exacerbate, reconfigure or be shaped by "elite power." It does so by offering a navigational approach that surveys a broad collection of diverse literatures on power. It begins by conceptualizing power across a range of academic disciplines, envisioning power as involving both agents (corrective influence) and structures (pervasive influence). It then elaborates different types of power and the interrelationship between different sources of power, with a specific focus on elites, including conceptualizing elite power, resisting elite power, and power frameworks. The Review then examines scholarship relevant to elite power in low-carbon transitions-including the multi-level perspective, Michel Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Anthony Giddens, Karl Marx, and other contextual approaches-before offering future research directions. The Review concludes that the power relations inherent in low-carbon transitions are asymmetrical but promisingly unstable. By better grappling with power analytically, descriptively, and even normatively, socially just and sustainable energy futures become not only more desirable but also more possible.

AB  - Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, and the environment they are in relationship with, have been the targets of exploitation, extraction, and destruction. Environmental atrocities throughout the Pacif.ic have demonstrated how imperialism, capitalism, and white supremacy drive destruction through effforts to dominate and exploit for material gain. The relationship between Pacific people and the environment, which defines who they are socially, spiritually, and ancestrally, continues to be damaged and even severed by these injustices. The purpose of this article is to provide examples of major environmental injustices in the Pacific and to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between settler colonialism and environmental injustices. Indigenous knowledge, with a focus on traditional ecological knowledge, is incorporated not just to demonstrate the deep impact of injustices on Pacific people's cultures but also to highlight how this way of knowing cultivates a path to revitalization and community resilience. Cultural practices rooted in traditional ecological knowledge, such as the preservation of food systems, promote reciprocity between living beings and self-determination, necessary for community flourishing. With this understanding, Pacif.ic peoples' relationship with their land offfers further evidence of the critical role culture and Indigenous knowledge can play in environmental justice policies and practices.

AB  - One Health is an approach that integrates perspectives from human, animal and environmental health to address health challenges. As the idea of One Health is grounded in achieving sustainable outcomes, an important aspect is the contribution of One Health to social sustainability. In this chapter we ask, what social sustainability is, what the indicators of social sustainability related to One Health are, and, through what measures we can evaluate the contributions of One Health to social sustainability, in terms of its operations, its supporting infrastructures and outcomes. We adopt a wider conceptualization of social sustainability and propose an approach based on basic needs, capabilities and emancipation, environmental justice, solidarity and social cohesion. First, we identify indicators used in literature to capture social sustainability in human, animal and environmental health and propose ways to integrate them into a framework for the evaluation of One Health initiatives. Second, we formulate questions that can be used to evaluate the social sustainability of One Health initiatives. Third, we discuss the viability of operationalising the indicators, the trade-offs that might arise and identify how they can be minimised. We then discuss methodological issues and highlight the importance of transdisciplinary deliberative approaches for adapting the framework to specific contexts.

AB  - ObjectiveThis article analyzes state patterns of environmental inspections to determine if the government enforces environmental laws equitably. MethodsThis article examines state inspections of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) nationwide from 2002 to 2011. It uses negative binomial regression models to test for disparities in levels of inspections at the county level. ResultsResults indicate evidence of race-based disparities in levels of state inspections in counties with larger populations of African Americans. Results also suggest evidence of age-based disparities in levels of inspections, as well as disparities in socially disorganized counties. ConclusionsAlthough the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has addressed class-based disparities in levels of inspections of the RCRA, the findings indicate that the EPA should examine its inspection efforts based on age and structural characteristics of communities.

AB  - In the 1980s, activists' concerns about the disproportionate placements of landfills in low-income communities ignited the environmental justice movement. Today, similar issues of environmental injustice-the limited availability of litter bins across New York City (NYC) neighborhoods-remain unresolved. This study examines the association between NYC neighborhood income and litter bin availability. The NYC Department of Sanitation 2020 Litter Bin Inventory and archival measures of neighborhood composition and socioeconomic status were aggregated within NYC census tract neighborhoods. Multilevel Bayesian conditional autoregressive Poisson models estimated the prevalence rate ratio for counts of litter bins according to median household income in each census tract, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Bivariate associations identified that census tracts with higher median household income had a greater prevalence of litter bins than census tracts with lower median household income; however, spatial autocorrelation attenuated the relationship between median household income and availability of litter bins. Further research is necessary to identify the spatially structured condition that accounted for the observed effect. The results warrant further investigation of both perceived and actual disparities in litter bin availability.

AB  - In this paper, I present evidence for framing climate change education around social justice. More specifically, I provide empirical support for framing climate change education around intragenerational climate justice, and argue that this frame can influence youth in industrialized, wealthy nations to become mobilized, climate-engaged individuals. To do so, I apply critical qualitative analysis to narratives from American youth who participated in a global climate change education program in Bangladesh. My findings include the importance of contextualizing climate justice, framing climate change around humans, implicating ourselves in the problem and recognizing our own obligations in mitigation, seeing climate change as real and tangible, being in a place impacted by climate change, feeling solidarity with those impacted, and recognizing social injustice and power disparities within climate change impacts. Based on these findings, I recommend an approach that provides context, nuance, and personal connection to an otherwise abstract global problem.

AB  - In this article, I advocate for critical environmental education that is responsive to power inequities and use standpoint theory to help explain why environmental education has been slow to become race-conscious/responsive. Standpoint theory provides theoretical support for the multiplicity of stories and views surrounding the environment and environmental issues with respect to continuing racial divisions within the US. I argue that environmental perspectives of people of color in the US are sociohistorically situated and inattention to them has led to the growth of and tension between different paths in environmental movements within the US. I conclude with a consideration of implications and recommendations for the research and practice of environmental education.

AB  - Neo-liberal principles and practices of limited government and market economies prevail in many global regions, especially at borders. This research examines health outcomes in Westway colonia, immediately adjacent to a steel recycling plant owned by the largest steel corporation in the world and in the Texas-Mexico borderlands, posing the questions and testing hypotheses about the incidence of cancer and respiratory and mental illnesses in an economically and politically impoverished region of Mexican Americans and immigrants. Using community-based participatory research and drawing on sources from mixed methods - ethnographic presence and both descriptive statistics and stepwise multiple regression from a random sample of 104 households, with 400 individuals within them - we demonstrate that years living in Westway (statistically significant in multivariate analysis) and closer location (in descriptive analysis) are related to negative health outcomes. Poor mental health is related to respondents' worries about the plant, odours, noise, soot, and continuous emissions on a three-shift basis. The border location offers insights into the impact of a relatively unregulated global economy on local people in a world of considerable migration across borders. Our findings are potentially relevant in the many unequal borderlands worldwide.

AB  - In this chapter, we "occupy the earth" with an overview of the anti-fracking discourse(s) of diverse local initiatives converging as a global movement opposed to fracking. By mapping the discourse(s) of the anti-fracking movement, the articulation of the problems and solutions associated with fracking raise questions not only about the environment but draw attention to a crisis of democracy and the critical need for social and environmental justice. With the help of a multiple theoretical framework we draw on insights about environmental movements and their democratizing potential; conceptualizations about power and (counter) discourse; and depictions of the environmental justice movements in the United States. Toward this end, we analyze the framing of the anti-fracking movement: the many local voices engaging in political struggles to sustain their communities, places and ways of life, and the global movements' forum for collective solidarity, recognition, and civic action. Shedding light on the multiple frames employed by movement members, we discuss the implications and potential embodied in this widening debate.

AB  - In the Northeast US fishery managers have attempted to control marine recreational fishing mortality through annual adjustments to the number and/or size of fish that can be kept. These measures, with a few exceptions, have generally failed to prevent recreational fishing mortality rates from exceeding annual target levels. In this study, we show that one of the reasons why keep limits may have failed is that a substantial number of anglers obtain little value from being able to keep self-caught fish. Our findings are based on a telephone survey administered to marine anglers in all of the coastal counties in the Northeast US in 2004/2005. To evaluate the importance of keeping self-caught fish, we provide estimates of the size of the marine angling population in the Northeast US that keeps fish for food or income and also for those that fish primarily for recreation and place little or no value on keeping fish. Demographic characteristics of the two groups of anglers are compared statistically and differences related to consumption of self-caught marine resources and to health warning advisories are discussed. We also estimate the size of the Northeast US angling population that relies on their self-caught marine resources as a cost-saving food source or as a supplement to household income. This information Could improve the effectiveness of fisheries regulations and the ability of policy analysts to predict how anglers might be affected by proposed fishery management actions.

AB  - In implementing the European Green Deal to align with the Paris Agreement, the EU has raised its climate ambition and in 2022 is negotiating the distribution of increased mitigation effort among Member States. Such partitioning of targets among subsidiary entities is becoming a major challenge for implementation of climate policies around the globe. We contrast the 2021 European Commission proposal - an allocation based on a singular country attribute - with transparent and reproducible methods based on three ethical principles. We go beyond traditional effort-sharing literature and explore allocations representing an aggregated least regret compromise between different EU country perspectives on a fair allocation. While the 2021 proposal represents a nuanced compromise for many countries, for others a further redistribution could be considered equitable. Whereas we apply our approach within the setting of the EU negotiations, the framework can easily be adapted to inform debates worldwide on sharing mitigation effort among subsidiary entities. An ethically-based method for allocating climate change mitigation effort among subsidiaries, applicable worldwide, is proposed. Applied to the EU Green Deal, this results in a wider range of targets than the Commission's proposal of 2021.

AB  - Is the #NoDAPL mobilization, which was historically unusual as a national scale grassroots campaign featuring American Indians grassroots activists and tribal governments in coalition with others, an indicator of future similar efforts? Or, will the Standing Rock resistance be a relative aberration, based on a unique set of circumstances? To explore these questions, I draw upon theory and historical scholarship about American settler colonialism; cross-group collaborations and social movement coalitions; and American Indian movements. A variety of within-group, intergroup and larger structural factors pose significant obstacles to American Indian participation in grassroots social movement coalitions. However, striking threats, the existence of social ties between American Indian movements and environmental movements, and overlap between ideologies and frames generated by each movement were sufficient to generate robust coalitional mobilization.

AB  - Inequalities in the exposure to environmental burdens and access to environmental benefits are an environmental justice concern for urban and regional environmental planning. Recent studies have assessed the exposure of different populations to a combination of environmental hazards through GIS-based Cumulative Environmental Impact Assessments (CEIA). The contribution of this study is the development of a CEIA, which incorporates the distance-based impact of transportation, the cumulative impact of environmental hazards, and access to environmental benefits for Santa Clara County (SCC), a highly diverse and rapidly developing region also known as 'Silicon Valley'. Our results show that social vulnerability, cumulative environmental hazards, and environmental benefits exhibit distinct spatial patterns in SCC. High environmental hazard values are found along freeway and railroad corridors with substantial industrial legacies, while environmental benefit scores are generally higher in the suburban periphery. Correlations indicate that socially vulnerable populations in SCC are predominantly hispanic and are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards, while white and wealthier populations are more likely to have access to environmental benefits. The results from this study may serve to develop community-based initiatives for neighborhood improvement and environmental-justice-based regional planning and public health policy reform.

AB  - Objectives. To examine drinking water quality in majority Black periurban neighborhoods in Wake County, North Carolina, that are excluded from nearby municipal water service and to estimate the health benefits of extending water service. Methods. We tested 3 samples collected July through December 2014 in 57 private wells for microbial contaminants. We compared contaminant prevalences to those in adjacent community water systems (35 280 samples from routine monitoring). Using a population intervention model, we assessed the number of annual emergency department visits for acute gastrointestinal illness that is preventable by extending water services to the 3799 residents of these periurban communities. Results. Overall, 29.2% of 171 private well samples tested positive for total coliform bacteria and 6.43% for Escherichia coli, compared with 0.556% and 0.00850% of municipal system samples. An estimated 22% of 114 annual emergency department visits for acute gastrointestinal illness could be prevented by extending community water service. Conclusions. Predominantly Black periurban neighborhoods excluded from municipal water service have poorer quality drinking water than do adjacent neighborhoods with municipal services. These disparities increase the risk of emergency department visits for acute gastrointestinal illness.

AB  - International law has thus far proven limited as a tool for securing environmental justice for those marginalized by the international order. This essay reviews two recent publications that respond to the disproportionate effects of global environmental crisis on the marginalized within the framework of international law. It suggests that while both texts are important works of scholarship, each leaves an impression that international law, at least as we know it, is inadequate to the task of framing meaningful responses not only to the disproportionate effects of environmental crisis on the marginalized, but to that crisis itself. It is argued that the difficulty in utilizing international environmental law as a means of addressing problems of global environmental degradation may be better conceived not as a weakness in international environmental law per se, but as a symptom of the severance of human and natural environment that undergirds the logic of international law. Acknowledgment of the relationship between foundational concepts of international law and environmental exploitation invites sober consideration of the limits of international law as a framework for generating responses to global environmental crisis, and its disproportionate effect on the marginalized.

Unlike many previous environmental justice studies, we examine census tracts rather than larger aggregates such as counties or zip codes. We also look at the problem of environmental injustice longitudinally by analyzing Census data from 1970, 1980, and 1990. Such an analysis not only allows us to detect potential environmental inequality, but also to postulate on the nature and origins of this injustice. Overall, our findings indicate that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to live near Superfund hazardous waste sites, but income and poverty indicators do not predict the location of sites. The spatial association between race, ethnicity, and Superfund sites is increasing over time, leading us to conclude that the likely cause of much of the recent environmental injustice uncovered in our results stems from indirect, rather than direct, forms of discrimination.

AB  - Objective. Much of the empirical work examining the issue of environmental justice centers on the unequal distribution of waste disposal facilities across diverse racial and ethnic subpopulations. Far less attention has been devoted to other types of environmental hazards. The purpose of this work is to extend the empirical examination of environmental justice into the area of accidental chemical releases (ACRs). Methods. To accomplish the above-stated objective, we use 1990 census data to examine the relationship between the racial, ethnic, and economic demographic characteristics of census tracts (N = 164) and serious chemical accidents that occurred in Hillsborough County, Florida, between 1991 and 1994. The data used to map the location of these spills were obtained from the EPA's Accidental Reporting Information Program (ARIP). Results. Our bivariate analysis indicates that chemical accidents are, on average, more likely to occur near census tracts that are African American and low income than tracts that are white and more affluent. However, in multivariate analysis, race is not statistically significant when controlling for the effects of income. Conclusions. These findings call attention to the problem of environmental injustice in the form of accidental chemical spills in Hillsborough County, Florida. We suggest that more attention be paid to this type of environment-al hazard and recommend that additional research be conducted in other locations.

AB  - Literature concerned with Natura 2000 highlights that conflicts emerged when local communities felt the implementation of the policy was unfair. In the paper, we extend those arguments and say that the contested nature of Natura 2000 conflicts is best understood through a framework of environmental justice that embraces the importance of empowering residents and communities in Natura 2000 processes. We draw from Nancy Fraser's critical approach that organizes justice issues within distribution, recognition and representation domains simultaneously. It enables us to look at the Natura 2000 conservation conflicts from a critical standpoint of local communities. With it, we conceptualize the role of resident empowerment to compliment examinations of environmental policy conflicts. To re-construct the case of Natura 2000 conservation conflicts through the lens of pluralistic environmental justice perspective, we revisit processes in which a sense of (in)justice about Natura 2000 policy nourished conservation conflicts in Poland.

AB  - Investment in park green space can improve the quality of life for urban residents but has also been linked to green gentrification. Investments in informal green space have been proposed as means for improving green access while minimizing the risk of displacement. Very little empirical research, however, has examined the differential impacts of park and non-park green space investments in the broader context of neighborhood greening. To further this understanding, we examine the association between park and non-park green space increases and the likelihood of gentrification in Chicago using satellite imagery, land use, and census data during two periods-1990-2000 and 2000-2010. We found that green space of any type did not have a statistically significant role in increasing the odds of gentrification, but the importance of green space variables in predicting gentrification increased with time. Neighborhood characteristics like the distance to downtown or the presence of gentrifying neighbors were most predictive, suggesting that green investment efforts should consider the preexisting risk factors for gentrification. Our results do not dispute that green space has the potential to play a role in gentrification, simply that green gentrification may be strongly contingent upon timing and neighborhood characteristics.

AB  - One of the most popular policy mechanisms for greenhouse gas emissions regulation is cap-and-trade which is a market-based approach that has come to dominate partially because of its flexibility. With flexibility, however, comes the potential for the clustering of greenhouse gas emissions. To understand whether emissions trading leads to localized clustering of emissions changes, we perform a systematic, spatio-economic assessment of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We analyze the spatial pattern of emissions changes from individual plants across the EU as well as how the pattern changes during the first two phases of the ETS implementation. Our findings indicate that there was clustering of emissions changes at the EU and country level which peaked at the start of the second phase but declined as the EU ETS matured. We also found that iron and steel, coke ovens, and refining have greater clustering and volatility compared to other industries. Based on the air quality implications of these clustered emissions, certain countries and industry types might need additional attention during the ETS design or redesign process. This study makes a novel contribution by systematically evaluating the spatio-temporal and equity implications of emissions distribution in cap-and-trade systems.

AB  - Little is known about the levels of air pollution at public parks where regular exercise takes place or in park-adjacent neighborhoods where people have easy access to parks. In this study we investigated the ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) at public parks and in park-adjacent neighborhoods for metropolitan Los Angeles. Socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequalities in exposure to the three criteria pollutants were also investigated using multiple linear regression models. In addition, differences in inhalation doses from breathing the three + criteria pollutants were investigated for the top and bottom quartile racial composition in the parks and neighborhoods. Our research showed that although public parks had on average the lowest pollutant concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5, they had relatively high O-3 concentrations. Park-adjacent neighborhoods, by contrast, had the highest NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, but the lowest O-3 concentrations. Higher exposures to NO2 and PM2.5 were systematically identified for the lower socioeconomic position or higher minority population neighborhoods. For children and adolescents aged 6-15 engaging in high and moderate intensity activities in and around public parks, those from the top quartile of primarily Hispanic neighborhoods had much higher (63%) inhaled doses of NO2 compared to the bottom quartile counterpart. PM2.5 showed a similar but less pronounced pattern of inhalation doses. Evidence of socioeconomic and racial-ethnic gradients was found in air pollution exposure and inhalation doses in and around the urban parks in Los Angeles. This suggests that patterns of exposure inequality found in other environmental justice research are present in exposures in and around urban parks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low-income communities and communities of color often suffer from multiple environmental hazards that pose risks to their health. Here we extended a cumulative environmental hazard inequality index (CEHII) - developed to assess inequalities in air pollution hazards - to compare the inequality among three urban counties in California: Alameda, San Diego, and Los Angeles. We included a metric for heat stress to the analysis because exposure to excessively hot weather is increasingly recognized as a threat to human health and well-being. We determined if inequalities from heat stress differed between the three regions and if this added factor modified the metric for inequality from cumulative exposure to air pollution. This analysis indicated that of the three air pollutants considered, diesel particulate matter had the greatest inequality, followed by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). As measured by our index, the inequalities from cumulative exposure to air pollution were greater than those of single pollutants. Inequalities were significantly different among single air pollutant hazards within each region and between regions; however, inequalities from the cumulative burdens did not differ significantly between any two regions. Modeled absolute and relative heat stress inequalities were small except for relative heat stress in San Diego which had the second highest inequality. Our analysis, techniques, and results provide useful insights for policy makers to assess inequalities between regions and address factors that contribute to overall environmental inequality within each region.

AB  - In October 2010, parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. One impetus behind the Nagoya Protocol was the mandate to address the unjust impacts such as the loss of access to resources, exploitation of traditional knowledge, and expropriation of rights to resources-of the global demand for genetic resources on indigenous peoples and local communities (ILCs). Using collaborative event ethnography, this article demonstrates the limited nature, scope, and engagement of the ILC justice discourse in the negotiations, despite the supposedly inclusive nature of the CBD. I attribute the constrained discourse in part to the existence of a justice metanorm as evidenced through the emergence of shared meanings and prescriptive status of justice instruments.

AB  - In an effort to reduce the potential for negative social impacts in forest carbon projects, private third-party actors such as the Climate, Community, and Biodiversity Alliance (Alliance) have established certification schemes (e.g. standards) to ensure that biodiversity and community livelihood goals are met through just means while also reaching carbon mitigation goals. Using a mixed methods approach including rigorous content analysis coupled with descriptive statistics on 56 Alliance project design documents, this paper seeks to understand: 1) the extent to which projects seeking Alliance certification responded to the standards criteria requiring local community participation in the project development process: and, 2) how the Alliance certification standards can serve as an instrument for procedural justice and thus contribute to narrowing the social justice gap in global forest governance. We find that while the standards could potentially help address this governance gap by serving as standards of justice, evidence suggests that projects are not fulfilling requirements to facilitate procedural justice. We suggest that the lack of information and attention to stakeholder processes represents a substantial hurdle for facilitating procedural justice for impacted communities, suggesting that forest carbon (including REDD+) projects may result in the same threats to communities and livelihoods as past forest governance interventions. Furthermore, our findings signal the possibility of future credibility problems for the Alliance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-term exposure to ambient ozone (O3) canlead to a series of chronic diseases and associated prematuredeaths, and thus population-level environmental health studieshanker after the high-resolution surface O3concentration database.In response to this demand, we innovatively construct a space-time Bayesian neural network parametric regressor to fuse TOARhistorical observations, CMIP6 multimodel simulation ensemble,population distributions, land cover properties, and emissioninventories altogether and downscale to 10 kmx10 km spatialresolution with high methodological reliability (R2= 0.89-0.97,RMSE = 1.97-3.42 ppbV), fair prediction accuracy (R2= 0.69-0.77, RMSE = 5.63-7.97 ppbV), and commendable spatiotempo-ral extrapolation capabilities (R2= 0.62-0.76, RMSE = 5.38-11.7 ppbV). Based on our predictions in 8-h maximum daily averagemetric, the rural-site surface O3are 15.1 +/- 7.4 ppbV higher than urban globally averaged across 30 historical years during 1990-2019,with developing countries being of the most evident differences. The globe-wide urban surface O3are climbing by 1.9 +/- 2.3 ppbV perdecade, except for the decreasing trends in eastern United States. On the other hand, the global rural surface O3tend to be relativelystable, except for the rising tendencies in China and India. Using CMIP6 model simulations directly without urban-ruraldifferentiation will lead to underestimations of population O3exposure by 2.0 +/- 0.8 ppbV averaged over each historical year. Ouroriginal Bayesian neural network framework contributes to the deep-learning-driven environmental studies methodologically byproviding a brand-new feasible way to realize data fusion and downscaling, which maintains high interpretability by conforming tothe principles of spatial statistics without compromising the prediction accuracy. Moreover, the 30-year highly spatial resolvedmonthly surface O3database with multiple metricsfills in the literature gap for long-term surface O3exposure tracing.

AB  - Joint prevention and control of air pollution (JPCAP) is an inevitable choice for controlling air pollution in the future. The existing air pollution prevention and control methods pay less attention to environmental justice, which results in poor treatment effects; hence, a more reasonable method is imperative. The innovation of this work is to construct a new method for dividing the scope and priorities of JPCAP by introducing environmental justice. First, we analyze the distribution and injustice of air pollution, and then divide JPCAP regions based on environmental justice using a clustering method. Finally, by selecting indicators from the characteristics of air pollution, natural conditions, and trade, the Entropy-TOPSIS method is employed to define the priorities of the JPCAP regions. Accordingly, we divided Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and its surrounding areas in China into four JPCAP regions. We also discovered key regions of air pollution control by determining the priorities of the four regions. The new method provides a practical guidance and a theoretical basis for regional joint control of air pollution.

AB  - Objectives. To (1) examine the disparity in availability of PurpleAir low-cost air quality sensors in California based on neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and exposure to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), (2) investigate the temporal trend of sensor distribution and operation, and (3) identify priority communities for future sensor distribution. Methods. We obtained census tract-level SES variables and PM2.5 concentrations from the CalEnviroScreen4.0 data set. We obtained real-time PurpleAir sensor data (July 2017-September 2020) to examine sensor distribution and operation. We conducted spatial and temporal analyses at the census tract level to investigate neighborhood SES and PM2.5 concentrations in relation to sensor distribution and operation. Results. The spatial coverage and the number of PurpleAir sensors increased significantly in California. Fewer sensors were distributed in census tracts with lower SES, higher PM2.5, and higher proportions of racial/ethnic minority populations. Furthermore, a large proportion of existing sensors were not in operation at a given time, especially in disadvantaged communities. Conclusions. Disadvantaged communities should be given access to low-cost sensors to fill in spatial gaps of air quality monitoring and address environmental justice concerns. Sensor purchasing and deployment must be paired with regular maintenance to ensure their reliable performance.

AB  - Megacities in China are undergoing transformation in urban functional structure brought on by rapid urbanization and spatial expansion, while private motorization connects disparate functional zones with ever-longer journeys. Policies to control growth of the car fleet while investing in mass public transport, in Beijing and in many other cities, have divided city residents into car users and those dependent on public transport. This paper examines these policies from the transport equity perspective by measuring accessibility disparity between public transport and private car. Cumulative accessibility is measured for each of the two transport modes, while an accessibility equity index (AEI) is developed based on numerical and spatial computation. The recent changes in spatial distributions of population and employment in Beijing are analyzed. Accessibility and AEI are measured using network-based Geographical Information System (GIS) and analyzed quantitatively and spatially. Nine scenarios with different employment location strategies are simulated to analyze their impacts on accessibility and AEI, with clear benefits among the scenarios with regard to accessibility equity for suburban populations. Results suggest that reducing the demand for car use and ownership can be supported through employment spatial redistribution policies, which can be used to raise relative accessibility by public transport. Land use policy can form part of a larger set of spatial and transport policies that includes regulation of the car fleet and public transport development. Such integrated approaches are of particular importance for the present and future megacities of China that are expanding rapidly, with relatively high volume flows on limited movement networks.

AB  - Once a fringe notion, solar geoengineering via Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) is gaining traction as a climate management tactic within mainstream institutions and factions of the climate justice movement. Cautious considerations of SAI are driven by the layered realities of climate urgency, political inaction, and the potential for climate impacts to harm the most vulnerable. This narrative is difficult to dispute, yet it originates from leading centers of SAI research-particularly the Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program (HSGRP)-that construct the "necessity" of research, experimentation, and potential deployment under ideological pretenses aimed at maintaining the hegemony of liberal-capitalism. Hence, advanced under the auspices of HSGRP, SAI would constitute a form of imperialism rather than a tool for climate justice. I link SAI to theories of capitalist imperialism, and situate HSGRP within Harvard's legacy shaping U.S. imperialism and position as a nodal point of liberal-capitalist power. In this context, I identify three dominant ideologies undergirding SAI research at Harvard-ecomodernism, Realist International Relations theory, and Keynesianism-that construct a specific narrative whereby established climate solutions (liberal-capitalist ecomodernism) are frustrated by "anarchical" international politics, leaving the poor vulnerable to near-term climate impacts. SAI is thus positioned as a mechanism capable of buying time for market-driven policy and reducing near-term climate risk. HSGRP directly counter poses this approach to radical elements of the climate justice movement that address capitalism as the root cause of both climate change and global poverty.

AB  - ObjectivePast research yields inconsistent evidence of disparities in environmental quality by socioeconomic status (SES), race, and/or ethnicity. Since the political significance of race/ethnicity may be contingent upon SES, this study advances environmental justice research by examining interactively the effects of race, ethnicity, and SES on environmental quality. MethodsWe match 2010-2013 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) compliance records with demographic and economic data for U.S. local government water utilities serving populations greater than 1,000. Statistical regression isolates direct and interactive relationships between communities' racial/ethnic populations, SES, and SDWA compliance. ResultsWe find that community racial/ethnic composition predicts drinking water quality, but also that SES conditions the effect; specifically, black and Hispanic populations most strongly predict SDWA violations in low-SES communities. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of analyzing race, ethnicity, and SES interactively in environmental justice research. Results also carry troubling implications for drinking water quality in the United States.

AB  - In recent years, urban research has become increasingly concerned with the social, political and economic implications of the techno-political and socio-scientific consensus that the present unsustainable and unjust environmental conditions require a transformation of the way urban life is organized. In the article, I shall argue that the present consensual vision of the urban environment presenting a clear and present danger annuls the properly political moment and contributes to what a number of authors have defined as the emergence and consolidation of a postpolitical and postdemocratic condition. This will be the key theme developed in this contribution. First, I shall attempt to theorize and re-centre the political as a pivotal moment in urban political-ecological processes. Second, I shall argue that the particular staging of the environmental problem and its modes of management signals and helps to consolidate a postpolitical condition, one that evacuates the properly political from the plane of immanence that underpins any political intervention. The consolidation of an urban postpolitical condition runs, so I argue, parallel to the formation of a postdemocratic arrangement that has replaced debate, disagreement and dissensus with a series of technologies of governing that fuse around consensus, agreement, accountancy metrics and technocratic environmental management. In the third part, I maintain that this postpolitical consensual police order revolves decidedly around embracing a populist gesture. However, the disappearance of the political in a postpolitical arrangement leaves all manner of traces that allow for the resurfacing of the properly political. This will be the theme of the final section. I shall conclude that re-centring the political is a necessary condition for tackling questions of urban environmental justice and for creating egalibertarian socio-ecological urban assemblages.

AB  - New technology brings great benefits, but it can also create new and significant risks. When evaluating those risks in policymaking, there is a tendency to focus on social acceptance. By solely focusing on social acceptance, we could, however, overlook important ethical aspects of technological risk, particularly when we evaluate technologies with transnational and intergenerational risks. I argue that good governance of risky technology requires analyzing both social acceptance and ethical acceptability. Conceptually, these two notions are mostly complementary. Social acceptance studies are not capable of sufficiently capturing all the morally relevant features of risky technologies; ethical analyses do not typically include stakeholders' opinions, and they therefore lack the relevant empirical input for a thorough ethical evaluation. Only when carried out in conjunction are these two types of analysis relevant to national and international governance of risky technology. I discuss the Rawlsian wide reflective equilibrium as a method for marrying social acceptance and ethical acceptability. Although the rationale of my argument is broadly applicable, I will examine the case of multinational nuclear waste repositories in particular. This example will show how ethical issues may be overlooked if we focus only on social acceptance, and will provide a test case for demonstrating how the wide reflective equilibrium can help to bridge the proverbial acceptance-acceptability gap.

AB  - Objective. In environmental justice research, different-sized units of analysis have generated mixed results, begging the question Of What constitutes die most appropriate unit of analysis. Grappling with this question raises both conceptual and methodological issues. In this article, it is argued that, conceptually, community should be the most important unit of analysis and that, methodologically, units should be selected through an appropriate sampling procedure. These issues are addressed through an investigation of the locations of industrial hog farms in Mississippi. Methods. A geographic information system procedure was used to identify community areas and to select the sample of units. The identified community areas were compared to counties, ZIP code areas, census tracts, and census block groups through a bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results. Race was the only variable that was consistently not found to be significant across all Units. For the remaining variables-income, education, and industry-results were mixed across units. Conclusions. This research confirms that units of different size generate different results. We argue that the decision about the most appropriate unit of analysis should be conceptually rather than statistically determined and that community is the most important unit of analysis because it holds both legal and social authority to raise concern about environmentally controversial facilities.

AB  - Many urban areas are perusing infill, transit oriented, and other "smart-growth" strategies to address a range of important regional goals. Denser and more mixed use urban development may increase sustainability and improve public health by reducing vehicle travel and increasing the share of trips made by transit, walking and bicycling. Fewer vehicle trips results in fewer greenhouse gas and toxic vehicle emissions, and more trips made by walking and bicycle increases physical activity. Prior research has largely focused on modeling and estimating the potential size of these and other smart-growth strategy benefits. A largely overlooked area is the potential for unexpected public health costs and environmental justice concerns that may result from increasing density. We evaluate regional land-use and transportation planning scenarios developed for the year 2040 by a metropolitan planning organization with a newly developed regional air quality modeling framework. Our results find that a set of regional plans designed by the MPO to promote smart-growth that are estimated to result in less vehicle use and fewer vehicle emissions than a more typical set of plans results in higher population exposure to toxic vehicle emissions. The smart growth plans also result in greater income-exposure inequality, raising environmental justice concerns. We conclude that a more spatially detailed regional scale air quality analysis can inform the creation of smarter smart-growth plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In response to the dominance of green capitalist discourses in Canada's environmental movement, in this paper, we argue that strategies to improve energy policy must also provide mechanisms to address social conflicts and social disparities. Environmental justice is proposed as an alternative to mainstream environmentalism, one that seeks to address systemic social and spatial exclusion encountered by many racialized immigrants in Toronto as a result of neo-liberal and green capitalist municipal policy and that seeks to position marginalized communities as valued contributors to energy solutions. We examine Toronto-based municipal state initiatives aimed at reducing energy use while concurrently stimulating growth (specifically, green economy/green jobs and, smart growth.). By treating these as instruments of green capitalism, we illustrate the utility of environmental justice applied to energy-related problems and as a means to analyze stakeholders' positions in the context of neo-liberalism and green capitalism, and as opening possibilities for resistance.

AB  - Participation in the field of environmental sanitation has low visibility and is little studied, especially in developing countries where democracy is a relatively recent reality. It is therefore pertinent to assess how social participation in sanitation occurs and how it is presented to society by the media. In this study, the participatory processes in environmental sanitation were assessed using newspaper articles published in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Different categories, such as discrete or continuous processes, passive or proactive populations, and top-down or bottom-up models of governance, were established. Although participation in and conflicts regarding environmental sanitation have been considered to be scarce, they were still observed in some instances, indicating that they occur in a covert or even invisible manner.

AB  - Indigenous peoples are among the most affected by environmental injustices globally, however environmental justice theory has not yet meaningfully addressed decolonisation and the resistance of Indigenous communities against extractivism in the settler-colonial context. This paper suggests that informing environmental justice through decolonial analysis and decolonising practices can help transcend the Western ontological roots of environmental justice theories and inform a more radical and emancipatory environmental justice. The Unist'ot'en Resistance and Action Camp blocking pipelines in northwestern British Columbia, Canada, their "Reimagined Free Prior and Informed Consent protocol" and the Delgamuukw case are described to discuss limitations of the state and legal framework for accommodating a decolonial and transformative environmental justice. A decolonial analysis informed by these two moments of Wet'sewet'ten history suggests limits and adaptations to the trivalent EJ framework based on recognition, participation and distribution. It is argued that a decolonising and transformative approach to environmental justice must be based on self-governing authority, relational ontologies of nature and epistemic justice and the unsettling of power through the assertion of responsibility and care through direct action. This discussion is placed in the context of the expansion of the concept of ecological rights, for example through the enshrining of the "Rights of Nature" in the constitutions of countries such as Bolivia and Ecuador, to highlight the Inherent tensions in the translation of Indigenous cosmo-visions into legal systems based on universalist values.

AB  - In this article we undertake a systematic mapping of 649 cases of resistance movements to both fossil fuel (FF) and low carbon energy (LCE) projects, providing the most comprehensive overview of such place-based energy-related mobilizations to date. We find that (1) Place-based resistance movements are succeeding in curbing both fossil-fuel and low-carbon energy projects. Over a quarter of projects encountering social resistance have been cancelled, suspended or delayed. (2) The evidence highlights that low carbon, renewable energy and mitigation projects are as conflictive as FF projects, and that both disproportionately impact vulnerable groups such as rural communities and Indigenous peoples. Amongst LCE projects, hydropower was found to have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10% of all cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects. The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism, climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative pathways to decarbonization.

AB  - Mechanistic air pollution modeling is essential in air quality management, yet the extensive expertise and computational resources required to run most models prevent their use in many situations where their results would be useful. Here, we present InMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution), which offers an alternative to comprehensive air quality models for estimating the air pollution health impacts of emission reductions and other potential interventions. InMAP estimates annual-average changes in primary and secondary fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations-the air pollution outcome generally causing the largest monetized health damages-attributable to annual changes in precursor emissions. InMAP leverages pre-processed physical and chemical information from the output of a state-of-the-science chemical transport model and a variable spatial resolution computational grid to perform simulations that are several orders of magnitude less computationally intensive than comprehensive model simulations. In comparisons run here, InMAP recreates comprehensive model predictions of changes in total PM2.5 concentrations with population-weighted mean fractional bias (MFB) of -17% and population-weighted R-2 = 0.90. Although InMAP is not specifically designed to reproduce total observed concentrations, it is able to do so within published air quality model performance criteria for total PM2.5. Potential uses of InMAP include studying exposure, health, and environmental justice impacts of potential shifts in emissions for annual-average PM2.5. InMAP can be trained to run for any spatial and temporal domain given the availability of appropriate simulation output from a comprehensive model. The InMAP model source code and input data are freely available online under an open-source license.

AB  - In view of the anticipated climate change, many countries face increasing risks of flooding. Since the end of the 20th century, the traditional hard flood protection measures have been increasingly complemented with spatial flood risk reduction measures. These measures, though in the public interest and as such, benefitting many people, almost inevitably affect landowners adversely. In other words, spatial flood risk reduction measures affect private land. The impact may extend from mere decreases in property values as a result of changes to zoning plans and to obligations to tolerate certain acts related to the construction or maintenance of water defence structures. Most of the time, implementation of spatial flood risk reduction measures thus discriminates between landowners, as some profit from better protection but others are affected negatively by the measures. Spatial flood risk reduction measures thus raise issues of social justice. Compensation plays a crucial role in flood risk management to mitigate the impact on land. How and in which cases this compensation is paid differs from country to country. Some national jurisdictions compensate for loss as a result of lawful administrative acts if and to the extent that it is considered unreasonable for this loss to be the full responsibility of the affected party. In this paper, we compare two different legal compensation frameworks in two European countries: Austria and the Netherlands. Based on a comparative analysis, we discuss how these different compensation schemes affect social justice, both in terms of substantive distributions but also in terms of procedural justice.

AB  - Multiple cases of toxic waste dumping from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries in the 1980s led to scholarly attention to transboundary waste movements. The Basel Convention was established to provide an international legal framework to tackle such problems in the early 1990s, focusing on hazardous waste. However, the transboundary movement of all waste, not just hazardous waste, remains a societal challenge globally, frequently surfacing as an ethical question on the one hand and a story of resource management/trade on the other. This phenomenon has been studied across disciplines resulting in diverse, scattered and often contested understandings. Despite previous and ongoing efforts, waste production, management and transboundary movements are increasing and are predicted to grow significantly with global social, environmental and economic implications. This literature review uses a research synthesis and problematisation approach to critically analyse the transboundary waste literature since 1985. The findings highlight research trends, the need for data reliability and policy coherence, and the sustainability implications of the phenomenon. One recurring theme in the literature is the reduction of the complex phenomenon involving multiple countries, policies, actors and waste streams into simple opposite narratives, which we called transboundary waste binaries. We have identified and then challenged assumptions behind transboundary waste binaries and discussed the implications of such assumptions on the broader discourse. We have concluded with future research recommendations to look past the transboundary waste binaries towards a nuanced and contextual understanding of transboundary waste flows.

AB  - Little is known of the relationship between exposure to the smallest particles of air pollution and socio-demographic characteristics. This paper explores linkages between ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations and indicators of both race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. We used estimates of UFP based on a highly-resolved land-use regression model of concentrations. In multivariate linear regression models census block groups with high proportions of Asians were associated with higher levels of UFP in comparison to block groups with majority White or other minority groups. Lower UFP concentrations were associated with higher homeownership (indicating higher SES) and with higher female head of household (indicating lower socioeconomic status). One explanation for the results include the proximity of specific groups to traffic corridors that are the main sources of UFP in Boston. Additional studies, especially at higher geographic resolution, are needed in Boston and other major cities to better characterize UFP concentrations by sociodemographic factors.

AB  - Indigenous movements face what Stuart Kirsch has called the risks of counterglobalization, which can distort their objectives into an all-or-nothing position with respect to development. In this contribution, I explore a case from the Philippines, where a movement originally conceived in terms of indigenous rights grew to include a more diverse mix of constituents and claims. This trajectory has made the movement vulnerable to charges of inauthenticity, particularly since the corporation it opposes has sponsored a parallel indigenous group and fashioned itself as the noble custodian of a threatened marine ecosystem. Nevertheless, the movement's constituents do not evaluate their activities exclusively in terms of its formal objectives or identity politics. For them, organized protest is entangled with the serious games of everyday life, including, for example, local elections, struggles to achieve upward social mobility and efforts to redefine ethnic identity. As a result, some constituents see their involvement primarily as a claim to socioeconomic parity and others as a pursuit of the exceptional rights that indigeneity confers. Without attention to such local-level variation, we risk obscuring some of the most important motives and outcomes of indigenous movements and, as a result, we may overlook the alternative visions of socio-environmental justice that emerge from their day-to-day struggles for livelihood, dignity and empowerment.

AB  - In May 2013, Los Angeles voters approved Proposition D, a regulatory measure that set zoning restrictions and capped the number of dispensaries at those that opened before 2007. Specifically, Proposition D stated that only 135 dispensaries were allowed to be in operation and set zoning restrictions prohibiting dispensaries from operating in certain areas. We first assessed whether the legislation changed the physical availability of medical marijuana via dispensaries in Los Angeles. We then used two data points 1 year prior to and 1 year following the implementation of Proposition D to determine if the locations of where the dispensaries are located changed after the enactment of Proposition D. Using a cross-sectional, ecological design, we investigated the change in dispensaries from 2012 to 2014 for Census tracts within the city of Los Angeles (N = 1000). We analyzed data using spatial error regression models that included controls for spatial autocorrelation due to the spatial structure of the data. We found that while the total number of dispensaries in Los Angeles remained largely unchanged, the spatial distribution of dispensaries did change in meaningful ways. Census tracts with more dispensaries in 2014 were significantly and positively associated with the proportion of African American residents and negatively associated with the percent of area that was commercially zoned. In other words, dispensaries opened in areas with a higher proportion of Black residents and closed in Census tract areas that had a higher percentage of commercially zoned land. Findings from this study highlight the importance of continuously regulating dispensary locations. Results suggest that likely as a result of changing regulations, dispensaries may be attempting to conceal their presence and locate in areas that will not advocate against their presence.

AB  - Natural resource extraction has become an appealing form of economic growth for many Native nations. Nations have experienced booming economic growth and prosperity from oil and gas development, but this has come at the expense of environmental and social harms to their communities. These environmental and social harms develop because the oil and gas industries and the Native nations' governments externalize costs of environmental and social protections onto the public in order to reap the benefits of saved costs. The ability to punt these environmental and social costs can be attributed to encroachments on sovereignty, institutional racism, and internal corruption, all of which cause great harm to Native citizens. Litigation against environmental and social harms is not the best solution for ensuring healthy environments when Native nations pursue economic development through oil and gas extraction. Instead, distributive and social justice policy solutions, under an environmental justice framework, can successfully provide protections to communities and the environment by forcing oil and gas industries to internalize all costs of oil and gas development and growth. This Comment, through the use of case studies, determines best practices of distributive and social justice policy solutions that Native nations can implement to internalize the costs of oil and gas extraction. Further, this Comment examines these best practices in the context of the booming oil and gas economy in the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation and the Bakken oil field.

AB  - In Brazil, the implementation of protected areas has often caused impoverishment and injustice to forest-dwelling peoples. With the launching of the re-democratic 1988 Constitution, numerous claims for access to resources, recognition of ethnic identities, and participation in environmental decision-making have been made by traditional peoples. Using an environmental justice approach, this article analyzes the spaces for and processes of negotiation over strictly protected areas through an examination of the land claim of the Afro-Brazilian quilombola community Bombas located inside the Upper Ribeira State Touristic Park, SAo Paulo. The article argues that exclusionary practices and discourses were used by the Brazilian state apparatus, hampering the recognition of a quilombola identity, land rights, and access to infrastructure development. The negotiation meetings served as a forum for challenging the power imbalances, but did not open up space for meaningful participation where quilombolas' voice did significantly influence the agenda and key decisions.

AB  - In light of the accelerating nature of climate change and its effect, it is unsurprising that various entities increasingly resort to courts and tribunals to seek to address the many harms and wrongs that clearly stem from climate change. This article discusses the opportunities in this context for those who face displacement by the effects of climate change, an issue that is not necessarily at the heart of either climate justice debates or climate displacement debates. Discussions about how to respond to displacement arising in the context of climate change often focus on the 'protection space' or 'assistance space', in which those affected are conceptualized as actual or potential seekers of protection or assistance, who may or may not be owed refuge elsewhere on account of unmet needs for shelter, support or safety. This article takes a different approach and conceptualizes those affected as potential or actual seekers of justice, who may be owed rectification for inflicted harm. The article thus contributes to emerging scholarship concerning climate change litigation and climate harm reversal, by focusing on the corrective justice potential for those who face the specific issue of displacement stemming from climate change. To this end, the article provides the relevant practical and analytical background, and discusses key recent law and policy developments in both the domestic and cross-border spheres. The article considers not merely the nexus between displacement stemming from climate change and considerations of justice, but also how and where justice in this context is or may be sought.

AB  - Objective Urban neighborhood greenness is associated with greater cardiovascular health in the general population, and with better pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Hypertension in pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal mortality and long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in women. We sought to examine the association between greenness and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Study Design This study is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of 1,943 women who received prenatal care from December 2013 to December 2016 at a single, urban, and tertiary academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Greenness measure was quantified via residential tree canopy cover within circumferential buffers of 100- and 500-meter radii around participants' homes. Associations between greenness and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (defined as gestational hypertension or preeclampsia) were estimated by using multilevel logistic regression accounting for maternal sociodemographic information (race-ethnicity, insurance status, and age) medical history (diabetes, body mass index, smoking history, and parity), neighborhood deprivation index, and including 1,225 Philadelphia residents for whom key exposure and outcome data were available. Results At baseline, the participants' mean (SD) age was 27.5 (5.9) years, (range: 14-44 years). The majority of participants were non-Hispanic Black (857, 70.2%). Participants with less residential tree canopy cover were significantly more likely to have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among participants with less than 10% compared with those with greater than 30% tree canopy cover was 2.14 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-4.15) within 100-meter buffer. Conclusion In our cohort, greenness was associated with lower hypertensive disorders of pregnancy odds. Our findings add to evidence that greenness may confer health benefits and warrant further investigations in identifying whether there is a causal pathway through which greenness may be protective against hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

AB  - Numerous studies have revealed that accessible parks are associated with better health outcomes. This interdisciplinary study focuses the spatial equality of local parks in Shenzhen, China, and aims to investigate its correlation with the summation of mortalities for the top four causes of non-accidental death. The paper consists of two parts: firstly, the spatial equality of parks was assessed by several criteria including the Gini index and accessibility calculated by the Gaussian-based two-step-floating catchment area (G2SFCA) method, and then multilevel regression analysis was novelly used to explore the correlation between the equality of park and mortality integrated with geodemographic and economic factors. The results show that the residents living in city centre experience higher accessibility and more equality of parks. There is greater equality regarding neighbourhood parks provision than urban parks provision. Parks that are walking accessible have stronger correlations with mortality compared to all types of green spaces. Most importantly, the greater park accessibility is associated with a lower mortality whereas this relation no longer exists when the accessibility exceeds 47.72m2/ person, which is concluded that building parks moderately is suggested to balance the health benefits and land scarcity for the sustainable development of cities.

AB  - NIMBY phenomenon is a resistance to the polluting factories, public infrastructure and service facilities by the local residents. With the rapid development of China's industrialization and urbanization, NIMBY phenomenon will no longer be the case, while the research about the NIMBY phenomenon by domestic scholars has just started, especially on the various types of empirical research. Therefore, based on the reviews of literature, the author proposed classification of NIMBY and different hedging strategies for different NIMBY phenomena.

AB  - Nationalization was once anathema to neoliberals and the hydrocarbon-based corporations long closely integrated with the neoliberal project. Indeed, the origins of neoliberal advocacy for global economic liberalisation can be traced, at least in part, to the resistance of oil multinationals to nationalist governments attempting to assert ownership and control over natural resources. It is therefore striking that calls are now mounting from this quarter for the nationalization of fossil fuel infrastructures, to keep them operating as climate policy, loss of public legitimacy and changing market conditions increasingly make investments in them unprofitable, uninsurable, or uncompetitive. The Canadian government's purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline exemplifies what we term a 'neoliberal nationalization'. Neoliberal pundits and oil industry figures created the perception of both an immediate economic crisis and a longer-term crisis of investor confidence in Canada; these 'crises' were used to justify the nationalization. Critically, the government acquisition of the pipeline was framed as a temporary measure of last resort. The intention of a neoliberal nationalization is to protect corporate actors from the effects of their own irresponsible business practises, maintaining 'business as usual' by pre-emptively socializing the foreseeable risks of rapid capital asset devaluation. In the case of hydrocarbon infrastructures like Trans Mountain, state authority is called upon to ensure the continued profitability of private fossil energy extraction, even as global financial markets accelerate disinvestment from the sector in response to evidence that most fossil fuels must remain in the ground to prevent catastrophic climate change.

AB  - It is often argued that concerns about the equity of a global climate agreement might appropriately be addressed in the language of human rights. The human rights approach has been promoted by a number of international political actors, including the UN Human Rights Council. As such, human rights are instrumentally applied as a solution to what could be called the "justice problem" in climate negotiations. In order to assess the degree to which human rights could be a useful approach to the justice problem with regard to to climate change, four major issues need to be examined. First, there is the distinction between human rights as protection against climate change versus the right to emit greenhouse gases. Both understandings are found in the debate on climate justice, but they are often not made explicit. Second, the "human rights as protection" approach with a focus on (a) right holders, both presently and in the future, needs to be elucidated, as well as (b) the human rights principles that are at stake, and (c) the duties and duty holders involved. Third, the human right to emit greenhouse gases needs to be clarified in the context of subsistence rights and equal per capita emission rights. Finally, there is the question of whether the cosmopolitan conception of human rights is at odds with the goal of ensuring that individuals assume responsibility for their own carbon-dependent lifestyle.

AB  - In NYC there is a growing labor demand within the energy efficiency sector. Given the historical ethnic and racial disparities in employment affecting Puerto Ricans and other minorities, are there any governmental workforce intermediaries and training programs in place that address these disparities within the green jobs sector? This article attempts to answer this question, arguing that the involvement of community-based workforce intermediaries is necessary for New York City's Puerto Rican communities to benefit from this increased labor demand. Given the fact that Puerto Rican CBOs have been at the forefront of the environmental justice movement in NYC, these CBOs position Puerto Rican communities particularly well to overcome the green jobs gap. Two local initiatives that point to possible career ladders for Puerto Rican low-wage workers in the energy efficiency and retrofits industry are briefly explored.

AB  - Planners often use the phrase 'hard-to-reach' to describe youth, people of color, and people with low incomes, people from whom they need information but are unsuccessful in reaching. Consideration of cultural premises for communicating can help explain why some people are 'under-heard' rather than 'hard-to-reach.' This study uses cultural discourse analysis to study under-represented community group deliberations about transportation, convened through a model of public engagement for environmental justice. Data include transcripts of 29 group deliberations and fieldnotes. Analysis and interpretation of cultural discourses about public participation processes focuses on three radiants of meaning: (1) respect for users and sociability, (2) being involved and efficacy, and (3) having a voice and feeling worthwhile. The model of engagement in deliberative processes allows for a reconfiguration of notions of being, acting, relating, and feeling in which participants give themselves amplified voice and agency. It contributes to literature on public engagement and how culture is conceived.

AB  - Nature-based solutions have recently been embraced as one route towards simultaneously addressing urban environmental and social problems, but an emerging agenda has sought to ask whether and how the 'greening' of cities may actually reinforce inequalities or lead to new forms of social exclusion. Using comparative case-study analysis, this paper examines the extent to which nature-driven stewardship initiatives recognize and redress inequalities. We compare two urban contexts that have undergone significant societal transformations over the last two to three decades: Sofia and Cape Town. The comparison shows how nature-driven stewardship initiatives differentially address deeper roots of environmental, social and racial privilege shaped significantly by post-socialist and post-apartheid transition contexts. Instead of assuming a homogenous ideal of urban nature and focusing on questions of the distribution of urban nature and its access, this paper finds it is important to consider the kinds of social relations that are required to both shape decision-making processes and generate meaningful and diverse values and ways of relating to nature in the city. Furthermore, it finds that inclusive nature-based solution governance recognizes and redresses both inequalities in access and inequalities that perpetuate dominant views about what nature is and for whom nature is produced and maintained.

AB  - In the context of contemporary global climate and environmental change, both natural and social scientists have stressed the role green areas play in global warming adaptation strategies and in improving the healthiness of the urban environment. Indeed, in recent years these spaces have become central to institutional political debates and various policies have been designed for their valorization. However, little attention has been paid to rewilded urban spaces, recently defined as novel urban ecosystems, and to their socio-ecological complexity. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach that links natural and social science perspectives, this article aims to highlight the role of novel urban ecosystems in the reconfiguration of urban policies. Indeed, this contribution analyzes ecosystem services coupled with the hybrid, contested socio-ecological nature of four case studies in Italy characterized by grassroots socio-environmental mobilization. Data were collected through comparative quantitative and qualitative methods. The evidence shows that the specific ecological features of novel urban ecosystems are strategic in terms of actual and potential ecosystem service provision for cities and suggests that citizens play a fundamental role in recognizing and valorizing them. In parallel, these spaces, reconceptualized as contested novel ecosystems, emerge as controversial hybrid urban socio-natures that enable community empowerment and produce a heterogeneous, grassroots political space oriented towards urban commons and environmental-climate justice.

AB  - In this paper, the case of the Coastal Strip in Gdansk is presented. Gdansk has natural and cultural heritage of great value and is included on Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage List as "Gdansk-Town of Memory and Freedom". The Coastal Strip is a rare example of landscape with natural dunes located within walking distance from densely populated residential districts. Therefore, the economic pressure for urban development is extremely strong. At the same time, the rise of social awareness about potential consequences of urbanization brought numerous efforts by local activists and researchers to prevent further development of the Coastal Strip. This study consisted of assessment of therapeutic qualities of The Coastal Strip using a conceptual framework-a universal standard for health promoting places. The results demonstrated that The Coastal Strip is a health-promoting place, thus adding new research-based evidence against plans for urban development of that area.

AB  - Local tariffs in the form of household contributions are the primary financial mechanism to fund the maintenance of rural water supplies in Malawi. An investigation was conducted into the tariffs set by rural service providers to sustain drilled boreholes equipped with Afridev handpumps. A binary logistic regression analysis identified significant explanatory variables for the most common identified considerations when setting tariffs, 'affordability' and 'operations and maintenance (O&M) costs'. The results demonstrate tariffs collected less frequently and usage above the design limit of the Afridev (300 users) had lower odds of considering affordability and higher odds of considering O&M costs, than those collected per month and within the design limit. The results further suggest a recognition by service providers of an increased maintenance challenge. High usage, acquiring spare parts, and the collection of tariffs when repairs are required indicate an increased likelihood of considering O&M costs, conversely to considering affordability. The balance of affordability and sustainable maintenance is a perpetual challenge under decentralised service delivery. Investment into ongoing support and supply chains is required for the financial and operational requirements of water supply, to ensure payments for services does not prevent access to clean water at the local level and to achieve the 2030 agenda.

AB  - It is well documented that the colonizers of Canada have long coveted the ancestral homelands of the Canadian Indigenous peoples for settlement and development. With this end goal in mind, it is not surprising that there exists an extensive history of assimilative efforts by the colonizers with respect to the Indigenous peoples of Canada-for example, legal assimilation through enfranchisement (voluntary and involuntary) and blood quantum requirements, and cultural assimilation through residential schools and the "sixties scoop". Another form of assimilation is environmental assimilation, that is, colonial development on Indigenous homelands to the extent whereby Indigenous cultural activities can no longer be supported in the development-transformed environment. Herein, I examine Bill C-69, a Government of Canada omnibus bill, through an environmental justice lens in the context of development across Canada on Indigenous homelands and impacts on Indigenous cultural sustainability. Specifically, Part 1 (i.e., the Impact Assessment Act, 2019) and Part 3 (i.e., the Canadian Navigable Waters Act, 2019) of Bill C-69 pose significant threats to Indigenous cultural sustainability. Through an environmental justice lens, procedural aspects include the use of the project list and scheduled waterways, the discretionary decision-making powers of the Government of Canada representatives, and the lack of acknowledgement of procedural elements of the environmental assessment processes that are constitutionally protected in comprehensive land claims. While, distributive justice aspects consist of unsustainable development from an Indigenous perspective, whereby environmental costs and benefits have been (and will be) distributed inequitably. Bill C-69 is a flawed statute that reinforces the colonial policy of assimilation.

AB  - Parks provide critical ecosystem services to urban residents. Park access critically determines how parks are used by residents. Many existing studies, which mostly have been conducted in developed countries, reported that park access disproportionately benefits the socioeconomically advantaged groups. To test if this observation also holds true in developing countries, we examined the park access and its relationship with socioeconomic conditions in Beijing, China. We used a buffering method and a road network-based analysis to calculate the park access of 130 neighborhoods, and applied the Pearson correlation to examine how neighborhood park access is related to socioeconomic conditions. Our results showed that (1) the park access decreased from 76% in the downtown areas to 24% in the suburbs; (2) the correlation coefficients (r) between socioeconomic conditions and park access were all smaller than 0.3 (p < 0.05)-that is, explaining less than 8% of the variability. Our study indicated that neighborhood socioeconomic conditions were only weakly associated with park access in Beijing and did not support the common phenomenon in western countries. Such a contradiction might be explained by the fact that park planning in Beijing is funded and administered by the city government and influenced by the central government's policy, whereas in most developed countries market sectors play a critical role in park planning. Our research suggested that urban planning funded by governments, when aimed at improving the wellbeing of all urban residents, may effectively reduce potential environmental inequalities.

AB  - Morbidity and mortality impacts of extreme heat amplified by climate change will be unequally distributed among communities given pre-existing differences in socioeconomic, health, and environmental conditions. Many governments are interested in adaptation policies that target those especially vulnerable to the risks, but there are important questions about how to effectively identify and support communities most in need of heat adaptations. Here, we use an equity-oriented adaptation program from the state of California as a case study to evaluate the implications of the currently used environmental justice index (CalEnviroScreen 3.0) for the identification of socially vulnerable communities with climate change adaptation needs. As CalEnviroScreen is geared towards air and water pollution, we assess how community heat risks and adaptation needs would be evaluated differently under two more adaptation-relevant vulnerability indices: the Social Vulnerability Index and the Heat-Health Action Index. Our analysis considers communities at the census tract scale, as well as the patterns emerging at the regional scale. Using the current index, the state designates 25% of its census tracts as "disadvantaged" communities eligible for special adaptation funds. However, an additional 12.6% of the state's communities could be considered vulnerable if the two other indices were considered instead. Only 13.4% of communities are vulnerable across all three vulnerability indices studied. Choice of vulnerability index shapes statewide trends in extreme heat risk and is linked to a community's likelihood of receiving heat-related California Climate Investments (CCI) projects. Tracts that are vulnerable under the current pollution-focused index, but not under the heat-health specific index, received four times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under the reverse scenario. This study demonstrates important nuances relevant to implementing equity-oriented adaptation and explores the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities in quantifying vulnerability.

AB  - Inhalation during showering activities is a major pathway for exposure to volatile disinfection-by-products (DBPs). Disinfection-by-products such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) have been shown to significantly increase cancer risks and can also pose other health hazards. In multi-family residences and common-shower facilities located in dormitories and gymnasiums, the time-lag between showers is likely to be short and the exposure to vapor-phase DBPs may be significantly increased due to residual concentrations from earlier showering activities. Current models do not consider the impacts of the initial vapor-phase concentration on health risks to be significant. The hypothesis that non-zero initial DBP vapor-phase concentrations lead to higher exposure and health risks was evaluated here using data from the City of Corpus Christi, TX at two levels of input parameter uncertainty. The inhalation risks and hazards were found to be over 1.5 times greater for subsequent showers compared to the initial shower of the day. For non-zero initial air concentrations and triangular distribution of input parameters, the model was found to be most sensitive to the initial air concentrations, highlighting the impact of initial conditions on cumulative daily intake (CDI) and subsequently on cancer risks and hazard indices. Increasing the time-gap between showers and improving ventilation are viable solutions to contend with the increased risk. It is recommended that the effects of initial air concentrations be incorporated in future risk assessments focusing on multi-family residences in older and poor neighborhoods where single shower dwellings are more common.

AB  - This article sheds light on a challenge to the emancipatory potential of social media for social movements that has so far largely been overlooked: corporations' monitoring of individuals. In this way, it goes beyond the ways in which corporations draw on big data' from online sources and instead explores how they (1) monitor and (2) discuss strategies for responding to the activities of individual activists, specifically in social media. Theoretically, it draws on Thompson's concept of mediated visibility, Mouffe's concept of the (post)political and Carpentier's notion of the fantasy of the post-political.

AB  - In La Guajira, Colombia, in the 21st century, coal mining has increased, and wind parks and wind turbines are being planned, which will affect the Wayuu people territorially, environmentally, and culturally. The demands of NGOs, grassroots organizations, and Wayuu leaders seek to position alternatives to extractivism, articulated with energy transition and postextractives transitions' proposals. Faced with the demands of local processes, companies and institutions also pose energy transitions, which respond to other perspectives and interests, since they continue to be anchored to socio-environmental and structural inequalities and a socioecological fix that reproduce the same effects of extractivism. From the critical debates on green extractivism and the proposals for radical socioenvironmental transformation, I analyze the energy transition proposals around an institutionalized governance and infrastructures of inequality. At the same time, I arise from the demands of the Wayuu people to propose that a rethinking of socio-environmental relationships to radical socioenvironmental transformations. This transformation will be based on demands of relational environmental justice that take up Wayuu ways of life and reposition human-non-human relationships under other ontologies, and proposals. The work was carried out collaboratively, based on an ethnographic work and interviews with various actors.

AB  - In recent years, several actors at the sub-national level (e.g. California, British Columbia, New York City) have taken unilateral steps to mitigate climate change by reducing their emissions. These developments have commanded considerable attention in the empirical literature. In this piece, we consider the philosophical dimensions of climate action at the sub-national level. Specifically, we argue that climate action at the sub-national level is an instance of a more general class of cases in which the failure of some collective agent to discharge some duty to which it is subject entails duties for the sub-collectives of which it is comprised to partially discharge that duty. We begin, then, with a discussion of such cases, and a defence of the devolution principle, which sets out conditions under which such duties arise. We then set out the argument with respect to sub-national political communities' duties to take action on climate change, specifically. The article concludes by considering complications arising out of the inevitable fact of partial compliance, drawing upon recent work in the literature on slack-taking duties.

AB  - National experience has shown that perceived inequity to disadvantaged communities can derail the consideration of proposed toll and pricing projects. Even in areas with existing toll facilities, new proposals are not immune from fairness criticisms. Left unanswered, fairness issues may overwhelm public opinion and potentially elicit legal concerns. Five general types of equity apply to toll and priced facilities: geographic, income, participation, opportunity, and modal equity. The first two issues are generally more important in the planning process. Issues with geographic equity are largely reflected in public opinion, which in turn reflects participation and modal equity. Income equity also incorporates elements of opportunity equity and modal equity. Through the careful and deliberate planning process, issues pertaining to income equity can more easily be mitigated or alleviated than geographic equity, fulfilling the requirements of environmental justice. As toll and pricing policies are developed, planners and policy makers should address key questions designed to identify (a) potential income equity concerns and (b) ways to mitigate those concerns that may occur. Although no assessment can completely address an potential issues of equity and fairness, the principle of environmental justice requires transportation professionals to evaluate proposed projects with an open eye and an open mind. Ultimately, no project needs to be delayed or tabled because of issues of equity. Rather, correctly identifying concerns and addressing them through deliberate and transparent policy and action can help further the case for tolls in a broad transportation financing and planning context.

AB  - Mining activities often cause displacement and disruption of Indigenous socio-cultural relations to land, water, biodiversity, and sacred entities. Due to the high disturbance and degradation that occurs as a result of mining on Indigenous lands, mine restoration and closure (MR&C) must mobilize the political agency of Indigenous Australians and provide enduring benefits beyond the life-of-mine. Here, we demonstrate that Indigenous engagements with mining restoration supply chains in Australia can only succeed if institutionalized socio-environmental inequalities are recognized and dismantled. Through environmental justice lenses, we examine critical mine restoration injustices and how Indigenous Australian participation can energize environmental self-determination. We analyze emerging restoration supply chains through the native seed collection and production activities as opportunities for nurturing transformative local collaborations, Indigenous entrepreneurship, and political participation. Our analysis shows the potential for community practices to coproduce MR&C through enduring partnerships, Indigenous-led organizations, and plural knowledge systems. Indigenous Australian leadership in coordinating investments, collaborations, techniques, and business operations is critical to transforming MR&C into democratic and equitable plans and actions on Indigenous lands where mining operates. When aligned with progressive institutional changes, restoration interventions can potentially strengthen environmental self-determination for Indigenous Australian political control over the customary use and stewardship of their lands.

AB  - In recent years, overtourism and tourism gentrification have been a central feature of public debate in the Balearic Islands, one of the most touristified regions on the planet. In this context, the discourse of tourism degrowth has thrived, being discussed across the political spectrum and even serving to legitimize a sustainable tourism plan and a new Tourism Act. This article provides a brief analysis of the debate around tourism degrowth in the 2014-2019 period and differentiates between two approaches. On the one hand, tourism degrowth has been used by socio-environmental platforms as a byword for detourisfication and the politicization of the hegemonic consensus on tourism. On the other, degrowth has been adopted as a green washing rhetoric in order to justify public policies aimed at tourist decongestion through deseasonalizing, while promoting tourism expansion. This work brings into focus the social construction of the tourism degrowth narrative by applying critical discourse analysis. We conclude that the debate over tourism degrowth is not just a discrepancy between different approaches to deal with overtourism, tourism pressure and gentrification. It is also a social struggle where the discourse over tourism degrowth has helped new democratic political subjects to coalesce and organize in civil society.

AB  - Naming the "Anthropocene" as the spatiotemporality in which we live is a theoretical action that resonates with two separate traditions that can, for a limited purpose, be brought into relation with one another. The first is that identified with Foucault's work, which is anti-humanist in a post-structuralist manner. The second is a set of ideas and resources for thought and action developed by indigenous peoples, namely "indigenous legal traditions", which are anti-humanist in a different way. I argue here that since both of these intellectual traditions begin by de-centering the classic liberal subject, and even de-centering "man", they have some affinities. In both perspectives, action is seen as a feature of webs of relationships, rather than as the willed acts of the classic European "person". Thus, borrowing from both of these could help to elaborate a framework for thinking about responsibility, action, and governance that does not reproduce the very anthropocentrism that underpinned the destructive exploitation of the environment.

AB  - Leading evaluation practitioners were asked about lessons from the recent 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) for evaluation practice. Contributors emphasize the importance of evaluating equity between rich and poor countries and other forms of climate injustice. The role of the evaluation is questioned: what can evaluation be expected to do on its own and what requires collaboration across disciplines, professions and civil society - and across generations? Contributors discuss the implications of the post-Glasgow climate 'pact' for the continued relevance of evaluation. Should evaluators advocate for the marginalized and become activists on behalf of sustainability and climate justice - as well as advocates of evidence? Accountability-driven and evidence-based evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of investments in adaptation and mitigation. Causal pathways in different settings and 'theories of no-change' are needed to understand gaps between stakeholder promises and delivery. Evaluators should measure unintended consequences and what is often left unmeasured, and be sensitive to failure and unanticipated effects of funded actions. Evaluation timescales and units of analysis beyond particular programmes are needed to evaluate the complexities of climate change, sustainability and to take account of natural systems. The implications for evaluation commissioning and funding are discussed as well as the role of evaluation in programme-design and implementation.

AB  - On the 30th anniversary of the Principles of Environmental Justice established at the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 (Principles of Environmental Justice), we continue to call for these principles to be more widely adopted. We propose an environmental justice framework for exposure science to be implemented by all researchers. This framework should be the standard and not an afterthought or trend dismissed by those who believe that science should not be politicized. Most notably, this framework should be centered on the community it seeks to serve. Researchers should meet with community members and stakeholders to learn more about the community, involve them in the research process, collectively determine the environmental exposure issues of highest concern for the community, and develop sustainable interventions and implementation strategies to address them. Incorporating community "funds of knowledge" will also inform the study design by incorporating the knowledge about the issue that community members have based on their lived experiences. Institutional and funding agency funds should also be directed to supporting community needs both during the "active" research phase and at the conclusion of the research, such as mechanisms for dissemination, capacity building, and engagement with policymakers. This multidirectional framework for exposure science will increase the sustainability of the research and its impact for long-term success.

AB  - In the United States (U.S.), up to 14% of the population depend on private wells as their primary drinking water source. The U.S. government does not regulate contaminants in private wells. The goals of this study were to investigate the quality of drinking water from unregulated private wells within one mile (1.6 kilometers) of an effluent-dominated river in the arid Southwest, determine differences in contaminant levels between wet and dry seasons, and identify contributions from human sources by specifically measuring man-made organic contaminants (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), and sucralose). Samples were collected during two dry seasons and two wet seasons over the course of two years and analyzed for microbial (Escherichia coli), inorganic (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nitrate), and synthetic organic (PFOA, PFOS, and sucralose) contaminants. Arsenic, nitrate, and Escherichia coli concentrations exceeded their respective regulatory levels of 0.01 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 1 colony forming unit (CFU)/100 mL, respectively. The measured concentrations of PFOA and PFOS exceeded the respective Public Health Advisory level. Arsenic, PFOA, PFOS, and sucralose were significantly higher during the dry seasons, whereas E. coli was higher during the wet seasons. While some contaminants were correlated (e.g., As and Hg rho = 0.87; PFOA and PFOS rho = 0.45), the lack of correlation between different contaminant types indicates that they may arise from different sources. Multi-faceted interventions are needed to reduce exposure to drinking water above health-based guidelines.

AB  - In this study, we explored how science teacher candidates construct ideas about science teaching and learning in the context of partnerships with urban community-based organizations. We used a case study design focusing on a group of 10 preservice teachers' participation in educational programming that focused on environmental racism and connected science to larger social issues in an economically dispossessed Mexican community in Chicago. Using theoretical lenses of humanistic science education, justice-centered science pedagogy, and structure-agency dialectic, we studied how preservice high school science teachers made sense of equity and social justice issues facing marginalized communities and how they thought about the goals and nature of science education, along with their role as science teachers, as they participated in a Toxic Tour provided by the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. By emphasizing both environmental challenges and the community assets in Little Village, the Toxic Tour provided an opportunity for science teacher candidates to develop a complex understanding of this particular community and critically reflect on their own communities. The teacher candidates identified both structures that are enabling or disabling for community members and people's individual and collective agency acting upon these structures. They also recognized communities as places of authentic science learning.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the racialized burden of toxicity in the US as a case study of what we call "domestic geopolitics." Drawing on the case studies of Badin, North Carolina, and Flint, Michigan, we argue that maintaining life in conditions of racialized toxicity is not only a matter of survival, but also a geopolitical praxis. We propose the term domestic geopolitics to describe a reconceived feminist geopolitics integrating an analysis of Black geographies as a domestic form of colonialism, with an expanded understanding of domesticity as political work. We develop the domestic geopolitics framework based on the dual meaning of domestic: the inward facing geopolitics of racialization and the resistance embodied in domestic labors of maintaining life, home, and community. Drawing on Black feminist scholars, we describe three categories of social reproductive labor in conditions of racialized toxicity: the labor of keeping wake, the labor of tactical expertise, and the labor of revolutionary mothering. We argue that Black survival struggles exemplify a domestic geopolitics of everyday warfare against racial capitalism's onslaught.

AB  - Parks are key community assets for physical activity, but some evidence suggests these resources are not equitably distributed. This study examined disparities by income and race/ethnicity in the availability, features, and quality of parks across Kansas City, Missouri. All parks and census tracts (CTs) were mapped using geographical information systems, and park features and quality were determined via audits. Multivariate analyses of covariance analyzed differences in park availability, features, and quality across low-, medium-, and high-income and race/ethnicity CT tertiles. Low-income CTs contained significantly more parks, but also had fewer parks with playgrounds and more quality concerns per park. High minority CTs had more parks with basketball courts, but fewer parks with trails. Medium-income CTs contained more aesthetic features per park. Future research should examine policies that contribute to and that might rectify disparities in park features and quality, especially in low-income and high minority areas.

AB  - In questioning the multiple positions of the stakeholders involved in the mining debate in Ecuador, this paper offers an analytical framework to uncover the 'politics of scale' of mining discourses. This is done by understanding how discourses are simultaneously structured, disassembled and restructured according to power relations among stakeholders involved in the mining debate. Q methodology is used as a tool to assess the subjective perceptions of key stakeholders regarding mining projects in the country. Results highlight four distinct discourses: (1) responsible extractivism; (2) local self-determination; (3) national economic development; and (4) local economic development. Discursive analyses suggest that mining positions are constructed to contest power in: decision-making, the enactment of values and rights, and the uneven distribution of economic benefits and socio-environmental burdens associated with mining. The analysis also offers insights for enhancing conflict-resolution and depicting the political complexity associated with structural power inequalities among actors implicated in mining conflicts in the country.

AB  - In this paper we outline the limitations of Environmental Justice theory when it comes to explaining and theorising the politics of contemporary environmental movements. Justice, we argue, needs to be understood not as a formalised and preconceived 'thing' to be delivered or applied but as an-open egalitarian ideal that movements across the world continuously redefine in embodied and performed ways which are historically and geographically distinct. Drawing upon the fifteen year long anti-mining struggles of Rosia Montana, Romania, we explore the tension between seeking 'traditional' forms of justice (i.e. dia-logic consensual politics) and putting forward more radical demands for socio-ecological change, in which representation and recognition are seen as insufficient practices for distributing justice. Visibility (rather than recognition) and egalitarian politics (rather than distribution) become the quilting points of struggles of many contemporary environmental movements, equality can only be enacted (or staged) through praxis that disrupts the distribution of the sensible experience and exposes the arbitrariness and incompleteness of power. We argue that in order to analyse and theorise the praxis of contemporary environmental movements, it is imperative for geographical literature to engage with post-foundational theory, and 'un-do' pre-conceived ideas and theorisations of (environmental) justice.

AB  - Over the last two decades, the global production of farm-raised shrimps has increased at a faster rate than any other aquacultural product, leading to massive socio-ecological damages in the mangrove areas where shrimp farming often takes place. Consequently, an increasing number of conflicts pitting coastal populations against shrimp farmers has been reported although very few conflicts have been studied in detail. This article contributes to fill this research gap by analyzing the causes, development and consequences of one such conflict in the Ecuadorian canton of Muisne (province of Esmeraldas). This conflict is one of the world's earliest and most important protest movements for the defence of mangroves and against the shrimp industry. Within a political ecology perspective, we connect three key dimensions of the conflict: (1) the socioeconomic metabolism of shrimp farming locally and internationally, (2) the institutions - formal and informal - that regulate the access to mangroves, and (3) the development of the mobilization itself, with special reference to the role of local women. The study is based on six-month fieldwork and combines data from 52 in-depth interviews of a wide range of actors, various documentation, and direct and participant observation. We find that the development of shrimp farming can be understood as a modern case of enclosure movement whereby customary community mangroves are privatized for the building of shrimp ponds. As a result, local mangrove-dependant populations - especially women - mobilized with the support of a grassroots Environmental Justice Organization. The protest was targeted at a form of ecologically unequal exchange where sectors of the global North shift socio-ecological costs onto poor sectors of the producing regions of the global South. In agreement with feminist political ecology, local women were particularly resistant to this process of 'accumulation by dispossession'. While only some mangroves could be saved or reforested as a result of the movement, women's mobilization has had the unexpected effect of challenging gender relations in their communities. This research articulates dimensions of a given conflict that are too often considered separately, namely social-metabolic issues, institutional change, and gender issues. This allows a more comprehensive view of a complex power struggle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monetary valuation methods are commonly used to analyze recreation values of water ecosystems. However, most studies on water-related recreation values have not analyzed direct links between ecological elements providing recreation opportunities and user demands. Therefore, we implemented an ecosystem service approach to study human-nature interaction during the actual recreation visit to an urban freshwater site. We developed a conceptual model of local cultural ecosystem services (CES) to study interactions between recreation supply and demand. We were interested in seasonality of water-related recreation supply, and the different demands of summer and off-summer visitors. We chose urban Lake Kuusijarvi in the city of Vantaa, Finland, as our case study area, because it is a popular outdoor recreation area around the year. We identified 14 key elements of the supply of local CES and 22 socio-cultural values for the demand for local CES. We found little seasonal change in recreation supply, but the socio-demographic characteristics and demands of summer and off-summer visitors varied significantly. Demand was higher and more diverse during the summer season, while off-summer visitors were more specific in their demands. Moreover, some visitors feared that some socio-cultural values can be lost if the recreational use of the lake area increases. We discuss our findings in a theoretical context focusing especially on interactions between supply and demand of local CES at Lake Kuusijarvi.

AB  - Many resource-rich countries face the paradoxical situation that their wealth in natural resources coincides with low economic and human development rates. To address this so-called resource curse, academics and practitioners turn their hopes to institutional quality. Yet whether, how and with what consequences institutional quality is transformed in resource curse contexts remains poorly understood, especially so at subnational levels. The most widely implemented initiative that seeks to address the resource curse through enhanced institutional quality is the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). This article analyses to what extent and how the EITI transforms institutional quality at national and subnational levels in Myanmar, focusing on transparency, civil society participation and accountability. We show that many transformations go beyond the official EITI process and report. While the EITI report itself is not heavily used by civil society organisations (CSOs), the EITI process motivated CSOs to gather data and organise themselves both around and beyond EITI-related issues at subnational levels. Such participatory processes of constituting transparency improved relations between the (regional) government, CSOs and private companies, but also created new forms of in- and exclusion among civil society. While avenues opened up for CSOs to demand accountability regarding the impacts of resource extraction, the extent to which they are able to trigger action of extractive industry actors in their region remains limited. In conclusion, we argue that transformations in institutional quality are not characterised by a linear trajectory from transparency in the form of the EITI report to accountability, facilitated by civil society participation in EITI multi-stakeholder groups, as the EITI standard posits. Rather, transformations in institutional quality are characterised by spin-offs, dynamic interlinkages, trade-offs, limitations and a reinforcing cycle between participation and transparency within and beyond the EITI.

AB  - Over the past few years, studies in political ecology and environmental justice have been increasingly connecting the commons and social movements empirically, giving shape to a new, distinctive body of research on commons movements. In our review, we first organize and synthesize empirical lessons from this body of literature. We then highlight recent theoretical efforts made by scholars to both bridge and transcend the gap between the theory of the commons and social movement theory. As we illustrate, movements can help create and strengthen commons institutions and discourses, as well as rescale them horizontally and vertically. This is particularly evident in the context of rural community-rights movements in the global South, as well as in new water and food commons movements and community energy movements in both the global South and North. Commons institutions, in turn, can serve as the basis of social mobilization and become a key frame for social movements, as shown in the context of local environmental justice and livelihoods conflicts and anti-privatization struggles. Tensions and contradictions of commons-movement dynamics also exist and reflect trade-offs between diversity versus uniformization and organizational closure versus expansion of discourses and practices. Theoretically, there is an opportunity to cross boundaries from the theory of the commons to social movement theory and vice versa, e.g., by highlighting the role of political opportunities and framing, and biophysical factors and polycentricity, respectively. More importantly, a new commons movements theory is emerging focusing on cross-scalar organizations, the virtuous cycles between commons projects and mobilization, and the processes of commons-making.

AB  - In southwest Alaska, dominant narratives of subsistence and conservation are concerned predominantly with material relations with fish, with the number of fish that are killed. In Akiak, an Alaska Native (Yupiaq) village located along the Kuskokwim River, people's relations with Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) extend beyond the material, encompassing also the temporal. In this article, I contend that state and federal fishing regulations enact and extend settler colonial representations of Indigenous disappearance. Framing Yupiaq people's appeals for "a taste of fish" as a temporal matter, I examine how state and federal fishing regulations rupture the temporality in which Yupiaq people's relations with Chinook salmon unfold and threaten people's well-being. By examining the vitality of human-salmon relations through an optic of care, I describe how Yupiaq peoples in Akiak experience the adverse effects of interrupted and postponed relations with Chinook salmon in "confusion" among youth. In turn, I illustrate how people get on with living despite the limits that the present politics of fisheries management place on their ability to take care of each other on their own terms, and in their own time.

AB  - Place-based resettlement capacity assessments to identify potential resettlement places for climate migrants are needed to guide resettlement programs related to climate change. This article proposes and validates a conceptual climate change resettlement capacity (CCRC) framework that can be used to identify potential resettlement places for climate migrants. The CCRC framework focuses on livelihood reconstruction, as this is the primary aim of most resettlement programs and a key for successful resettlement and mitigation of impoverishment of resettled people and communities. The framework has two main dimensions - assets and conditions - as its foundation, with a set of subdimensions and generic indicators identified for both of them. Expert evaluation was used to validate the framework. The operationalization of the framework is illustrated through a case study of two regions of Ethiopia vulnerable to climate change. The framework is designed to assist international organizations, governments, planners, and policymakers in identifying both the most suitable and least suitable places to resettle communities in the face of actual or anticipated displacements due to climate change. In addition, the framework can be used by researchers to undertake theoretical and empirical studies on resettlement induced by climate change. With minor modifications, the framework can also be applied to resettlement capacity assessments for non-climate resettlement programs and research. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many environmental justice communities face elevated exposures to multiple stressors, given biases in urban and environmental policy and planning. This paper aims to evaluate sound level exposure in a densely populated environmental justice city in close proximity to major roadways, a nearby airport and high levels of industrial activity. In this study we collected various sound level metrics to evaluate the loudness and frequency composition of the acoustical environment in Chelsea, Massachusetts, USA. A total of 29 week-long sites were collected from October 2019 to June 2020, a time period that also included the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically altered activity patterns and corresponding sound level exposures. We found that Chelsea is exposed to high levels of sound, both day and night (65 dB (A), and 80 dB and 90 dB for low frequency, and infrasound sound levels). A spectral analysis shows that 63 Hz was the dominant frequency. Distance to major roads and flight activity (both arrivals and departures) were most strongly correlated with all metrics, most notably with metrics describing contributing from lower frequencies. Overall, we found similar patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic but at levels up to 10 dB lower. Our results demonstrate the importance of noise exposure assessments in environmental justice communities and the importance of using additional metrics to describe communities inundated with significant air, road, and industrial sound levels. It also provides a snapshot of how much quieter communities can be with careful and intentional urban and environmental policy and planning.

AB  - Over the last decade the scope of the socio-environmental concerns included within an environmental justice framing has broadened and theoretical understandings of what defines and constitutes environmental injustice have diversified. This paper argues that this substantive and theoretical pluralism has implications for geographical inquiry and analysis, meaning that multiple forms of spatiality are entering our understanding of what it is that substantiates claims of environmental injustice in different contexts. In this light the simple geographies and spatial forms evident in much "first-generation" environmental justice research are proving insufficient. Instead a richer, multidimensional understanding of the different ways in which environmental justice and space are co-constituted is needed. This argument is developed by analysing a diversity of examples of socio-environmental concerns within a framework of three different notions of justice-as distribution, recognition and procedure. Implications for the strategies of environmental justice activism for the globalisation of the environmental justice frame and for future geographical research are considered.

AB  - Inspired by Lefebvre's meditation on the rhythms seen from his apartment in Paris, we develop a novel rhythmanalytic account of urban air pollution, its breathing-in and impact in vulnerable bodies. We conceptualise urban air pollution as entwined in its making and consequence with the diverse rhythms of technologies, social practices and socio-temporal structures, environmental and atmospheric processes, bodily movements in space and time, and rhythmically constituted corporeality. Through this interdisciplinary account we position urban air pollution as integral to the 'beat' of the city, both a product of and constituent part of its evolving spatiotemporal form. We build on this foundation to develop a polyrhythmic conceptualisation of how certain places and lives are more dominated by pollution than others. Unequal patternings are made through the structuring effects of rhythmic repetition and by fatal intersections between the rhythms of polluted air and unequal capacities to avoid harmful breathing in and to resist the arrhythmic corporeal consequences that can follow. Understanding inequalities as manifest not within a static landscape of spatial relations, but in sets of unequally unfolding and structured polyrhythmic relations has implications for revealing patterns of inequality and for extending evidence-making more deeply into how rhythms intersect. Which and whose rhythms are to be intervened in are also considered as key ethical and political questions. We draw out implications for activism and community action, and identify the potential for bringing rhythmanalysis into productive engagement with broader environmental justice concerns, including in relation to recent COVID-19 experiences.

AB  - Increasingly, studies are focusing on the role the local food environment plays in residents' ability to purchase affordable, healthy and nutritious foods. In a food desert, an area devoid of a supermarket, access to healthy food is limited. We conducted a systematic review of studies that focused on food access and food desert research in the United States. The 31 studies identified utilized 9 measures to assess food access. Results from these studies can be summarized primarily into four major statements. Findings from other countries offer insight into ways, in which future research, policy development and program implementation in the US may continue to be explored. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Maps of regional morbidity and mortality rates are useful tools in determining spatial patterns of disease. Combined with sociodemographic census information, they also permit assessment of environmental justice; that is, whether certain subgroups suffer disproportionately from certain diseases or other adverse effects of harmful environmental exposures. Bayes and empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in smoothing crude maps of disease risk, eliminating the instability of estimates in low-population areas while maintaining geographic resolution. In this article we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions. Fitting the resulting highly parameterized models requires careful implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as well as novel techniques for model evaluation and selection. We illustrate our approach using a dataset of county-specific lung cancer rates in the state of Ohio during the period 1968-1988.

AB  - Park green space (PGS) is an important part of urban ecosystem and green infrastructure, and the ease of access to PGS is closely related to the health of residents. A growing number of studies have attempted to identify accessibility disparities, but results have varied because of the travel mode choice and the measurement method. This study proposes a dynamic Huff two-step floating catchment area (H2SFCA) method based on map service API (Application Programming Interface) to assess the accessibility of PGS, with the Gini coefficient and bivariate local Moran's I used to analyze accessibility equity. Results show that: (1) driving and biking modes have more significant spatiotemporal compression effects than dynamic modes, public transit, and walking mode. (2) The accessibility values and spatial patterns vary significantly by travel mode. The PGS availability pattern at the local level is more uneven than the distribution of accessibility at the regional level. In comparison with dynamic travel modes, the accessibility values for the single travel mode are more likely to be overestimated or underestimated. (3) The PGS accessibility by the dynamic modes generally has better spatial equity and residents can select suitable travel tools to acquire more equitable park services. In addition, there is a significant accessibility difference between dynamic driving-based mode and dynamic transit-based mode in four subdistricts, which are mainly located in the south of Tianhe District. The public transport facilities linking parks in these areas need to be optimized. This study further improves the accessibility evaluation method, with the findings conducive to the implementation of refined PGS planning and management.

AB  - In a recession, transit agencies aim to provide key services while retaining national core values. When making service changes, federal funding recipients are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin and must not place undue burden on Environmental Justice (EJ) populations. To ensure compliance, New York City Transit developed analytical methodologies to identify impacts for the SO proposed service rationalization initiatives, allowing for proactive mitigation. For 38 routes with span changes, load factor analysis across demographic and income categories (during periods of service elimination) demonstrated that impacts were equitably shared. For route changes, impacts were measured using shortest-path trip time and cost analysis using Census Transportation Planning Package Journey-to-Work data. The "M" and "V" Train modifications and the Co-op City bus restructuring illustrate package analysis of complex service changes, capturing mitigating effects of adjacent route restructurings. These service changes reduced costs while ensuring that Title VI/EJ communities were not disproportionately affected. After extensive EJ work and community outreach, the proposed changes were implemented in June 2010.

AB  - Large-scale water transfer projects (LWTPs) have been promoted to address rising water demands around the world. Scholars have been examining various impacts of LWTPs for decades; however, there is limited research that systematically examines the literature and synthesizes impacts and lessons learned from LWTPs. By conducting a systematic literature review, we assess the impacts of LWTP implementation on communities followed by the social, political, and economic factors that shape the implementation of LWTPs. Our review indicates that LWTPs can threaten livelihood strategies, jeopardize the sustainability of traditional cultures, and disrupt communities through resettlement. These impacts are shaped by the use of water as a political mechanism, the prioritization of economic interests, and unequal participation of stakeholders. Our review goes beyond individual studies of LWTPs to highlight the importance of using an environmental justice framework to guide LWTP assessments so that these assessments can address unique contexts of individual LWTPs.

AB  - Industrialisation, urbanisation and economic development have produced unprecedented (if unevenly distributed) improvements in human health. They have also produced unprecedented exploitation of Earth's life support systems, moving the planet into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene-one defined by human influence on natural systems. The health sector has been complicit in this influence. Bioethics, too, must acknowledge its role-the environmental threats that will shape human health in this century represent a 'perfect moral storm' challenging the ethical theories of the last. The US conservationist Aldo Leopold saw this gathering storm more clearly than many, and in his Land Ethic describes the beginnings of a route to safe passage. Its starting point is a reinterpretation of the ethical relationship between humanity and the 'land community', the ecosystems we live within and depend upon; moving us from 'conqueror' to 'plain member and citizen' of that community. The justice of the Land Ethic questions many presuppositions implicit to discussions of the topic in biomedical ethics. By valuing the community in itself-in a way irreducible to the welfare of its members-it steps away from the individualism axiomatic in contemporary bioethics. Viewing ourselves as citizens of the land community also extends the moral horizons of healthcare from a solely human focus. Taking into account the 'stability' of the community requires intergenerational justice. The resulting vision of justice in healthcare-one that takes climate and environmental justice seriously-could offer health workers an ethic fit for the future.

AB  - In honour of our lost colleague Anna K. Dvorak, we draw from elements of her last unfinished manuscript to explore new directions in critical GIS education and practice. Anna was a recent PhD in Geography hired into a critical GIS tenure-track position. The ways in which she wove GIS practice through her research interests, teaching sensibilities, and community advocacy experiences defied easy categorization; we argue she represents a new generation of geography graduate student who is redefining where and how critical GIS education occurs. Anna's social and environmental justice work with the Pacoima Beautiful non-profit organization in southern California formed the basis for an on-going research initiative that gave her the opportunity to experiment with GIS as advocacy tool in the hands of local high school students. At the time of her death she had completed an initial draft of a manuscript situating this work in broader community activism issues. We remember Anna by presenting large sections of her work unaltered, interwoven with our commentary on the significance of her approach to critical GIS in a time of shifting academic and corporate commercial relationships to the technology.

AB  - Justice for nature remains a confused term. In recent decades justice has predominantly been limited to humanity, with a strong focus on social justice, and its spin-off - environmental justice for people. We first examine the formal rationale for ecocentrism and ecological ethics, as this underpins attitudes towards justice for nature, and show how justice for nature has been affected by concerns about dualisms and by strong anthropocentric bias. We next consider the traditional meaning of social justice, alongside the recent move by some scholars to push justice for nature into social justice, effectively weakening any move to place ecojustice centre-stage. This, we argue, is both unethical and doomed to failure as a strategy to protect life on Earth. The dominant meaning of 'environmental justice' - in essence, justice for humans in regard to environmental issues - is also explored. We next discuss what ecological justice (ecojustice) is, and how academia has ignored it for many decades. The charge of ecojustice being 'antihuman' is refuted. We argue that distributive justice can also apply to nature, including an ethic of bio-proportionality, and also consider how to reconcile social justice and ecojustice, arguing that ecojustice must now be foregrounded to ensure effective conservation. After suggesting a 'Framework for implementing ecojustice' for conservation practitioners, we conclude by urging academia to foreground ecojustice.

The Dine and other indigenous residents of this region use groundwater for drinking, livestock, and irrigation, creating a serious environmental health risk. Currently, many individuals and communities on the Na-vajo Nation must purchase and transport treated water from hours away. Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) pref-erentially take up uranium and arsenic, potentially representing a tool to remove these contaminants through on-site, low-cost phytoremediation. This study reports the results of a collaboration among researchers, high school students, teachers, and tribal leaders to analyze water chemistry and perform a phytoremediation exper-iment. In 2018 and 2019, we compiled existing data from the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA) and collected samples from surface and groundwater. We then used sunflower seedlings grown in local soil to assess whether phytoremediation could be effective at removing arsenic and uranium. For the NNEPA-sampled wells, 9.5% exceeded the maximum contaminant level for uranium (30 mu g per liter) and 16% for arsenic (10 mu g per liter). For the new samples, uranium was highest in surface pools, suggesting leaching from local soil. Unlike studies from humid regions, sunflowers did not decrease uranium and arsenic in soil water. Instead, there was no change in arsenic concentration and an increase in uranium concentration in both planted and control treatments, attributable to weathering of uranium-bearing minerals in the desert soil. Because much of global uranium mining occurs in arid and semiarid regions, the ineffectiveness of phytoremediation on the Navajo Nation emphasizes the importance of prevention and conventional remediation. More generally, the participatory science approach created meaningful relationships and an important collaboration between a tribal chapter and a university, providing both cultural and scientific experiential learning opportunities for Dine high school students, undergraduate researchers, and senior personnel.

AB  - Over the last decade, environmental sociology has produced a tremendous stream of research pertaining to environmental justice issues. In general, we now know that low income groups and communities of color are disproportionately exposed to toxic wastes. In this paper I argue that future research requires a shift in methodological approach. Learning how groups come to be exposed to toxic wastes requires an understanding of the organizational processes that shape decisions regarding production practices and regulatory enforcement strategies. I conclude by making three claims: (I) Documenting that disempowered groups are exposed to toxic wastes more than other groups is important. Disentangling whether race or class matters more is more dubious. (2) If we want to make claims about process, we should study process and not outcomes. (3) Insofar as we have to study outcomes, we should be more aware of which outcomes we want to study and what types of inferences we are able to draw from outcomes.

AB  - Over what is now a period of several decades, green political theorists have attempted to reconcile the political philosophy of John Rawls with impending environmental crises. Despite numerous attempts, the general consensus among those receptive to the idea that Rawls' notion of "justice as fairness" can indeed be extended to incorporate environmental concerns is that such a theory cannot extend beyond minimal, "light" green notions of environmental justice. However, a theory of Rawlsian environmental stewardship can not only allow for more ecocentric visions of environmental justice, but also complement the "freestanding" nature of his later, specifically political liberalism.

AB  - Natural gas leaks in local distribution systems can develop as underground pipeline infrastructure degrades over time. These leaks lead to safety, economic, and climate change burdens on society. We develop an environmental justice analysis of natural gas leaks discovered using advanced leak detection in 13 U.S. metropolitan areas. We use Bayesian spatial regression models to study the relationship between the density of leak indications and sociodemographic indicators in census tracts. Across all metro areas combined, we found that leak densities increase with increasing percent people of color and with decreasing median household income. These patterns of infrastructure injustice also existed within most metro areas, even after accounting for housing age and the spatial structure of the data. Considering the injustices described here, we identify actions available to utilities, regulators, and advocacy groups that can be taken to improve the equity of local natural gas distribution systems.

AB  - Little national evidence is available on spatial disparities in distributions of parks and green spaces in the USA. This study examines ecological associations of spatial access to parks and green spaces with percentages of black, Hispanic, and low-income residents across the urban-rural continuum in the conterminous USA. Census tract-level park and green space data were linked with data from the 2010 U.S. Census and 2006-2010 American Community Surveys. Linear mixed regression models were performed to examine these associations. Poverty levels were negatively associated with distances to parks and percentages of green spaces in urban/suburban areas while positively associated in rural areas. Percentages of blacks and Hispanics were in general negatively linked to distances to parks and green space coverage along the urban-rural spectrum. Place-based race-ethnicity and poverty are important correlates of spatial access to parks and green spaces, but the associations vary across the urbanization levels.

AB  - Objective To examine how global health institutions are reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from their own operations and analyse the facilitators and barriers to achieving decarbonisation goals. Methods We reviewed the sustainability goals and implementation plans of 10 global health universities from the Modified Letter Turned CommaTropEd & apos; network. We systematically collected information from institutional websites and annual reports. Through online interviews, 11 key informants validated the information from 9 of the institutions and shared their opinions regarding what factors are helping their institutions decarbonise and what factors are hindering progress. Results 4/10 institutions sampled have a sustainability strategy and implementation plan, only 3/10 have specific decarbonisation goals, and 3/10 are reporting on progress. 5/10 institutions reported that they are in the process of determining emission reduction targets. Conclusion This paper identifies common success factors that facilitate decarbonisation as well as common challenges and how they are being tackled, and makes recommendations on sustainability efforts in academic institutions.

AB  - In this article, carbon management is framed as a domain in which active reflection on the uncertain significance of climate change takes material form in the construction of new infrastructures of carbon accounting and carbon markets. "Carbon" refers not to a chemical, per se, but to an imaginative space of global atmospheric relations rendered material. The historical ontology of carbon and atmosphere together form a distinctive global medium, as I describe. The atmosphere as medium is manifest in the informational spaces of digital platforms meant to do work on the human subjects of climate change. I describe the carbon accounting practices of two Beijing-based enterprises that are involved in building out the infrastructure of carbon accounting for the purpose of decarbonizing Chinese industry. Carbon is at the center of a contemporary formation that is imaginative, materialist, heavily quantified, and oriented toward the technical modification of human affairs. It supposes that humans as planetary agents have become significant in terms of collective activity that is historically recent, highly unequal, and global in scope. The human is configured not as a biological species, such as in debates on "life itself" or distinctions between humans and other species, or even in terms of an essential humanity that can provide the transcendent bonds of a moral community. Rather, carbon accounting formulates the human ecologically and geologically with an eye toward imagining the future forms these relations might take. Hence, climate change has identified the human as a contemporary problem with particular urgency.

AB  - Political orientation and ideology are amongst the most significant influences on climate change attitudes and responses. Specifically, those with right-of-centre political views are typically less concerned and more sceptical about climate change. A significant challenge remains to move beyond this ideological impasse and achieve a more open and constructive debate across the political spectrum. This paper reports on novel mixed-methods research in the UK to develop and test a series of 'narratives' to better engage citizens with centre-right political views. Qualitative work in Study 1 revealed two particularly promising narratives. The first focused on the idea that saving energy is predicated on the 'conservative' principle of avoiding waste; the second focused on the advantages of 'Great British Energy' (based on patriotic support for domestic low-carbon technologies). An online experiment in Study 2 with a representative UK sample compared these narratives with a more typically left-of-centre narrative focused on the concept of 'climate justice' with a representative sample of the UK public. Results indicate that the first two narratives elicited broad agreement and reduced scepticism amongst centre-right participants, while the 'climate justice' narrative (which reflects a common environmental message framing) polarised audiences along political lines. This research offers clear implications for how climate change communicators can move beyond preaching to the converted and initiate constructive dialogue about climate change with traditionally disengaged audiences.

The emerging field of Indigenous Environmental Studies and Sciences (iess) is distinctive, investigating social resilience to environmental change through the research lens of how moral relationships are organized in societies. Examples of iess research across three moral relationships are discussed here: responsibility, spirituality, and justice. iess develops insights on resilience that can support Indigenous peoples' struggles with environmental justice and political reconciliation; makes significant contributions to global discussions about the relationship between human behavior and the environment; and speaks directly to Indigenous liberation as well as justice issues impacting everyone.

AB  - It may be too late to achieve environmental justice for some indigenous peoples, and other groups, in terms of avoiding dangerous climate change. People in the indigenous climate justice movement agree resolutely on the urgency of action to stop dangerous climate change. However, the qualities of relationships connecting indigenous peoples with other societies' governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations are not conducive to coordinated action that would avoid further injustice against indigenous peoples in the process of responding to climate change. The required qualities include, among others, consent, trust, accountability, and reciprocity. Indigenous traditions of climate change view the very topic of climate change as connected to these qualities, which are sometimes referred to as kin relationships. The entwinement of colonialism, capitalism, and industrialization failed to affirm or establish these qualities or kinship relationships across societies. While qualities like consent or reciprocity may be critical for taking coordinated action urgently and justly, they require a long time to establish or repair. A relational tipping point, in a certain respect, has already been crossed, before the ecological tipping point. The time it takes to address the passage of this relational tipping point may be too slow to generate the coordinated action to halt certain dangers related to climate change. While no possibilities for better futures should be left unconsidered, it's critical to center environmental justice in any analysis of whether it's too late to stop dangerous climate change.

AB  - Increases in wildfire activity in the western United States in recent years have led to significant property loss in wildland-urban interface areas, raising difficult questions for policymakers regarding mitigation of wildfire damages and how mitigation costs should be distributed. Yet in spite of increased attention to the distribution of environmental and climate-related risks across socioeconomic groups, and its relevance to current wildfire-related policy debates, the distributional incidence of wildfire hazard is not well understood. This paper fills this gap by combining property-level data on locations and values of residential properties, demographics, wildfire hazard, and historical wildfire perimeters. We find that there is substantial heterogeneity within high wildfire hazard areas, but that high wildfire hazard and impact from recent wildfires (2011-2018) have disproportionately been borne by high-income, white, and older residents, and by owners of high-value properties; properties in the tenth decile of market value by county are on average 70% more likely to be in high wildfire hazard areas than median value properties. However, because many high-value high wildfire hazard properties are concentrated in high density areas, most of the high wildfire hazard area in the western US is sparsely populated and comprises mainly relatively low-value properties.

AB  - More than 70% of the population in Ethiopia lack access to electricity and thus rely on conventional sources of energy such as biomass that is associated with negative consequences on health and the environment. Decentralized community-based micro-hydropower plants (MHPs) are being utilized as effective means to transition to modern low-carbon energy systems providing access to electricity to communities in remote areas. However, there exist a knowledge gap regarding energy justice dimensions and gendered impacts related to sustainable energy transitions in the Global South. This research investigates the gendered justice implications of low-carbon energy projects in the case of four community-based micro-hydropower projects in Ethiopia implemented by the German Development Cooperation (GIZ). Although the projects generally achieved positive outcomes for the lives of the villager's socio-economic impacts on income; productive use, health and education affected men and women differently. The particular energy needs, uses and challenges that women face were insufficiently addressed and hence are limiting the opportunities for women to benefit equally from access to electricity. Generally, procedural justice aspects such as access to information, consultation and participation seemed to be insufficient to create a sense of ownership which in turn can jeopardize the long-term sustainability of the hydropower plants.

AB  - Justice and fairness have become key considerations in sustainability pathways and nature-based solutions (NBS), following activists and critical scholars who have long argued that the urban environment is an inherently political space that requires an analysis of benefits and burdens associated with its existence, use, and access. However, what justice means and how it is expressed, recognized, or achieved is often implicit in the literature on NBS, even though underlying notions of justice shape the analysis done and actions proposed. This paper starts from the premise that justice knows many different interpretations, therefore warranting scholars and practitioners working on NBS to carefully consider the differences and frictions between competing meanings of justice. Drawing from the history of social and environmental justice theory, we give an account of some key justice dilemmas and discuss their tenets as it relates to the end, means, and participants in the making of justice. From this, we draw out questions and commitments academics and practitioners in the NBS space should grapple with more explicitly. We argue that the emergent tension between pragmatic policy approaches and critical theoretical engagement is hindering a version of NBS that goes beyond a reflection of the justice implications of NBS to ensuring that NBS contributes to the furthering of justice. We advocate for the inclusion of critical social sciences and humanities perspectives and approaches beyond tokenism to instead encourage ontological, epis-temological, and political reflection of the work academics and practitioners do in the NBS space.

AB  - This article situates pesticides as technologies marked by both continuities and discontinuities from previous modes of agrarian racism in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, a plantation region of the United States South. Attention to the historical-geographical specificity of pesticide intensification, I argue, provides the means to understand pesticide intensification as a mode of what I term agro-environmental racism. Anti-Black racism shaped the politics of pesticides, underpinning policies and material practices that were destructive of both the environment and human welfare in the Delta and beyond. The structures and ideologies of plantation racism helped position the Delta as one of the most pesticide-intensive sectors of U.S. agriculture during the mid-20th century-a particularly consequential period for both the intensification of pesticides and the formation of contemporary environmentalism. Pesticides were defended by agro-industrial interests as technologies supporting agricultural production-and particularly that of cotton, the most pesticide-intensive commodity crop. Simultaneously, they were figured as technologies crucial to a normative way of life. Although pesticides were articulated without explicit mention of race by the 1960s, I argue that the freedom struggle activism of the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union and Fannie Lou Hamer provide context necessary to explain the pesticide politics of the Delta's plantation bloc. These mobilizations to enact more just, sustainable, and livable geographies were an indictment of a plantation politics which put the health of cotton and profitability of plantations above all else.

We examined these perceptions to determine the extent to which Caucasians and Mexican Americans living in the Tucson, Arizona, metropolitan area differ in their perceptions of water quality-related risk, inequity, trust, and participation in civic activities. Ethnic variations in perceptions toward inequity, trust, and public participation were observed even when socioeconomic variation between Caucasians and Mexican Americans was controlled. However, significant ethnic variations in perceptions of water quality-related risks were observed only when socioeconomic variation was not controlled. Implications of these findings to environmental justice efforts in Mexican American communities are discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the context within which struggles for environmental justice are taking place in India. We explore the ways in which postcolonial patterns of government and governance in India affect the ends, the means and the representation of these struggles, focusing on three particular areas: state reform, the judiciary and public interest litigation, and environmental social movements. We argue that India differs from west in the ambitious yet incomplete and contradictory nature of government-sponsored intervention in the environment, and in the particular nature of its public sphere, both of which have been important in shaping struggles for environmental justice. Our wider intention is not merely to catalogue these differences, but to use the Indian material to raise questions about the emphases and implicit assumptions of western environmental justice literature, and reflect on how these may be need reconsideration when working in postcolonial contexts.

AB  - Landscape anthropology has explored relationships between peoples and places as well as culturally specific ways of experiencing and imagining the world that infuse these relationships. Departing from Kakipitatapitmok, the site of a direct-action blockade maintained at Grassy Narrows First Nation since 2002, I employ analytical frameworks inspired by the landscape genre to consider the physical and conceptual "place" of Anishinaabe anticlearcutting activism. I draw on the Grassy Narrows case to suggest that when considered from an emic perspective, the landscapes we encounter are very often politically constituted. As a distinctive new way of being and relating within their boreal forest homeland, anticlearcutting activism has transformed Kakipitatapitmok into a politically charged vantage point from which Grassy Narrows activists comprehend, configure, and communicate their place in the world. I advocate for an anthropological conception of landscape that can account for activists' experiences of environmental injustice and their ongoing efforts to overcome it.

However, the influence of exposure to particulate pollution on non-notifiable health outcomes such as individual-level restricted activity is less well understood. Days absent from work or school were collected for 2257 students and teachers at eight secondary schools in Christchurch, New Zealand. Mean levels of PM10 (PM less than 10 micrometers in diameter) for the study period were 42.7 mu g m(-3) at schools and 48.9 mu g m(-3) at a centrally located monitoring site. A significant (p < 0.05) association between PM10 and restricted activity days was found at schools for same-day and 1-day lags. The results presented in this paper suggest that there is a positive association between restricted activity and particulate matter air pollution even though the associations were not consistently statistically significant.

AB  - Populations of color and low-income communities are often disproportionately burdened by exposures to various environmental contaminants, including air pollution. Some air pollutants have carcinogenic properties that are particularly problematic in South Carolina (SC), a state that consistently has high rates of cancer mortality for all sites. The purpose of this study was to assess cancer risk disparities in SC by linking risk estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2005 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) with sociodemographic data from the 2000 US Census Bureau. Specifically, NATA risk data for varying risk categories were linked by tract ID and analyzed with sociodemographic variables from the 2000 census using R. The average change in cancer risk from all sources by sociodemographic variable was quantified using multiple linear regression models. Spatial methods were further employed using ArcGIS 10 to assess the distribution of all source risk and percent non-white at each census tract level. The relative risk (RR) estimates of the proportion of high cancer risk tracts (defined as the top 10% of cancer risk in SC) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated between the first and latter three quartiles defined by sociodemographic factors, while the variance in the percentage of high cancer risk between quartile groups was tested using Pearson's chi-square. The average total cancer risk for SC was 26.8 people/million (ppl/million). The risk from on-road sources was approximately 5.8 ppl/million, higher than the risk from major, area, and non-road sources (1.8, 2.6, and 1.3 ppl/million), respectively. Based on our findings, addressing on-road sources may decrease the disproportionate cancer risk burden among low-income populations and communities of color in SC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives. We assessed spatial disparities in the distribution of Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facilities in Charleston, SC. Methods. We used spatial methods and regression to assess burden disparities in the study area at the block and census-tract levels by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Results. Results revealed an inverse relationship between distance to TRI facilities and race/ethnicity and SES at the block and census-tract levels. Results of regression analyses showed a positive association between presence of TRI facilities and high percentage non-White and a negative association between number of TRI facilities and high SES. Conclusions. There are burden disparities in the distribution of TRI facilities in Charleston at the block and census-tract level by race/ethnicity and SES. Additional research is needed to understand cumulative risk in the region. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:1974-1980. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2012.300700)

AB  - Looking back from 2050, this article is written in the form of a fictional speech reflecting on the impressive progress made by 2050 towards achieving the global goal of zero net emissions. The speaker also highlights the severe and ongoing ecological damage and human suffering caused by the failure to reduce emissions with sufficient urgency in the first quarter of the 21st Century - and the ongoing challenge of implementing the actions required to bring global temperatures back below 1.5 degrees. The speech identifies the following key drivers of the 'great 21st century energy transition'. i) Sustained leadership from national and sub-national governments, business, civil society and the military in ratcheting up and accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement. ii) The escalating frequency and severity of catastrophic climatic events. iii) Disruptive, game changing technological innovation including in energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy storage and distribution, transport, construction and agriculture. iv) Disruptive, game changing innovation in social, economic and political institutions and relationships including: increasing recognition of the importance of reducing the global consumption of goods and services; an ongoing shift towards more distributed and collaborative economic paradigms and systems; growing popular and political support for the global climate justice movement; radical improvements in the transparency and accountability of democratic and governance processes; and the mobilization of millions of citizens driving transformational change in investment flows, electoral outcomes and political choices.

AB  - In Mediterranean-climate regions of California and southern Oregon, juvenile salmon depend on groundwater aquifers to sustain their tributary habitats through the dry summers. Along California's North Coast streams, private property regimes on land have created commons tragedies in groundwater and salmon fisheries, both classic examples of commons that are often governed collectively and sustainably by their users. Understanding the linkages between salmon and groundwater is one major focus of salmon recovery and climate change adaptation planning in central California and increasingly throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this paper, I use extended field interviews and participant-observation in field ecology campaigns and regulatory forums to explore how, in one water-scarce, salmon-bearing watershed on California's central coast, collaborators are synthesizing agency and landowner data on groundwater and salmon management. I focus on three projects undertaken by citizen scientists in collaboration with me and Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District staff: salmonid censuses, mapping of wet and dry stream reaches and well monitoring. I find that collaborative research initiated by local residents and agency personnel has, in some cases, created a new sense of ecological possibility in the region. I also consider some limitations of this collaborations, namely the lack of engagement with indigenous Pomo and Miwok tribal members, with the Confederated Tribes of Graton Rancheria and with farmworkers and other marginalized residents, and suggest strategies for deepening environmental justice commitments in future collaborative work.

AB  - In Brazil, one of the most pressing issues for environmental justice scholars (and movements) is unequal access to land. Over the past 20 years, people have mobilized collectively to demand both access to resources (distributional equity) and the right to participate in decisions over their distribution (procedural equity). In this article, I analyze the recent development of large-scale soybean production in the Brazilian cerrado. I argue that distributional inequities in the cerrado have been produced through a state-led process of development that favored large farms and modern, agro-industrial development. Popular discourse, however, fetishizes the efficiencies that accrue to large-scale agriculture, naturalizing the comparative advantage of wealthy farmers and erasing the importance of the state and geopolitical context for development in the region.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in large-scale land deals, often from public lands to the hands of foreign or domestic investors. Popularly referred to as a global land grab', new land acquisitions are drawing upon, restructuring and challenging the nature of both governance and government. In the Introduction to this special issue, we argue for an analysis of land deals that draws upon the insights of political ecology, cultural politics and agrarian studies to illuminate the micro-processes of transaction and expropriation as well as the broader structural forces at play. We argue that the state' is often invoked as a key player in land grabbing but states never operate with one voice; rather we need to unbundle the state, to see government and governance as processes, people and relationships. To develop this approach, we focus on territory, sovereignty, authority and subjects not as static objects but as relationships produced in and through place, property, power and production. Understanding the dynamic nature of these relationships is critical to understanding the highly variable form and content of large-scale land deals in different settings around the world. The papers in this special issue help to develop this perspective and this Introduction highlights important areas of convergence among them.

AB  - In environmental planning, decision making on land use for infrastructure increasingly causes conflicts, particularly with regard to contested waste facilities. Risk management and perceptions have become crucial. Empirical investigations of these conflicts brought clear advancement in the fields of environmental psychology, geography and risk research. However, in planning and policy design the dominant one-dimensional approach among planners remains, and the approach to address resistance to facility siting is not firmly founded in empirical evidence. Instead, it uses simplified assumptions about the motives of opponents, seeing residents as merely protecting their 'turf' and exclusively focusing on their own 'backyard'. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study on risk perceptions, based on a large-scale survey in six decision-making processes for different types of waste facilities. A scale is developed to measure the planners' perspective of the motives for opposition. The analysis shows that the crucial factors in perceived risk perceptions are not personality traits (e.g. selfishness, economic rationality) but perceived environmental injustice, fairness of the process, and personal commitment to others. Continual thinking in terms of 'backyard' motives disregards the socially motivated norms for equity, fairness, and commitment to others and may easily undermine co-operative behaviour.

AB  - Many environmental justice studies argue that firms choose to locate waste sites or polluting plants disproportionately in minority or poor communities. However, it is not uncommon for these studies to match site or plant location to contemporaneous socioeconomic characteristics instead of to characteristics at the time of siting. While this may provide important information on disproportionate impacts currently faced by these communities, it does not describe the relationship at the time of siting. Also, variables that are important to a plant's location decision - i.e., production and transportation costs - are often not included. Without controlling for such variables, it is difficult to evaluate the relative importance of socioeconomic characteristics in a firm's initial location decision. This paper examines the role of community socioeconomic characteristics at the time of siting in the location decisions of manufacturing plants while controlling for other location-relevant factors such as input costs. When plant location is matched to current socioeconomic characteristics, results are consistent with what the environmental justice literature predicts: race is significant and positively related to plant location, while income is significant and negatively related to plant location. When plant location is matched to socioeconomic characteristics at the time of siting, empirical results suggest that race is no longer significant, though income is still significant and negatively related to plant location. Poverty rates are sometimes significant but act as a deterrent to plant location. Variables traditionally considered in the firm location literature - such as land and labor costs, the quality of labor, and distance to rail - are significant. The presence of pre-existing TRI plants in a neighborhood and average plant size are also significant.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in high-level, decision-making arenas as a response to global policy challenges. Claiming to be transformative and pluralistic, NbS aim to resolve societal problems through a focus on nature, which is understood to be a benign ally. This uncritical framing of nature may have unintended and inequitable consequences that undermine the emancipatory potential of NbS. In this paper, we highlight the need to pay attention to epistemic and power dimensions that tend to be hidden in NbS. We assume that nature is neither passive nor external to human society, but is instead expressed in frames (reifying modes of expression) that reflect both knowledge and power in social encounters where NbS are used. Drawing upon five cases, we analyse how particular ways of framing nature express and reinforce the power relations that structure people's interactions. Each of the five cases relies on a nature-based frame to produce knowledge on climate adaptation, peacebuilding and justice. The analysis reveals how frames of nature are enacted in particular contexts, and how this conditions the potential for societal transformation towards sustainability and pluralistic knowledge. We demonstrate how frames of nature can constrain or enable opportunities for various groups to respond to environmental change. We discuss how the NbS paradigm might better incorporate diverse, situated knowledge and subjectivities, and conclude that this will require a more critical evaluation of NbS practice and research.

AB  - Our understanding of asthma epidemiology is growing increasingly complex. Asthma outcomes are clearly socially patterned, with asthma ranking as a leading cause of health disparities among minority and low socioeconomic groups. Yet, the increasing prevalence and marked disparities in asthma remain largely. unexplained by known risk factors. In the United States, asthma disproportionately affects nonwhite children living in urban areas and children living in poverty. Low socioeconomic status (SES), ethnic minority group status, and residence in an inner-city environment are closely intertwined in the United States, making it a challenge to fully disentangle the independent effects of each of these characteristics on asthma morbidity. In addition, studies show geographic variation in asthma outcomes across large cities and neighborhoods within cities that cannot be explained by economic factors alone. Although more limited data are available, studies in rural areas also suggest the stratification of risk based on SES and the proportion of minorities. Among low-SES areas, those with predominantly minority, segregated populations seem especially burdened. Marginalized populations of lower socioeconomic position are disproportionately exposed to irritants (eg, tobacco smoke), pollutants (eg, diesel-related particles), and indoor allergens (eg, cockroach and mouse allergen). Moreover, these marginalized individuals may also live in communities that are increasingly socially toxic, which, in turn, may be related to the increased experience of psychosocial stress that may influence asthma morbidity. Epidemiologic trends suggest that asthma may provide an excellent paradigm for understanding the role of community-level contextual factors in disease. Specifically, a multilevel approach that includes an ecological perspective may help to explain heterogeneities in asthma expression across socioeconomic and geographic boundaries that, to date, remain largely unexplained. Traditionally, asthma epidemiology has focused on individual-level risk factors and family factors. Far less attention has been given to the broader social context in which individuals live. A multilevel approach that explicitly recognizes the embedding of asthma within its biological, psycho-socioeconomic, environmental, and community contexts, is likely to provide a better understanding of asthma disparities at different stages in the life course. Is it simply asthma disparities or is it social disparities in asthma?

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the supply quality of parks and green spaces within the Third Ring Road area in Shenyang city by combining a landscape pattern index analysis with a principal component analysis. Moreover, a network analysis based on the ArcGIS platform was used to measure the accessibility of parks and green spaces. The research results showed that the overall supply quality of parks and green spaces (-9.55) must be improved. The supply quality levels of the four analyzed park types could be ranked as follows: garden parks (118.00) > community parks (73.67) > comprehensive parks (-16.64) > specific parks (-32.17). Among the analyzed recreation parks, the accessibility of daily recreation parks was poor, while the overall service efficiency of weekly recreation parks was better, except in a few regions. These research results can provide suggestions for future green space planning in Shenyang city. In addition, from the perspective of landscape patterns, studying the service quality of parks and green spaces can provide new ideas for further research on accessibility.

AB  - Limited accessibility measurements of park green spaces (PGSs) have given an account of multiple transportations when people enjoy the services. Considering the varying types and functions of PGSs, this study proposed a multi-mode method that is based on the traditional two-step floating catchment area method and relied on PGS classification to estimate spatial disparity between the supply of PGSs services and residents' demands in accessibility. Choosing the urban center of Wuhan as the study area, comparative analysis of space and statistics were conducted in accessibility between the traditional single-mode and the multi-mode methods. After a sensitive analysis of accessibility with varying travel time thresholds, underserved areas in the urban center were identified on a community level based on the PGS groups. Results indicated that the estimated accessibility average and standard deviation values by single-mode method were slimly higher than that of the multi-mode method. The average and standard deviation values of the accessibility among five time thresholds exhibited slight difference and an increasing trend. The further examination analysis of spatial accessibility in 25-min threshold demonstrated that accessibility presented spatial polarization and that most underserved areas distributed in the eastern and southwestern of the urban center in Wuhan. The findings may provide a more realistic estimation and further the knowledge of access to green spaces to help decision makers developing equal and effective planning policies and strategies.

AB  - Outdoor air pollution is a major killer worldwide and the fourth largest contributor to the burden of disease in China. China is the most populous country in the world and also has the largest number of air pollution deaths per year, yet the spatial resolution of existing national air pollution estimates for China is generally relatively low. We address this knowledge gap by developing and evaluating national empirical models for China incorporating land-use regression (LUR), satellite measurements, and universal kriging (UK). Land use, traffic and meteorological variables were included for model building. We tested the resulting models in several ways, including (1) comparing models developed using forward variable selection vs. partial least squares (PLS) variable reduction, (2) comparing models developed with and without satellite measurements, and with and without UK, and (3) 10-fold cross-validation (CV), Leave-One-Province-Out CV (LOPO-CV), and Leave-One-City-Out CV (LOCO-CV). Satellite data and kriging are complementary in making predictions more accurate: kriging improved the models in well-sampled areas; satellite data substantially improved performance at locations far away from monitors. Variable-selection models performed similarly to PLS models in 10-fold CV, but better in LOPO-CV. Our best models employed forward variable selection and UK, with 10-fold CV R-2 of 0.89 (for both 2014 and 2015) for PM2.5 and of 0.73 (year-2014) and 0.78 (year-2015) for NO2. Population-weighted concentrations during 2014-2015 decreased for PM2.5 (58.7 mu g/m(3) to 52.3 mu g/m(3)) and NO2 (29.6 mu g/m(3) to 26.8 mu g/m(3)). We produced the first high resolution national LUR models for annual-average concentrations in China. Models were applied on 1 km grid to support future research. In 2015, >80% of the Chinese population lived in areas that exceeded the Chinese national PM2.5 standard, 35 mu g/m(3). Results here will be publicly available and may be useful for epidemiology, risk assessment, and environmental justice research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is critical to understand how matters relating to water are reported, or ignored, among linguistically diverse media and to understand the possible influence this may have on the conception of water issues among ethnically diverse groups. This research analysed five daily newspapers published in Sydney between 2011 and 2012 in three languages (English, Chinese and Korean) and found that water issues were presented differently by newspapers across language divides in Sydney. These differences may contribute to diverse conceptual constructions of water problems and water management among ethnically diverse communities. After allowing for the influence of other variables, this research highlights the necessity to investigate media construction of water issues in various Non-English language publications as an important approach to improving situated and place-based water awareness in an ethnically diverse city.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study is to examine the claims that poor and nonwhite communities host a disproportionately large number of waste disposal facilities because these communities received less protection against waste disposal facilities than wealthier and predominantly white communities. Methods. This is a statistical study of the demographic characteristics of communities surrounding hazardous waste sites in metropolitan Texas. It compares ethnic and economic characteristics of these communities both at ''time of siting'' and during the 1990 Census. These results are statistically tested using chi-square and Cramer's V. Results. At ''time of siting'' there were statistically significant positive relationships between siting, poverty, and a predominantly white host population. For 1990 data poverty remained significant, but race did not, indicating a shifting ethnic composition. Low population density is proposed as an alternative explanation. Conclusions. These results emphasize the need for research on the historical characteristics of the communities surrounding locally unwanted land uses (LULUs) and the changes that occur in host communities after siting. By gaining an understanding of these broader issues, we will be better able to address the social, economic, and environmental issues associated with environmental justice.

AB  - Local communities and their opinion on shale gas exploitation (SGE) play an essential role in the implementation of energy policies, while little is known about the reasoning process underpinning the acceptance of SGE. The present study develops a conceptual framework to examine the psychological process of residents' acceptance of local SGE, in which the impacts of trust, knowledge, and fairness are mediated by risk and benefit perceptions. Structural equation modeling has been applied to analyze the hypothesized relationships based on a dataset of 825 households in China's largest shale gas field. Our results indicate that residents' perceived fairness and trust positively affect their benefit perceptions and negatively affect their risk perceptions, which results in positive influences on acceptance, and knowledge of SGE's environmental impacts positively affects perceived risks, which results in a negative influence on acceptance. Moreover, residents' acceptance is primarily determined by their benefit perception, followed by perceived fairness, and knowledge is the least important determinant. Thus, our study contributes to the literature by exploring the structural relationships between various psychological predictors and the acceptance toward SGE, and the results from our empirical survey provide insight into designing appropriate strategies in the process of generating and communicating shale policies.

AB  - North Carolina ranks as the 2nd largest hog producer in the United States. Currently, the state houses over 10 million hogs. It is estimated that about 19 million tons of hog waste was produced in 2004 by the 10 million hogs in the state (scorecard.com). Despite the increase in waste output due to increased production, concerns are that majority of these producers have not improved their waste management practices. Most importantly, all the big factories are located in counties in the Black Belt region of the state. These are counties where the percent Black population is greater than the state and national averages of 25.4% and 12% respectively. The existence of pollution, poverty, and minority populations in a given area, more often than not, raise questions about environmental justice. Statistical and geographical information systems (GIS) analyses are performed at the zip code level to whether relatively poor, nonwhite populations are disproportionately exposed to hog waste directly or indirectly. The results indicate that these populations are not directly targeted but their association with poverty and also being rural dwellers help explain their disproportionate exposure.

AB  - Large scale renewable energy developments, although seen as environmentally good, also have the potential to damage a community's well-being if the distribution of outcomes of the development, both good and bad, is unfair. Inequality in the distribution of benefits and costs, especially when some sections of a community benefit at the expense of others, can divide communities, damage relationships, and result in conflicts. In recent years, a considerable number of empirical studies examining the controversies over distributional inequalities in renewable energy practices have emerged. However, most of them have focused on the developed world; there has been little research in the context of the Global South, where large scale and rapid development of solar energy especially is anticipated to contribute to economic development and relieve energy poverty. This paper provides an empirical case study of 'Charanka Solar Park' in the Indian state of Gujarat. The objective is to qualitatively analyse the distributional concerns in the implementation of the large scale solar park, developed in a remote rural location. The research illustrates how the benefits of renewable energy development tend to accrue at regional and national level whilst local host communities bear adverse consequences. Distributional inequalities also occurred at the local scale in Charanka, where while the upper caste and economically better of sectors of the community were able to take opportunities, while vulnerable pastoralists and small farmers suffered the most from loss of land resources and associated livelihoods. Thus, the uneven distribution of benefits arising from the solar park development reinforced and deepened existing in-equalities. The paper concludes by discussing how distributional injustice in such developments might be ameliorated in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inequality in access to ecosystem services is inextricably linked with environmental justice in socially heterogeneous urban settings. Historically, San Antonio has been the gateway to Mexico and is strategically located along the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) corridor. It is also characterized by some of the most distinct residential segregation among US. cities. However, little is understood about the ways in which historically institutionalized residential segregation initiated by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) and NAFTA have affected socio-ecological outcomes. Here, this paper presents a novel empirical study of racial residential segregation. The study utilizes quantitative and spatially explicit estimates of regulating ecosystem services and biodiversity, and links the supply of ecosystem services to the distribution of human well-being within a heterogeneous social-ecological system. Specifically, the paper employed 1930s HOLC redlining maps and applied the ceteris paribus approach for racial concentrations to reflect a historical legacy and path dependence by institutional inertia. The results point to the social-ecological divide in that Hispanic and African American minorities derive fewer ecosystem benefits and face greater health risks and socio-economic disadvantages (p < 0.01). Notably, NAFTA corridor-related health risks are the most significant for the Hispanic population (p < 0.01). These patterns are likely to persist and may be amplified by 2050 (adjusted R-2 = 0.646). The findings highlight that institutional transformations are essential for the greater social-ecological equity in the San Antonio region under NAFTA and, potentially, new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Additionally, by assessing the EJ implications of spatially heterogeneous distribution of ecosystem services supply, the paper provides methodology that enhances science-based planning and better environmental decision-making to avoid or mitigate socialecological divides in rapidly urbanizing regions both in the U.S. and around the world.

AB  - Population exposure to multiple chemicals in air presents significant challenges for environmental public health. Air quality regulations distinguish criteria air pollutants (CAPs) (e.g., ozone, PM2.5) from hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)-187 chemicals which include carcinogens and others that are associated with respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and numerous other non-cancer health effects. Evidence of the public's cumulative exposure and the health effects of HAPs are quite limited. A multilevel model is used to assess differential exposure to HAP respiratory, neurological, and cancer hazards (2005) related to the Townsend Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (TSI), after adjustment for regional population size and economic activity, and local population density. We found significant positive associations between tract TSI and respiratory and cancer HAP exposure hazards, and smaller effects for neurological HAPs. Tracts in the top quintile of TSI have between 38%-60% higher HAP exposure than the bottom quintile; increasing population size from the bottom quintile to the top quintile modifies HAP exposure hazard related to TSI, increasing cancer HAP exposure hazard by 6% to 20% and increasing respiratory HAP exposure hazard by 12% to 27%. This study demonstrates the value of social epidemiological methods for analyzing differential exposure and advancing cumulative risk assessment.

AB  - Infrastructure intended to serve the public good frequently has implications for environmental justice and social sustainability. Drinking water supplies for sub/urban areas in North Carolina, USA, have regularly been secured by constructing dams to impound reservoirs. We used high-resolution, publicly available US Census data to explore whether 66 such reservoirs in North Carolina have induced demographic shifts in the communities that find themselves adjacent to the newly created lakeshores. Our principal findings include: (1) The ratio of white people to non-white people was significantly higher in communities within 0.5 miles of reservoir shorelines than in more distant communities; (2) even as North Carolina overall became less white from 1990 to 2010, the ratio of white people to non-white people within the 0.5 miles of the shoreline increased relative to the overall ratio in the State; and (3) similar, but less distinct, shifts in per capita income occurred during the period. Our results are consistent with the proposition that reservoirs have induced demographic shifts in communities adjacent to newly created lakeshores similar to the shifts associated with environmental gentrification and amenity migration, and may now be associated with perpetuating those shifts. These findings raise concerns about environmental justice and social sustainability that should be considered when planning and building infrastructure that creates environmental amenities. Where reservoirs are being planned, social costs, including the costs of demographic shifts associated with environmental gentrification or amenity migration, and disproportionate regulatory burdens, should be mitigated through innovative policy if possible.

AB  - Natural disasters can obstruct first responders when and where they are needed most. This analysis models the response of emergency service stations during flooding events in England to find major impacts on ambulance and fire services at a time of escalating flood risks to the country. Emergency responders must reach urgent cases within mandatory timeframes, regardless of weather conditions. However, flooding of transport networks can add critical minutes to travel times between dispatch and arrival. Here, we explicitly model the spatial coverage of all Ambulance Service and Fire and Rescue Service stations in England during flooding of varying severity under compliant response times. We show that even low-magnitude floods can lead to a reduction in national-level compliance with mandatory response times and this reduction can be even more dramatic in some urban agglomerations, making the effectiveness of the emergency response particularly sensitive to the expected impacts of future increases in extreme rainfall and flood risk. Underpinning this sensitivity are policies leading to the centralization of the Ambulance Service and the decentralization of the Fire and Rescue Service. The results provide opportunities to identify hotspots of vulnerability (such as care homes, sheltered accommodation, nurseries and schools) for optimizing the distribution of response stations and developing contingency plans for stranded sites.

AB  - Lodged in an impasse between questions of environmental justice and modes of capitalisation in the green economy, indeterminacy is a vulnerable and porous relation. Pollution activates a potentiality in the organism to be otherwise, to generate certain kinds of tumours, mini-deaths or mutations. Toxicity has an intermediary status that launches a mobility of effects that is often fragmented through sense organs, affirming forms of non-identity in biopolitical relations. Organisms are receptive to such bodily reconfigurations precisely because they are open to the material communication of the world. In contrast to the hidden labour of indeterminacy in capitalist modes of capture, this article crafts an analytics of indeterminacy as an interjection in the politics of environments. Through dispersants in the Gulf of Mexico and military bees, two economies of indeterminacy are discussed. Drawing on Georges Bataille's notion of political economy, I argue that what is required is an economy of radical inequivalence; an excessive engagement with the possibilities of indetermining forces to make fleeting marks.

AB  - In resisting climate change, to what extent can lifestyle forms of activism be considered to be political? What are their determinants and to what extent do they differ from the determinants of other forms of action? What role do generational factors play? Does the centrality of lifestyle changes for young participants translate into a disaffection towards more traditional forms of action? This article explores the forms of action adopted by participants in two Fridays For Future (FFF) strikes, focusing on the repertoires of action of (young) climate justice protesters. We draw on protest survey data covering the FFF demonstrations held in 15 European countries in March and September 2019. Starting from a sharp generational contrast between the importance given to individual lifestyle changes in addressing the climate emergency, we investigate whether this results in significant generational differences in the choice of the repertoires of action. Challenging the vision of young people as 'disaffected citizens', it is demonstrated that young protesters do not participate less in claim-based action than older cohorts. Furthermore, a process of politicisation can be seen to be unfolding that leads to increased commitment in both lifestyle and political forms of participation - at least among active milieus.

AB  - Interest has recently been focused on which populations are most at risk of premature mortality induced by air pollution, This coincides with greater concern about environmental justice. We analyzed total mortality in the four la largest US cities with daily measurements of particulate matter less than 10 mu m (PM10) and combined the results to determine whether race, sex, and education are potential modifiers of the effects of PM10,, on mortality. We computed daily counts of deaths stratified by sex, race, and education in each city and investigated their associations with PM10 in a Poisson regression model. We combined the results by using inverse variance weighted averages, We found evidence of effect modification by sex, with the slope in female deaths one third larger than in male deaths, whereas for social factors and race we found only weak evidence of effect modification, In general, the effect modification appeared modest compared with other reports of substantial effect modification by medical conditions.

AB  - Objectives. Our primary objective was to provide higher quality, more accessible science to address challenges of characterizing local-scale exposures and risks for enhanced community-based assessments and environmental decision-making. Methods. After identifying community needs, priority environmental issues, and current tools, we designed and populated the Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (C-FEAST) in collaboration with stakeholders, following a set of defined principles, and considered it in the context of environmental justice. Results. C-FEAST is a geographic information system and resource access Web tool under development for supporting multimedia community assessments. Community-level exposure and risk research is being conducted to address specific local issues through case studies. Conclusions. C-FERST can be applied to support environmental justice efforts. It incorporates research to develop community-level data and modeled estimates for priority environmental issues, and other relevant information identified by communities. Initial case studies are under way to refine and test the tool to expand its applicability and transferability. Opportunities exist for scientists to address the many research needs in characterizing local cumulative exposures and risks and for community partners to apply and refine C-FERST.

AB  - Objective measurement of the supply-demand of ecosystem services and sustainable ecosystem management has received increasing attention from the scientific community and the general public. This study explored changes in the supply-demand of ecosystem services and their natural and social driving mechanisms using spatial analysis methodologies as well as the relationship between the supply-demand of ecosystem services and environmental justice in coastal regions in China. In this study, the ecosystem service supply-demand index (ESSDI) was proposed based on the ecosystem services provision index and the land development index. Results indicated that although the imbalance in the supply-demand pattern of ecosystem services was serious, the spatial imbalance in the supply-demand pattern of ecosystem services improved from 2000 to 2015. Notwithstanding that the correlation coefficient between natural factors and ESSDI was higher, the development of the economy and the improvement of the quality of the population also had a substantial effect on ESSDI and the improvement of environmental quality. The spatial imbalance in ESSDI also caused serious environmental injustice as a result of differences in natural background, national policies, development gaps, trade, and industrial shifts. However, the implementation of some ecological compensation projects changed the spatial imbalance in ESSDI and relieved the environmental injustice. This research supports auxiliary decision-making for the sustainable management of regional ecosystems.

AB  - Over the last decade, the emerging trend in China to regard environmental justice as a separate and distinct body of law, from an objective perspective, has been facilitating ecological protection and the sustainable development of resources and energy. However, the current judicial approaches to environmental justice in China, compared with other countries, are yet to break away from the traditional judicial boundary. It is concluded that China should continue to deepen its environmental judicial reform in terms of cross-administrative division management, expert involvement, scope of authority and judicial philosophy, and also for this purpose, the paper advises to set up specialized environment courts.

AB  - Objective. We examine empirical evidence of region-based environmental injustice in China, and factors, especially environmental public service, that contribute to the distribution of environmental hazards among various Chinese regions. Methods. We use variance analysis to assess the disparate distribution of environmental hazards, and then employ the expanded Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model to identify the determinants, using a panel data set of 26 provincial capital cities and four municipalities directly under Chinese central government over the period 2003-2010. Results and Conclusions. Our findings confirm the presence of region-based environmental injustice in China and demonstrate its annual improvement. We also find that environmental public service, economic development level, population size, and environmental protection technology are major impact factors. These findings not only support the environmental Kuznets curve assumption, but also help to advance the existing literature on environmental justice and the human-environment relationship.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is critical for ecosystem health and biodiversity conservation, yet urbanization is increasing habitat fragmentation. Green corridors that connect isolated remnant habitat patches (e.g. parks) can increase connectivity and provide ecosystem services in cities. Vacant land, especially prevalent in shrinking cities, presents a unique opportunity to reconnect these landscapes. This paper provides a practical and replicable approach for assessing landscape connectivity patterns and identifying priority locations for green corridors. The methodology integrates social and ecological factors coupled with site-scale multifunctional greenway designs and is applied to the city of Detroit as a proof of concept. First, we use FRAGSTATS to evaluate structural landscape connectivity patterns at a census tract scale. A functional connectivity assessment based on graph theory and Conefor software is used to validate the results, which indicate that habitat is highly fragmented in Detroit. To identify opportunities to reduce this fragmentation, we use a least-cost path approach to map potential green corridors linking city parks through vacant parcels, alleys, and smaller green spaces, and prioritize these corridors using a gravity model and network analysis. To make the model more concrete and useful for decision-makers, we develop site-level multifunctional corridor design typologies. This study presents a novel approach to assessing urban connectivity and a multi-scalar, systematic methodology for planning urban green infrastructure networks that connects landscape ecology with practical planning and design considerations to maximize social and ecological functions.

AB  - Objective We investigate equity in the distribution of green schools, what kind of student populations they serve, and what kinds of communities host them. Methods Leveraging national school enrollment data (2000-2014), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design data, and communities' characteristics data from 2010 U.S. Census, we estimate logit models to examine the association between green schools and student and community demographics. Results Higher percentages of minorities in both student population and hosting neighborhood are associated with greater likelihood that new schools are green. New schools in more affluent and less educated communities are less likely to be green. Conclusion There is a lack of evidence for environmental injustice in students' and communities' access to new green schools in the United States. New schools serving lower-income and minority families and children are more likely to be green, although environmental justice indicators such as education show somewhat "unjust" patterns.

AB  - Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) is an important step in urban development. As one of the 'externalities of development', LAR conflicts have affected social stability and development in rural areas of China. With social conflict research shifting from value identity to resource allocation, few studies have examined the relationship between the spatial injustice of urban public resources and LAR conflict. To mitigate this research gap and formulate effective policies, this study aims to reinterpret the obstacles of LAR conflicts from the perspective of the spatial injustice of urban public facilities allocation in Hangzhou City by examining 195 administrative litigation cases. Spatial accessibility was used for estimating the spatial justice of urban public resources allocation. A classification and regression tree (CART) model was applied to identify the advantage and disadvantage factors behind LAR conflict, and explored the logical and structural relationships among these factors. Results showed that a spatial mismatch between the spatial behavior preferences of human activity and the spatial injustice of urban public resources allocation had significantly accelerated LAR conflicts. When the spatial behavior preferences of human activity and spatial distribution of urban public resources correspond to each other pre- and after LAR, basic rights to social space are safeguarded and various groups can equitably share spatial resources. There are no conflicts. Conversely, respondents expressed a high level of dissatisfaction in comparison to their pre-LAR conditions, and LAR conflict undeniably occurs. This approach also proposes some good LAR policies by regulating the spatial injustice of urban public resources allocation associated with LAR with the aim of long-term urban sustainable development for Hangzhou.

AB  - In many publications, Bryan Norton has proposed hierarchical systems theory to understand and manage complex environmental conservation and sustainability problems. In doing so, Norton drew from the decision science and planning theory literature to frame persistent environmental problems, ranging from Herbert Simon's un-programmed decisions to Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber's wicked problems. Norton pioneered the development of an adaptive management framework to guide a community and valued-based pragmatic and discursive approach for continually solving and re-solving the wicked environmental management problems. In this chapter, I highlight important ingredients of Norton's adaptive management framework and synthesize some of the key findings that resulted from applying some of the key elements of Norton's adaptive management framework in the field setting of addressing the "wicked" problem of tropical deforestation in Tanzania, Vietnam and Peru through a MacArthur Foundation funded project (2006-2011). The following specific problem formulation and valuation issues are explored in this chapter: space-time boundaries; identification of stakeholder values; weights on stakeholder values; and decision rule choice. We discovered that many wicked problems surrounding environmental management persist in the field settings due to the stakeholder power asymmetries, conflicting values, politics of scale across different space time horizons and institutional inertia. I propose that institutional designs and governance processes operating at different levels of the space-time hierarchy-ranging from a person's ambit to their community, city, state, country and planetary scales-must also be examined and addressed for adaptive management in social ecological systems.

AB  - Over the past decade, both the housing market and the subprime mortgage market in the United States experienced a rise and fall. To explore whether subprime lending has increased or decreased social inequality between subprime neighborhoods and nonsubprime neighborhoods, this article examines the relationship between subprime mortgages and housing price variations within the Philadelphia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), using a global, ordinary least squares (OLS) method and a local, geographically weighted regression (GWR) method. The results show that neighborhoods obtaining disproportionate numbers of subprime mortgages enjoyed lower housing price appreciation rates than other neighborhoods during the housing boom era but suffered higher housing price depreciation rates during the housing bust era, after controlling for other variables. The results also show that the association between housing price variations and explanatory variables differs across geographic submarkets. The empirical evidence draws some policy implications, such as rethinking the homeownership policy through expanding subprime lending, as well as promoting place-based housing policymaking. Combining OLS and GWR, this article improves the understanding of how subprime lending exacerbated social inequality at the neighborhood level.

AB  - Many cities are turning to greening efforts to increase resilience, but such efforts often favor privileged groups, thereby resulting in injustices. In this systematic review, we analyze 71 place-based studies of green infrastructure (GI) justice in cities worldwide. We draw from environmental justice scholarship, as well as climate and water justice literature to assess the state-of-the-art knowledge of urban GI justice. We examine the way GI is researched to improve our understanding of the types of injustices that exist in GI planning, siting, and implementation, providing rich insights into why injustices exist and pathways to address GI injustice. We find that research on GI justice in cities is growing and expanding its scope in terms of both the types of justice issues analyzed, and the groups of people excluded from the benefits of GI. We find that GI injustice stems from a history of unequal investment and non-participatory decision-making processes, where the unequal distribution of GI is only the "tip of the iceberg". To address GI injustice around distribution, cities would have to offset a decades-long lack of investment and inclusivity in decision-making processes. Pathways to achieve GI justice point to assessing unbalanced power structures, directing continuous funding to community engagement programs and greening efforts, leveraging existing infrastructure through the multifunctionality of GI, and dedicating funding mechanisms for safety and maintenance. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research is needed to integrate the different dimensions of GI that are tailored to the community on the ground, and to monitor progress toward justice.

AB  - The installation of the hydroelectric power plant Belo Monte in the Brazilian Amazon displaced more than 40,000 people, among them numerous riverine families who were not recognized as such. Their displacement resulted in the loss of their territory and the forced abandonment of their way of life. Struggling against their precarization and for recognition, affected riverine people founded a Riverine Council as a political body through which they organized themselves and reclaimed interpretative power over their 'being riverine'. Discovering the category of traditional people as a legal shell to introduce their epistemic and ontological perspectives, they tried to force the state and the construction consortium to recognize their rights, guarantee access to their territories and, hence, compensate for environmental injustices. This paper focuses on the epistemic dimension both within the installation of Belo Monte and within the resistance struggle of the riverine population. For this purpose, we use a decolonial framing of Agamben's (2002; 2005) perspective on the state of exception and the assignment of bare life that considers the epistemic character of the coloniality of power working within (see Mignolo 2005; Quijano 2009). This forms the basis for the occurrence of epistemic injustices (see Fricker 2007), which is discussed in connection with the environmental justice debate. In order to shed more light on the mechanisms of the production of disposable and bare lift and the possibilities of resistance within the struggle for epistemic justice, we finally add the idea of precarization and performative resistance (see Butler 2009; Butler and Athanasiou 2013).

AB  - The Knoxville Urban Wilderness (KUW) is a successful example of a growing global movement to utilize vacant urban land as many cities "de-urbanize". A key question is whether this particular kind of green space promotes social inequality via green gentrification. Our analysis shows how the KUW has affected nearby home prices. Socioeconomic data including income, educational attainment, and race is also presented to explore the possibility of gentrification in South Knoxville. Our findings do not support strong evidence of gentrification, which implies that lower-income households are benefiting from advances in environmental amenities. Other households in specific areas are benefiting from both increases in home values and from expansions of the KUW. These are encouraging results for urban planning efforts that seek to utilize large areas of vacant urban land while also having positive social and economic impacts.

AB  - The importance of equity has been emphasized in climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and ecosystem restoration. However, equity implications are rarely considered explicitly in restoration projects. Although the role of equity has been studied in the context of biodiversity conservation and environmental governance, environmental variables are often ignored in equity studies, and spatial analyses of equity are lacking. To address these gaps, we use a mixed methods approach, integrating spatially explicit ecological and social data to evaluate, through an equity lens, a restoration project in a semi-arid rangeland socioecological system in Kenya. We use questionnaires and semi-structured key informant interviews to explore four dimensions of equity: distributional, procedural, recognitional, and contextual. Our results show that restoration employment and distance to the restoration site strongly influence perceived distributional and procedural equity. Employment and distance to restoration site can interact in counterintuitive ways in their influence on aspects of perceived equity, in this case, the fairness of site selection. Our findings exemplify that equity dimensions are intimately linked, and trade-offs can occur between equity dimensions, across socio-temporal scales, and in choosing the ethical framework to apply. Our work demonstrates how restoration is influenced by different dimensions of equity and we opine that incorporating equity in project planning and implementation processes can improve restoration outcomes. We emphasize the importance of respecting plurality in the values systems and ethical frameworks that underlie what is considered equitable, while negotiating trade-offs between diverse ethical positions in the design and implementation of ecosystem restoration projects.

AB  - The Bear River is driven by a highly variable, snow-driven montane ecosystem and flows through a drought-prone arid region of the western United States. It traverses three states, is diverted to store water in an ecologically unique natural lake, Bear Lake, and empties into the Great Salt Lake at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (BRMBR). People in the Bear River Basin have come to anticipate droughts, building a legal, institutional, and engineered infrastructure to adapt to the watershed's hydrologic realities and historical legacies. Their ways of understanding linked vulnerabilities has led to what might appear as paradoxical outcomes: farmers with the most legally secure water rights are the most vulnerable to severe drought; managers at the federal Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge engage in wetland farming and make unlikely political alliances; and, increased agricultural irrigation efficiency in the Bear River Basin actually threatens the water supply of some wetlands. The rationality of locality is the key to understanding how people in the Bear River Basin have increased their adaptive capacity to droughts by recognizing their interdependencies. As the effects of climate change unfold, understanding social-ecological system linkages will be important for guiding future adaptations and enhancing resilience in ways that appropriately integrate localized ecosystem capacity and human needs.

AB  - The rapid transition to clean energy is fraught with potential inequities. As clean energy policies ramp up in scale and ambition, they confront challenging new questions: Who should pay for the transition? Who should live next to the industrial-scale wind and solar farms these policies promote? Will the new "green" economy be a fairer one, with more widespread opportunity, than the fossil fuel economy it is replacing? Who gets to decide what kinds of resources power our decarbonized world? In this article, we frame these challenges as part of an emerging agenda of "clean energy justice." Mapping this agenda highlights the equity challenges that will attend the transition to clean energy, and allows for more comprehensive, creative approaches to legal and policy solutions. A cleaner energy economy does not ineluctably translate into a more just economy. We identify four considerations that will be critical to ensure that clean energy does not entrench widening inequalities in wealth and power: (1) how to fund the transition; (2) who benefits from the upsides of the new clean energy economy, including green jobs and new technologies like rooftop solar panels; (3) who participates in decisions about the shape of the new clean energy economy; and (4) how and where new clean energy infrastructure is sited. Drawing from available data, we describe why there are real risks that the gains of clean energy might be unequally distributed, while the costs fall on rural communities and non-adopters of new technologies, thus exacerbating inequality while greening the grid. And through original empirical research, we highlight the challenges of full and equal participation in the esoteric, technocratic procedures of energy law. The present moment is a critical one for bringing these diverse considerations together into this overarching agenda. The U.S. energy system is in the early days of a long transition away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. It is time for energy lawmakers and energy law scholars to better anticipate the distributive and procedural justice concerns that will attend this transition, and to forge new ways to address them.

AB  - Resilience thinking - an approach for understanding and managing change - is increasingly central to climate change adaptation law and policy. Yet the influence of adaptation law and policy on the distribution of climate impacts is often overlooked in studies of socio-ecological resilience to climate change. This article demonstrates how environmental justice scholarship helps to address this gap in the literature relating to adaptation law and resilience. Drawing on existing literature, the article identifies four principles to promote resilience and justice through climate adaptation laws. Climate adaptation laws must (i) prepare for, and respond to, change; (ii) address the distributive effects of climate change and adaptation; (iii) promote participation in adaptation processes; and (iv) cross sectors and scales. Each criterion can be implemented in part through existing legal processes, but might also be further supported by incremental law reform. Developing both resilience and justice dimensions will enhance the effectiveness of adaptation laws in addressing climate impacts.

AB  - The city of Muskegon Heights, Michigan is a classic example of the inextricable link between environmental justice and brownfields. Muskegon Heights is a small, predominantly African-American city near the shores of Lake Michigan. The City had a thriving industrial job base from the early 1900's until the early 1970's, when many plants closed their doors and moved to the southern United States or other countries. The economic devastation caused by the City's high unemployment rate, the loss of high paying manufacturing jobs, and environmental degradation cannot be overestimated. Despite these significant obstacles, the City is deeply committed to urban revitalization. Muskegon Heights' brownfields program is a key part of this community-based revitalization process. A decades-old wastewater treatment plant caught a national spotlight in the United States through the efforts of the City. The City operated the plant from the 1920's until the early 1970's when it connected to a regional treatment system. The plant was then leased to a succession of hazardous waste treatment companies that used it to treat electroplating and oil wastes until 1990. The current corporate successor of the lessee, the Safety-Kleen Corporation, is in bankruptcy. The site has been unused for the last decade due to concerns about heavy metal and solvent contamination and cleanup liability. Instead of being discouraged by the regulatory and financial hurdles, the City has approached the project as an opportunity to create both needed housing and a prototype for other low-income, minority, urban communities that want to attract middle-income families back to their community. In 2001 this project was selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) as one of five national Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Brownfields pilots.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning is a scientific method of prioritising scarce resources to minimise the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. The approach aims to consider social, economic and political imperatives, and may be used by municipalities to designate their (predominantly) natural open space systems, in the form of a conservation plan. However, the multidimensional outcomes of implementing these conservation plans - in terms of both positive and negative ecological, social, and institutional dimensions - are rarely critically evaluated. We present a practical approach to assess the outcomes of implementing natural open space plans in urban areas, especially for the local (municipal) level where resource challenges may hinder assessment. The approach, drawn from comparisons of existing conservation assessment frameworks, considers the following outcome categories: ecological/natural; social/human; financial (institutional); and management (institutional). The approach is tested on a South African case study, and factors (challenges and opportunities) affecting the outcomes of implementing natural open space plans are identified. The results underscore how ecological outcomes are negatively affected by habitat transformation attributed to urbanisation and inappropriate land use management; and transgressions such as illegal, exploitive land uses. In respect of the social/human outcomes, collaborative partnerships with civil society, and the involvement of champions, are pivotal to implementation success. We found that financial and management institutional constraints contribute to inadequate investment in natural open space planning exacerbated by budget alignment to short and medium-term socio-economic and political priorities. The inter-dependence of the different outcomes emphasises the complexity of socialecological systems and the need for a holistic assessment. Understanding the factors affecting the outcomes of implementing natural open space plans allows local government to respond to the emerging knowledge of changing ecological and socio-economic conditions, facilitating the institutionalisation of adaptive management approaches, which appreciate the intertwined nature of social-ecological systems. This can, in turn, enhance decision-making processes, and advance conservation outcomes, ecosystem resilience and resulting flows of ecosystem services provided by nature, which are essential for human well-being.

AB  - Questions of equity, gender, power and rights are central to environmental justice in climate mitigation schemes such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation). Drawing on the ideas of co-benefits arid safeguards, the strategies for challenging mainstream discourse on gender in REDD+ - from the outside and within - are examined of two organisations that have attempted to bring a political concept - gender - into the largely technical discourse of climate policy. The analysis points to the risks of co-option that women's organisations face, trying to challenge and change the mainstream discourse on gender in climate policy-making. The need for diverse and flexible strategies for resistance and influence in order to seize opportunities that may arise in countering the depoliticising force of global climate governance are highlighted.

AB  - Racial discrimination by housing and lending institutions occurs worldwide. In the United States, it was legal and widely practiced well into the 1960s and has persisted in varying forms since. The Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) was one of many institutions engaging in racially discriminatory practices and created neighborhood appraisal maps in the 1930s based in part on race, ethnicity, and economic class of a neighborhood's residents. Using these HOLC neighborhood boundaries, we compared 12 present day population characteristics including health, employment, education, and income measures in each of the four HOLC neighborhood ratings across 14 U.S. cities. We used population-weighted logistic regression for paired data comparison and unsupervised learning techniques to uncover the consistency between HOLC evaluations and today's socio-economic and health outcomes. While existing literature focuses on case studies of particular cities and outcomes, we took a broad view and found consistent relationships over our study's cities and variables with few exceptions. Though there are many factors that contribute to continued inequality in a particular area, this study demonstrates that socio-economic and health inequality measured across numerous indicators continues to align with historic discriminatory housing boundaries.

AB  - There is growing recognition that "human development" frameworks, such as the Capabilities Approach (CA) with its emphasis on the promotion of justice, offer promise for guiding efforts aimed at enhancing mental wellbeing. This article explores challenges that might arise when there is a need to arbitrate among the competing demands of different parties in their efforts to enhance capabilities. Particular tensions can arise when the efforts of particular individuals to enhance their capabilities exert pressure on scarce resources, or threaten the safety and security of people living in precarious environmental contexts. Consideration is given to the need for "an ethos of restraint" to balance the consumption of resources aimed at facilitating human development on the one hand, with the need to promote environmental justice on the other. The paper highlights research that has investigated how environmental factors can impact on mental wellbeing, including rapid urbanization, climate change related issues (such as weather systems, drought, food insecurity and rising sea-levels), and access to "green/blue spaces". As such, the paper explores the important links that can exist between people and the ecosystems in which they live (including the way in which particular cultural beliefs and practices of indigenous groups can be tethered to the land). Elinor Ostrom's "design principles", derived from her work investigating the sustainable use of pooled resources, are presented as a helpful means of assisting members of communities to negotiate and apply "functioning constraints", which can promote environmental justice whilst not compromising efforts aimed at promoting mental wellbeing.

AB  - This article explores the potential for a more ordinary sense of urban environmental justice. While great progress has been made over the last 30 years in connecting environmental politics to the everyday concerns of urban residents, this article claims that the urbanization of environmentalism has produced a very narrow sense of what everyday forms of justice may be. Drawing on a Lefebvrian-inspired interpretation of everyday life, this article exposes a residual set of ordinary socio-ecological injustices that persist in urban space. While rarely addressed in either environmental politics or urban policy, this article claims that these expressions of ordinary injustice have a significant impact on the capabilities of disadvantaged urban communities to live out a full life. Drawing on the case of the Black Country Urban Forest in the English West Midlands - the largest urban woodland project in the UK - analysis considers how the spatial location and scalar constitution of the project appear to draw attention to the spaces of ordinary environmental neglect in cities. Further analysis shows, however, that the desire to address simultaneously questions of social and ecological injustice, which is typical in such large-scale urban greening initiatives, can actually compromise the ability of such schemes to resolve ordinary forms of urban injustice.

AB  - Since the introduction of neoclassical economic theory, material wealth and accumulation have been linked to hedonic wellbeing. In turn, Utilitarian notions have generated the belief that infinite growth is not only good but necessary for society to prosper. Unsurprisingly, this belief system has supported the considerable depletion of natural resources and has not always led to social equitability or environmental justice, two pillars of sustainable development. Given these limitations, this paper looks into eudaimonic wellbeing, as defined by Stoicism. The latter originating in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome, has been used throughout the centuries to discuss and support the flourishing of individuals, but has rarely been applied to collective wellbeing. Consequently, we explore whether, and to what extent, this virtue-based philosophy can answer questions regarding the value and the role of material acquisition in societal development, as directed by sustainable policy. We propose the idea that the Stoic emphasis on prudence, self-control, courage and justice, as the only means to achieve "happiness", is intrinsically linked to sustainable wellbeing and that its principles can be used to demonstrate that society does not require limitless growth to flourish.

AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings : In this study I investigate whether zoning has traditionally protected communities of color from the dangers of heavy commercial and industrial use to the extent that it has protected White communities. I evaluate whether upzonings-changes from less intensive uses to more intensive heavy commercial and industrial uses-disproportionately occurred in African-American and low-income neighborhoods in Durham (NC) from 1945 to 2014, and I evaluate the comparative impact of downzonings. I use the contemporary demographics of the census tracts where these rezonings occurred and qualitative evidence from public hearings, plans, and other relevant primary materials. I find that before 1985, the pattern of rezonings in Durham had negative implications for African-American areas in particular. Environmental justice efforts in the 1980s, followed by gentrification, caused the city's planners and local elected officials to change course. Takeaway for practice : Planners have an ethical obligation to promote equity, and their ability to do so depends on understanding sources of social injustice. In Durham, race historically played a role in upzonings and downzonings involving heavy commercial and industrial uses. The city also demonstrates that planners and local elected officials can successfully intervene to end disparities in zoning practice across communities of different racial characteristics. Assessing past zoning practices in other cities may reveal similar records of bias and help planners to present cases for corrective action.

AB  - The anthropocene is often discussed as an era of 'new' environmental changes that require unprecedented forms of societal adaptation, one example being climate-induced resettlement. Yet discussions of the anthropocene can also be better contextualized in terms of their featuring certain phenomena as 'new' that are really much more longstanding phenomena. For example, many Indigenous peoples have ancient traditions of environmental 'mobility.' This essay reviews some of the history of Indigenous philosophies, especially Anishinaabe, of mobility, migration, and resettlement. Often these philosophies focus on fluid and transformative relationships as constituting the fabric of resilient societies. Indigenous traditions of mobility are critically relevant for climate justice. They put into relief how colonial power can operate as a containment strategy that works to curtail mobility. In this way, looking at Indigenous mobility in the anthropocene involves unraveling layers of colonialism where containment has been widely imposed. This claim can be used to signal some of the dangers of centering the causal role of climate change in certain cases societal movement. To further support our claims, the essay concludes with a brief analysis of some of the literature and testimonies on resettlement in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.

AB  - Portrayals of the Anthropocene period are often dystopian or post-apocalyptic narratives of climate crises that will leave humans in horrific science-fiction scenarios. Such narratives can erase certain populations, such as Indigenous peoples, who approach climate change having already been through transformations of their societies induced by colonial violence. This essay discusses how some Indigenous perspectives on climate change can situate the present time as already dystopian. Instead of dread of an impending crisis, Indigenous approaches to climate change are motivated through dialogic narratives with descendants and ancestors. In some cases, these narratives are like science fiction in which Indigenous peoples work to empower their own protagonists to address contemporary challenges. Yet within literature on climate change and the Anthropocene, Indigenous peoples often get placed in historical categories designed by nonlndigenous persons, such as the Holocene. In some cases, these categories serve as the backdrop for allies' narratives that privilege themselves as the protagonists who will save Indigenous peoples from colonial violence and the climate crisis. I speculate that this tendency among allies could possibly be related to their sometimes denying that they are living in times their ancestors would have likely fantasized about. I will show how this denial threatens allies' capacities to build coalitions with Indigenous peoples. Inuit culture is based on the ice, the snow and the cold.... It is the speed and intensity in which change has occurred and continues to occur that is a big factor why we are having trouble with adapting to certain situations. Climate change is yet another rapid assault on our way of life. It cannot be separated from the first waves of changes and assaults at the very core of the human spirit that have come our way. Just as we are recognizing and understanding the first waves of change ... our environment and climate now gets threatened. Sheila Watt-Cloutier, interviewed by the Ottawa Citizen. (Robb, 2015) In North America many Indigenous traditions tell us that reality is more than just facts and figures collected so that humankind might widely use resources. Rather, to know "it"-reality-requires respect for the relationships and relatives that constitute the complex web of life. I call this Indigenous realism, and it entails that we, members of humankind, accept our inalienable responsibilities as members of the planet's complex life system, as well as our inalienable rights. (Wildcat, 2009, xi) Within Maori ontological and cosmological paradigms it is impossible to conceive of the present and the future as separate and distinct from the past, for the past is constitutive of the present and, as such, is inherently reconstituted within the future. (Stewart-Harawira, 2005, 42) In fact, incorporating time travel, alternate realities, parallel universes and multiverses, and alternative histories is a hallmark of Native storytelling tradition, while viewing time as pasts, presents, and futures that flow together like currents in a navigable stream is central to Native epistemologies.

AB  - Social movements move and grow by autopoesis-by calling their prospective ranks to order using public pronouncements replete with consequential assumptions about the world as they see it. In the same way, governing bodies and vested economic interests stake out opposing public positions. In the wake of the crucial international climate negotiations in Paris, December 2015, at which the nations adopted the first truly universal climate treaty, we look back over five years of participatory ethnographic research inside the UN climate talks and the social movements for climate justice, identifying key lifeworld assumptions inscribed in the public position-taking of central economic, public, and political sphere actors. Our findings include grounds for skepticism that UN climate policy can transcend the power of the fossil fuel companies to attenuate both international ambitions and national contributions to the universal effort, but also an exciting possibility that climate justice philosophy and tactics, aided by bold counter-spectacle techniques from the Occupy movement, might return to the stage in the coming years and lead the necessary deep culture shift that decarbonization will require.

AB  - Pushing back against an extractive approach to research to center relationships, this paper draws from ethnographic sensibilities and community vignettes to discuss what academic-activists and political scientists can learn from communities' situated bodies of knowledge. Tensions emerge when those most directly affected by public policy decisions are excluded from the decision-making process. Consultation leaves many encountering a paradox: their lived experiences are discredited even when they are invited to participate. This paper offers an imaginative approach to the design of participatory policy processes and asks: how can decision-makers meaningfully engage affected parties in pursuit of environmentally just policy creation? In response, this paper argues that bodies generally, and guts specifically, are political. To do so, I flesh out how a sensing policy approach to public engagement and socially engaged research can assist those crafting policies - including, laws, programs and service-delivery - to address contentious multilayered environmental justice issues. These include concerns for more-than-human life. Reflecting on experiences of community-engagement with Indigenous communities in Canada and HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, sensing policy builds from interpretive methods and intersectionality-based policy analysis to inform and potentially improve decision-making processes by taking seriously the experiences, knowledges and voices of those most affected by the government (in)decisions.

AB  - The Half-Earth proposal (or 'Nature Needs Half') was put forward as an answer to the current sixth mass extinction crisis on Earth and sparked a debate with disagreement on empirical and normative questions. In this paper I focus on the so far undertheorised normative debate and will provide some conditions that would need to be fulfilled in order for the Half-Earth proposal to serve justice. As I will illustrate, to even begin with situating the Half-Earth proposal within an account of justice rests on an extensive rebuilding of our understanding of justice and many dimensions of justice have to be addressed before it is possible to determine whether the proposal could be regarded as all-things-considered just. I will start by focusing on the question of what would constitute a just global distribution of habitat by introducing the conceptual framework of distributive ecological justice - i.e., the notion that also nonhuman beings can have justice claims to certain 'goods' - and put it into conversation with considerations of environmental justice between humans. The upshot is that if a range of empirical and normative conditions are fulfilled, then the proposal can embody a distributively just compromise between ecological and environmental justice.

AB  - The paper begins with a brief analysis of the concepts of environmental justice anal environmental racism and classism. The authors argue that pollution- and environment-related decision-making is prima facie wrong whenever it results in inequitable treatment of individuals on the basis of race or socio-economic status. The essay next surveys the history of the doctrine of free informed consent and argues that the consent of those affected is necessary for ensuring the fairness of decision-making for siting hazardous facilities. The paper also points out that equal opportunity to environmental protection and free informed consent are important rights. Finally, it presents a case study on the proposed uranium enrichment facility near Homer, Louisiana and argues that siting the plant would violate norms of distributive equity and free informed consent. It concludes that siting the facility is a case of environmental injustice and likely an example of environmental racism or classism.

AB  - This article examines the "climate gap" in the Southwest US (Arizona and New Mexico), referring to the "disproportionate and unequal implications of climate change and climate change mitigation" for "people of color and the poor" [Shonkoff, S. B., et al., 2011. The climate gap: environmental health and equity implications of climate change mitigation policies in California. Climatic Change, 109 (Suppl. 1), S485-S503]. The climate and poverty relationship is examined using multi-scaled analysis across three indicators of climate vulnerability, focusing on connections to health, food, and energy during the period 2010-2012. We provide an overview of climate-related social vulnerability in the Southwest based on available federal, state, and county-level census data. We then summarise the results from a stakeholder workshop and in-depth interviews about climate vulnerabilities with social service providers in southern Arizona. We identify a significant Southwest climate gap based on census data and interview findings about climate vulnerability especially relating to high levels of poverty, health disparities, and increasing costs for energy, water, and food. We find that grassroots and community organisations have mobilised to respond to climate and social vulnerability, yet resources for mitigation and adaptation are insufficient given the high level of need. Confronting a changing climate that is projected to be hotter, drier, and with the potential to reach new thresholds, we suggest that more research needs to be done to understand the social and spatial characteristics of climate risk and how low-income populations embody and experience climate risk, and adapt to a changing climate.

AB  - The term 'Just Transition' (JT) emerged from the 1970s North American labour movement to become a campaign for a planned energy transition that includes justice and fairness for workers. There is diversity in the JT narratives and ambitions that different actors put forward regarding its aims and strategies. This article critically reviews academic and grey literature on the JT in the Global North and South Africa to examine how labour, advocacy, private sector, and governmental actors frame and formulate the JT, and how narrative patterns across actors can signal transformative justice. Highlighting the JT's origins, we fill a gap in transition literature by reintroducing the labour perspective into an analysis of affirmative and transformative justice, and propose an original theoretical framework that unites scholarship in environmental and labour studies. JT proposals are examined through an analysis of the actors, approaches, and tensions across five key themes: depth & urgency, scale & scope, identity & inclusion, material equity, and participation & power. Finally, we synthesise trends in our findings in relation to prominent JT discourses in the literature - Green Growth, Green Keynesianism, Energy Democracy, and Green Revolution - and discuss the transformative potential of JT alliances and coalitions going into the future.

AB  - This article asks how we can develop a decolonial approach to researching climate justice, one which recognizes the agency of diverse populations, particularly those in the Arctic and the Mediterranean. This approach should inform the co-production of research, and current debates on climate justice.This article addresses the broader question of the special issue by reflecting on the coloniality of knowledge production in a context of global climate governance. Drawing on the rationale of the special issue, we highlight key dynamics in which knowledge shape climate policies and propose a decolonial approach at the nexus of academic knowledge production and policy formation by accounting for diverse ways of knowing climate justice. To this end, the article asks how to develop a decolonial approach to researching climate justice in order to identify the meaning-in-use of climate justice by affected people in what we describe as sensitive regions of the Arctic and the Mediterranean. To this end, the article develops a research design that accounts for diverse ways of knowing. The article proceeds as follows: first, we will discuss how diverse ways of knowing are related to global climate governance and climate justice; second, we outline our practice-based research framework that addresses research ethics, decolonial approaches and norm contestation; and third, we discuss how our approach can inform not only the co-production of research in climate governance, but also current debates on climate justice.

We found that their experiences tend to be different than those that are highlighted or warned about in the literature.

AB  - The Anacostia River severs Washington, D.C. Military waste, urban runoff, and former farmland dirty the water, but people who live along its shores cherish the river and fight to make it clean. Political ecology, stressing the power relations, inequalities, connections, and contradictions that join natural and social processes over time, enlarges historical and anthropological theory in Washington. In this article I explore the experiences and perspectives of people who have lived along the Anacostia River over the last 10,000 years. Linked transformations in environmental and social processes repeatedly created unsettled, contradictory, and unjust relations between people and the natural and built environment. The pollution of the Anacostia River reflects colonialism and conquest: nationalism, militarism, empire; racism, inequality, and urban renewal. I begin with the British conquest, then turn to four successive moments in state formation: the founding of the capital, the invention of a strong central government, urban renewal in the capital core, and the contemporary development of the waterfront. The use values of people who live along the river conflict with the exchange values that have dominated the city's history. The city's environmental justice movement has emerged from these use values and today confronts a massive redevelopment plan that exploits and undermines the movement.

AB  - This article focuses on the Fort Circle Parks of Washington, DC, and also provides examples from other cities to explore the histories, problems, and possibilities of urban parks. As public space, parks are crucial to community and identity. They provide important natural habitats and healthful environments, but they can also become toxic sites. Planners have tried to organize how they are used through how they are designed; then other people have used them in different, contested ways. Parks are sites of deeply rooted folk traditions, shifting ideologies, and corporate power. They attract loyal champions and volunteers, and engage fervent place-based activism. Parks express and exacerbate shifting inequalities in cities. In parks, people with power may slight and denigrate the poor, the problematic, and the aimless, and sometimes blame them for the parks' problems. But diverse people also come together there in startling, serendipitous ways. Parks tell stories about power, and about democracy.

There has been little consideration of the direct human dimension - the cost to and of environmental victims - except in clinical terms. In order to prevent and minimise environmental victimisation it seems outlines the personal, social and cash costs of environmental victimisation, using the psyche-social literature, and brief case studies of intellectual disability, road transport and cross-border pollution. It is proposed that governments and commerce might not respond in obvious ways to these cost arguments, but 'trust' is identified as a cost that both may recognise. It is concluded that the concept of loss-costs should be central to any analysis, and the paper provides a 'Framework for comprehensive argument of the costs of environmental victimisation', in the form of a simple matrix.

AB  - Purpose Environmental health disparities case studies are explored through a combination of lens including the naturome/nurturome, exposome [nature vs nurture] and multiple exposure-zone [place as predictor of health and wellbeing] concepts. This work places the educational program and experience within a theoretical framework using all these grounding theories. This provides an approach to experiential and transformative education in environmental equity/sustainability that we are calling transformative, trans-theoretical equity education, (TE2)-E-2. This paper aims to describe this model, its grounding theories and provide real-world examples of this model in action through PIEER. Design/methodology/approach The University of Northern Iowa's environmental equity internship, Panther Initiative for Environmental Equity and Resilience, PIEER, engages students on multiple levels to view sustainability from an equity perspective. The experience seeks to immerse the student in an understanding of equity while also having a tangible impact in the community. Systems analysis of issues, through formal systems thinking approaches, inculcating practices that allow students to work through difficult equity and social justice implications, high vs. low context communication and leadership styles are discussed. Findings Findings of the first evaluation of program impact indicate long-lasting benefits to this immersive experience. Findings of an evaluation survey of current and past PIEER interns (N = 30, n = 22/21; response similar to 0.73/72) indicate that participants consistently rank the experience in the upper 25th percentile of benefit for their personal growth in understanding equity and environmental issues. They also note that the experience has led them to be more likely to engage in behaviors supporting both social justice and environmental concerns. Research limitations/implications This evaluation consists of a small sample size which prevents the use of a mixed methods approach to evaluate the consistencies among the data. Practical implications If society is to truly achieve equitable sustainability, we must accomplish this through both transformative theory and transformative experiences. Social implications Providing both transformative theory and transformative experiences to students is an important foundational step in achieving equitable sustainability. Originality/value The University of Northern Iowa has a unique environmental equity internship which is training students to revision sustainability from an equity perspective.

AB  - Sexually violent predator (SVP) statutes define some sex offenders as dangerous enough to be segregated from society, but then require their release into local communities. This article examines how decision makers and community members interpret and respond to this inherent contradiction during disputes over SVP placements. The article departs from traditional moral panic explanations of reactions to sex offenders by linking literature on local siting conflicts to insights from legal mobilization studies in order to understand the origins and features of community opposition to sex offenders. Data from three case studies of SVP placements in California suggest that interpretations of what I call legal signals, or implicit messages embedded in state laws, produced these conflicts. The findings shed new light on the role of law in siting conflicts and collective action by explaining how state laws facilitate communities' exclusion from siting decisions, encourage local opposition, and disempower already marginalized communities.

AB  - Social scientists have entered the debate over the environmental inequities facing the poor in general, and communities of color in particular. Crucial to their empirical studies is the operational definition of "community" as a unit of analysis. Different operationalizations of community exist, leading to divergent conclusions about the extent of the problem. Earlier research concluded that inequities were national in scope, while later studies found little evidence to support the previous research. This paper examines three general ways in which community has been framed as a geographical unit of analysis in environmental justice research: (1) as a neighborhood (a place of cultural identity); (2) as part of a political jurisdiction (county, city, etc.); and (3) as approximated by data constructs (like zip code areas and census tracts). The paper discusses several theoretical and methodological issues involved in operationally defining an appropriate unit, or units, of analysis for research on environmental inequity.

AB  - The first wave of environmental justice literature tended to define environmental racism as the disparate siting of toxic waste facilities in low-income areas and communities of colour. More recently, environmental justice scholars have turned to a critical environmental justice framework to explore questions of spatial equity in relation to movements like Black Lives Matter. It is increasingly clear that the state, the built environment, economic development, and race converge in communities who face increased surveillance, divestment, and gentrification. Using Hyde Park on the South Side of Chicago as a case study, I draw on qualitative and historical methods to interrogate dominant narratives surrounding policing in urban environments. This paper highlights how Black geographies, as an analytic, highlight the intersection of police brutality and the built environment in Hyde Park. Legacies of urban renewal, now framed as neighbourhood revitalisation, and narratives around criminality and race all influence community police relations in the area. As the University of Chicago expands, so does its police force, and so do conflicts over who can use public spaces and how these spaces are used. I argue that institutions like the University of Chicago rely on the police to racially manage and expand their built environment. I also look to Black Lives Matter as a way to understand police brutality as enmeshed with toxic ecologies. This pairing of activism, ecology and policing allows a more nuanced analysis of the racialised underpinnings of the built environment.

AB  - Safety is an important dimension of access to green space. When parks are perceived as unsafe, people are unlikely to derive the health and community benefits from them. In this study, we examine inequities in green space access in five medium-to-large US cities using parcel-level, network-based analysis. We quantify access using three measures: proximity, congestion-weighted acreage, and crime-constrained proximity. We find that, in the five US cities studied, there is a striking lack of access to safe parks. In addition, inequalities between socioeconomic subgroups are substantially exacerbated when considering access to safe parks, with racial/ethnic minorities and low-income communities fairly consistently worse off. The results suggest that interventions to improve park safety could result in large and immediate improvements for access and environmental justice. However, even once these inequalities are addressed, there remains significant work to provide all residents with sufficient and proximal access to green space and the wide array of benefits that it has to offer.

AB  - Singapore in the 1950s was a deeply divided society. Struggling to recover from the hardships of the Second World War and fighting an internal battle that the British government termed an 'emergency', it was a time of hardship, tension, and anxiety. In the midst of this crisis, Singapore's inhabitants continued to manage the natural elements of their climate and environment, especially the dangerous combination of heavy monsoonal rains, low-lying marshland, and tidal flooding. This article examines the circumstances surrounding a particularly severe episode of flooding that occurred in December 1954. It explores how the flood's impact was exacerbated by human exigencies, especially recent government resettlement plans and infrastructural weaknesses. In line with the themes of this special issue, it explores the notion of 'justice' during a disaster. In this case, justice was intimately related to political agency, social vulnerability and resilience. Viewed in this way, the flood story can be used as a lens into the wider socio-political contexts of the time.

AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings:Historical patterns of discrimination and disinvestment have shaped the current landscape of vulnerability to heat in U.S. cities but are not explicitly considered by heat mitigation planning efforts. Drawing upon the equity planning framework and developing a broader conceptualization of what equity means can enhance urban heat management. Here I ask whether areas in Baltimore (MD), Dallas (TX), and Kansas City (MO) targeted for disinvestment in the past through practices like redlining are now more exposed to heat. I compare estimates of land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery across the four-category rating system used to guide lending practices in cities around the United States, summarize the demographic characteristics of current residents within each of these historical designations using U.S. Census data, and discuss the connection between systematic disinvestment and exposure to heat. LST and air temperatures are not equivalent, which makes it difficult to reconcile existing research on the human health impacts of heat exposure that rely on a sparse network of air temperature monitoring stations with more granular LST data. Areas of these cities that were targeted for systematic disinvestment in the past have higher mean land surface temperatures than those that received more favorable ratings. Poor and minority residents are also overrepresented in formerly redlined areas in each of the three study cities. Takeaway for practice:By examining areas that have experienced sustained disinvestment, cities may be able to more quickly narrow the focus of heat mitigation planning efforts while furthering social equity. Efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of rising temperatures in U.S. cities must be tailored to the local climate, built environment, and sociodemographic history. Finally, geospatial data sets that document historical policies are useful for centering and redressing current inequalities when viewed through an equity planning lens.

AB  - The intersection between gender and climate change action has received little scholarly attention. To facilitate a critical orientation towards the informal economies of social reproduction, the ways that the UK's climate politics are rooted in masculinist discourses of a green economy are illustrated. Adopting an intersectional approach, it is argued that such a green economy perspective diverts attention from labouring bodies in climate politics, invisibilising the 'who' in the experience of climate solutions. Through critically engaging divisions of labour in climate policy, evidenced through a feminist critical discourse analysis, it is shown how a surface-level inclusion of gender perpetuates the labouring bodies associated with specific labour markets. In response, it is suggested that an intersectional approach to climate policy can account for these omissions and highlights the ways in which a more just, intersectional climate politics might be formulated.

AB  - There exist few examples of functioning water co-governance systems where Indigenous and settler colonial governments work together to share authority for water on a nation-to-nation basis. In this paper I examine the multiple barriers to achieving water co-governance, highlighted by a multidimensional framework including distributional, procedural and recognitional (in)justices. I apply this framework to a case study in the Yukon, Canada, which is based on research conducted in partnership with four out of fourteen Yukon First Nations (Carcross/Tagish, Kluane, Tr'onclek Hwech'in and White River First Nations); all are in areas where the water governance system is shaped by Indigenous water rights and authorities that are acknowledged in modern land claim and self-government agreements. Despite the many substantive and positive changes resulting from the explicit acknowledgement of Yukon First Nation water rights, I find that this system falls short of achieving co-governance. In particular, Yukon First Nations critiques highlight the limitations imposed by the continued assertion of 'Crown' jurisdiction over water and by the marginalisation of Indigenous legal orders that follows from the privileging of settler worldviews and forms of governance. Thus, co-governance arrangements depend not only on the distributional justice of shared jurisdiction; Indigenous legal orders and relationships to water must also be reflected in the procedural and recognitional justices of the decision-making processes and institutions that are developed.

AB  - The recent growth and restructuring of the swine industry in the state of Mississippi has raised various environmental and socioeconomic concerns. We spatially examined the location and attributes of 67 industrial hug operations to determine if African American and low-income communities have a high prevalence of industrial hog operations located near their neighborhoods at the census block group level. We used spatial data and cross-classification analysis to compare the prevalence of industrial hog operations in neighborhoods that are primarily African American and low income with the prevalence in neighborhoods that are African American and affluent. We also used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between the environmental justice variables and the location of the industrial hog operations. The block group characterization showed a high prevalence of hog operations in the four highest quintiles compared with the lowest quintile for percentage African American and percentage poverty. At increasing levels of percentage African Americans and percentage of persons in poverty, there are 2.4-3.6 times more operations compared with the referent group; additionally, scale adjustment to only the hog counties reduces this to 1.8-3.1 more operations compared with the referent group, The inequitable distribution of hog-confined agricultural feeding operations in these communities may have adverse environmental impacts associated with industrial hug production, such as increased health risks and quality of life degradation, as have occurred in other areas having similar facilities.

AB  - Purpose - This chapter examines the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of international businesses to combat commercial and governmental corruption. The focus is on multinational enterprises (MNEs) as key business actors globally. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology of the chapter is a combination of literature review, summary of international anticorruption accords, and analysis of available data sources. The literature review is not a systematic survey of academic literature but rather citation of key works bearing on the chapter's purpose. Greater emphasis rests on anticorruption accords and data sources to provide practical guidance to business managers and public officials. Findings - Corruption is global and ubiquitous although varying markedly by country and industry. Corruption occurs in multiple forms such as bribery, entertainment, extortion, facilitating payments, favors, gifts, gratuities, and travel. International anticorruption accords now constitute a formal global norm against bribery and extortion in commercial or governmental transactions. Economic and political costs of corruption are high. Active national enforcement is gradually increasing. Practical implications - The needed corporate policy is not to pay bribes, large or small, in any form for any reason. Such policy will in future extend to prohibit even minor facilitating payments. Businesses should define and enforce broadly applied anticorruption norms. The chapter cites key examples of prosecutions and anticorruption efforts. Originality/value of chapter - This chapter marshals available information from literature, anticorruption accords, and corruption data sources. The chapter is intended to be a useful guide for business managers and public officials.

AB  - Rapid growth and the concentration of hog production in North Carolina have raised concerns of a disproportionate impact of pollution and offensive odors on poor and nonwhite communities. We analyzed the location and characteristics of 2,514 intensive hog operations in relation to racial, economic, and water source characteristics of census block groups, neighborhoods with an average of approximately 500 households each. We used Poisson regression to evaluate the extent to which relationships between environmental justice variables and the number of hog operations persisted after consideration of population density. There are 18.9 times as many hog operations in the highest quintile of poverty as compared to the lowest; however, adjustment for population density reduces the excess to 7.2. Hog operations are approximately 5 times as common in the highest three quintiles of the percentage nonwhite population as compared to the lowest, adjusted for population density. The excess of hog operations is greatest in areas with both high poverty and high percentage nonwhites. Operations run by corporate integrators are more concentrated in poor and nonwhite areas than are operations run by independent growers. Most hog operations, which use waste pits that can contaminate groundwater, are located in areas with high dependence on well water for drinking. Disproportionate impacts of intensive hog production on people of color and on the poor may impede improvements in economic and environmental conditions that are needed to address public health in areas which have high disease rates and low access to medical care as compared to other areas of the state.

AB  - The environmental justice movement has stimulated community-driven research about the living and working conditions of people of color and low-income communities. We describe an epidemiological study designed to link research with community education and organizing for social justice. In eastern North Carolina, high-density industrial swine production occurs in communities of low-income people and people of color. We investigated relationships between the resulting pollution and the health and quality of life of the hog operations' neighbors. A repeat-measures longitudinal design, community involvement in data collection, and integration of qualitative and quantitative research methods helped promote data quality while providing opportunities for community education and organizing. Research could affect policy through its findings and its mobilization of communities.

AB  - The idea of dignity is often taken to be a foundation for principles of justice and democracy. In the West it has numerous formulations and conceptualisations. Within the capabilities approach to justice theorists have expanded the concept of dignity to encompass animals and ecological communities. In this article I rework the idea of dignity to include the Maori philosophical concepts of mauri, tapu and mana - something I argue is necessary if the capabilities approach is to decolonise in the Aotearoa context. Furthermore, the article links the nation's recognition of three extensive geographical regions - Te Awa Tupua, Te Urewera and Mt Taranaki - as legal persons to Matauranga Maori and nonhuman dignity. In doing so, I identify the potential that this understanding of dignity and these legal moves have to decolonise democracy within the settler state.

AB  - The idea of time is critical to intergenerational environmental justice (IEJ). Focusing on time as discrete instantiations on a forward projection limits the capacity of IEJ to theorise justice for future generations. Framed by this understanding of time, IEJ then excludes peoples for whom time is spirally bound and for whom nonhuman and human are entangled within the spheres of justice. In a contribution towards decolonising IEJ theory, drawing on Maori ontology of time, IEJ is theorised as integral to being, rather than as an act of sacrifice or beneficence.

AB  - The value of urban green space for environmental education fieldwork is empirically investigated in a study among all secondary schools in Amsterdam. The article describes how the proximity of schools to green spaces emerges as a new factor in the sustainable city' and the compact city' debate. For fieldwork excursions proximity to green spaces is crucial for establishing a pattern of outdoor environmental education. Once established, it shapes teachers' attitudes on excursions. A linear structural path analysis reveals how this in turn results in more fieldwork excursions to other destinations. Interviews with teachers show how this can be interpreted mainly as a result from iterative positive experiences with excursions close to the school, which are triggered by the availability of nearby green space. Remarkably, beside the effects of green spaces for well-being and health, the significance of green space for environmental education of children remained under-investigated. This argument came prominently to the fore in a case of urban densification within the framework of compact city policies. In the dispute about the elimination of green space, citizens claimed a high educational value would vanish, but they felt this value was not recognized in the decision-making process.

AB  - The compact city is advocated as a key strategy to establish sustainable cities. Compact city policy implies urban densification, sometimes with elimination of green space. Citizen's valuable arguments in urban densification developments in green space are easily ignored, as is explored in a case study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Place making decisions are more often legitimized with sustainability claims, and arguments from less convinced residents are denied or remain unexamined. About green space these also concern environmental qualities significant for long term sustainability of cities. This is illustrated by presenting empirical evidence about environmental education, an argument emerging from the explorative study. Environmental education should be seen as an important element in longterm sustainability, but the educational relevance of proximity of green space to schools had remained unknown. Empirical evidence of the negative effect of larger distances to green space on environmental education is presented in a geographical survey. The results suggest that close proximity to urban green space also reinforces fieldwork activities further away. As the validity of this argument was denied in the case study, this illustrates the need to establish frameworks that foster recognition and learning in open processes in urban densification.

AB  - Recently, location data regarding the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) in South Korea was released to the public. This study investigated the spatial patterns of TRIs and releases of toxic substances in all 230 local governments in South Korea to determine whether spatial clusters relevant to the siting of noxious facilities occur. In addition, we employed spatial regression modeling to determine whether the number of TRI facilities and the volume of toxic releases in a given community were correlated with the community's socioeconomic, racial, political, and land use characteristics. We found that the TRI facilities and their toxic releases were disproportionately distributed with clustered spatial patterning. Spatial regression modeling indicated that jurisdictions with smaller percentages of minorities, stronger political activity, less industrial land use, and more commercial land use had smaller numbers of toxic releases, as well as smaller numbers of TRI facilities. However, the economic status of the community did not affect the siting of hazardous facilities. These results indicate that the siting of TRI facilities in Korea is more affected by sociopolitical factors than by economic status. Racial issues are thus crucial for consideration in environmental justice as the population of Korea becomes more racially and ethnically diverse.

AB  - The various benefits of urban green space are gaining increasing attention nowadays. Hence, the distribution of green space has become a scrutinized concern for spatial equity among local governments and the planning scholars. This study is the first quantitative evaluation of urban park accessibility using house-level data in urban China, from the perspective of social equity. We chose Nanjing as the empirical case and examined 2709 real estate units and 79 parks within the city. Accessibility is measured by the 10-min walking distance from homes to the adjacent urban parks. Using the Street Network Analysis model in ArcGIS and the statistical methods in SPSS, the result shows that 60.5% of the real estates in Nanjing are located within a 10-min walk to access urban parks. However, this accessibility is positively correlated with housing prices, and negatively correlated with the age of the buildings, holding all other factors constant. While affluent homeowners capture a high-quality green amenity, newly-built low-income communities, where most residents are classified as a vulnerable population, have the lowest percentage of accessible green space. This study reveals the existing spatial disparities of urban park accessibility among different socio-economic groups in Nanjing, China. Additionally, we found that urban redevelopment projects with greening and the large-scale affordable housing construction are pricing out the urban poor and rural immigrants from the inner city to the urban peripheral areas. This will reduce the accessibility to urban parks and other public service facilities among the lower income families, and exacerbate the inequality among the rich and the poor in terms of their quality of life. Main findings of this study can inform policy decisions regarding equitable park provision in the construction of the green city and the sustainable development in urban China and other developing countries.

AB  - The significant growth in freight traffic and relevant crashes has aroused increasing concerns about road safety threats in local communities. We use data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area and examine the spatial relationship between freight-related crashes and neighborhoods with low-income and minority populations. We find that both household income and percentage of minority population are significantly correlated with the density of both freight-related crashes and freight-related crashes causing severe injuries and fatalities. The results indicate that freight-related crashes are subject to a spatial inequity problem. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating freight-related safety improvement within these low-income and minority neighborhoods.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as the "fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." The last decade has focused considerable national attention on the environmental pollution inequity that persists among the nation's poorest communities. Despite these environmental justice efforts, poor communities continue to face adverse environmental conditions. For the more than 550 Native American communities, the struggle to attain environmental justice is more than a matter of enforcing national laws equitably; it is also a matter of a federal trust duty for the protection of Indian lands and natural resources, honoring a promise that Native American homelands would forever be sustainable. Equally important is the federal promise to assist tribes in managing their reservation environments under their reserved powers of self-government, an attribute that most distinguishes tribes from other communities. The PM Northwest, Inc. (PMNW) dumpsite is located within the boundaries of the Swinomish Indian Reservation in Washington State. Between approximately 1958 and 1970, PMNW contracted with local oil refineries to dispose of hazardous wastes from their operations at the reservation dumpsite. Almost two decades would pass before the Swinomish tribe was able to persuade EPA that a cleanup action under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) was warranted. This article reviews the enduring struggle to achieve Indian environmental justice in the Swinomish homeland, a process that was dependent upon the development of the tribe's political and environmental management capacity as well as EPA's eventual acknowledgement that Indian environmental justice is integrally linked to its federal trust responsibility.

AB  - The purpose of this integrative review is to examine recent literature on the intersection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 novel coronavirus) and climate change that will lead to a greater understanding of the complexities of the urgent pandemic linked with the emerging climate crisis. A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations' views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century.

AB  - This article is based on activist research conducted alongside Extinction Rebellion Netherlands. By taking a pedagogical approach to social movements, it posits that Extinction Rebellion Netherlands is simultaneously bound up in the reproduction of and resistance to dominant ways of knowing and being. It discusses how 'pedagogies of urgency' reproduce the learning of hegemonic forms of life associated with modernity/coloniality. Treating the movement's margins as a privileged space of epistemological possibility, it examines how the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted who is 'heard, seen and rendered knowing' [Motta & Esteves. (2014). Reinventing emancipation in the 21st century: The pedagogical practices of social movements. Interface, 6(1), 1-24, p. 5)]. This has facilitated the unlearning of pedagogies of urgency, and the learning of new relationships, subjectivities and knowledges that centre justice, prefiguration, and building relations across difference. Nevertheless, the pandemic also underscores some of the impossibilities for learning and dialogue inherent in the exclusions and violence at the heart of modern/colonial power relations.

AB  - The limited effectiveness of Environmental Education (EE) in promoting conceptual and behavioral change preoccupies scholars and activists alike. A central process in this field is that of privatization, which takes place through integrating external programs in school curricula. The present article discusses the implications of this process on the effectiveness of EE in accomplishing its goals, in particular the promotion of environmental justice agenda, which is considered a major target of EE. This question is examined from the viewpoint of educational workers who are in charge of EE at elementary public schools in Israel. Taking these workers as active social agents, we proceed from the view that the way they understand their field of action and their own place in it does not only reflect the situation in this field but actually plays a role in shaping it. Research is based on in-depth interviews with three groups of educational staff: EE teachers, SPNI (The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel) external instructors, and school principals. Analysis points at impaired occupational self-images, struggles over symbolic resources and weak esprit de corps. All this reflect - and accelerate - the field's severe structural ambiguity and devaluation, to the point that it works against its own basic moral principles.

AB  - This article defends the idea of applying principles of corrective justice to the matter of climate change. In particular, it argues against the excusable ignorance objection, which holds that historical emissions produced at a time when our knowledge of climate change was insufficient ought to be removed from the equation when applying rectificatory principles to this context. In constructing my argument, I rely on a particular interpretation of rectificatory justice and outcome responsibility. I also address the individualism objection by showing why we should view states as relevant agents of climate change. This argument is built on the assumption that states are institutions set up to coordinate and regulate human interaction, so as to protect their citizens from the unwanted consequences of such interaction.

AB  - The Gran Chaco, Latin America's second largest forest after the Amazon, has one of the highest deforestation rates worldwide. In the province of Salta, Argentina, the deforestation rate is particularly high, with substantial environmental and social impacts. The province is characterized by the presence of various actors (large-scale producers, small-scale farmers, indigenous peoples, governmental actors, civil society), who are differently exposed to the impacts of deforestation. To better understand this unequal exposure, the paper looks at deforestation from a perspective of environmental justice. As justice is strongly dependent on the local context, we focus on capturing the perceptions of stakeholders on deforestation. We use Q-method, which combines qualitative and quantitative methods to study perceptions. Our results point to the existence of three significant perspectives. The first one, labelled "Development" perspective ranks distribution as the most important dimension. The second one labelled "Family agriculture" perspective stresses the significance of procedural issues. The third one labelled "Subsistence" perspective elaborates mainly on matters of recognition. We conclude that, in order to slow down deforestation, it would be essential to create conditions where marginalized actors are given priority, to facilitate their participation and grant their rights with respect to land use.

AB  - The increase in deforestation in Latin America is generating a great number of land-use conflicts. Diverse stakeholders, such as large-scale producers, indigenous people and small-scale famers, compete for land and contest its use. We applied the methodological framework of social multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) as it addresses one of the main problems confronted in land-use planning: the conflicting perceptions on what a land-use plan should achieve and how. The paper presents a SMCE of different land-use scenarios in the Argentinean Chaco, using two sets of criteria: one reflecting issues of sustainability and one tackling environmental justice. We found that the scenario envisioned by indigenous people is the most sustainable as well as environmentally just, followed by the family agriculture scenario. The findings further point to the strongly negative impact of the development scenario as well as the business as usual scenario. The results also suggest that the two sets of criteria complement each other. In the sustainability approach inequality is often only tackled through one criterion looking at distributional aspects, whereas environmental justice also accounts for issues of recognition and procedure. In a world, which is increasingly unequal, it is more important than ever to account for justice. Overall, the SMCE allows displaying the high environmental, social, cultural and economic costs of deforestation in the Argentinean Chaco, as well as the potential benefits of forest conservation in this area. Finally, our findings could assist in the creation of dialogues about alternative, more sustainable and environmentally just, futures.

AB  - The increasing environmental deterioration that cities face, such as heat island effects, noise and air pollution, can be mitigated by urban park benefits (UPBs). As a result, UPBs are closely related to the well-being of urban residents and are considered an important element of environmental equity. However, the spatial coverage of UPBs considered in previous studies is restricted to the location of urban parks, and the spatial transfer capability of some UPB types is largely ignored. This study divides UPBs into four categories, i.e., park entry benefits, small space benefits, medium space benefits, and size-determined benefits. We investigate the acquisition levels of these four UPB categories in Shanghai's central city by park accessibility indices, integrating spatial and social dimensions. The results show that sub-districts with higher socioeconomic status are more likely to have good access to the four UPB categories. Fortunately, elderly and unemployed individuals also have easier access to UPBs as do those with higher socio-economic status. Despite parents' desire to have parks nearby for their children's growth, inequities of access to UPBs are found among children. The research methods and results of this paper have implications for urban planning practices.

AB  - The decline in human mobility and socioeconomic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by reports of significant improvements in air quality. We evaluate whether there was a uniform improvement in air quality across neighborhoods, with a special attention on differences by race. We focus on the COVID-19 lockdown in New York State, an early epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. Using a triple difference-in-differences model, we find that, despite the seasonal decline in particulate matter pollution starting late March (concurrent with the lockdown period), the lockdown narrowed the disparity in air quality between census tracts with high and low shares of non-white population in rural New York, whereas the racial gap in air quality remained unchanged in urban New York.

AB  - Previous research addressing the unequal distribution of locally desirably land (LDL) has mainly ignored their associated environments (i.e., rural or urban). However, this study proposed a new framework that treats rural and urban regions separately. In rural areas, the LDLs included all public lands. In urbanized areas, the LDLs were defined as green open spaces. Potential inequities in the distribution of LDL were assessed with respect to socioeconomic characteristics of residents in the State of Georgia. Using US Census Bureau Data (2000). Census Block Groups (CBGs) adjacent to LDLs were compared to CBGs outside of LDLs on four socioeconomic variables (per capita income, occupation, education, and race) in urban, suburban and rural environments. Results showed that CBGs adjacent to LDLs were composed of statistically significant upper-class communities containing fewer blue-collar workers, more whites, and higher income and higher educated people in rural, suburban and urban areas.

AB  - Since the kickoff of reform and opening up, with the rapid social and economic development, China's environmental problems get increasingly serious. A review of the emergence and development of environmental problems will reveal that not all social strata cause the same degree of environmental damage, and people with different social backgrounds and lifestyles will have different impacts on the environment. Moreover, environmental risks are not evenly distributed among all social members. Different social strata and regions are subject to different proportion of environmental risks. This concerns environmental justice. Particularly, as the inter-regional economic disparities widen, the issue of environmental justice among all regions gets more and more obvious. This poses a threat to the distribution of limited environmental capacity among regions, and a potential hazard to coordinated and sustainable development among regions. Adherence to the scientific outlook of development to ensure environmental justice and coordinated development among regions has now become an important research subject on building a harmonious socialist society. In this paper, we will, taking Jiangsu Province as an example and based on the analysis of regional differences and development trends, build an environmental justice assessment index system to assess the environmental justice under regional differences and put forth suggestions on regional coordinated development.

AB  - The environmentally sustainable city has been increasingly attracting the attention of politicians and researchers. In this regard, this paper reviews the existing literature on the relationship between urban development, local health and Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. Some findings suggest that patterns of urban development could promote urban sustainability in terms of the reduction of GHG emissions, for example, high-density development or compact urban form, which reduces vehicle kilometres travelled and thus reduce GHG emissions. However, it has also been found that these types of urban development might also cause health problems for local residents related to factors such as overcrowding, less green space for outdoor activities, a local heat island effect, high exposure to traffic and air pollution, and psychological stress. This local health paradox related to environmentally sustainable development is also deeply connected to equity issues, including environmental justice, health equity and the related spatial inequities. For future research, the paper proposes a new conceptual framework of the 'glocal environmentally sustainable city', addressing a balance between local health and global environmental sustainability.

AB  - The environment is the common property of all human beings, and all should enjoy equal rights to use the environment. Years of growth have greatly improved China's overall economic development, but the problem of environmental inequality has become prominent. Based on data from 278 prefecture-level cities, the Williamson coefficient is used to measure the environmental inequality and environmental pollution-inequality indices of 25 regions from 2003 to 2015, and the effects of the stringency of environmental policy instruments on environ-mental inequality are discussed. The results demonstrate that the provincial environmental inequalities in China between 2003 and 2015 declined at first and then rose, thus showing a U-shaped trend, and the heterogeneity of various pollutant emissions is substantial. The extent of public participation is negatively correlated with environmental inequality, while the stringencies of command-and-control and market-based instruments are positively correlated with environmental inequality. An inequality process may be necessary during the trans-formation from a high-pollution to a low-pollution state, so governments should mix a variety of environmental policy instruments to narrow or even eliminate regional environmental inequality. The findings of this study have important implications for the government to effectively choose policy instruments, improve policymaking ability, and eliminate environmental inequality.

AB  - Research on environmental justice and social inclusion suggests that high-income wage earners may have better job access due to their greater choices in both housing and transportation markets. This study compares the jobs/housing balance and mode choice of different groups of employees of a large employer (27,113 employees) and those of the "reference groups" from comparable employees working for smaller employers in Los Angeles. Based on spatial and statistical analyses, this paper finds the following: a) Across all employee groups, a better jobs/housing balance was accompanied by higher income, as was likelihood to patronize Travel Demand Management (TDM) programs. b) Employees from the large employer had more options for carpooling and thus drove alone less, even after controlling overall housing stock, residential location, annual income, and/or commute time. c) Across all employee groups, good jobs/housing balance did not necessarily bring about green mode choice. d) Comprehensive TDM measures by the large employer significantly reduced employees' dependence on driving, even in a region where autocommuting dominates. However, these measures were costly to implement. e) Different employee groups favor different TDM programs, and the patterns are marked by income. The above findings suggest that shared or consolidated TDM and housing programs, which pool smaller employers, might better promote green mode choice. Participating employers may also negotiate better deals for program implementation when these programs involve third-party transit agencies and contractors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Clean Air Act requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency to review routinely the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5). A non-governmental Independent Particulate Matter Review Panel recently concluded that the current PM2.5 standards do not protect public health adequately and recommended revising the daily standard from 35 to 25-30 mu g/m(3) and the annual standard from 12 to 8-10 mu g/m(3). To assess the public health implications of adopting the PM2.5 standards proposed by the panel, the health benefits are quantified from their implementation based on both current (observed) and future (simulated) air quality data for California. The findings indicate that strengthening the standards would provide significant public health benefits valued at $42-$149 billion. Additionally, the stronger standards are shown to benefit environmental justice via health savings that are allocated more within environmentally and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.

AB  - The purpose of SENTIERI-ReNaM Project is to describe mesothelioma incidence in the Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs). The present report deals with 39 NPCSs (20 in Northern Italy, 8 in Central Italy and 11 in Southern Italy). Asbestos is specifically mentioned in the regulatory acts of recognition for 10 NPCSs and it is the only agent that has determined environmental contamination in 3 of them (Casale Monferrato, Broni, and Bari). The timeframe of the study is 2000-2011 for 34 out of 39 sites. The corresponding reference periods for the sites of Latium, Campania, Umbria, and Bolzano Province are, respectively, 2001-2011, 2005-2011, and 2006-2011. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) for mesothelioma, with their corresponding 90% Confidence Intervals, have been estimated for all sites. The interpretation of the study findings has been based on anamnestic information made available by the Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM), and completed thanks to knowledge derived from the international scientific literature. In men, mesothelioma incidence has shown excesses in 27/39 sites and defects in the remaining 12; in women, excesses have been reported in 20 sites, defects in 15, and no cases have been detected in the remaining 4 sites. The highest annual incidence rates have been observed in the sites characterized only by the presence of as-bestos-cement factories (Broni and Casale Monferrato): respectively, 98.0 and 68.6 per 100,000 per year in men, 72.1 and 45.8 in women. Besides these two sites, the highest rates have been observed in the sites with naval shipyards: 13.2 in men and 2.5 in women. Excesses of mesothelioma incidence have been confirmed (with respect to previous observations) in the sites of Broni, Casale Monferrato, Balangero, and in the coastal areas of Trieste, La Spezia, Venice, and Leghorn. Balangero has been the major European chrysotile quarry, while the other sites are characterized by the presence of naval shipyards with demonstrated use of asbestos before it was banned in 1992. An excess of mesothelioma incidence has also been confirmed in the site of Biancavilla, characterized by the presence of the fluoro-edenite fibrous amphibole, classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). An increased incidence of mesothelioma was also observed in the areas where no direct use of asbestos had previously been documented, like Cengio and Saliceto (chemical industry), Falconara on Sea (oil refinery), and Litorale Domizio Flegreo and Agro Aversano (a large area including multiple hazardous waste dumping sites). These findings show that a relevant proportion of Italian mesothelioma cases is concentrated in NPCSs. About 1,500 extra cases of mesothelioma have been estimated in the overall series of 39 sites (2000-2011), corresponding to 125 extra cases per year. The excess has concerned the sites with manufacture of asbestos-cement products, but also the areas with asbestos quarries, naval shipyards, illegal hazardous waste dumping sites with asbestos-containing materials, petrochemical industries, refineries and steel plants. In some sites, particularly Casale Monferrato and Broni, analytical epidemiological studies have shown the causal role of not only occupational, but also environmental exposures, with special reference to paving of gardens and courtyards with asbestos-cement industry by-products. The main novelty generated by the collaborative SENTIERI-ReNaM Project concerns the detection of significant mesothelioma excesses not only in sites where asbestos is explicitly reported as a source of contamination, but also in a number of areas defined "of national interest" for environmental cleanup due to other sources of pollution. This confirms that the range of economic activities and working and living environments affected by asbestos exposure is very wide and it is not restricted to the industrial sectors characterized by the direct use of this material.

AB  - The obstetrics-gynecology community has issued a call to action to prevent toxic environmental chemical exposures and their threats to healthy human reproduction. Recent committee opinions recognize that vulnerable and underserved women may be impacted disproportionately by environmental chemical exposures and recommend that reproductive health professionals champion policies that secure environmental justice. Beauty product use is an understudied source of environmental chemical exposures. Beauty products can include reproductive and developmental toxicants such as phthalates and heavy metals; however, disclosure requirements are limited and inconsistent. Compared with white women, women of color have higher levels of beauty producte-related environmental chemicals in their bodies, independent of socioeconomic status. Even small exposures to toxic chemicals during critical periods of development (such as pregnancy) can trigger adverse health consequences (such as impacts on fertility and pregnancy, neurodevelopment, and cancer). In this commentary, we seek to highlight the connections between environmental justice and beauty producte-related chemical exposures. We describe racial/ethnic differences in beauty product use (such as skin lighteners, hair straighteners, and feminine hygiene products) and the potential chemical exposures and health risks that are associated with these products. We also discuss how targeted advertising can take advantage of mainstream beauty norms to influence the use of these products. Reproductive health professionals can use this information to advance environmental justice by being prepared to counsel patients who have questions about toxic environmental exposures from beauty care products and other sources. Researchers and healthcare providers can also promote health-protective policies such as improved ingredient testing and disclosure for the beauty product industry. Future clinical and public health research should consider beauty product use as a factor that may shape health inequities in women's reproductive health across the life course.

AB  - Recent studies examining racial and ethnic inequities in exposure to urban air pollution have led to advances in understanding the nature and extent of overall concentration exposures by pollutant, demarcated by disadvantaged groups. However, the stability of inequities at various spatial units and the exposure by air pollution sources are often neglected. In this case study from the Dallas-Fort Worth (Texas, USA) area, we used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and an air dispersion model to estimate environmental justice impacts at different spatial scales (i.e., zip code, census tract, block group) and by source (i.e., industrial pollution sources, vehicle pollution sources, industry and vehicle pollution sources combined). Using whites as a reference, blacks and other races were more likely to be exposed to higher sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations although the Odds Ratio (OR) varied substantially by pollution source type [e.g., industrial pollution source based: (OR=1.80; 95% CI (Confidence Interval): 1.79-1.80) vs. vehicle pollution source based: (OR=2.70; 95% CI: 2.68-2.71)] and varied less between spatial scales [for vehicle pollution sources, (OR=2.70; 95% CI: 2.68-2.71) at the census tract level but was (OR=2.54; 95% CI: 2.53-2.55) at the block group scale]. Similar to the pattern of racial inequities, people with less education (i.e., less than 12 years of education) and low income (i.e., per capital income below $20 000) were more likely to be exposed to higher SO2 concentrations, and those ORs also varied greatly with the pollution sources and slightly with spatial scales. It is concluded that the type of pollution source plays an important role in SO2 pollution exposure inequity assessment, while spatial scale variations have limited influence. Future studies should incorporate source-specific exposure assessments when conducting studies on environmental justice.

AB  - The numerical model MUKLIMO_3 is used to simulate the urban climate of an imaginary city as an illustrative example to demonstrate that the residential areas with deprived socio-economic conditions can exhibit an enhanced heat load at night, and thus more disadvantageous environmental conditions, compared with the areas of higher socio-economic status. The urban climate modelling simulations differentiate between orographic, natural landscape, building and social effects, where social differences are introduced by selection of location, building type and amount of vegetation. The model results show that the increase of heat load can be found in the areas inhabited by the poor population as a combined effect of natural and anthropogenic factors. The unfavourable location in the city and the building type, consisting of high density, low housing with high fraction of pavement and small amount of vegetation contribute to the formation of excessive heat load. This abstract example shows that the enhancement of urban heat load can be linked to the concept of a socially stratified city and is independent of the historical development of any specific city.

AB  - This article provides a framework for understanding water problems as problems of justice. Drawing on wider (environmental) justice approaches, informed by interdisciplinary ontologies that define water as simultaneously natural (material) and social, and based on an explicit acceptance of water problems as always contested, the article posits that water justice is embedded and specific to historical and socio-cultural contexts. Water justice includes but transcends questions of distribution to include those of cultural recognition and political participation, and is intimately linked to the integrity of ecosystems. Justice requires the creative building of bridges and alliances across differences.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of public engagement in environmental risk contexts through a rhetorical analysis of the key term "community" in a risk assessment of mining-caused soil contamination. Drawing on Burke's concept of terministic screens and method of cluster criticism, the analysis shows the divergent constitutions of "community" in the Sudbury Soils Study's official discourse and the citizen-activist rhetoric of the Community Committee on the Sudbury Soils Study. Tracing the verbal and visual clusters within each organization's articulation of "community" as place and people reveals how the official Study's technical-regulatory ideology of environmental risk and citizen participation is countered by the Community Committee's contestatory environmental justice ideology. These competing views of "community" are mutually constitutive in that the official Study's mainstream risk discourse establishes the terms for the Community Committee's reactive counter-discourse, thus limiting citizen participation mainly to questions of "downstream" impacts. Our rhetorical analysis of "community" suggests a generative method for understanding the complex power relations animating specific risk communication contexts as well as for potentially reinventing "community" in terms more conducive to meaningful citizen engagement.

AB  - Toxic chemicals - "toxicants" - have been studied and regulated as single entities, and, carcinogens aside, almost all toxicants, single or mixed and however altered, have been thought harmless in very low doses or very weak concentrations. Yet much work in recent decades has shown that toxicants can injure wildlife, laboratory animals, and humans following exposures previously expected to be harmless. Additional work has shown that toxicants can act not only individually and cumulatively but also collectively and even synergistically and that they affect disadvantaged communities inordinately - and therefore, as argued by reformers, unjustly. As late as December 2016, the last full month before the inauguration of a president promising to rescind major environmental regulations, the United States federal environmental-health establishment, as led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), had not developed coherent strategies to mitigate such risks, to alert the public to their plausibility, or to advise leadership in government and industry about their implications. To understand why, we examined archival materials, reviewed online databases, read internal industry communications, and interviewed experts. We confirmed that external constraints, statutory and judicial, had been in place prior to EPA's earliest interest in mixture toxicity, but we found no overt effort, certainly no successful effort, to loosen those constraints. We also found internal constraints: concerns that fully committing to the study of complex mixtures involving numerous toxicants would lead to methodological drift within the toxicological community and that trying to act on insights from such study could lead only to regulatory futility. Interaction of these constraints, external and internal, shielded the EPA by circumscribing its responsibilities and by impeding movement toward paradigmatic adjustment, but it also perpetuated scientifically dubious policies, such as those limiting the evaluation of commercial chemical formulations, including pesticide formulations, to only those ingredients said by their manufacturers to be active. In this context, regulators' disregard of synergism contrasted irreconcilably with biocide manufacturers' understanding that synergism enhanced lethality and patent-ability. In the end, an effective national response to mixture toxicity, cumulative risk, and environmental injustice did not emerge. In parallel, though, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which was less constrained, pursued with scientific investigation what the EPA had not pursued with regulatory action.

AB  - Through more than two decades of multilateral climate change negotiations, China has steadfastly opposed emission limits for developing countries. Scholars have traditionally explained the rigidity of Chinese diplomacy with reference to economic interests and power, and in the process understated the importance of equity norms. In international negotiations, China has served as one of the key architects and promoters of the common but differentiated responsibility principle, which holds that global environmental justice requires that developed countries bear the primary obligation for combating climate change. China has used this principle strategically in order to legitimize its opposition to emission limits. However, China's negotiating stance cannot be defined simply as the instrumental use of norms, as Beijing is genuinely sensitive to issues of equity. These equity concerns have occasionally led China to act in a manner that, from a strict cost-benefit analysis, runs counter to its own economic interests. In sum, notions of environmental justice are simultaneously a tool China uses to pursue its interests and a force that structures China's interest.

AB  - This paper is about intra- and inter-generational equity, connecting environmental justice discourse with necessary responses to climate change. It offers a review of the role of globalization in this pervasive context, contrasting the disaggregated nature of localized impacts, and seeks to address the potential for adjusting law-policy frameworks as a key part of the search for solutions. It argues that environmental justice approaches can incorporate values into law-policy processes based upon vital aspects of the integrity and functioning of communities, distributional fairness, and capacities for wider engagement and participation in the search for necessary behavioural change. The conclusion is that the ultimate success of the urgent process of addressing climate-related threats, through a meaningful degree of mitigation and adaptation, and multiple levels of decision-making and response, must be informed by the precepts of environmental justice.

AB  - Water stories told in Kilimanjaro Region, such as Mami Wata narratives conveyed across Africa and the Atlantic, give horrific insights into morally problematic forms of wealth acquisition through environmental destruction. This paper approaches farmers' stories of water spirits and water management practices as indices of farmers' witness to their own social displacement by government-backed agribusinesses. Analysis shows that farmers are drawn to, and are already part of, a system that waits and watches for their death. As perverse as many forms of necropolitics can be, this form of social devivification, duplicitously advanced in the name of environmental conservation and sustainability, is all too familiar and ordinary. This article unveils agro-industrial conceits about water management and contrasts these conceits to farmers' life-sustaining practices.

AB  - Understanding potential disparities in community compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) will help managers effectively and fairly allocate funding for improving drinking water systems. Environmental justice is experienced at the scale of the individual, the household, the neighborhood, or the water service provider and is too fine-grained a scale for spatial analysis with most available state datasets. This research represents an effort to ascertain which spatial analysis method selected to estimate the demographics of water service areas best supports environmental justice analysis at the state scale. To understand whether there are disparities in compliance with the SDWA, this study specifically investigated the relationship between socioeconomic status and race as well as other water system variables, and violations to the SDWA of community water system (CWS) in the state of Pennsylvania. The sociodemographic characteristics of the water systems were estimated using three different CWS-level spatial analysis methods (areal weighting, dasymetric mapping, areal interpolation) and a county-level spatial analysis method. Negative binomial regression was used to evaluate whether these sociodemographic characteristics, and other water system variables, including size of the water system, ownership, and water source, are associated with SDWA violations. This research demonstrates that the spatial analysis method selected for an environmental justice study can affect the results and conclusions of the research. Evidence that SDWA violations were associated with race or socioeconomic status was not found; however, this study did determine that small CWSs (<200 connections) and CWSs serving rural areas are less likely to be compliant with the SDWA.

AB  - This essay compares two philosophical proposals concerning the relation between values and science, both of which reject the value-free ideal but nevertheless place restrictions on how values and science should interact. The first of these proposals relies on a distinction between the direct and indirect roles of values, while the second emphasizes instead a distinction between epistemic and nonepistemic values. We consider these two proposals in connection with a case study of disputed research on the topic of environmental justice and argue that the second proposal has several advantages over the first.

AB  - Within the current climate of change (environmental, economic and social) what constitutes 'justice' is continually shifting in relation to vulnerable people, places and species. This is most acute in cities, where the majority of people now live and the need to create new pathways of co-existence between humans and other species has been recognized. The convergence of rapid urbanization and anthropogenic climate change has had disproportionately negative effects on the urban poor and those most marginalised (human and non-human). This paper provides a critical overview of the emergent field of urban climate justice which focuses on the complex links between environmental sustainability, human vulnerability and biodiversity loss in the natural environment. This is an interdisciplinary agenda demanding new forms of sustainability research and practical engagement underpinned by calls for a more integrated approach to eco-social justice principles around human and other species equity in cities.

AB  - Watersheds are often degraded by human activities, reducing their ability to provide ecosystem functions and services. While governmental agencies have put forward plans for improving watershed health, resources are limited, and choices must be made as to which watersheds to prioritize and what actions to take. Prioritization tools with sufficient specificity, resolution, and automation are needed to guide decisions on restoration and management actions across large scales. To address this need, we developed a set of tools to support the protection of streams and associated riparian habitats across the state of California. We developed and tested watershed condition estimation models based on bioassessment data, used the EPA's StreamCat dataset to identify stressors, incorporated environmental justice factors and developed reach-specific models to prioritize actions. We applied the prioritization tools statewide and were able to identify 18% of stream reaches that are in good condition but that are most vulnerable to existing stressors and an additional 19% of stream reaches that are degraded and are highest priority for restoration and management. The remaining 63% of stream reaches were prioritized for protection and periodic monitoring or minor remedial actions. The results of this project can help regional stakeholders and agencies prioritize hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to protect, acquire, and restore stream and riparian habitats. The methods are directly transferable by using any regional condition and stress data that can be readily obtained.

AB  - Waterkeeper v. EPA represents a limited victory for advocates of reporting requirements. In this case, the court held that the Environmental Protection Agency could not exempt farms from air pollution reporting requirements based on the use of the de minimis doctrine, which allows for exemptions from regulations to avoid trifling matters. Prior to this case, in most environmental cases involving the de minimis doctrine, courts have upheld agency use of the doctrine unless a court finds that the statutory language is "extraordinarily rigid" and therefore does not permit this interpretative tool. Here, however, while the majority did not uphold the agency action, the decision also omitted any discussion whatsoever of whether the statutory language of either the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act was so "extraordinarily rigid" as to preclude de minimis exemptions. This therefore weakens the precedential value of the decision for advocates in similar future cases, because it leaves the door open for the possible use of the de minimis doctrine to avoid regulatory responsibilities. However, advocates can overcome this precedential weakness in two ways. First, advocates can highlight the environmental justice benefits of reporting requirements to communities, the government, and businesses. This will greatly reduce the probability that a given reporting requirement will "yield a gain of trivial or no value." Second, advocates can emphasize the fact that it is unnecessary for the Environmental Protection Agency to invoke its de minimis authority to shield small business owners from reporting requirements, since it can use its prosecutorial discretion to do so. Thus, advocates of reporting requirements have several tools in their "toolbox" if agencies attempt to use the de minimis doctrine to justify similar exemptions in the future.

AB  - This special issue is a contribution to environmental labour studies, which aims to investigate the practices and theories that integrate labour and nature, by focusing on labour environmentalism. While nature is privately appropriated and exploited by Capital, workers' organizations tend to construct nature as labour's other, a place to enjoy or a place to be protected from destruction at best. In the following introductory article to this special issue, we present our view of what environmental labour studies are investigating and might investigate in the future and the place of labour environmentalism within this broader agenda. We also suggest an analytical framework to evaluate the depth, breadth, and level of the agency of the variations of labour environmentalism. We suggest that environmental labour studies can be a way of studying not only the intersections between social and environmental justice, climate change and working conditions but can also contribute to building a bridge between environmental theory and practice.

AB  - Vehicle emissions are major sources of air pollution linked to negative health outcomes in children. Consequently, California State Bill 352 stipulates that new schools may not be sited within 500 ft of major roadways. However, the exposure of existing schools to roadway emissions and the uneven distribution of the burden of air pollution have not been systematically explored for most cities. IN response, the objectives of our study were twofold: We used spatial analysis and an evaluation of traffic count data to develop a proximity-based approach to assessing school exposure to roadway air pollution emissions. Second, we applied our method to ask whether the risk of exposure to high concentrations of roadway emissions is equally distributed for schools in Santa Clara County (SCC; USA), and which demographic or spatial patterns emerge. In the process, our proximity-based approach estimated total annual traffic counts throughout SCC, identified major roadways, and assessed cumulative emission burdens and socio-economic indicators for each school in the study area. Results were compared to output from a physically-based model and to county asthma data. Our results suggest that (i) 14% of schools in SCC are potentially exposed to high levels of air pollution from roadways, a rate that is higher than the national average, and (ii) students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and receiving aid are more likely to be educated in schools with higher risk of exposure to elevated levels of roadway vehicle emissions. Asthma hospitalization rates are highest in socio-economically disadvantaged areas with a higher density of major roadways. Areas of higher vehicle emissions determined by the physically-based model are in general agreement with those of the distance-based approach. We propose a combination of shortand long-term mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to vehicle emissions for school children.

AB  - This paper examined the impact of an environmental justice class positioned against the backdrop of the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. Students questioned the link between the water crisis and environmental and racial injustice, as Flint citizens are largely African American and reside below the poverty line. The inquiry guiding this research centered on how students might use their voices to garner agency due to their participation in this class. The students' narratives became counter-stories; at the end of the course, their counter-stories highlighted a positive relationship between students' agency and their desire to become involved in the democratic process. The findings illustrate how participatory projects, ones that students direct themselves, can result in students' feelings of anxiety and complicate the role of the teacher in shaping the curriculum. The discussion examines curriculum design and place-based education adjacent to the complex undertaking of civic engagement with students.

AB  - Toxic environmental emissions have the potential to harm already susceptible populations living in close proximity to industries with pollutant emissions such as coal-fired electrical power plants. The organized dissemination of information in communities that find themselves susceptible to occupation by industries with pollutant emissions is a crucial step in the long and arduous process of preventing such harm. Here, we present a blueprint that can be used by community organizations to prevent industries that pollute the environment from locating in communities that are already disproportionately exposed to pollution (referred to here as environmental justice communities). We base this blueprint on a specific case in Taylor County, Florida, where the steps outlined successfully prevented the Taylor Energy Center (TEC) consortium from obtaining the necessary permits for the operation of a proposed coal-fired electrical power plant, thereby minimizing the risks of additional toxicant exposure to the affected community.

AB  - This article traces how the notion of finite limits to emissions based on 2 degrees C carbon budgets was applied to increase the credibility of a carbon-constrained future in two very separate realms, social movements contesting fossil-fuel development and the financial sector-a process yet to be described in the relevant political and financial literatures. For each realm and sub-areas within them, we apply a three-wave taxonomy to trace the application of 2 degrees C carbon budget based concepts-including stranded assets, the carbon bubble, divestment, and anti-pipeline campaigns-from the fringe to the mainstream in under 10 years. We do so by drawing on relevant primary documents and peer-reviewed literature, complemented by a quantitative textual analysis of relevant discourse from news sources. The article establishes how, in efforts to shift expectations, climate proponents used 2 degrees C carbon budgets to frame a stark choice between a safe climate with strict carbon constraints and growth-oriented fossil-fuel interests. The article also demonstrates that these concepts, and efforts inspired by them, contributed to constraints on fossil-fuel developments and interests, arguably further enhancing the credibility of a carbon-constrained future. We conclude with a discussion of the potentially self-reinforcing nature of such expectation dynamics and by highlighting overlapping implications for actors across finance, where investors reorient risk assessment around climate, and social movements, where activists disrupt states' entrenched commitment to fossil-fuel expansion.

AB  - This work draws upon previous studies of environmental inequity to investigate the distribution of estimated air lead concentrations across 3,111 U.S. counties. Data for this research come from the U.S. Census Bureau's 1990 Census of Population and Housing: Summary Tape File 3A and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1990 Cumulative Exposure Project. Findings from OLS and WLS regression suggest that air lead concentrations are associated with county racial composition. Counties with the largest proportion of Black youth under 16 years of age (10th decile = 0.09) have nearly 7.9 percent more lead in the air than counties with no Black youth (1st decile = 0.00). Counties with the largest proportion of White youth under 16 years of age (10th decile = 0.25) have nearly 10.0 percent less lead. in the air than counties with the smallest proportion of White youth (1st decile = 0.13). These findings persist despite adjustments for urbanization, income, and housing values. This work proposes that the distribution of air lead levels has important implications for the field of sociology and the study of racial inequality.

AB  - This research expands upon organizational ecology theory to examine variations in founding of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental justice movement across U.S. counties for two time periods (1990-1999 and 2000-2008). Cross-movement effects are examined to determine if founding is more or less likely to occur in counties where related civil rights and environmental organizations are located. Consistent with the notion of agglomeration effects, we hypothesize that during the 1990s the relationship among civil rights density, environmental density, and environmental justice founding is positive and suggests cooperative efforts. That is, environmental justice organizations should form in counties where civil rights organizations and environmental organizations exist. Because the focus of environmental justice organizations may have expanded over time and created a more competitive atmosphere, cross-movement relationships that were positive across counties during the 1990s are hypothesized to turn negative across counties during the 2000s. Multivariate analysis suggests mixed support for these hypotheses. Specifically, civil rights density is positively associated with environmental justice founding during the 1990s and negatively associated with environmental justice founding during the 20005 suggesting potential cooperative and then competitive effects across counties over time. However, the correlations between environmental density and environmental justice founding, while positive and statistically significant during the 1990s, are not statistically significant during the 2000s. Thus, in the case of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental and environmental justice movements it appears that there is a trend toward competitive effects even as those effects have yet to materialize.

AB  - This study investigates the association between air-lead levels and crime rates across 2,772 US. counties. Data for the analysis come from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Census, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Results suggest that air-lead levels have a direct effect on property and violent crime rates even after adjusting for general levels of air pollution and several structural covariates of crime. We also find that resource deprivation interacts with air-lead levels. The association between air-lead levels and crime rates-property and violent-is strongest in counties that have high levels of resource deprivation and weakest in counties that have low levels of deprivation. This interaction is consistent with arguments and evidence in the health care literature that populations most at risk of lead poisoning are least likely to get the resources required to prevent, screen, and treat the illness.

AB  - This study draws upon concepts in landscape research and environmental justice to examine the association between community poverty and environmental violations that occurred between 2002 and 2008 across 110 coal strip mining operations located within the United States. Multivariate results suggest that residential poverty is greater around facilities that have been identified as violating an environmental law. In addition, the association between poverty and violations is dependent upon regulatory inspections. While an increase in inspections is associated with an increase in the odds that a violation will be discovered, it is also associated with lower levels of community poverty. We conclude that this pattern of associations between poverty, inspections, and violations is consistent with arguments in the environmental justice and landscape literatures.

AB  - This research extends the study of natural resource violations by examining the association between conservation organizations and the enforcement of natural resource violations across 67 Florida counties in 2006. Specifically, the authors look at natural resource violations as an organizational outcome that is influenced by perceived community organization around environmental conservation. To do this, they examine the association between the number of conservation organizations and the level of enforcement for natural resource violations. The results suggest that even while controlling for organizational capacity (i.e., number of officers), offenders and targets, proportion rural population, and economic benefits from natural resource use, a positive association exits between conservation organizations and natural resource enforcement levels. This relationship is not replicated in the case of animal rights and hunting and fishing organizations. Although issues related to environmental justice are always a concern in studies of environmental enforcement, the authors find no evidence of an association between social and economic disadvantage and community organizing. Finally, a post hoc examination of the data suggests that the association between conservation organizations and the level of natural resource enforcement is stronger for those counties where more officers enforce natural resource violations than for those counties where fewer officers enforce violations.

AB  - We examined the effects of human connection to nature on residents' concerns about justice in conservation policies of Natura 2000. Expansion of Natura 2000 conservation network has resulted in local communities having to consider Natura 2000 in their development plans, and justice concerns have been strong in some communities near Natura 2000 sites. We conceptualized Natura 2000 justice within a framework composed of 3 domains of conservation justice: distribution, recognition, and representation. To examine the effect of nature connection on perceived justice of Natura 2000, we conducted a door-to-door survey of rural resident (80.09% response rate) in 3 municipalities of Pomerania in Poland. The effect of connection to nature on perceived distribution of Natura 2000 benefits was positive (b = 0.187, t= 7.057,p < 0.001); perceived communication about Natura 2000 was positive (b = 0.089, t = 2.940 p < 0.01); perception of limitations was positive (b = 0.078, t = 2.416, p < 0.01); perceived recognition was positive (b = 0.117, t = 3.367, p < 0.001); and perceived representation was positive (b = 0.123, t = 5.015, p < 0.001). Our results suggest local residents' bonds with nature matter and they should be considered when new conservation approaches, such as Natura 2000, are introduced.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban green space provides multiple recreation opportunities with important benefits for physical and psychological well-being, but access to these benefits is often unequally distributed. Various methodologies to assess outdoor recreation opportunities exist, but they rarely take into consideration dimensions of environmental justice. The aim of this paper is to map and assess nature-based outdoor recreation opportunities with a focus on green space accessibility for different social groups, and discuss the results in light of of environmental justice. We use the Oslo metropolitan area, Norway, as a case study. We combine statistical analysis with spatial modelling to assess recreation preferences and distribution of nature-based recreation opportunities. We also analyse accessibility for different social groups, including children and the elderly, migrants and low-income households. Our results show that most people prefer large wooded green areas, high density of trees, and presence of water, although preferences differ depending on age and place of residence. Areas for daily recreation are accessible to the whole population in the study area, but they are unequally distributed, migrants and low-income households having relatively less access. Our methodology can also be applied in other cities and metropolitan areas to assess differences in accessibility to outdoor recreation opportunities. We discuss whether and to which extent these results illustrate a situation of environmental injustice. We conclude that the relation between access to green space and environmental justice can be complex, and that injustice may not automatically result from uneven access.

AB  - This essay is an ecocritical analysis of Duff Wilson's book, Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret (2002). While the book is in many ways the result of journalistic investigation, it also has literary value through its zest for story-telling, giving readers an insight into small-town America, and the weight that bears upon the sense of community owing to the corporate interest of the chemical industry. Duff Wilson's book narrates how chemical wastes that would be expensive to treat according to current legislation are dumped into fertilizers that are later sprayed across vast expanses of land in Quincy, a small town in Washington State, endangering humans, cattle and the land alike. Lawrence Buell has rationalized the possible polarizations of environmental writing, and found that the "health of the physical environment" is one, while the other is "social welfare or interhuman equity." Duff Wilson no doubt finds that environmental writing has duties in both areas of concern, but, as he moves on, the biocentric view gets the upper hand, though the more social perspective is not discarded. Duff Wilson's book, while examining questions which may sound unliterary, such as agricultural price-levels and competition in the chemical industry, delves into issues of literary ethics and grasps human intimacies when they are shaped by those forces. Behind the social and economic mechanisms at work in this small rural community, one encounters cases of human suffering, which Duff Wilson conveys with adroitness and a sense of implicit solidarity. This is what makes his book especially poignant, and capable of exploring the various nuances of social fragility.

AB  - Tobacco shops, medical marijuana dispensaries (MMD), and off-sale alcohol outlets are legal and prevalent in South Los Angeles, California-a high-crime, low-income urban community of color. This research is the first to explore the geographic associations between these three legal drug outlets with surrounding crime and violence in a large low-income urban community of color. First, spatial buffer analyses were performed using point-location and publically accessible January-December 2014 crime data to examine the geography of all felony property and violent crimes occurring within 100, 200, 500, and 1000-foot buffers of these three legal drug outlet types across South Los Angeles. Next, spatial regression analyses explored the geographic associations between density of these outlets and property and violent crimes at the census tract level. Results indicated that mean property and violent crime rates within 100-foot buffers of tobacco shops and alcohol outlets-but not MMDs-substantially exceeded community-wide mean crime rates and rates around grocery/convenience stores (i.e., comparison properties licensed to sell both alcohol and tobacco). Spatial regression analyses confirmed that tobacco shops significantly positively associated with property and violent crimes after controlling for key neighborhood factors (poverty, renters, resident mobility, ethnic/racial heterogeneity). Thus, study findings provide the first empirical evidence that tobacco shops may constitute public health threats that associate with crime and violence in U.S. low-income urban communities of color. Implementing and enforcing control policies that regulate and monitor tobacco shops in these communities may promote community health by improving public safety.

AB  - This chapter describes the evolution of justice considerations in environmental planning. The rise of the public involvement movement in the 1970s led to a series of guidelines as to how government and industry sponsored public programs should be ethically conducted. In parallel, the environmental justice movement created a literature that clearly demonstrated that the negative effects of environmental degradation fell unequally on particular groups in society, such as the poor or those in an ethnic minority. The chapter explores the concepts of justice that have been used as the two interests merged. Through examples of the application of justice principles in environmental decision making, the dynamics of justice arguments are explored. These include: the issues of relative deprivation, deservingness and entitlement; evidence-based decision making; the issues relating to group interest; and the scales and levels of justice rhetoric. It concludes that the influence of justice research on decision making has been limited to this stage. Nevertheless, if opportunities relating to the creation of a common language, avoidance of the use of public discourse to reach a pre-determined outcome, and creating defensible evaluation programs within the political process are improved substantially, more influence will be achieved.

AB  - This study examines local news reporting about the Flint water crisis. The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with local reporters to explore journalistic practices and perceptions of the crisis. The study utilised a framework grounded in concepts from community journalism and crisis reporting, as well as environmental justice and racism scholarship. The qualitative thematic analysis centres around four themes: coverage practices and professionalism, resources and challenges, connections to place, and environmental justice and racism. The results reveal that the crisis served as a catalyst for some news organisations to make substantial investments in their newsrooms; but this was not the case for small organisations that depend mostly on grant-funding. Local reporters generally claimed that despite their attachment to the Flint community, they maintained their normal journalistic standards. However, some reporters struggled to separate their personal experiences from their professional practices, evidence consistent with prior studies on crisis reporting. Reporters demonstrated empathy towards victims impacted by the water crisis, and this heightened their distrust towards official sources and motivated their outreach efforts. Finally, for those reporters, their ideologies were largely consistent with both historical and emerging claims on environmental justice and environmental racism, that persons of colour, minority populations, and poor neighbourhoods in cities are more likely to suffer from environmental hazards compared to white and more affluent communities. Suggestions for crisis reporting in environmental justice contexts are discussed.

AB  - Urban parks can provide many physical and psychological health benefits, but these may not be shared equitably among visitors. The purpose of this study was to explore park visitor demographics and activities, as well as their in-depth narratives regarding experiences, perceptions of accessibility, and desired improvements in a range of urban park types, using Portland, Oregon as a case study. We used a mixed-methods approach to interview and observe visitors in 15 urban parks of three general park types: recreational-active use, natural-passive use, and multi-use parks. The most common activities were physical recreation, interactions between adults, and adult child interactions, which all support physical and mental well-being. Ninety-four percent of observed children were engaged in physical recreation and three-fourths were interacting with other children. Our non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations with joint plots indicated some trends in visitor demographics and activities across park types, but we found no significant differences in the total number of observed visitors, females and males, racial-ethnic groups, or adults and children across park types. Our complementary in-depth, semi structured interviews with participants revealed specific motivations for park visitation, access concerns, and desired improvements. Visitation was primarily motivated by physical recreation opportunities, accessibility, and children, whereas the main access concerns were park proximity, trails and paths, and maintenance. Feelings of safety were particularly important for female visitors, while a sense of community helped to create a welcoming atmosphere for visitors with underrepresented racial-ethnic backgrounds. Participants across demographics groups discussed preferences for improvements, which focused on enhancing various park amenities and social atmosphere. Only 19 % of participants indicated that no changes were needed in the parks. We provide strategies for urban park planners, governmental agencies, and community groups to continue enhancing urban park experiences and accessibility for diverse visitors.

AB  - Urban parks are widely-recognized to provide multiple social and ecological benefits, but an increasingly number of studies show that such benefits are often inequitably distributed across socio-economic and ethnic groups. This has led to a growing interest in assessing the spatial distribution and access to parks and other green spaces as an aspect of environmental justice. Even though such spatial studies require assessment at multiple scales, how results may be influenced by scale has not received adequate attention. This study assessed the effects of scale on park provision and spatial equity in Singapore. A range of park provision indicators were used to evaluate how they are affected by scale and to explore their correlations with wealth, income and ethnicity. Scale effects were assessed using planning units adopted for national land use planning, namely, region, planning area and subzone. Scale significantly affected park provision indicators, particularly for indicators that incorporate population. Correlations at larger scale tend to be stronger than at smaller scales. There were higher park provision and lower potential for park congestion in planning units with higher wealth and income. Inequity also appears stronger when studied at smaller spatial scales. Results also showed that park provision indicators are prone to skewed frequency distributions, especially at smaller scales. The implications of the results were discussed in relation to spatial equity assessment and possible causes of the disparities. We also highlight the need to direct park planning at smaller scale of neighbourhoods rather than at the town or regions levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluates the underlying logic of urban planning behind the inequitable geographical distribution of public open space in Hong Kong. Existing open spaces and areas zoned as open spaces are found to have distinct patterns of distribution. Fewer than half of Hong Kong's 1737 public parks and recreation grounds were zoned as 'Open Space' in town plans. Three typical land-use zoning configurations adjoining the 1177 'Open Space' zones are identified. A large proportion of Hong Kong's 'Open Space' zones, particularly those with waterfront access, were located close to upmarket, low-density housing areas and mixed commercial-business zones, rather than to high-density mass housing zones. An historical review elucidates the influence of colonial politics, racial harmony, public hygiene and democratisation on open space planning and development in Hong Kong. Recreation is not the only social function of open space. The government's latest planning and development strategies expanding a network of new open spaces at strategic waterfront locations and near commercial/business zones, and encouraging private-sector participation in place promotion and urban marketing may exacerbate the inequitable distribution of open space, encourage its commodification and deprive underprivileged communities of the right to conveniently access public space.

China has not yet formed a complete legal system of civil compensation for environment pollution. Taking the surface water environmental damage incident of sewage treatment plant as a case, we analyze the virtual disposal cost method and the provision of reference data for sewage treatment plant. It will simplify the assessment process for surface water environmental damage and greatly improve the efficiency of environmental justice and environmental damage compensation.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS), as public services facilities that provide lots of outdoor space for people's activities and exercise, has a significant impact on urban residents' social, psychological, and physical benefits. The reasonable distribution of the urban green space is of great significance for enhancing the overall well-being of urban dwellers. In this study, we selected Wuhan City center as a research area, extracted the spatial distribution information of urban green space, roads networks from high-resolution remote sensing images in 2019. The urban green space service situation in different travel modes, travel times, and parks types are subsequently calculated with a network analysis model in GIS. The results showed that the services area of urban green space in the city center of Wuhan was within a driving distance of 30 min, accounting for 70.38% of the total study area, and the use of high-resolution remote images spatial data can measure equity on a more precise scale.

AB  - This study examines the spatial distribution of outdoor recreation sites and their proximity to census block groups (CBGs), in order to determine potential socioeconomic inequities. It is framed within the context of environmental justice. Information from the Southern Appalachian Assessment database was applied to a case study of the Chattahoochee National Forest in North Georgia. Outdoor recreation sites (campgrounds, wilderness areas, good/poor fisheries habitat, and overcrowded recreation sites) were mapped using geographic information systems. All CBGs (n = 200) contained by, and within 1500 meters (approximately one mile), of the Chattahoochee National Forest were identified and characterized by four socioeconomic variables (race, household income, heritage, and occupation). Logit analysis was conducted to determine the spatial relationships between outdoor recreation sites and CBG variables. Results show that household income was the only significant predictor (p < .05) of proximity to outdoor recreation sites. CBGs with a higher proportion of lower income households were significantly more likely to be situated within 1500 meters of a wilderness area, campground, and/or good fisheries habitat than CBGs with higher incomes. Implications for identifying recreation as a locally desirable or undesirable land-use, applying benefits-based management, and considering sustainable community development in national forest management are addressed.

AB  - Vehicle traffic is responsible for a significant portion of toxic air pollution in urban areas that has been linked to a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Most vehicle air quality analyses used for transportation planning and health effect studies estimate exposure from the measured or modeled concentration of an air pollutant at a person's home. This study evaluates exposure to fine particulate matter from vehicle traffic and the magnitude and cause of exposure misclassification that result from not accounting for population mobility during the day in a large, sprawling region. We develop a dynamic exposure model by integrating activity-based travel demand, vehicle emission, and air dispersion models to evaluate the magnitude, components and spatial patterns of vehicle exposure misclassification in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Overall, we find that population exposure estimates increase by 51% when population mobility is accounted for. Errors are much larger in suburban and rural areas where exposure is underestimated while exposure may be overestimated near high volume roadways and in the urban core. Exposure while at work and traveling account for much of the error. We find much larger errors than prior studies, all of which have focused on more compact urban regions. Since many people spend a large part of their day away from their homes and vehicle emissions are known to create "hotspots" along roadways, home-based exposure is unlikely to be a robust estimator of a person's actual exposure. Accounting for population mobility in vehicle emission exposure studies may reveal more effective mitigation strategies, important differences in exposure between population groups with different travel patterns, and reduce exposure misclassification in health studies.

In this article, we describe an environmental justice-focused intervention located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that aimed to increase community empowerment to address urban environmental injustices by training residents to reclaim vacant land. We use a case study approach to illustrate resident perceptions of the impact of vacant land and urban decay. The results suggest that these residents viewed vacancy as an important indicator of community well-being and social inequality. We use a social and environmental justice framework to describe results and implications for practitioners and researchers.

AB  - This paper explores the political processes that activists engaged in contesting land grabbing have triggered to connect claims across borders and to international institutions, regimes and processes. Through a review of cases of land-grab resistance that have led to project cancelation or suspension, I argue that contextual elements of the land grab and shifting geopolitics highlight the need for adaptation and refinement of models of transnational advocacy, historically structured in North-South patterns. For example, while some elements of the boomerang pattern of transnational advocacy are still relevant, changing realities call for new empirically enriched models. To this end, I outline two typologies of political contention that can help us conceptualize multi-scalar interactions between activists to demonstrate the impact of local resistances at larger scales - 'the catapult effect' and the 'minefield effect'. This paper contributes to calls for further theorization to understand how feedback processes between international discourses, meso-politics and conflicts and resistance at local sites of production impact the implementation of contested land deals.

AB  - This study investigates the implementation of U.S. environmental protection laws under American Indian tribal governance. The landmark laws of the 1970s that form the core of America's environmental policy regime made no mention of American Indian tribal lands, and the subsequent research literature on environmental policy has given them little attention. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has primary implementation responsibility for environmental protection laws on tribal lands, which offers a unique opportunity to study direct federal implementation apart from typical joint state-federal implementation. Further, because Indian reservations are homes to a disproportionately poor, historically subjugated racial group, analysis of environmental programs on tribal lands offers a unique perspective on environmental justice. We analyze enforcement of and compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to compare the implementation of environmental policy on tribal lands with nontribal facilities. Analysis reveals that, compared with nontribal facilities, tribal facilities experience less rigorous CWA and SDWA enforcement and are more likely to violate these laws.

AB  - Venezuela is well known for its century-old oil economy, which has significantly shaped its social fabrics, territories, and eco-systems. Since 1999, the Bolivarian Revolution has led to important transformations in the context of the 'Socialism of the 21st century' project, but the extractivist model has deepened. This situation has created or intensified several ecological distribution conflicts, which have been further exacerbated by an extraordinary national crisis unleashed in the period 2013-2016. In this paper, a geography of the 20 most emblematic and representative socio-environmental conflicts in the period of the Bolivarian Revolution is presented. From a comparative political ecology perspective, this article aims to understand how power relations are expressed through territorial configurations and spatial dynamics of resistance, and what are the implications for sustainability. It is argued that a remarkable new situation of environmental injustice is occurring in this period. Despite the 'eco-socialist' discourse raised, the current Petro-State has updated the traditional regime on eco-systems, territories, and human bodies primarily by resorting to the assimilation of socio-environmental conflicts through a strategic distribution policy of oil rents. However, it has maintained a pattern of ecological degradation and social marginalization as an outcome of its economic development model. The current context of crisis has fostered intense territorial disputes and conditions for the emergence of new social actors, practices, scenarios, and geographies linked to underground economies and criminal bands, which complicate an already concerning scenario of unsustainability. The current extractivist model is reaching a breaking point. New commodity frontiers have become a main area of dispute.

AB  - Wilderness has been constructed as White, in part through histories that marginalize African American attitudes and experiences. In response, we provide an overview of African Americans' relationships with nature during three historical periods: (a) Enslavement, (b) Reconstruction and Postreconstruction, and (c) 1936-1994. African Americans' relationships with nature were created through an ongoing dialectic of oppression and transgression throughout each historical period. Four types of transgression were identified: wilderness as a space free of White oppression, wilderness as a site to challenge White oppression, engagement with nature despite White oppression, and advocacy for more just relationships with wilderness. Transgression is discussed as a means to remember environmental history and envision new relationships between African Americans and wilderness in the present, bonds for which transgression may one day no longer be necessary.

AB  - Youth articulations of climate change injustice are experiencing an unprecedented moment in the spotlight as, inspired by Greta Thunberg, young people around the world take to the streets demanding justice for their generation in the face of climate emergency. Formal opportunities for youth voices to be heard in environmental governance are slim, although the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) offers a rare opportunity for youth to share their perspectives as one of nine civil society constituencies: YOUNGO. Recent research in Global Environmental Change has called for empirical exploration of justice claims-making by different stakeholders to develop understanding of how justice is conceptualised and negotiated in climate change governance spaces. To date, climate justice claims from youth have not been explored in the academic literature. This paper draws upon rich, ethnographic, longitudinal data on the evolution of justice claims made by a group of youth participants in the UNFCCC to contribute to this empirical gap. In our research, a UK-based case study organisation and long-established member of YOUNGO was studied between 2015 and 2018, including observation of their participation at the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Conferences of the Parties. We find that youth participants first articulated injustices based on perceived future risks to their generation but, over time, switched to solidarity claims about injustices experienced by other groups in the present. Whilst laudable, this impedes their mandate as representatives of younger generations. We also make three theoretical contributions to environmental justice theory. First we expand participation justice theory to both the visible structures of participation (procedural justice) and the informal rules and discourses shaping participation (representation justice). Second we demonstrate the importance of both external and self-recognition for the articulation of justice claims. Third we clarify the relationship between power and justice claim-making, proposing that we must look beneath what is articulated to shed light on the exercise of ideological power that shapes the framing and claiming of justice in environmental governance spaces.

AB  - This contribution examines how and with what effects the Movement of People Threatened by Dams (MOAB) in the Ribeira Valley, Brazil, works at various scales simultaneously. It is argued that MOAB was kicked off by mobilising Afro-descendants around livelihood issues, and that one of the first anti-dam strategies was to claim quilombola recognition and land rights at the state level. MOAB soon expanded its network and broadened its agenda to include procedural justice, targeting federal and international agencies for recourse. The paper concludes that MOAB has successfully used different scales for framing, mobilisation and action, which has contributed to the dam project being put on hold for almost three decades.

AB  - Urban trees are increasingly being used to help cities adapt to climate change, improve health and wellbeing, and promote biodiversity. Yet these benefits are distributed unequally, mirroring the uneven distribution of the urban forest in many cities. Contrasting theories have been proposed to explain these observed patterns that focus either on the economic wherewithal of individuals (the 'luxury effect'), or the outcome of structural factors such as municipal decision-making processes. Here, we explore patterns across 10 municipal authorities in greater Melbourne, Australia to compare the relative importance of these competing mechanisms. We show that both individual and structural processes are both major determinants of the density and diversity of trees in this large Australian city. Interestingly, education level was strongly related to tree density, while household income was negatively related to tree density and diversity in some municipalities. The luxury effect was not able to adequately explain the patterns observed in Melbourne. This finding has important implications for the planning and management of urban forests and the equitable distribution of the benefits they provide, in the context of the rapid expansion of urban populations across the globe. To counteract inequity, local municipalities must acknowledge and deliberately overcome internal biases that favour the provision of street trees to more advantaged sections of the community.

AB  - This study introduces risk theory of environmental science into human settlement science using 2004-2013 statistics, remote sensing data, and thematic maps. The entropy weight method and risk-index model are both used to study the characteristics of the time course and spatial pattern of human settlement risk in 31 provincial regions in China. In addition, influential mechanisms of vulnerability, functionality, stress, and adaptability on environmental risks are analyzed. Three primary results are obtained. First, for temporal characteristics, environmental risks of human settlements increased significantly from 2003 to 2012. The year 2006 marked both a sudden change and the cut-off point after which human settlements in China experienced qualitative changes and new risks. Second, for spatial characteristics, the risk index of human settlements decreased gradually from the southwestern to the northeastern, northwestern, and northern parts of China. The risk index of human settlement spaces differed significantly, with obvious block aggregation of spatial-distribution characteristics. Third, for relevant factor characteristics, between 2003 and 2012, the temporal change in vulnerability is relatively stable, with a slight increase in functionality and a slight decrease in adaptability. Spatially, Qinghai, Tibet, southwestern China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Beijing, and Tianjin had relatively high vulnerability in human settlements; Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had the best functionality; Hunan and Sichuan had relatively high stress; and Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had relatively stronger adaptability. Further consideration and discussion are required on the environmental risks for different social groups and at different geographical scales, as well as on the uncertainty and long-term features of environmental risks in addition to environmental justice issues.

AB  - Using a unique combination of datasets and estimation techniques, we test whether private lease negotiations to extract oil and natural gas exhibit features of Coasian efficiency. We demonstrate that measures of wealth (including income, house square footage, and land acreage), typically determinants of willingness to pay for environmental quality, do affect bargaining outcomes. However, race, ethnicity, and language also play important roles after conditioning upon these variables, suggesting an environmental injustice and a breakdown of efficient Coasian bargaining. We further demonstrate that failure to negotiate protections in leases leads to increased risk of future drilling violations, and that weak lease restrictions are not generally offset by strong local ordinance restrictions.

AB  - This paper explores the context of environmental justice (EJ) in Scotland, and presents a case study whereby the main attributes for an indicator of EJ were identified, encompassing procedural and distributive aspects of justice. Through a participatory process, weights were assigned using a Multi-Criteria Analysis tool, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Results show that overall, environmental injustices are mostly associated by respondents to unequal distribution of health burdens due to pollution, yet greater weight is attached to procedural justice by community environmental activists. The paper suggests that AHP may be applied to many situations and could form a basis for the development of tools to address and deliver EJ in Scotland.

AB  - Toxic chemicals are released into land, air, and waterways daily. Exposure to such chemicals, however, is not equally distributed across the U.S. It is well documented that communities without agency and capital, typically economically and socially disadvantaged, are those that suffer the brunt of the impacts of a polluted environment. These impacts can have both acute and chronic health consequences, leading to lower life expectancy, higher cancer rates, and compromised immune systems. Emerging qualitative work indicates that incarcerated persons - individuals who have no agency to leave their environment - are disproportionately affected by our polluting practices. This study argues that environmental regulations across the country allow polluting industries to poison confined populations. Nationwide data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory is used to examine if industries geographically closer to correctional facilities emit greater amounts of toxic chemicals. Regional differences are examined as well. Results identify a pattern of harm - incarcerated persons who already have compromised health are also exposed to high levels of toxic chemicals.

AB  - What is the relationship between social movements and polycentric governance? The concept of polycentricity has been at the center of recent debates in environmental governance. While most of this work has analyzed polycentric arrangements in relation to collaborative and adaptive governance, some have recently focused on how political conflicts shape these arrangements. In this paper we build on this work through Luther Gerlach's forgotten framework of polycentric social movements to undertake the task of politicizing polycentricity. This task entails expanding the analytical focus of institutional analyses of polycentricity and examining the social group politics of social movements. To this end, we present a case study of the climate justice movement and its relation to climate change governance. We analyze whether and to what extent the movement has embodied polycentric arrangements throughout its history, and to what effects. We show that show that, in seeking to address the multiscalar nature of environmental problems and the limits of existing institutional arrangements, climate justice groups are increasingly organized in a polycentric fashion. Climate justice groups mobilize multiple strands of environmental justice movements from the global North and South, as well as from indigenous and peasant rights movements, and it is organized as a decentralized network of semiautonomous, coordinated units. We find that this strategy generates new opportunities and challenges for the movement, and thus has important implications for its effectiveness in achieving these transformations. Lastly, we find that through these polycentric arrangements, movements such as that for climate justice are able to exert simultaneous influence on multiple sites of environmental governance, from the local to the global, furthering increased polycentricity in formal institutional arrangements.

AB  - This article tracks the key events that set the stage for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris, particularly as they relate to politics of convergence. One side of this coming together is an intersection of issues, where new terrestrial and aquatic carbon sequestration programs have blurred the margins of climate change mitigation and resource grabbing. These programs, enclosing forests, farmlands, and oceans, are likewise fused together in what can be described as an emerging carbon complex' that is part of the wider blue/green economy. On the reverse side, the clear intersection of issues as witnessed by radical, and historically sectoral, agrarian/social justice movements is causing them to intertwine in resistance. The realm of climate change has proven to be an exceptional space of struggle and countermovement building. Political interactions between movements have become increasingly sophisticatedrequiring frameworks that address environmental, agrarian, and oceanic issues at once, as the issues have become ever more complex. Agrarian/social justice movements maintain that their agendas for food sovereignty and climate justice hinge upon exposing fault lines in the system and advocate overall system change. COP21 and its parallel side events were together a landmark moment, but part of a much more involved process, the road through Paris', along which movements had carved out transnational and local spaces of convergence against the backdrop of a global carbon complex.

AB  - This paper explores the challenges for democratizing land and natural resource control in Guatemala through use of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests (Tenure Guidelines). This international human rights instrument comes at a critical moment, in which the current global land rush has shaped contemporary agrarian transformation with serious implications for the right to food and control of natural resources. The Tenure Guidelines provide us with a unique opportunity to put land and natural resource tenure squarely under the prescriptions of international human rights law, rather than allowing tenure to be subsumed by a narrow understanding of property rights based on civil and merchant law. In Guatemala, we are witnessing a political opening, where the government has incorporated the language of the Tenure Guidelines into its regulatory framework unlike any other country in Latin America. At the same time, the world watches on while a slow-motion coup engulfs the Central American country, reflecting a global trend of gutting democracies and coopting the language and legislation meant to protect them. Thus, the implementation of the Tenure Guidelines is strongly contested by state and corporate actors seeking to use the instrument in order to gain political legitimacy for the expansion of agribusiness like oil palm and sugarcane, and other forms of extractive industry. This paper's findings indicate that when applied together with a rights-based approach, the Tenure Guidelines are a powerful social and political tool. Such is especially true of the most marginalized populations who require protection and respect for their existing tenure rights, promotion of reforms for better access to and control over land and resources, and restoration of tenure rights resulting from displacement or dispossession.

AB  - This research advances knowledge on the understudied topics of violence against women and their contributions to ecological movements through a multiple case study analysis of 25 women defenders listed in the EJAtlas, an environmental conflict database. Women's mobilization is often constrained within cultural contexts limiting them to gendered spaces and roles and punishing them with multiple violences. Women defenders' distinctly gendered violent experiences thus inform their perspectives, narratives, and advocacy. Women defenders assert authority and achieve movement success by emphasizing aspects of identity within and despite unevenly faced barriers, brutality, and burdens. These multi-faceted tactics contribute to emancipation beyond just women and their communities by dismantling violent hegemonies while promoting alternative, inclusive, and antiviolent visions of environmental justice.

AB  - Two worldviews are now contending for cultural dominance: the open-system model long promoted by economists, here called the "image of unlimited good," and a more traditional closed-system view, Foster's " image of limited good," still widely found among peasant societies today. The former rests on the assumption that people "create" wealth, an illusion that conflates the properties of wealth's real and virtual forms while ignoring the economy's extreme reliance on fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources. The laws of thermodynamics dictate that as "growth" occurs in such a system, it fundamentally destroys; thus the net sum cannot be positive, and the system is not expanding but steadily running down. The latter rests on the assumption that most of the "goods" valued by people in life are scarce, being derived from finite raw materials through the expenditure of human labor and extrasomatic energy. Such goods are therefore "subtractable," their limited supply forming a commons that must somehow be shared. Based on an ethnological argument centering on the successful management of scarce water for irrigation, a shift toward the closed-system worldview is shown to be necessary if people are to act collectively to limit their expanding consumption, a change already widely underway, particularly in the global South.

AB  - This research presents and applies a new procedure to elaborate a spatial hierarchy of poverty. The proposed method simultaneously combines variables of magnitude and intensity based. on recent (bootstrapping & spatial autocorrelation) and traditional statistical techniques, and overlay routines of Geographical Information Systems. While magnitude and intensity refer to absolute and relative data, respectively, each variable may be concentrated or agglomerated in space. In this study, concentration is the presence of high global values, regardless of their location, and agglomeration is the concentration of spatially contiguous high local values. Both agglomeration and concentration are merged through a geographical overlay procedure to create conglomerates of magnitude or intensity of poverty. Cases inside these conglomerates are classified by gaussian (natural breaks) or paretian (heads and tails) procedures to set up a spatial hierarchy. For the first time in the study of the spatial pattern of poverty, the resulting spatial hierarchy is based on the simultaneous combination of the concentration and agglomeration processes measured in relative and absolute terms. The benefits of the procedure for an area-based public policy are illustrated by assessing the spatial targeting of poverty in the 2,456 Mexican municipios in 2010. The suggested methodology in this research may be easily extended to identify other spatial patterns, such as crime, industry, diseases, pollution or environmental justice in different areas or countries.

The moral issues of ecological degradation and climate justice need to be integrated into social consciousness, political legislation, and climate treaties. Both science and religion can contribute to this integration with differentiated language but shared purpose. Recognizing the limits of both science and religion is critical to finding a way forward for addressing the critical challenges of climate change. How we value nature and human-Earth relations is crucial to this. We need a broader environmental ethics in dialogue with the science of climate change.

AB  - This paper analyzes whether regulating "hot spots" of toxic air pollution by increasing the spatial resolution of regulation could address environmental justice (EJ) concerns. To examine this question, this paper develops a decision model of a regulator choosing emission controls within a net cost minimizing framework. An empirical application of the model using air toxic emission data for Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties in Florida estimates the emission standards and spatial distribution of risks at a coarse and a finer spatial resolutions. Implications for EJ are analyzed by combining the simulated spatial risk distributions at the two resolutions with the demographic data. Results indicate that different measures of EJ point to different conclusions regarding the question of whether finer resolution regulation alleviates EJ concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for EJ policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The policy we analyze involves regulation of air toxics sources at increasingly finer spatial resolutions. We develop a model of a decisionmaker choosing emission standards within a net cost minimization framework. Empirical application of the model to two counties in Florida demonstrates that regulation at finer resolutions could involve trade-offs between net social costs and equitable distribution of risks and, in some settings, between individual and population risks.

AB  - This study examines altitudinal residential segregation by race in 146 cities in the U.S. South. It begins by embedding the topic in recent theorizations of the social construction of nature, the geography of race, and environmental justice. Second, it focuses on how housing markets, particularly in the South, tend to segregate minorities in low-lying, flood-prone, and amenity-poor segments of urban areas. It tests empirically the hypothesis that blacks are disproportionately concentrated in lower-altitude areas using GIs to correlate race and elevation by digital elevation-model block group within each city in 1990 and 2000. The statistical results confirm the suspected trend. A map of coefficients indicates strong positive associations in cities in the interior South-where the hypothesis is confirmed-and an inverse relationship near the coast, where whites dominate higher-valued coastal properties. Selected city case studies demonstrate these relationships connecting the broad dynamics of racial segregation to the particularities of individual places.

AB  - With the emergence of global mechanism for toxic harm accountability, a transnational environmental justice regime is slowly rising. One of the ways in which its taking form is through transnational litigation schemes where corporations are being locally sued by the alleged victims of their overseas misbehaviours. Using a science and technology studies approach, this article deals with one of the most central components of those schemes: victimization devices. Such concept refers to the highly varied sociotechnical assemblages through which claims about toxic victimhood are mobilized in litigation-based schemes, usually including components such as toxicological evidence and testimonies from the affected people. In order to explore the complexities involved in transnationally mobilizing these devices, this article analyses the lawsuit presented in Sweden by inhabitants of Arica, Chile, against the local mining corporation Boliden for its alleged responsibility in dumping toxic waste near their homes in the late 1980s.

AB  - This study examines the intersection of individual life-histories, organisational histories and societal histories and reveals how religion, in several different expressions, serves to provide a connection between justice for workers and justice for the environment in the work of trade unionists. The trade union movement is generally seen as secular. and thus in our life-history interviews finding religion as a backdrop to labour activists' formation was unexpected. Religion becomes manifest in various ways, partly through experiences in the present or at formative periods in unionists' lives, but also through its cultural embeddedness in language and collective memory. In this way it serves to provide subtle influences on beliefs, concepts of social justice and daily action.

AB  - This study applies a Foucauldian discourse analysis in a study of forest owners' descriptions of power relations in Finnish forest and nature conservation policy, in the context of the recent implementation of cooperative National Forest Programme. Twenty-five forest owners in southern Finland were interviewed using a semi-structured "qualitative attitude approach." Three discursive strategies were found: (1) "submitting to others' power," (2) "questioning others' power" and (3) "taking power." As discursive resources for these strategies, forest owners used two identities, "forestry identity" and "conservation identity," as well as expressions of justice, in order to create tension or alignment between policy actors. The first two strategies emphasized non-cooperation and non-communication between stakeholders and were dominant in the interviews. As a contrast, the third strategy emphasized cooperation and communication; however, it was used rarely. The results of the study can help policy stakeholders to become aware of the discursive construction of policy processes and the presence of power in all social interaction between policy stakeholders.

AB  - This article uses a political ecology approach to examine how urban residents of the refinery city of Esmeraldas "wager life" under conditions of social and chemical toxicity associated with oil capitalism. The article draws on the scholarship on affective economies and critical oil geographies to trace the knotting of social reproduction and oil capital in Esmeraldas and to illustrate how "cruel optimisms" (Berlant 2011) allow city-dwellers to make sense of everyday life amidst frontier-style petro-capitalism. Focusing on personal narratives of social reproduction, affect, and hope in the city, the article first argues that "justice" can be contradictory and politically ambivalent and, second, challenges fixed readings of resistance, refusal, or submission in resource extraction-dominated sites. Rather than presupposing resistance to petro-capitalism or submission to its workings, the article illustrates the liveliness of urban justice struggles and how attention to embodied ecologies and affective oil economies deepens scholarship on social justice.

AB  - We propose and implement a new emplacement framework through exploration of the socio-spatial landscape of the Fox River Watershed (FRW) in Northeastern Wisconsin from a particular cultural perspective. Based primarily upon interviews conducted with 16 Hmong people to better understand and learn from the experiences of an important but overlooked FRW stakeholder group, we present our findings through the components of this framework: displacement, misplacement, replacement, and emplacement. Our research reveals that the strength of Hmong culture has persisted through tremendous loss and displacement, to survive and evolve in a new setting. The resettlement of Hmong people in the FRW has afforded relatively widespread access to landscapes that facilitate recreation, social interaction, and food production, enhancing physical and mental health and augmenting household incomes. It has also led to empowerment of women and the emergence of a generation of group members with formal ecological knowledge to add to their existing ethnobiological understanding and cultural foundation of ecological conscience. For such reasons, conservation organizations, policy makers, and departments of natural resources should look to build linking social capital between those in power and marginalized groups such as the Hmong.

AB  - We hypothesised that neighbourhood inequalities in health and health-related behaviour are due to selective migration between neighbourhoods. Ten-year follow-up data of 25-74-year-old participants in a Dutch city (Eindhoven) showed an increased probability of both upward and downward migration in 25-34-year-old participants, and in single and divorced participants. Women and those highly educated showed an increased probability of upward migration from the most deprived neighbourhoods; lower educated showed an increased probability of moving downwards. Adjusted for these factors, health and health-related behaviour were weakly associated with migration. Over 10 years of follow-up, selective migration will hardly contribute to neighbourbood inequalities in health and health-related behaviour. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper articulates a paradigm shift in the adoption of a critical ecopedagogy focused on substantive and systemic change within nature sports. In analyzing the unifying concept of nature sports, we propose an ontological shift towards genuine sustainability, a communion among people and with nature. These activities comprise a group of physical practices that have the potential to challenge participants in novel ways that provide an alternative to traditional sports and the ideological values associated with these dominant sports, such as competition and personal gain. Nature sports inscribe meaning on bodies in motion, with a blurring or erasure of boundaries, as participants become one with nature rather than seeking to exploit or conquer it. These novel and countercultural practices promise the possibility of systemic sustainability, as participants redefine sport in terms of relational equity and ecoliteracy. As a utopian project, this systems approach recognizes the nature-sport nexus as a living framework to honor culturally appropriate practices and traditions in building an ecological movement centered on environmental justice. In this way, nature sports offer an opportunity to reimagine sustainable development through the promotion of a circular, rather than linear, economy-an economy based on re-creation rather than exploitation and waste.

AB  - This paper considers law's role in constructing rurality in the context of land use disputes in Ontario, Canada. In particular, highly contested aggregate mineral developments are examined to demonstrate how legal and policy conceptions of the rural shape people-place relations to construct rurality as residual. In this context, rurality is considered as a dimension of a broadened and relational politics of environmental justice that extends to the more-than-human world. At the same time, this paper explores how environmental justice perspectives are critical to deepening and strengthening the transformative potential of rural land use and environmental activism. Land use conflicts are considered as one strategic opening for an ecologically just rural politics of place that can shift the way law structures relationships of rurality in particular places.

AB  - This paper reflects on a collaborative project by the co-authors, investigating how filmmaking may intervene into the racialised politics of place and the practices of memory. Warren County, North Carolina is credited as the birthplace of the US environmental justice movement for 1982 landmark protests linking environmental concerns with civil rights organising. Our 2012 short film, Remembering Kearneytown, looks at this significant environmental history through the perspective of co-author Rev. Kearney, assistant pastor at a church nearbyWarren County's iconic former toxic landfill. In the film, Rev. Kearney calls for his community to reclaim their legacy of environmental justice and re-imagine Warren County as a model of health rather than waste. This article proposes that collaborative filmmaking can serve as a technology of liberatory praxis, to intervene in dominant racial narratives. Our approach conceives of filmmaking geographically, using visual methodologies to engage with the meanings and transformative capacities of place.

AB  - This paper aims to extend the energy justice framework by using the capability approach to understand factors affecting community acceptance of energy technologies. The capability approach is a normative framework for assessing people's well-being and devising interventions for social justice. Whilst recognising that opposition to energy technologies is fundamentally a problem of distributive, recognition and procedural injustices, the paper operationalises the capability approach to unveil what these justice tenets mean to indigenous people living in three communities neighbouring wind installations located in Southern Mexico. Findings conclude that building a bottom-up approach to understand complex conceptions of energy justice within a community can lead to an improved awareness of justice implications relevant to community acceptance of energy technologies. In the Mexican case, these factors relate to inclusive community engagement that pays particular attention to valued ways of being and doing of the local population, such as equal access to employment, higher education and professional training, diversified sources of income, and recognition of the local indigenous everyday life and communal identity. The results also highlight a nested structure of justice concerns, with the three tenets being embedded into one another and presenting different levels of visibility.

AB  - While the critique to economic growth is quintessential in the degrowth scholarship, one may observe a similar focus in various environmental justice movements around the world. This is particularly visible when it comes to the increasing perception that mega-development projects are both unjust and unsustainable, threatening the survival of people and environments. In this paper, we illustrate this focus by looking at two anti-mining movements in Eastern Europe (EE): Save Rosia Montana (Romania) and Krumovgrad (Bulgaria). The local movements describe open cast mining (even in the prospective phase) as potential destruction of basic sources of life (material commons such as water or crops, and community relations). The paper emphasizes a dynamic involved in doing environmental justice, or 'de-growing EJ': affected communities organize themselves by 'staying in place', producing alternative economies, organizing local democratic institutions. What potentially "grows" here, is a societal imaginary of justice on how to reproduce the socio-ecological conditions of life by protecting and re-defining traditional means of production and grassroots practices, knowledge, wealth, and values.

AB  - This paper explores a fruitful convergence between the distributive and procedural dimensions of environmental justice theory and current debates in the field of development studies over capitals and capabilities, institutions, and discourse formation to shed new light on natural resource management projects in the developing world. Specifically, we document the planning and implementation of two types of water interventions in two contrasting regions: watershed development programmes in northeast India and small reservoirs in sub-Saharan West Africa. We find that there is a contradiction between the inherently political nature of water interventions and the fact that such projects remain grounded in apolitical, technical and managerial narratives. In contrast to the new semantic of development, this depoliticization results in the near absence of attention paid to procedural (participation and empowerment) and distributive (equity) justice concerns and in local actors having to revert to covert ways to achieve their ends. A constructive dialogue between development studies and environmental justice scholars can offer a fresh look on the society-environment nexus in the developing world.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure provides ecosystem services that are essential to human wellbeing. A dearth of national-scale assessments in the Global South has precluded the ability to explore how political regimes, such as the forced racial segregation in South Africa during and after Apartheid, have influenced the extent of and access to green infrastructure over time. We investigate whether there are disparities in green infrastructure distributions across race and income geographies in urban South Africa. Using open-source satellite imagery and geographic information, along with national census statistics, we find that public and private green infrastructure is more abundant, accessible, greener and more treed in high-income relative to low-income areas, and in areas where previously advantaged racial groups (i.e. White citizens) reside. Areas with White residents report 6-fold higher income, have 11.7% greater tree cover, 8.9% higher vegetation greenness and live 700 m closer to a public park than areas with predominantly Black African, Indian, and Coloured residents. The inequity in neighborhood greenness levels has been maintained (for Indian and Coloured areas) and further entrenched (for Black African areas) since the end of Apartheid in 1994 across the country. We also find that these spatial inequities are mirrored in both private (gardens) and public (street verges, parks, green belts) spaces, hinting at the failure of governance structures to plan for and implement urban greening initiatives. By leveraging open-access satellite data and methods presented here, there is scope for civil society to monitor urban green infrastructure over time and thereby hold governments accountable to addressing environmental justice imperatives in the future. Interact with the data here: green-apartheid.zsv.co.za.

Unique political and cultural dynamics shape the study and pursuit of environmental justice (EJ) in Native American communities. This review summarizes Native American EJ issues based on a cross-disciplinary search of more than 60 publications. In so doing, we discuss the unique nature of Native American EJ in terms of conducting research and working toward reducing the continuation of historical trauma associated with environmental ills, the types of strategies used in Native American EJ research, and issues of Native American climate justice. We conclude with discussion of remaining knowledge gaps and future research needs.

AB  - Urbanising cities of India are engulfing the peri-urban land and water resources. Informal water sellers, who transfer water from peri-urban to urban areas, meet the growing water demand in Hyderabad, one of the fastest growing cities in India. This article qualitatively explores how informal water tankers are changing the flows of water, posing challenges to water access for peri-urban residents. We conclude that apart from the state's infrastructural and capacity challenges to provide piped water, power interplay between actors is responsible for the mushrooming of informal water markets. The transfer of water has contributed to groundwater depletion as well as to the water insecurity of peri-urban residents.

AB  - This editorial introduces the Special Section "Commons and Social Movements", which centers on how social movements and commons initiatives shape each other. The Section responds to the recent momentum gained by the "commons movement" in Europe and across the world, as well as the consolidation of a critical scholarship that expands the frontiers of institutional ecological economics for the study of the commons. The diversity of contributions included in the Section illustrates the novelty of the topic. Still, some transversal themes emerge, including the coevolution of movements and commons, the role of heterogeneities, and cross-scalar dynamics. Also promising are the authors' efforts to put the commons and social movement theories in dialogue via con-cepts like water rooted collectives, management opportunity structures, collective reactions to commons grab-bing or liminal commons. Also important is the common understanding across all contributions about the potential of commons movements as sustainability transformation actors. Commons movements can break policy status quos but also prefigure, perform and scale up-and-out alternatives. This is probably the main take home message of this Section and we hope also a motivation to further a research agenda around it.

AB  - This paper shows that a fuller integration of the economic theory of well-being into strategies adopted to reduce the impact of climate change could help to avoid potential conflicts between the mitigation measures applied and the consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels. The paper moves along the path traced by Wood and Roelich (2019) with their Tensions Triangle Theory, but aims to develop it further from an operational point of view, showing how contemporary ecological tax reforms, if inspired by the Capabilities Approach, could more effectively contribute to achieving an inclusive, sustainable, accessible and secure global energy system, that provides solutions to energy challenges and, at the same time, creates value for business and civil society as a whole, without compromising the balance between the three fundamental elements of the tensions triangle described by Wood and Roelich. In particular, this chapter aims to show how the enlargement of the tax area according to new criteria of distributive justice inspired by the Capabilities Approach could serve to increase the mobility of social assets and to develop strategies to adapt public finance systems to the changes produced not only by environmental emergencies, but also by other sudden and adverse phenomena, such as economic crises and significant revenue losses caused by the adoption of non-transparent or harmful tax practices. Finally, the paper considers the proposal to establish taxes on so-called global commons-such as the atmosphere, climate, healthy environment, oceans-and to redistribute their revenue to reduce economic inequalities and poverty.

AB  - This paper describes a project initiated by non-literate indigenous people to equip their own "citizen scientists" with rugged smartphones running adapted software that enable them to share some of their detailed environmental knowledge in ways that improve the sustainable management of their forest. Supporting local people to share their environmental knowledge in scientifically valid and strategically targeted ways can lead to improvement in environmental governance, environmental justice and management practices. Mbendjele huntergatherers in the rainforests of Congo are working together with the ExCiteS Research Group at University College London to make their local knowledge about commercial hunters' activities improve the control of commercial hunters and diminish the harassment they often experience at the hands of "eco-guards" who enforce hunting regulations. Developing and deploying a system for non-literate users introduces a range of challenges that we have tried to solve. Our Anti-Poaching data collection platform, running on Android smartphones, is based on a decision tree of pictorial icons and employs various smartphone sensors to augment observations. We describe its development here.

AB  - This paper presents an analytical framework to identify and understand grassroots water governance practices, which we call 'rooted water collectives' (RWC). RWCs can be multi-scalar organizations that engage in common property resources management or multi-scalar social movements that advocate for common property resources governance. The framework, which we open for discussion, scrutinizes (1) the extent to which 'rooted water collectives' are 'grounded' in the sense they address locally perceived water control problems and resort to water-context embedded meaning, values, identities, belonging and vernacular knowledge; (2) their internal decision-making dynamics; and (3) their effectiveness in achieving impact at multiple scales. It also considers five contextual factors that enable and constrain RWC development. RWC can be deployed as a conceptual lens, but also as an empirical manifestation constituting the object and subject of research. It differs from wide-spread top-down-implemented participatory water management approaches and common property resources management research, in the importance it gives to politics, advocacy and multi-scale social movements. The framework is illustrated with a cursory analysis of four cases: irrigators' federations in Peru; the 'new water culture' movement in Spain; collective irrigation in oases in North Africa; and loosely structured networks of irrigation water users in Cambodia.

AB  - This paper elucidates different forms and modes by which the two State agencies in Mumbai, India-the High Court and the municipal government-appropriated the human rights to water of an estimated two million slum-dwellers in the city. While the order of the High Court made inadequate and narrow interpretations of human rights to water, the municipal policy and functionaries indulged in delayed, selective, cosmetic, distorted, or rhetorical acceptance of these rights. These interpretations and actions led to many limitations and risks for the realization of human rights to water for slum-dwellers including penal tariffs, sub-par infrastructure, and new barriers to water access. Yet, the court order also removed a stiff legal barrier and empowered slum dwellers by lending legitimacy to their claims to water access. This paper responds to concerns in the literature over the appropriation of human rights to water by capitalist States especially in the Global South and its adverse im-plications for the realization of these rights. It also substantiates previous researchers' claims that there is a potential for positive outcomes of struggles for these rights. Finally, I indicate that, while countering such institutional appropriation, struggles for human rights to water need to undertake political action to enforce these rights.

AB  - This paper contributes to geographical perspectives on energy justice by arguing for the concept of "spaces of energy well-being." We build on the concepts of capabilities, home, and emotional embodiment to offer an understanding of the spatiality of well-being. The paper draws on empirical material from a study conducted with social housing tenants in Port Kembla, Australia, following recent energy price increases. Interviews illustrate that social housing tenants engaged in reducing domestic energy consumption occupy a paradoxical space of well-being. We argue that energy bills are lived and felt daily through bodies as anxiety, given that participants experience social housing as a therapeutic and safe place that allows possibilities to refashion the self. We better understand the dynamics of pride and shame from limiting energy use. Our analysis suggests that essential to understanding the ways social housing tenants relate to uneven access to fuel is as an emotionally embodied home making and unmaking practice.

AB  - This paper explores an intriguing case of environmental mobilisation in the world, Argentina's anti-mining movement. This movement has contributed to the cancelation or suspension of about half of the contentious projects they have opposed and has led to the approval of regulations and laws restricting large-scale mining activities in 9 out of 23 national provinces. This process of mobilisation and institutional change is quite unique when compared to other Latin American and worldwide environmental mobilisation processes. This paper studies how the actors and the strategies mobilised in Argentinean mining conflicts have led to these and other mobilisation outcomes. With this aim we have developed, in collaboration with the Environmental Justice Atlas (www.ejaltas.org), a systematic identification and analysis of all public large-scale mining conflicts in the country from 1997 (when large scale mining began) to 2018. We conclude signalling three key interrelated features of anti-mining contention in Argentina: the diversity of actors and their strategies, some political opportunity structures (i.e. decentralised mining governance to provinces, mobilisation at early stages of projects) and the role of multi-scalar environmental justice networks acting on local, provincial and national scales.

AB  - Trust can be understood as a mechanism to reduce social complexity. Trust is located in the relations between people, making it a property of social systems. Trust is a prerequisite for the functioning of society, providing a foundation upon which sustainable development, environmental justice, etc. are only possible. Consequently, there is a great interest to maintain or strengthen trust in systems and institutions, e.g., in money as an exchange medium. The requirement of trust for environmental governance sets the boundaries for social change and reduces the probability of implementing measures that might undermine trust and social cohesion, e.g., environmental policies that threaten investments in the economy. Contemporary socio-economic trends, including the acceleration of market processes, globalization, and the consequential growing complexity in society make it more difficult to maintain trust. Thus, it is questioned whether efforts that potentially improve the society-environment relationship are actually desirable in society.

AB  - Urban parks are essential components of urban ecosystems, providing recreation and relaxation places to residents. Measuring the spatial accessibility to urban parks serves as an initial step in urban planning and developing urban development strategies to improve social and environmental justice. This study aims to evaluate measures of spatial accessibility to urban parks by comparing three geographic information systems (GIS)-based approaches, accounting for network complexity, transport modes, distance thresholds, and destination choices. Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures. The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate accessibility measure for use in different contexts.

AB  - Urban cultural space (UCS) has been of great social and economic value for sustainable development, and the existing researches about it mainly focus on some specific aspects, such as historical heritage or cultural service facility. However, UCS hasn't been quantitatively assessed as an independent system with clear definition and comprehensive classification. Thus, we present a quantitative analysis based on the statistic of UCS provision in different categories between 44 sub-districts in Xi'an and find its inequalities. Xi'an urban land use data and population data of sub-district level are introduced in the analysis process with GIS, SPSS and MATLAB. Our results indicate that inequalities of UCS in Xi'an are mainly reflected in three aspects, including categories, geospatial and population. Among the four categories of UCS, historical heritage and cultural park account for higher percentage, while cultural service facility and religious space are lower. The inequalities in geospatial could be estimated from two indicators. The first indicator named cultural space rate ranges from 0 to 66.88%, while the other named distance between residential and cultural space varies from 100.47 m to 2004.75 m. The inequalities in population could be assessed by cultural space per capita and Gini coefficient. The results indicate that per capita ranges from 0 m(2) to 214.79 m(2). The Gini coefficient of Xi'an is 0.86, which means that the UCS distribution in population is extremely inequitable. Our studies would further the research on UCS and provide constructive suggestions in urban planning and policy formulation to ensure adequate UCS provision and improve its distributional order in Xi'an.

AB  - Within research on late liberal biopolitics, scholars have examined the individualization of public or collective dangers, such as the obesity epidemic, natural disasters, and climate change. Yet few have scrutinized the most audacious of cases: when the government participated in and benefited from the destruction of its land and poisoning of its people, and then, rather than admit culpability, turns around to blame their citizens' ill health on their individual behavior. In this article, I investigate lead contamination in Kabwe, Zambia a former lead mining town and one of the 10 most polluted cities in the world. I argue ignorance, not just knowledge, can be a technology of governing: a strategic way for the government to manage their population and "let die." Drawing upon 48 qualitative interviews with mine, government, and civil society insiders along with eight resident focus groups, this article scrutinizes how government secrecy gave way to three talking points that frame conversations about the environment in Kabwe-that lead contamination is natural, that lead poisoning is easily preventable, and that it is treatable. With this narrative, education campaigns actively produce ignorance about the causes and consequences of widespread lead poisoning, continually turning poisoning events and happenings into quasi-events, or states of being residents are left to endure.

AB  - This paper investigates the introduction of unit-pricing (UP) schemes in waste management with regard to grassroots initiatives promoting bottom-up participatory processes in local communities, addressing several issues concerning environmental justice and degrowth. As waste service charges and fees increase in proportion of waste generated in presence of UP schemes, the paper explores and evaluates the socio-economic impact of these schemes at a local level, analysing data and information gathered from four municipalities in Spain. Findings indicate that UP schemes can provide a more balanced payment system for local residents, and help reducing free-rider behaviours associated with illegal and improper disposal practices. In addition, findings provide empirical evidence of the importance of grassroots initiatives in relation to increasing awareness regarding environmental issues among the public, and in view of facilitating change towards more sustainable practices within local communities. Conclusions gathered from this study offer valuable insights to local and national policymakers with regard to the design and delivery of UP schemes in waste management services.

AB  - This paper explores and examines the distribution of environmental conflicts in Germany between 1985 and 2015, analysing the main causes for environmental conflicts related to privatisation and deprivatisation processes of urban services in 80 German cities. Using information collected via means of a Delphi Method based on focus groups with experts, we identify 90 cases of large-scale privatisation initiatives involving urban services occurred in different fields within the period considered. In 38 cases, privatisation was reversed due to initiatives undertaken by environmental justice organisations and other local grassroots groups promoting de-privatisation and re-municipalisation. In another 30 cases, privatisation was prevented as a result of these initiatives. Findings from our analysis indicate that deprivatisation initiatives and potential conflicts related to them are frequently driven by grassroots organisations promoting the provision of commons-based urban services. Our findings also suggest that privatising services in the energy, water supply and waste management sectors is likely to negatively affect the quality of service supply and increasing prices for urban residents.

AB  - This essay examines W. E. B. Du Bois's call for the "conservation of races" as an instance of an ecological legacy in African American thought that challenged traditional divisions between humans and nonhumans. Evoking contemporary models of rhetoric, I show that Du Bois implicitly figured blackness as an inventive rhetorical ecology that was distributed through material things and environments. Promoting the conservation of that ecology, his sociological work gestured toward a worldly, more-than-human ideal of justice. I explore how his ecological articulation of conservation resonated with Progressive Era environmental conservation in its rejection of ideals of purity but pressed beyond its economic materialism and human essentialism. Ultimately, I argue, Du Bois leaves us with a unique picture of conservation as a cooperative practice of identification in which both human and nonhuman participants come to articulate as interdependent parts of a larger ecology, a process that involves memory at a lived, material level.

AB  - Urban green space and water features provide numerous social, environmental, and economic benefits, yet disparities often exist in their distribution and accessibility. This study examines the link between issues of environmental justice and urban water management to evaluate potential improvements in green space and surface water access through the revitalization of existing engineered water infrastructures, namely stormwater ponds. First, relative access to green space and water features were compared for residents of Tampa, Florida, and an inner-city community of Tampa (East Tampa). Although disparities were not found in overall accessibility between Tampa and East Tampa, inequalities were apparent when quality, diversity, and size of green spaces were considered. East Tampa residents had significantly less access to larger, more desirable spaces and water features. Second, this research explored approaches for improving accessibility to green space and natural water using three integrated stormwater management development scenarios. These scenarios highlighted the ability of enhanced water infrastructures to increase access equality at a variety of spatial scales. Ultimately, the "greening" of gray urban water infrastructures is advocated as a way to address environmental justice issues while also reconnecting residents with issues of urban water management.

AB  - This contribution explores how climate-vulnerable states can effectively use the law to force action in order to address loss and damage from climate change, taking the Pacific Island state of Vanuatu as an example. Vanuatu made headlines when its Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and External Trade, the Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, announced his government's intention to explore legal action as a tool to address climate loss and damage suffered in Vanuatu. Our contribution places this announcement in the context of Vanuatu's own experience with climate loss and damage, and the state's ongoing efforts to secure compensation for loss and damage through the multilateral climate change regime. We then discuss the possibilities for legal action to seek redress for climate loss and damage, focusing on two types of action highlighted in Minister Regenvanu's statement: action against states under international law, and action against fossil fuel companies under domestic law. After concluding that the issue of compensation for climate loss and damage is best addressed at the multilateral level, we offer proposals on how the two processes of litigation and negotiation could interact with each other and inspire more far-reaching action to address loss and damage from climate change. Key policy insights The review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage offers an opportunity to start putting in place a facility for loss and damage finance under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A climate damages tax (CDT) on fossil fuel companies seems a particularly promising option for mobilizing loss and damage finance. Such a CDT could be one revenue stream for a relevant loss and damage facility. Legal action - including cases against foreign states or fossil fuel companies - could bolster the position of climate-vulnerable states in multilateral negotiations on loss and damage finance.

Urbanization at large scales has inherent sustainability problems, and planning institutions and governance mechanisms have had limited success at the metropolitan scale, let alone at a megaregional one. A vision of more sustainable regional development includes an emphasis on balanced local communities to reduce regional mobility demands; the management of land, resources, and population to live within regional limits; efforts to improve equity and build social capital; and on economic development that strengthens the quality of the region's social and ecological systems rather than the quantity of production and consumption.

AB  - Urban development can have negative impacts on the environment through various mechanisms. While many air quality studies have been carried out in more developed nations, Eastern Caribbean (EC) countries remain understudied. This study aims to estimate the concentrations of air pollutants in the EC nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Transport, recreation and construction sites were selected randomly using local land use records. Pollutant levels were measured repeatedly for numerous 1-hour intervals in each location between October 2015 and November 2018. Weather trends and land use characteristics were collected concurrent to sampling. Across 27 sites, mean NO2, O-3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 levels were 26.61 ppb (range: 0-306 ppb), 11.94 ppb (0-230 ppb), 27.9 ppb (0-700 ppb), 52.9 mu g m(-3) (0-10,400 mu g m(-3)) and 29.8 mu g m(-3) (0-1556 mu g m(-3)), respectively. Pollutants were elevated in high urban areas and generally significantly positively correlated with each other, with the exception of PM10. NO2 levels in construction areas were generally comparable to those in transportation areas and higher than in recreation areas. O-3 levels were lower in construction than recreation and transport areas. SO2 concentrations were lower in construction and recreation compared to transport sites. Construction and recreation PM10 levels exceeded transport sites, while PM2.5 was highest in construction areas. Additional bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to assess whether various meteorological, temporal and land use factors including rain, tour season and urban features explained variability in air pollutant concentrations. Tourist season and specific months, more than any other factors, contributed most to variability in pollutant concentrations. These new measurements of air pollution concentrations in an understudied nation may have important implications for health outcomes among exposed EC residents, and provide critical data for future exposure and epidemiologic research and environmental policy.

In light of recent legal and federal policy developments, continued research is needed to better understand the scale of the gap between the treatment of white and minority communities and to better understand how zoning can reverse past injustices.

AB  - Through an examination of four sites of contention in Ecuador, this study explores the impacts of transnational campaigns on domestic organizations and community groups while holding constant the focus of conflict, the construction of an oil pipeline. The international organizations verified local claims, enabled access to international venues such as conferences and investor meetings, and influenced the financing of future large-scale projects. Yet, the transnational campaigns unintentionally emphasized environmental conservation at the expense of local dignity-in-life claims, resonated only with select groups, and potentially undermined domestic networking building. The Northern campaigns emphasized World Bank standards that were arguably weak on environmental protection, especially when compared to the environmental justice demands arising in the oil hubs. Indeed, community participation, environmental health regulation, and economic redistribution may be better achieved through grassroots efforts that target the state, rather than through transnational engagement dependent on international bodies and concerns.

AB  - Using critical race structuralism (CRS), a new contribution, as well as primary and secondary data, this article explores the role of science in teaching social justice issues in urban education. In the United States, a teaching workforce, which is predominately White, middle class, and female, intersects with an increasingly diverse student population, creating a need for culturally responsive teaching practices, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) classes. An investigation of existing literature reveals the need for greater emphasis on environmental racism and social justice as they pertain to students living in low-income and urban communities. Our findings reveal that CRS can be utilized in a collective effort to transform teacher education programs and teacher pedagogy, to effectively address environmental racism and other social justice issues in urban schools and communities.

AB  - Through the critical lens of Julia Kristeva's concept of abjection, this essay analyzes representations of the body in Indra Sinha's 2007 novel Animal's People, arguing that such representations encode the author's conceptions of and responses to the marginalization of environmental justice communities in modern India and the Global South. Reading Sinha's depictions of the bodies of disaster victims and their allies, I contend Sinha mobilizes the abject as an oppositional mode that offers a possible ground of resistance to neo-colonial configurations of power, configurations produced in part by the pervasive and increasing encroachment of multinational corporations on national sovereignty and individual rights. I also maintain that the bodies of the victims do not tell the whole story of Sinha's complex response to the plight of these communities. Rather, Sinha also articulates important connections between bodily materiality, corporate personhood, and corporate guilt. Ultimately, I argue, Sinha's effort to seek redress for environmental justice communities involves the reintroduction of the bodies of victim and perpetrator into narrative in order to foreground the body as a crucial rhetorical element in a contest between marginalized people and the gargantuan powers that oppose and oppress them.

AB  - Urban planning for health equity should be guided by an intersectional approach. Intersectionality is an essential framework for understanding the multiple overlapping factors, such as social and economic inequalities, that produce health disparities. We offer four strategies that planning researchers and practitioners can use to develop and integrate an intersectional approach into planning for health equity: challenging implicit and explicit assumptions, building cross-sectoral coalitions united by a shared vision for social and environmental justice, applying transdisciplinary and co-designing approaches throughout the planning process, and using existing tools to evaluate the impact of programs and policies on advancing health equity.

AB  - To address disparities in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for racial/ethnic minority groups, this study characterized personal and ambient concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a suspected hot spot of air pollution - the Village of Waterfront South (WFS), and an urban reference community - the Copewood/Davis Streets (CDS) neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey. Both are minority-dominant, impoverished communities. We collected 24-h integrated personal air samples from 54 WFS residents and 53 CDS residents, with one sample on a weekday and one on a weekend day during the summer and winter seasons of 2004-2006. Ambient air samples from the center of each community were also collected simultaneously during personal air sampling. Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) presented higher (p < 0.05) ambient levels in WFS than in CDS, particularly during weekdays. A stronger association between personal and ambient concentrations of MTBE and TEX was found in WFS than in CDS. Fourteen to forty-two percent of the variation in personal MTBE, hexane, benzene, and TEX was explained by local outdoor air pollution. These observations indicated that local sources impacted the community air pollution and personal exposure in WFS. The estimated cancer risks resulting from two locally emitted VOCs, benzene and ethylbenzene, and non-cancer neurological and respiratory effects resulting from hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylenes exceeded the US EPA risk benchmarks in both communities. These findings emphasized the need to address disparity in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for the socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This study also demonstrated that air pollution hot spots similar to WFS can provide robust setting to investigate health effects of ambient air pollution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to apply an intersectional environmentalist lens to the circular economy (CE) transition in Flanders. CE discourse often takes a deterritorialised approach, that is, a focus on innovation and growth. This approach tends to neglect local knowledge and background skills that can inhabit and work with landscapes in balanced ways to enable a fully circular society. This knowledge is partly embodied by "nobodied" actors. After introducing relevant terminology, this article draws upon a collaborative autoethnography which integrates autobiographies of authors' experiences of circularity in projects with "nobodied" CE actors, and ethnographic notes on the Flemish context in which the CE discourse developed. The reflections unearth how a lack of an intersectional environmentalist lens in the CE rhetoric "nobodies" informal CE actors and practices. We show how they do not matter in a circular economy in a deterritorialised approach, but how they matter in a circular landscape view.

AB  - With increasing focus on the associations between green space and the health of disadvantaged groups such as the elderly, children, and low-income people, there is still inconsistent evidence in the literature from the perspective of environmental justice in China. Thus, this study re-examines the impact of green space on self rated health, mental health and physical capability based on a comprehensive survey of Lilong communities in Shanghai in 2016. We employed several types of greenness indicator at the community level, including park accessibility, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), eye-level green visibility, and satisfaction with neighborhood green-space provision. Our results show that there is no significant relationship between neighborhood greenness and Lilong residents' general health, with neighborhood greenness more strongly associated with Lilong residents' mental than physical health. For vulnerable neighborhoods, of the various greenness assessment metrics studied, self-reported satisfaction with the level of greenness is shown to have the most consistent positive effect on people's health outcomes.

AB  - White-collar workers, with tremendous work pressure, excessive working hours, and poor physical condition, need green spaces not only to have physical exercise and social gatherings, but also to become closer to nature and to relieve stress for their mental health. In China, the 996 office schedule, working from 09:00 to 17:00 six days a week, has become popular in the workplace; under such high-intensity work and pressure, white-collar workers have limited time to access green space for leisure, and their use of green space for health benefits is compromised. This study selected Shenzhen Futian Central Business District to find out the green space use patterns and preferences of white-collar workers based on GPS data and questionnaire surveys. In addition, the value of green exposure in the time dimension was calculated according to individuals' actual behaviors. Based on cluster analysis, this study summarized the typical green space use patterns of three groups of white-collar workers, which reflects the hidden inequity of white-collar groups who are subjected to varying degrees of spatiotemporal constraints in using green space. This paper puts forward three directions for the optimization of green space allocation, functional facilities, and improved walkability in employment-intensive urban areas. The results provide certain guiding significance for alleviating the mismatch of time and space in green space enjoyment and for improving the spatiotemporal inclusiveness of green spaces in urban central business districts.

AB  - Urban public space is indispensable in a metropolitan environment. In recent years, green space, as an important part of that public space, has been studied in terms of its pattern and equity of accessibility. However, the pattern of urban public space, including streets, has not yet been studied, nor has it been studied among different countries. To resolve this gap in information, this study conducted a quantitative comparison on the general pattern, type pattern, and scale pattern of urban public space between Zurich in Switzerland and the old city of Nanjing in China. This study also explored using the location quotient method to quantify the pattern of urban public space and its physical structure characteristics. The results show the difference between urban public space in China and Europe exists not only in quantity, scale or type, but also in the pattern of the urban public space system, including the choice of location, distribution status, and service level of that public space. The maximum location quotient of Zurich's public space is 9.5 for the areas located in the urban core area. Meanwhile, it is 8.5 for Nanjing for areas located in the periphery of the old city. Areas with a location quotient of greater than one cover 63.3% of the urban construction land in Zurich, while only 30.8% of the corresponding urban construction land is covered in Nanjing. The area and quantity of streets are quite different as well. The street areas of Zurich account for 51.5% of the total area of public space and the number of streets account for 51.2% of the total number of public space sites, while those numbers are only 22.6% and 17.5% for Nanjing, respectively. In addition, the scale gradient of public space is polarized. Both the area ratio and quantity ratio of medium, medium-large, and large public space in Zurich exceed 92%, while the area ratio and quantity ratio of Nanjing are less than 77% and 68%, respectively. This study provides important insights for revealing urban public space patterns to facilitate the sustainability development of urban public space.

AB  - Urban parks play a key role in urban sustainable development. This paper proposes a method for the evaluation of public parks from the perspective of accessibility and quality. The method includes the data extraction of urban park locations and the delineation of urban built-up areas. The processing of urban park data not only involves the extraction from digital maps, but also the classification of urban parks using a semi-automated model in ArcGIS. The urban area is identified using the Point of Interest (POI) data in digital maps, taking economic and human activities into consideration. The service area and its overlapped time is included in the evaluation indicators. With a clear definition of park and urban built-up area, the evaluation result of urban parks is of great comparability. Taking China as an example, the quality of urban parks in 273 prefecture-level cities has been evaluated. The results show that the average service coverage of urban parks in Chinese cities is 64.8%, and that there are significant disparities between cities with different population sizes and locations. The results suggest the necessity to improve public parks in small-and-medium sized cities and inland areas to strengthen the coordination of urbanization and regional development.

AB  - Understanding the complex impact of air pollution is crucial to assessing exposure risk and defining public health policies in China. However, the evidence and hence knowledge of how urban activity responds to air pollution are limited. In this paper, we propose to use geotagged check-in records on Weibo, a Tweeter-like platform, to systematically investigate the effect of air pollution on urban activity. Based on panel models, we found clear evidence that such effect exists and varies between pollutants, visitors and residents, and different activity types. Typically, SO2 has the largest impact, followed by PM2.5, NO2, and PM10; local citizens' activities are more susceptible than visitors; leisure-related activity has a sensitivity at least twofold higher than work-related activities. Additionally, we tested hypotheses about the heterogeneous effect. We confirmed the role of Income and air quality, showing that people who live in richer and more polluted cities are more likely to experience the effects of air pollution. Specifically, people who live in a more polluted city with 100 unit increments in AvgAQI show on average the same sensitivity as those who live in a less polluted city and earn about 20.3 thousand yuan more in average Income. This reveals new insights about environmental injustice in China. By presenting a portrait of the spatial heterogeneity, we argued that environmental injustice in terms of air pollution is not just about the difference in exposure risk measured based on population distribution, rather the measurement should also consider the disparity derived from urban activity. Secondly, new injustice may arise in underdeveloped areas where manufacture industry is transferred to but people barely take avoidance behavior. Finally, the map also reveals the general neglect of the detrimental effect of light air pollution, which we speculate is partly due to China's comparatively low standard in governmental regulations. We believe our finding contributes significantly to exposure risk assessment and environmental justice debates. Hence it highlights the necessity and urgency of public healthy polices that spread the health consequence of air pollution, especially in the underdeveloped region.

AB  - Urban greenery is essential to the living environment of humans. Objectively assessing the rationality of the spatial distribution of green space resources will contribute to regional greening plans, thereby reducing social injustice. However, it is difficult to propose a reasonable greening policy aimed at the coordinated development of an urban agglomeration due to a lack of baseline information. This study investigated the changes in spatial fairness of the greenery surrounding residents in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay by examining time-series remote sensing images from 1997 to 2017. With the substitution of impervious, artificial surfaces for universal areas of human activities, we quantified the amount of surrounding greenery from the perspective of human activities at the pixel level by utilizing a nested buffer. The Gini coefficient was further calculated for each city to quantify the spatial fairness of the surrounding greenery to people. The results indicated that areas with less greenery surrounding them decreased during 1997 and 2017 in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay. The spatial fairness did not tend to increase with the improvements in the overall greening level. The spatial fairness of 4 cities had an increasing trend, and the Gini coefficients of 5 cities were still over 0.6 in 2017. We further proposed different greening policy suggestions for different cities based on the amount of greenery surrounding people and the trend in fairness. The results and the conclusion of this research will help to improve future regional greening policies and to reduce environmental injustice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the transition to carbon-free economy, concerns have grown about the ?green divide? ? the separation of society into different social groups whose socioeconomic status determines one?s well-being from climate change impacts. Studies in environmental justice concur that the adverse effects of urban climate change are disproportionately greater for the demographically vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, the children, and the socially marginalized. Yet, little is known about how these social groups contribute to urban climate change policies. Accounting for local climate risks and the presence of national adaptation schemes, this study examines whether the implementation of adaptation policies in the 902 European cities is influenced by the proportion of these vulnerable groups. Our results show a positive and significant association between the proportion of elderly citizens and adaptation policies among these European cities. The result of this study offers local level empirical evidence to the climate justice discussion and suggests that the adaptation policies adopted by these European cities are working to ameliorate environmental injustice faced by the older and weaker social groups.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) plays an essential role in sustainable urban development and is closely related to public health and human well-being. The inequity of UGS violates environmental justice and threatens the life quality of residents. Although previous studies have examined UGS distribution and the disparity between social groups, they seldom consider the spatial heterogeneity of the UGS inequity for the vulnerable. To find out which vulnerable groups are suffering the insufficiency of UGS resources and to identify the specific spaces with severe UGS inequity in the context of high-density cities, this study employed a geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to investigate the spatial relationship between UGS availability and neighborhood vulnerable socio-economic variables in Guangzhou, China. Results showed that the older adults, less-educated population, immigrants, and households with a living area below 50m2 in more than half of the neighborhoods in Guangzhou were suffering UGS inequity. These neighborhoods were detected spatially and had different spatial agglomeration characteristics. Based on this, the UGS inequity level of each neighborhood was comprehensively evaluated so that we can identify the spaces facing serious UGS inequity issues that should be paid attention to in future UGS system planning and policymaking.

AB  - This paper theorises the spatialisation of White supremacy through the siting and expansion of a US immigrant detention centre, the Northwest Detention Center (NWDC). This case reveals the spatial relationship between the detention centre's displacement with the Seattle-Tacoma region's increasing wealth, highlighting the role of detention and incarceration in the spatialisation of White supremacy. If White advantage maps onto whiteness as property, then White supremacy maps onto interlocking systems of settler colonialism and racial capitalism that dispossess people of colour of land and turns their bodies into devalued pollution sinks, where the less-than-citizen is forced to live on Tar Pits that they cannot even call "home". Since 2014, detained immigrants' activism has fuelled conversations about the punitive nature of administrative immigrant detention, racial profiling, and the city's responsibility to enforce health, safety and environmental regulations for all residents. Through the stories of detainees, deportees and their co-conspirators, this site fight illustrates how abolition ecologies call for tearing down toxic detention centres. Beyond rejecting White supremacist logics in immigration enforcement, abolitionists make freedom as a place together.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGSs) are important for urban residents' well-being, especially in dense urban areas. This study uses Macau, a high-density city in Asia, as a case study area and tracks changes in the distribution of UGS accessibility across space and across population groups from 2010 to 2015. Based on the two-step floating catchment area model (2SFCA), the results indicate that UGS accessibility is distributed unevenly across space and population groups in Macau. Over time, however, UGS accessibility became more evenly distributed, despite the decline in overall UGS accessibility. These changes are attributable to the policies of upgrading UGSs and building micro-scale UGSs. These results shed light on how future policies can enhance UGS equity in high density urban areas.

AB  - Young people are both among the generations to be most affected by climate change and critical-advocates for climate action. In the face of growing urgency surrounding the climate crisis, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has become an important institutional framework for political progress. We developed a community-based participatory action research project centered on youth involved in the COP climate negotiations. A "leverage points" approach guided our research; this paper is the first time the framework has been applied in an international negotiations context. Our-findings point to the structural power, networks, and paradigms that youth might engage with for international climate justice work. We identify actionable leverage points through which youth-organizers might increase their social power in the COP process to bring about climate action. Many of these -leverage points are rooted in dynamics of power, which we expand upon and connect to broader literature. Moving forward, these findings can benefit and inform the strategies of youth as they participate in the COP process.

AB  - This Note seeks to paint a picture of what working toward environmental justice should look like. Focusing on the demands that environmental justice communities voiced through the Principles of Environmental Justice, it posits that three key components are necessary to comprehensively achieve environmental justice: distributive justice, recognitional justice, and procedural justice. Common understandings of environmental justice often miss either one or both of the latter two components. This Note puts a name on work that simultaneously addresses all three: comprehensive environmental justice work. By developing a common understanding of comprehensive environmental justice, this Note aims to ensure that those who care about achieving environmental justice understand the need to address each component. For environmental justice supporters and partners who are eager to contribute to the movement in the most efficient and effective way, a common understanding of comprehensive environmental justice work can aid in identifying which organizations deserve their resources. For lawyers who aim to aid the movement, a common understanding will contextualize their role in the movement and the components they are addressing. Part I recounts the events leading up to the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit and adoption of the Principles of Environmental Justice. Part II traces the government's attempts to implement environmental justice. Part III evaluates the role of the lawyer in actualizing this understanding of comprehensive environmental justice. Part IV assesses an Earthjustice-led coalition's role in alleviating blood-lead-level disparities in environmental justice communities in a recent Ninth Circuit case. Part V briefs policy implications of a fragmented understanding of environmental justice. Finally, by identifying good practices that large organizations are currently employing, I conclude with some guideposts for empowering rather than usurping the communities who founded the environmental justice movement.

AB  - With the rapid spatial expansion of the warehousing industry in major metropolitan areas, environmental impacts associated with warehousing activities have been growing in the recent decades. This study focuses on the disproportionate distribution of warehousing facilities in disadvantaged neighborhoods and discusses how the disparities result from the interactions between various socioeconomic processes. From the perspective of environmental justice, warehousing-related environmental hazards affect the spatial relationship between warehouses and local communities. The changing factors in the firm location choice of warehousing facilities and the housing location choice of disadvantaged population jointly lead to the environmental justice problem in warehousing location.

AB  - Warehousing activities generate substantial externalities that affect surrounding neighborhoods. Using data for four major metropolitan areas in California, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, this study tests the relationship between the spatial distribution of warehouses and disadvantaged neighborhoods. The results based on spatial presentation and statistical models show that warehouses are disproportionately located in minority neighborhoods, regardless of the differences in urban contexts. In specific, medium-income and low-income minority neighborhoods are more likely to have higher concentration of warehouses than medium-or low-income white ones. The four metros are diversified in the roles of global trade, land availability, and the size of the warehousing industry. However, the spatial patterns are found consistent across these metros, suggesting that the environmental justice problem in warehousing location is a common concern. Local governments should monitor and evaluate the rapid spatial expansion of warehousing facilities and make efforts to mitigate subsequent environmental impacts that are disproportionately located in disadvantaged communities.

AB  - Warehousing activities generate substantial environmental externalities that affect surrounding neighborhoods. Using data from the Los Angeles region, this study tests the relationship between the spatial distribution of warehouses and neighborhoods with different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The results show that warehouses are disproportionately located in both low-income and medium-income minority neighborhoods. The distribution of warehousing facilities and activities is highly related to the percentage of minorities as expected, but its relationship with household income is nonetheless mixed. In the Los Angeles region, low-income neighborhoods are not always attractive to warehouse developers because they are not convenient for warehousing development.

AB  - This study examines the distribution of commercial treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) of hazardous waste in the southeast. Four hypotheses are tested: (1) economic rationality, (2) social inequity, (3) civic capital, and (4) scientific rationality. The data set is a match of records on operational TSDFs and large quantity generators (LQGs) of hazardous waste from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, nonprofit organization data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics, and seismic hazard and hydrologic data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Logistic regression results indicate that location outcomes are predictable by the distribution of civic capital assets, the racial composition of a community, the hydrologic suitability of a land use, and TSDF proximity to LQGs. The concentration of LQG activity and the percentage of African Americans in a neighborhood are the most consistent predictors of TSDF location outcomes across spatial measures of risk.

AB  - This chapter engages with biocultural approaches to conservation to affirm the growing need and application of frameworks to address power, rights, and indigenous perspectives in local to global environmental problems. Through a case study that focuses on M.bengokre-Kayapo peoples' projects for water sovereignty, I describe the sociopolitical and institutional contexts and cultural perspectives that shape Kayapo engagements with aquatic environment. While river and riparian habitats are central to Kayapo livelihoods and political goals, Kayapo understandings of aquatic landscapes are not central to national and international visions of sustainable Amazonian futures. These visions fashion the Amazon as a conservation-development mosaic instead of a bioculturally diverse homeland. I argue that bicultural approaches are particularly well-suited to highlight these different perspectives on policy and practice and to shift conversation paradigms in a way that can accommodate Kayapo Peoples' and other Indigenous Peoples' strategies to retain a good or mejkumrej life.

AB  - This paper explores the extent to which global environmental justice can serve to serve to interpret negotiations over international transboundary waters. Trade-offs are considered in terms of their spatial and temporal features, while the biophysical traits of water are found to shape the cast and behaviour of actors and institutions suffering injustices, or ignoring or opposing justice claims. Applications of the frame to recent negotiations along the Nile and Jordan rivers show that inequitable outcomes can be entrenched by apparently fair processes. The negotiations procedures do not recognize the power asymmetry that exists between the actors, and thus fail on Rawls' precondition of equality for justice, suggesting that while distribution may be a necessary condition for justice, process alone is not necessarily so. The analysis also finds that focus on the international can obscure injustices at the sub-national level, and that environmental issues must be considered within the social justice context they derive from. One practical implication is that evaluations of negotiations over international transboundary waters should consider their outcome first, followed by investigation of the asymmetry in power that undermines the processes.

AB  - This paper applies a "justice" lens to the struggle of the people displaced by the Merowe Dam in northern Sudan. Application of distributive, procedural, and representational aspects of justice exposes the dissatisfaction of the affected people with the government's offer and execution of compensation. Consideration of social justice and the utility of norms in trans-national activism brings into sharp focus the difference in interests, and abilities of the many actors involved, and highlights the government's tactics to divide the communities, and the social divisions sown. As the struggle develops, justice claims are seen to change towards less material issues, suggesting that an expanded and dynamic conception of justice is more helpful than narrow or time-bound conceptions. The findings are of relevance to communities facing possible displacement from dams planned nearby, not least of all for the insight provided on the effectiveness of different tactics in the struggle.

AB  - This contribution looks at those Small Island Developing States that are doomed to disappear due to anthropogenic climate change. The citizens of these states will not only lose their physical homeland but also their social structure and cultural community. The focus here is on cultural loss. While its subjective importance is easy to grasp, it is harder to see cultural loss as a matter of justice. This paper first presents an account of why cultural loss is often seen as merely unfortunate but not unjust. Against these worries, the paper argues that we have a right that no one threatens our social bases of self-respect and that societal cultures are one important base of self-respect. The discussion concludes that anthropogenic climate change affects peoples' rights with regard to the cultural dimension and that therefore adaptation efforts ought to protect the social bases of self-respect of those climate refugees whose physical, political, and cultural existence is threatened by our inability to keep emissions below safe levels.

The essay aims to demonstrate one avenue for integrating Life Death within the greater landscape of new materialist rhetorical theory as well as within the rhetoric of science. To do so, it examines the genetic impacts of lead poisoning in marginalized communities to posit how rhetoric links together research in the life sciences and humanities to explain the relationship between genetic alterations and structural discrimination.

AB  - This essay is an impassioned epitaph conveying the teachings of Joti wise persons from the Venezuelan Amazon who passed away recently. It honors their wish to spread the philosophy of jkyo jkwaini, which holds that loving-caring for everyone and everything around us is an essential human trait that holds the key to sustaining all life. If this innate faculty is nurtured, it gives people the power to maintain or even enhance the living world; if suppressed, its absence will inevitably lead to the degeneration and demise of the world. Their essential message urges everyone to use the dynamism of love already present within us to reverse the dominant trend of exploiting nature selfishly. An environmental ethic of loving-caring can actually be found in disparate cultural traditions, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. (Re)establishing loving-caring as a central guiding principle for organizing human ecological dynamics is already taking place in different urban and rural settings globally. Vital connections between ancient eco-philosophies and contemporary ecosocial movements are highlighted in order to show that real possibilities exist for building ecotopias moving forward. These arguments are attuned to postulates for biocultural conservation endorsed by ethnobiologists, Indigenous rights advocates, and environmental activists. Case studies are mentioned to stress the common ground shared by a diverse assortment of stakeholders.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is an important component of urban resources which contributes to human physical and mental health. Studies on the accessibility of UGS under the two-step floating catchment (2SFCA) framework have recently received much attention. However, the effects of people's actual mobility patterns have not been fully considered in current studies. Proposed in this study is an improved accessibility model called AM-Ga2SFCA, which refines the traditional Gaussian 2SFCA method with the actual mobility information extrac-ted from mobile phone big data and online map. A new attractiveness index of UGS is implemented by combining the popularity evaluated by the PageRank algorithm and the actual utilisation based on buffer analysis. In addition, realistic travel time between each demand point and UGS is retrieved from the online map, which is further introduced into AM-Ga2SFCA as the travel cost. A case study is conducted in Shenzhen, China to validate the proposed model. Results show that the accessibility of UGS is strongly correlated with regional urbanization level, for example, higher accessibility generally occurred in the region with developed transportation and rich green resources. From the perspective of age groups and travel modes, we found that the environmental justice issue had already occurred in Shenzhen especially for the non-elderly: under the walk mode, nearly 80% of the non-elderly only shared 20% of UGS whilst approximately 80% of the elderly shared 30% of UGS. However, taxi or private vehicles can effectively alleviate the aforementioned phenomenon by reducing the Gini index to less than 0.5. The proposed model is expected to advance the understanding of UGS accessibility and facilitate effective planning to reduce environmental justice.

AB  - This paper evaluates the real effects of environmental justice reform on environmental governance at the firm level. Using the establishment of environmental courts in China as a quasi-natural experiment, our difference-in-differences estimation shows that: (1) environmental courts significantly enhance environmental investment by firms, and this relationship is robust to different specifications and alternative measures; (2) three possible channels are the improved levels of justice and enforcement of environmental protection, and the mitigation of local government intervention; (3) our findings are particularly pronounced in subsamples with severe local protectionism, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and non-SOEs with political connections; (4) at the city-level, environmental courts significantly increase air quality and promote cities to cross the inflection point of the environmental Kuznets curve earlier. Overall, this paper reveals the micro-mechanisms behind the real effects of environmental justice on firm environmental investment, thus providing timely implications for regulators concerned with environmental protection.

AB  - This study examines residents' housing decisions in a multihazard environment (flood, hurricane, and toxic chemicals). The combination of a hedonic price model and a household survey conducted in Harris County, Texas, indicates that flood hazard was an important factor in households' housing decisions, but not hurricane and toxic materials hazards. The results have further suggested that home buyers were poorly informed about hurricane and toxic materials hazards when housing decisions were made and came to understand their vulnerability only while living in hazard-prone neighborhoods. Moreover, it appears that low-income households and minorities were the least-informed group in the housing market. These findings provide implications for using hazard information programs to promote community resilience to natural hazards and community environmental justice.

AB  - Urban parks improve the quality of urban ecological environment and residents' physical and mental health. Existing studies have measured their spatial distribution in terms of accessibility or quality, however, this is not effective. Here, this study developed a spatial distribution assessment framework for urban parks, which included four dimensions: convenient degree (D-1), crowded degree (D-2), diversity of choices (D-3), and service quality (D-4). Taking Beijing as an example, we analyzed the difference in park distribution and found that park distribution is relatively equitable except for convenient degree. However, there are significant differences from the city center to the periphery. The inner-city area has better convenience, while the middle areas have more choices, and the outer ring performs better in terms of D-2 and D-4. There are significant gaps among communities with different housing prices. We found a gentrification trend within the Low, Middle-Low, and High price groups when analyzing the intra-group differences. This study can help urban planners and policymakers to better identify the gaps in park distribution and provide directions for optimizing the layout.

AB  - Urban public green space (UPGS) plays an important role in sustainable development. In China, the planning, classification, and management of green spaces are based on the Standard for Classification of Urban Green Space (SCUGS). However, limitations to the UPGS exist due to the over-emphasis on quantitative standards and insufficient consideration of the actual access mode of residents. Though the taxi trajectory data are widely selected to study public service facilities, its adoption in UPGSs research remains limited. Based on the case of UPGSs in the three districts of Shenzhen, we used the taxi (including cruise taxis and Didi cars, which are like Uber) trajectory data to investigate the spatial layout and the allocation of management resource of the UPGSs from the spatial interaction perspective. By rasterizing and visualizing the percentage of pick-up and drop-off points in the UPGSs' buffer, the service scope of UPGSs was defined, which reflected the spatial distribution and activity intensity of the visitors. Then, an unsupervised classification method was introduced to reclassify the twenty two municipal parks in the three districts. Compared to the traditional planning method, the results show that the service scope of the same type of UPGS in the traditional classification is not the same as the one obtained by the study. Visitors to all UPGSs are distributed as a quadratic function and decay as the distance increases. In addition, the attenuation rates of the same type of UPGSs are similar. The findings of this study are expected to assist planners in improving the spatial layout of UPGSs and optimizing the allocation of UPGS management resources based on new classifications.

AB  - This paper offers both theoretical and empirical analyses to explore energy justice from a policy perspective. We first propose a framework that explicitly connects core functions of clean energy policy instruments (i.e., regulation, financial incentive, government provision, information, and education program) to philosophical groundings of energy justicedistributive, procedural, and recognition justice. To empirically explore distributive energy justice, we examine the racial and socioeconomic disparities in three government-driven clean energy programs in the United States, including (1) the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) smart-grid investment grant (SGIG); (2) utility smart-meter roll out programs; and (3) city government adoption of green buildings. Results showed that the amount of ARRA funding awarded to utilities was closely related to racial composition. Inequalities were also found in utility smart-meter programs. Utilities operating in communities with a larger Hispanic population were less likely to initiate smart-meter roll out. The intensity of smart-meter technology implementation was positively correlated with education levels. Our third empirical case showed that government procurement policy can improve distributive equity for energy-efficient buildings. However, its spillover effects on the private sector can result in more adoptions in areas with fewer minorities and more highly-educated residents.

AB  - Trauma is considered a modern civilized sickness, and its occurrence substantially affects all of society, as well as individuals. The implementation of trauma emergency systems in cities with young, prosperous, and highly mobile populations is necessary and significant. A complete trauma emergency system includes both low-level trauma centers that offer basic emergency services and high-level trauma centers that offer comprehensive services. GIS and operational research methods were used to solve the location problem associated with these centers. This study analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of trauma demands and the candidate locations of trauma centers based on a spatial analysis and presented a hierarchical location-allocation model for low- and high-level trauma centers in Shenzhen. The response, coverage, treatment and cost capacities of the trauma center locations were considered, and an ant colony optimization was used to calculate the optimal solution. The objectives of this study were to optimize trauma center locations, improve the allocation of medical trauma resources and reduce the rate of deaths and disabilities due to trauma.

State relations to indigenous social movements highlight the use of Living Well and Earth Mother concepts through accommodation, resistance, and protaganism. Six active issues of environmental governance are examined: (1) climate change and justice movement; (2) agrarian reform, agrobiodiversity, and food justice; (3) water resources; (4) indigenous territories; (5) Protected Areas; and (6) extractive industries (mining, hydrocarbons). The usages of Living Well and Earth Mother show versatility as they have been mobilized in the respatializing of the politics and social-power dynamics of environmental issues at scales of the state, global and international institutions, and community and local levels. Analysis also reveals deployment of Living Well and Earth Mother that is discursively influential and yet conceptually reduced and unevenly applied, thus suggesting a characteristic of verisimilitude. My analysis determines that respatialization at various levels, including territorial transitions of sub-national regional spaces, are associated with the heightened articulation of environmental governance through indigeneity and "speaking like an indigenous state" amid resource nationalism. Linkages and logics operating within this conjuncture differ from the prevailing interpretation of the Bolivian state's use of Living Well and Earth Mother as solely an unwitting contradiction or instrumentalist camouflage.

AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of the Kriging interpolation model and the Emission Weighted Proximity Model (EWPM) in assessing relative exposure risk of air pollution using results from the American Meteorological Society/EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD) as benchmarks. We used simulated exposure risk to SO2 in the Dallas area in Texas in this evaluation. Results suggest that the relative exposure risks to SO2 at different locations in the study area as estimated by EWMP are closer to estimated risks from AERMOD when compared with the results calculated by Kriging. In addition, study results also indicate that the relative exposure risks calculated by Kriging are similar to those from AERMOD when the density of emission sources in the area in question is high. It is therefore concluded that relative exposure risks determined by both the Kriging interpolation method and the EWPM are acceptable when it is not possible to use AERMOD. In situations when the density of emission sources is low in the study area, EWPM is a better choice than Kriging.

AB  - Tidal marshes are one of the world's most economically valuable habitats; yet, they have experienced large and persistent declines globally. Increased knowledge of the ecosystem services delivered by marshes has become a powerful tool to conserve and restore them. But hesitancies regarding valuations and their application in decision-making remain. Here we draw on the literature and collective experience of participants in the "Concepts and controversies in tidal Marsh ecology revisited" workshop, November 2 and 3, 2019, Mobile, AL, to provide a concise snapshot of the current field of salt marsh ecosystem service valuation, discuss the possible risks in salt marsh valuation, and the importance of stakeholder engagement to mitigate them. We provide examples of the application of valuation in conservation-related decision-making, illustrating the growing operationalization of ecosystem services in incentivizing salt marsh conservation and restoration. Ecosystem service quantification and valuation is already playing an important role in decision-making by coastal risk managers, insurers, engineers, and policy makers. While there are legitimate criticisms of valuation techniques and remaining uncertainties in ecosystem service delivery that arise both through natural variability across space and time and through differing and shifting cultural values, our perspective is that the rise of big data, the development of valuation techniques, a growing understanding and application of environmental justice practices, and increasing interdisciplinarity to tackle these complex issues are paving the way for valuation to play a critical role in decision-making around salt marshes.

AB  - Using data on the geographic location of fracking wells in four U.S. states with mandatory disclosure between 2011 and 2013 Colorado, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas this paper analyzes the socio-demographic characteristics of people living close to fracking activity. Geo-coded well data from the FracFocus registry are merged to blockgroup-level socio-demographic data from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey and population density and land use data from EPA's Smart Location Database 2010. Different buffer zones around fracking wells are applied to capture effects at different spatial scales and to compare only areas with similar geological properties. We explain the distance to the nearest well within a county with fracking activity or within a buffer zone by race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, various land-use control variables, and county fixed-effects. We find robust evidence that minorities, especially African Americans, disproportionately live near fracking wells, but less consistent evidence for environmental injustice by income or educational attainment. Strong heterogeneity across states can be observed, suggesting that an improvement in disclosure laws in other states, that would make similar analyses possible, is of great importance.

AB  - This paper analyzes how racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to industrial air toxics in U.S. cities vary with neighborhood income, and how these disparities vary regionally across the country. Exposure is estimated at the census block-group level using geographic microdata from the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We find that racial and ethnic disparities in pollution exposure are strongest among neighborhoods with median incomes below $25,000, while income-based disparities are stronger among neighborhoods with median incomes above that level. We also find considerable differences in the patterns of disparity across the ten EPA regions. In the two regions with the highest median exposure (the Midwest and South Central regions), for example, African-Americans and Hispanics face significantly higher exposures than whites, whereas in the region with the next highest exposure (the Mid-Atlantic), the reverse is true. We show that the latter result is attributable to intercity variations - minorities tend to live in the less polluted cities in the region - rather than to within-city variations.
