AB  - A wealth of evidence suggests an important relationship between nature and human health and well-being and this appears to hold particular resonance for coastal environments. Notably, this relationship has been explored in assessments of ecosystem services, or the benefits that people derive from nature. In this paper, we extend the debate to encompass ideas around relational values which considers that human well-being is derived from relationships with nature rather than being solely delivered as the benefits commonly suggested in the ecosystem services literature. The paper draws on conceptual ideas around relational values, sense of place and environmental justice to understand the values and importance of coastal environments for people. These value concepts are explored through detailed narratives revealed by participants in two case study UK coastal locations, using a form of civic dialogue and videography approach called Community Voice Method (CVM). We find that despite levels of relative deprivation in our case study locations, interviewees express values which are striking in terms of the depth of care felt; values which are 'time-deepened' and shaped not only by what people do and are able to do, but also by personal histories and memories which remain strong despite material changes and transformations in people's lives and the places they live. The CVM method in addition provides a practical approach for creating deliberative spaces to explore those deeply embodied and shared connections to the coast which are important and should have greater prominence in coastal management policy and practice.

AB  - Addressing intertwined socio-economic and environmental problems in informal urban areas underscores the need for just sustainability. The co-production of urban housing provides a useful domain to link issues related to sustainability with social and environmental justice. Using the example of an informal settlement re-blocking project, this paper shows how co-production as an approach might or might not promote principles ingrained in just sustainability. The study relied on data collected through semi-structured interviews with residents and key informants as well as transect walks within the settlement. The case shows that working towards just sustainability is not straight-forward. It demands efforts that navigate, with foresight rather than hindsight, the dynamics in multi-scalar contexts into which informal settlements are embedded. Social and institutional structures, processes and relationships producing and reproducing material distribution are crucial to entrenching the just sustainability praxis.

AB  - Background: Pre- and perinatal nutritional status defines the development of adult metabolism and energy balance in humans. Young children in poor households are disproportionately more vulnerable to food insecurity given the cumulative impact of chronic stress on susceptibility to chronic diseases as an adult. Qualitative studies focusing on the experience of food insecurity in Latin America are scarce. In Argentina, although socioeconomic indicators improved in the aftermath of the 2001ecomomic crisis, the disadvantaged provinces in the north continue to bear the burden of historical inequities. The study was conducted among Primary Health Care patients in the city of San Salvador de Jujuy, Argentina. It analyzes environmental and household level stressors through the narratives of mothers with young children living with food insecurity, from the perspectives of eco-developmental conceptual frameworks. Methods: We conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with mothers of children <1 to 6 years of age who participated in maternal-child health programs in Primary Health Care clinics and lived in food insecure households. Interviews focused on the environmental context and the resources and processes for obtaining and preparing daily meals. Results: The Eco-bio-developmental (EBD) framework and the vulnerability-assets approach, provided a basis for conceptualizing the significance of findings. Our results indicated the need to understand pathways in the association of stressors, vulnerability and ill health, as well as the mitigating role of social relationships. For example, understanding the link between the stress of being exposed to environmental contaminants and the capacity to overcome food insecurity, or developing strategies to integrate the support provided by kinship networks like extended families into food security programs. The results also indicate the importance of developing support mechanisms for vulnerable family members like grandmothers in food insecure households who play instrumental roles as providers and caretakers of younger relatives. Conclusion: The empirical evidence generated by this study may inform community based strategies and public health policies to address food insecurity in vulnerable population groups who face health effects from multiple stressors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past 25 years, China has experienced remarkable economic growth and rapid agricultural-to-industrial and rural-to-urban transitions. As a consequence, China now faces many daunting environmental challenges that are significantly affecting human health and quality of life, including indoor and outdoor air pollution, water pollution, deforestation, loss of agricultural land, and sustainability. Chinese government leaders have recently emphasized the need for better environmental protection practices along with interventions involving strong public participation. OBJECTIVES: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is a collaborative approach to research that involves community members, organizational representatives, and researchers as equal participants in all phases of the research process. Over the past 15 years, CBPR has gained recognition and acceptance and is now valued as a means to effect change and provide scientific knowledge relevant to human health and the environment. In this article we highlight the success of CBPR in the United States and suggest that it could be a useful model for addressing environmental health problems in the People's Republic of China. DISCUSSION: CBPR can reduce the tension between science and society by promoting genuine communication, by enabling scientists and administrators to listen and respond to the public, by allowing communities to help shape the research agenda, and by increasing accountability of researchers and governments to the public. CONCLUSIONS: CBPR can potentially help improve environmental health in China, but it is likely to take a different form than it has in the West because the government will be leading the way.

AB  - Alternative food movements work to create more environmentally and economically sustainable food systems, but vary widely in their advocacy for social, racial and environmental justice. However, even those food justice activists explicitly dedicated to equity must respond to the unintended consequences of their work. This paper analyzes the work of activists in Oakland, CA, who have increasingly realized that their gardens, health food stores and farm-to-table restaurants play a role in what scholars have called green gentrification, the upscaling of neighborhoods through the creation of environmental amenities. Gentrification has had grave consequences for the low-income communities of color that food justice activists seek to serve. Activists are reflexive about this dynamic, and have developed strategies to push back against displacement. Most commonly, non-profit organizations and individual social entrepreneurs found businesses that seek to raise the profile of people of color in the trendy Oakland food scene while employing long-term residents in well-paying, green jobs. However, while these efforts are an essential component of a broader agenda to create both food justice and development without displacement, even these relatively high paying (when compared to the industry standard) "good food jobs" cannot keep up with escalating rents. For this reason, we also highlight the direct action and policy-oriented strategies engaged by a smaller number of food justice activists, and argue that these are necessary compliments to a market-based approach.

AB  - Academics and activists highlight the potential for alternative agrifood movements to contribute to the evolving coalescence of justice and sustainability. This potential, however, is constrained by what scholars have identified as the prevalent whiteness of such movements. This paper uses ethnographic research at two northern California farmers markets to investigate how whiteness is performed and perpetuated through the movements' discourses and practices. We found that many managers, vendors and customers hold notions of what farmers and community members should be that both reflect and inform an affluent, liberal habitus of whiteness. Although whiteness pervades these spaces, we have also witnessed individual discourses and acts of solidarity and anti-racism, as well as fledgling institutional efforts to contest white cultural dominance. We conclude by discussing the potential of farmers markets to create an anti-racist politics of food.

AB  - As women take on more leadership roles in the United States advancing social and political change, analysis of women's contributions to the transformation occurring within the energy sector is critically important. Grassroots movements focused on energy justice and energy democracy focus on: (1) resisting the power of large multinational fossil fuel energy companies that exacerbate inequities and disparities in energy, (2) reclaiming the energy sector with more community and public control to redisitrbute benefits and risks, and (3) restructuring the energy sector to prioritize equity and justice with community ownership and distributed governance. This research analyzes women's leadership by focusing on how two women-led, non-profit organizations are advancing the renewable energy transition, operationalizing the concept of energy democracy and contributing to the energy justice movement. The two organizations are Grid Alternatives, a solar installation and workforce training organization, and Mothers Out Front, an advocacy organization focused on addressing climate change by promoting a transition to renewable energy. These organizations differ in their mission and approaches, yet both intentionally link climate and energy action with other forms of social justice activism, by expanding community engagement, strengthening participation, and fundamentally redistributing power to promote a transition to more equitable, resilient and sustainable energy systems. This paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of gender in energy justice and energy democracy movements, and to the practical consideration of the role that women's leadership is playing in accelerating energy system change and advancing the principles of energy justice and energy democracy.

AB  - Although urban greening is universally recognized as an essential part of sustainable and climate-responsive cities, a growing literature on green gentrification argues that new green infrastructure, and greenspace in particular, can contribute to gentrification, thus creating social and racial inequalities in access to the benefits of greenspace and further environmental and climate injustice. In response to limited quantitative evidence documenting the temporal relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification across entire cities, let alone across various international contexts, we employ a spatially weighted Bayesian model to test the green gentrification hypothesis across 28 cities in 9 countries in North America and Europe. Here we show a strong positive and relevant relationship for at least one decade between greening in the 1990s-2000s and gentrification that occurred between 2000-2016 in 17 of the 28 cities. Our results also determine whether greening plays a "lead", "integrated", or "subsidiary" role in explaining gentrification. The relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification is an important one for urbanization. Here the authors show a positive relationship for at least one decade between greening in the 1990s-2000s and gentrification that occurred between 2000-2016 in 17 of 28 studied cities in North America and Europe.

AB  - A growing number of cities are preparing for climate change impacts by developing adaptation plans. However, little is known about how these plans and their implementation affect the vulnerability of the urban poor. We critically assess initiatives in eight cities worldwide and find that land use planning for climate adaptation can exacerbate socio-spatial inequalities across diverse developmental and environmental conditions. We argue that urban adaptation injustices fall into two categories: acts of commission, when interventions negatively affect or displace poor communities, and acts of omission, when they protect and prioritize elite groups at the expense of the urban poor.

AB  - Background Although pesticides have adverse effects on child health and development, little research has examined pesticide exposure among child farmworkers. This analysis addresses two specific aims: (1) describes pesticide exposure among Latinx child farmworkers in North Carolina, and (2) delineates factors associated with this pesticide exposure. Methods In 2018 (n = 173) and 2019 (n = 156) Latinx child farmworkers completed interviews and wore silicone wristbands for a single day to measure pesticide exposure. Wristbands were analyzed for 70 pesticides. Results Most Latinx child farmworkers were exposed to multiple pesticides; the most frequent were pyrethroids (69.9% in 2018, 67.9% in 2019), organochlorines (51.4% in 2018, 55.1% in 2019), and organophosphates (51.4% in 2018, 34.0% in 2019). Children were exposed to a mean of 2.15 pesticide classes in 2018 and 1.91 in 2019, and to a mean of 4.06 pesticides in 2018 and 3.34 in 2019. Younger children (<= 15 years) had more detections than older children; children not currently engaged in farm work had more detections than children currently engaged in farm work. Migrant child farmworkers had more detections than nonmigrants. For specific pesticides with at least 20 detections, detections and concentrations were generally greater among children not currently engaged in farm work than children currently engaged. Conclusions Children who live in farmworker communities are exposed to a plethora of pesticides. Although further research is needed to document the extent of pesticide exposure and its health consequences, sufficient information is available to inform the policy needed to eliminate this pesticide exposure in agricultural communities.

AB  - Although environmental justice has been developed extensively, both theoretically and empirically, its complementary concept, environmental privilege, has received far less scholarly attention, and it has rarely been reflected in empirical geography. Environmental privilege adds an important dimension to environmental justice scholarship, highlighting the importance of understanding environmental inequality by moving from ghettos into places where racial and economic privilege is enjoyed. In this article, I aim to start defining a review of environmental privilege themes and dimensions. Such a review of this social phenomenon will be relevant for the many fields involved in the understanding of pressing sustainability challenges and of human-nature interactions more broadly. I also draw an initial research agenda for addressing environmental privilege in the postpandemic world.

AB  - A species-spanning approach that incorporates clients' relationships with their companion animals into family genograms, schools of social work curricula, continuing education, interviews, assessments, and interventions offers increased career opportunities, professional and personal growth and development, and a more comprehensive resolution of clients' issues, social justice concerns, and the prevention of family violence. This article identifies six reasons why social workers should be cognizant of human-animal relationships and introduces nine ways, with action steps, in which social workers can include these relationships into training and practice outside the more developed field of veterinary social work. These venues include: agencies working in child protection and child sexual abuse; children's advocacy centers and courthouse facility dogs; animal shelters; domestic violence shelters; public policy advocacy; clinical practice; agencies working with older and disabled populations; veterinary sentinels for intimate partner violence; and pet support services for homeless populations. Such attention to the human-animal bond can utilize social workers' problem-solving skills to improve delivery of services, identify clients' risk and resiliency factors, enhance social and environmental justice, expand academic inquiry, and increase attention to all of the vulnerable members of families and communities.

AB  - Background The transition of the Ruhr region in Germany from a hard coal belt into a knowledge-based economy with a dynamic service sector and state of the art universities over the past 60-80 years has been widely touted as a successful example of how just and fair low carbon energy transitions can unfold. Methods This paper leverages documentary analysis of data across a wide array of sources to test these claims and identify lessons by creating a novel just energy transition framework. Results The study finds economic motivation, mindset and reorientation-not environmental concerns-to be the defining features for at least the first two decades of this shift. The lack of willingness to acknowledge environmental impacts and market realities has delayed the transition and led to wasteful allocation of resources towards supporting the hard coal mining industry. The prominence given to distributional justice cushions the victims of this transition financially, but does not allow a broad based coalition to advance the transition process. It is in the second phase (mid-1980s onwards that we see procedural aspects of justice come forth and support greater ownership and sustainability of the transition to emerge, while the evidence of recognition justice continues to be scant. Conclusions There are many nuanced successes in the Ruhr's example, along with some failures worth highlighting. It is in the breakdown of this transition into two distinct phases and their nuances (particularly in the domain of justice) that fresh insights emerge and allow for a better understanding of what constitutes a suitable energy transition in a particular socio-economic and political context. As the international community embarks on ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, it can maximise the benefits and minimise the damages and costs by considering these realities on the ground.

He argues that the three papers (a) demonstrate the geographical approaches necessary for understanding broader social, economic, and environmental consequences of climate change at a range of scales; and (b) allow understanding to be gained of a possible world under changed climate. The author's review highlights assessments that climate changes in the Arctic will provide a variety of geographical outcomes (entailing both opportunity and challenge) for Eurasia and North America. The three important papers, he points out, effectively identify and analyze a regional geography for a future world geographical system, as well as illuminate important scientific and policy issues associated with climate change in Eurasia and the planet's northern rim.

AB  - Aircraft noise and environmental equity in Canada's four largest cities Previous environmental equity studies have examined the spatial distribution of aircraft noise across cities. Their findings show that, in several cities, visible minorities and low-income populations are most affected by aircraft noise. In contrast, one study concludes that well-off populations are the most affected. These contradictory findings support the use of a comparative approach for several cities. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we want to identify if there are groups in the population that are in a situation of inequity to aircraft noise exposure in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary. Then, we want to check if the exposure to the aircraft noise of the different groups varies significantly from one metropolis to another. We use the recommended noise exposure contour maps in Canada: the Noise Exposure Forecasts. Next, four variables are extracted from the 2016 Statistics Canada census at a fine-scale level (dissemination areas): that is, the percentages of low-income, visible minorities, 0- to 15-year-old, and 65-year-old and over populations. The results of a mixed effects logistic regression model show that environmental inequities in terms of exposure to aircraft noise for the four population groups are not consistent from city to city.

AB  - A community-university partnership used community-based participatory research (CBPR) to design, implement, and evaluate a multi-cultural public health campaign to eliminate flammable products and reduce use of products high in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in hardwood floor finishing in Massachusetts. Leading participants were Vietnamese-American organizations and businesses. Following the public health campaign, a multi-lingual survey of self-reported experiences with fires, product use, exposure to outreach activities, and changes made, was conducted with floor finishers. One hundred nine floor finishers responded. Over 40% reported fires at their companies' jobs, mostly caused by lacquer sealers. Over one third had heard radio or TV shows about health and safety in floor finishing, and over half reported making changes as a result of outreach. Exposure to various outreach activities was associated with reducing use of flammable products, increasing use of low-VOC products, and greater knowledge about product flammability. However, most respondents still reported using flammable products. Outreach led by community partners reached large proportions of floor finishers, was associated with use of safer products, and adds to recent work on CBPR with immigrant workers. Continued use of flammable products supports the belief that an enforceable ban was ultimately necessary to eradicate them.

AB  - Athens, Greece has been in economic and social crises after the 2008 global recession, resulting in an increase in wood burning as a cheaper method of residential heating in the winter. Reducing wood burning emissions is a source-specific method to address air quality degradation, and indirectly climate change, through instituting policies aimed at human health co-benefits. In this work, we investigate and quantify the potential health co-benefits from policies reducing outdoor particulate matter (PM) pollution from residential wood burning by assessing the pollution conditions during the 2015 calendar year in Athens, Greece, emphasizing vulnerable populations. We conducted a systematic literature search to extract data regarding effective improvements to outdoor PM due to wood burning interventions, and get a range of potential ambient PM reduction estimates regarding realistic benefits from different interventions. We applied a health impact assessment methodology and used existing Athens specific data to calculate the preventable daily average non-accidental deaths associated with reducing PM, additionally considering low and high socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We found that the reduction in outdoor PM concentration showed the potential to benefit lower SES groups as much as 13.5 times more than the high SES group, representing an opportunity for policies to improve not only the health of the total population but also improve environmental equity and health disparities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on drinking water in the United States has rarely examined-disproportionate exposures to contaminants faced by low-income and minority communities. This study analyzes the relationship between nitrate concentrations in community water systems (CWSs) and the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics of customers. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that CWSs in California's San Joaquin Valley that serve a higher proportion of minority or residents of lower socioeconomic status have higher nitrate levels and that these disparities are greater among smaller drinking water systems. METHODS: We used water quality monitoring data sets (1999-2001) to estimate nitrate levels in CWSs, and source location and census block group data to estimate customer demographics. Our linear regression model included 327 CWSs and reported robust standard errors clustered at the CWS level. Our adjusted model controlled for demographics and water system characteristics and stratified by CWS size. RESULTS: Percent Latino was associated with a 0.04-mg nitrate-ion (NO(3))/L increase in a CWS's estimated NO(3) concentration [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.08 to 0.16], and rate of home ownership was associated with a 0.16-mg NO(3)/L decrease (95% CI, -0.32 to 0.002). Among smaller systems, the percentage of Latinos and of homeownership was associated with an estimated increase of 0.44 mg NO(3)/L (95% CI, 0.03-0.84) and a decrease of 0.15 mg NO(3)/L (95% CI, -0.64 to 0.33), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in smaller water systems, CWSs serving larger percentages of Latinos and renters receive drinking water with higher nitrate levels. This suggests an environmental inequity in drinking water quality.

AB  - Background: Few studies of environmental justice examine inequities in drinking water contamination. Those studies that have done so usually analyze either disparities in exposure/harm or inequitable implementation of environmental policies. The US EPA's 2001 Revised Arsenic Rule, which tightened the drinking water standard for arsenic from 50 mu g/L to 10 mu g/L, offers an opportunity to analyze both aspects of environmental justice. Methods: We hypothesized that Community Water Systems (CWSs) serving a higher proportion of minority residents or residents of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have higher drinking water arsenic levels and higher odds of non-compliance with the revised standard. Using water quality sampling data for arsenic and maximum contaminant level (MCL) violation data for 464 CWSs actively operating from 2005-2007 in California's San Joaquin Valley we ran bivariate tests and linear regression models. Results: Higher home ownership rate was associated with lower arsenic levels (beta-coefficient = -0.27 mu g As/L, 95% (CI), -0.5, -0.05). This relationship was stronger in smaller systems (beta-coefficient = -0.43, CI, -0.84, -0.03). CWSs with higher rates of homeownership had lower odds of receiving an MCL violation (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16, 0.67); those serving higher percentages of minorities had higher odds (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2, 5.4) of an MCL violation. Conclusions: We found that higher arsenic levels and higher odds of receiving an MCL violation were most common in CWSs serving predominantly socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Our findings suggest that communities with greater proportions of low SES residents not only face disproportionate arsenic exposures, but unequal MCL compliance challenges.

AB  - Background and objectives: The human health impact of the historic and current mining and processing of non-ferrous metals in the African Copperbelt is not known. This study assessed the exposure to metals in the population of Katanga, in the south east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, using biomonitoring. Methods: Seventeen metals (including Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, U) and non-metals (including As) were measured by ICP-MS in urine spot samples from 351 subjects (32% women), aged 2-74 yr (mean 33 yr). Forty subjects (controls) lived 400 km outside the mining area; 311 subjects lived in the mining area, either very close (<3 km) (n = 179; 6 communities) or moderately close (3-10 km) (n = 132; 4 communities) to mines or smelting plants. Results: For all metals (except Ni) urinary concentrations were significantly higher in subjects from the mining area than in control subjects. In subjects living very close to mines or smelting plants, the geometric means (25th-75th percentile) of urinary concentrations, expressed as mu g/g creatinine, were 17.8 (10.9-29.0) for As, 0.75 (0.38-1.16) for Cd, 15.7 (5.27-43.2) for Co, 17.1 (8.44-43.2) for Cu, 3.17 (1.47-5.49) for Pb and 0.028 (0.013-0.065) for U, these values being significantly higher than those of subjects living 3-10 km from mines or industrial operations. Urinary Co concentrations were markedly elevated, exceeding 15 mu g/g creatinine in 53% of the subjects, and even 87% of children (< 14 yr), living very close to the mining areas. Urinary As was also high (79% above 10 mu g/g creatinine in subjects living very close to the mining areas). Compared with background values from the US general population, subjects living very close to areas of mining or refining had 4, 43, 5- and 4-fold higher urinary concentrations of Cd, Co, Pb and U, respectively. Conclusions: This first biomonitoring study of metal exposure in the African Copperbelt reveals a substantial exposure to several metals, especially in children. The urinary Co concentrations found in this population are the highest ever reported for a general population. The pathways of exposure and health significance of these findings need to be further investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - After a spout of optimism surrounding Myanmar's so-called democratic transition in the post-2010 period, civil-society organisations and academics are beginning to highlight rampant and violent resource grabs unfolding across the country. Delving into the Northern Tanintharyi landscape in the Southeast, this article aims to understand interrelated dynamics of coastal and agrarian transformation during the state-mediated capitalist transition of the past 30 years. Conceptually developing a landscape-approach that sees individual 'grabs' in a relational manner and as part of broader political-economic struggles, the article shows how the Myanmar military regime sought a conjoined ocean and land control-grab in pursuit of rent extraction from productive foreign capital in fisheries and off-shore gas sectors. Empirically, these dynamics are traced from the scale of regional geopolitical struggles down to two particular villages in Northern Tanintharyi-highlighting resulting processes of differentiation along lines of class and gender. This conceptual framework and explanation of drivers behind ocean and land control-grabbing, in turn, complicates prevalent policy solutions in Myanmar (and elsewhere) that reduce the question of resolving resource-grabs to the pursuit of an elusive 'good governance'.

AB  - A mounting body of research shows strong positive associations between urban nature and child well-being, including benefits related to mental and physical health. However, there is also evidence that children are spending less time in natural environments than previous generations, especially those living in deprived neighborhoods. To date, most studies analyzing children's (unequal) exposure or access to urban green and blue spaces focus on residential metrics while a school-based perspective, also an essential part of children's daily experience, is still understudied. The overall goal of this research is to assess spatially the amount and main components of green infrastructure within and around a sample of primary schools (n = 324) in the city of Barcelona, Spain, and to examine the equity implications of its distributional patterns. A multi-method approach based on GIS, correlation and cluster analyses, and an online survey, is used to identify these patterns of inequity according to three main dimensions: socio-demographic disparities across neighborhoods; school type (public, charter and private); and the frequency of outdoor educational activities organized by schools. Results show that schools located in the wealthiest neighborhoods are generally greener, but inequities are not observed for school surrounding green infrastructure indicators such as access to public green spaces or between public and charter schools. Survey results also indicate that greener schools generally organize more nature-based outdoor activities than those with less exposure to urban nature. In the light of these findings, we contend that multiple indicators of green infrastructure and different dimensions of equity should be considered to improve justice in the implementation of school-based re-naturing and outdoor educational programs.

AB  - Background: Human biomonitoring (HBM) has rapidly gained importance. In some epidemiological studies, the measurement and use of biomarkers of exposure, susceptibility and disease have replaced traditional environmental indicators. While in HBM, ethical issues have mostly been addressed in terms of informed consent and confidentiality, this paper maps out a larger array of societal issues from an epistemological perspective, i.e. bringing into focus the conditions of how and what is known in environmental health science. Methods: In order to analyse the effects of HBM and the shift towards biomarker research in the assessment of environmental pollution in a broader societal context, selected analytical frameworks of science studies are introduced. To develop the epistemological perspective, concepts from "biomedical platform sociology" and the notion of "epistemic cultures" and "thought styles" are applied to the research infrastructures of HBM. Further, concepts of "biocitizenship" and "civic epistemologies" are drawn upon as analytical tools to discuss the visions and promises of HBM as well as related ethical problematisations. Results: In human biomonitoring, two different epistemological cultures meet; these are environmental science with for instance pollution surveys and toxicological assessments on the one hand, and analytical epidemiology investigating the association between exposure and disease in probabilistic risk estimation on the other hand. The surveillance of exposure and dose via biomarkers as envisioned in HBM is shifting the site of exposure monitoring to the human body. Establishing an HBM platform faces not only the need to consider individual decision autonomy as an ethics issue, but also larger epistemological and societal questions, such as the mode of evidence demanded in science, policy and regulation. Conclusion: The shift of exposure monitoring towards the biosurveillance of human populations involves fundamental changes in the ways environment, health and disease are conceptualised; this may lead to an individualisation of responsibilities for health risks and preventive action. Attention to the conditions of scientific knowledge generation and to their broader societal context is critical in order to make HBM contribute to environmental justice.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the impact of neighborhood context on family caregivers, or how environmental factors combine with individual-level caregiver risk factors to affect caregiver outcomes. Objectives: To combine Geographic Information System (GIS) and survey methods to examine the effects of caregiver residence in disadvantaged/underserved neighborhoods on caregiver outcomes. Research Design and Methods: Telephone surveys with 758 caregivers from the Pittsburgh Regional Caregiver Survey geocoded for classification into Environmental Justice Areas (EJAs) and Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs). We examine the impact of EJA/MUA caregiver residence on care recipient unmet needs for care, caregiver depression and burden, and positive aspects of caregiving, adjusting for sociodemographics, caregiving context, care recipient disability level, caregiving intensity, and additional risk factors. Results: There was spatial clustering of caregiver depression and burden outside of the disadvantaged/underserved areas, while positive aspects of caregiving were clustered within EJAs/MUAs. Approximately 36% of caregivers lived in EJAs/MUAs, and they differed, sociodemographically, on caregiver risk factors and caregiver outcomes. Multivariable models showed that caregivers residing in EJAs/MUAs were less likely to be depressed and reported more positive aspects of caregiving after adjusting for known individual-level risk factors. Residence in disadvantaged/underserved areas also modified the effects of several risk factors on caregiver outcomes. Discussion and Implications: Caregiver outcomes show interesting spatial patterns. Unexpectedly, caregivers living in these potentially challenging environments were less depressed and reported more gains from caregiving after adjusting for known risk factors. Results suggest that socioeconomic disadvantage does not necessarily translate into poor caregiver outcomes. Understanding the mechanism for these effects is important to designing effective caregiver interventions. The paper also demonstrates the value of using GIS methods to study caregiving.

AB  - Alliance building across social movement groups is an important aspect of social movement dynamics, contributing to their viability and capacity to promote social change. Yet, with few exceptions, cross-movement coalitions have received little sustained theoretical or empirical attention. This article contributes to an understanding of cross-movement coalition building through the examination of a successful case of alliance: a coalition of environmental justice and peace and anti-weapons proliferation groups to stop a federally funded U. S. biodefense laboratory from being built and operated in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Cross-movement collaboration was challenged by tensions arising from differences in positionality. Positional differences reflect status distinctions such as race, class, gender, and place and the differential experiences and expectations that result. Nonetheless, this coalition was able to resolve positional tensions and, as a result, remained a viable protest vehicle. We found this was accomplished through a cross-movement bridging process that involved (1) cause affirmation, (2) strategic deployment, (3) exclusion, and (4) co-development of cross-movement commitments. We extend existent accounts of cross-movement coalition by providing both a culturally founded and fine-grained account of coalition work in the maintenance of alliance relations. The article and its conclusions also address the broader implications of understanding successful trans-positional cross-movement alliances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that toxicity of fine particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) differs by chemical component. Exposure to components may differ by population. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether exposures to PM2.5 components differ by race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Long-term exposures (2000 through 2006) were estimated for 215 U.S. census tracts for PM2.5 and for 14 PM2.5 components. Population-weighted exposures were combined to generate overall estimated exposures by race/ethnicity, education, poverty status, employment, age, and earnings. We compared population characteristics for tracts with and without PM2.5 component monitors. RESULTS: Larger disparities in estimated exposures were observed for components than for PM2.5 total mass. For race/ethnicity, whites generally had the lowest exposures. Non-Hispanic blacks had higher exposures than did whites for 13 of the 14 components. Hispanics generally had the highest exposures (e.g., 152% higher than whites for chlorine, 94% higher for aluminum). Young persons (0-19 years of age) had levels as high as or higher than other ages for all exposures except sulfate. Persons with lower SES had higher estimated exposures, with some exceptions. For example, a 10% increase in the proportion unemployed was associated with a 20.0% increase in vanadium and an 18.3% increase in elemental carbon. Census tracts with monitors had more non-Hispanic blacks, lower education and earnings, and higher unemployment and poverty than did tracts without monitors. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to PM2.5 components differed by race/ethnicity, age, and SES. If some components are more toxic than others, certain populations are likely to suffer higher health burdens. Demographics differed between populations covered and not covered by monitors.

AB  - Background: Environmental biomonitoring data provide one way to examine race/ethnicity and income-related exposure disparity and identify potential environmental justice concerns. Methods: We screened U. S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2008 biomonitoring data for 228 chemicals for race/ethnicity and income-related disparity. We defined six subgroups by race/ethnicity-Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white-and income-Low Income: poverty income ratio (PIR) < 2, High Income: PIR = 2. We assessed disparity by comparing the central tendency (geometric mean [ GM]) of the biomonitoring concentrations of each subgroup to that of the reference subgroup (non-Hispanic white/High Income), adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Bonferroni procedure. Results: There were sufficient data to estimate at least one geometric mean ratio (GMR) for 108 chemicals; 37 had at least one GMR statistically different from one. There was evidence of potential environmental justice concern (GMR significantly > 1) for 12 chemicals: cotinine; antimony; lead; thallium; 2,4-and 2,5-dichlorophenol; p, p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene; methyl and propyl paraben; and mono-ethyl, mono-isobutyl, and mono-n-butyl phthalate. There was also evidence of GMR significantly < 1 for 25 chemicals (of which 17 were polychlorinated biphenyls). Conclusions: Although many of our results were consistent with the U. S. literature, findings relevant to environmental justice were novel for dichlorophenols and some metals.

AB  - A women's rights perspective can inform and structure research on climate policy impacts on women. To date, climate policy analysis has mostly considered women as agents of climate protection, that is, objects of mitigation policies, rather than subjects in their own right. However, climate change mitigation involves direct and indirect distributive effects depending on which sectors are involved, which instruments are chosen and how funds are obtained and allocated. Since gender roles impact on individual livelihoods and activities, distributive effects are likely to be gendered. This paper suggests that women's human rights can be used as a framework for research aiming to fill this gap. They provide a well-developed, tested range of criteria for gender justice. Such assessments would allow for a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of the gendered distributive effects of climate policies, notably with regard to the particularly understudied situation in the industrialized world.

AB  - A string of corporate litigation cases in the United Kingdom highlights the role of corporate group structures in complicating efforts to impose liability on parent companies for the activities of their subsidiaries, particularly where those subsidiaries are located in the Global South. Corporate group structures serve to insulate parent companies against liability for actions of their subsidiaries. This is the case even where economic benefits accrue to parent companies, which are often incorporated in the Global North. These group structures cabin liability for environmental and climate harms within subsidiary companies through reliance on company law principles such as limited liability and separate legal personality. These company law principles allow parent companies to enjoy corporate profits from the activities of their subsidiaries but disavow liability for any environmental damage resulting from such activities. This dichotomy has obvious equity implications, which are exacerbated in the extractive industries and in the context of climate change. Negative climate impacts are and will be felt predominantly in the Global South. In addition, environmental damage removes avenues of climate adaptation for vulnerable populations. But company law principles are not impervious to these equity challenges. These principles have never been absolute and courts have consistently found exceptions to them, although those exceptions have fluctuated in effectiveness and frequency over the years. Recent decisions by the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in the United Kingdom imposed duties on parent companies for environmental damage caused by their subsidiaries. Cases following the decision in Chandler v Cape Industries illustrate tension between company law as interpreted in the Global North, and climate and environmental justice as experienced in the Global South. Climate change forces a reconceptualization of company law, including transnational corporate liability. This paper argues that these reconsiderations are not only appropriate, but given the contested histories of many of these companies in the Global South, long overdue.

AB  - As the impacts of climate change intensify, potential relocation is becoming more of a reality for coastal communities throughout the world. This is furthering the demand for the implementation of governance relocation frameworks. In order to stay true to the principles of environmental justice while at the same time ensuring an effective policy that meets the needs and wants of affected communities, an adaptive relocation framework requires collaboration between state and non-state actors. It is thus important to pay attention to how non-state actors are incorporated into public participatory climate change adaptation efforts. In order to affectively address previous limitations of public participation, stakeholders must pay attention to already existing power systems. Through a case study approach of a village relocation project in Fiji, I examine the role of power in a climate change adaptation plan that involved the community of Vunidogoloa, local government, and national government stakeholders. I employ Steven Lukes's three-dimensional framework of power to the case of Vunidogoloa, a Fijian village that relocated inland due to coastal erosion and shoreline flooding, to illustrate how the political arrangement of participation reinforced existing hierarchies between the village and the government.

AB  - Across scientific fields, there have been calls to improve the integration of scientific knowledge in policy making. Particularly since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, these calls increasingly refer to data on human well-being related to the natural environment. However, policy decisions involve selective uptake of information across communities with different preferences and decision-making processes. Additionally, researchers face the fact that there are important trade-offs in producing knowledge that is simultaneously credible, legitimate, socially relevant, and socially just. We present a study that developed human well-being indicators for Washington State's Puget Sound ecosystem recovery agency over 3 years. Stakeholders, decision makers, and social scientists were engaged in the identification, modification, and prioritization of well-being indicators that were adopted by the agency for tracking progress toward ecosystem recovery and strategic planning. After substantial literature review, interviews, workshops, and indicator ranking exercises, 15 indicators were broadly accepted and important to all audiences. Although the scientists, decision makers, and stakeholders used different criteria to identify and prioritize indicators, they all agreed that indicators associated with each of 6 broad domains (social, cultural, psychological, physical, economic, and governance) were critical to assess the holistic concept of well-being related to ecosystem restoration. Decision makers preferred indicators that mirrored stakeholder preferences, whereas social scientists preferred only a subset. The Puget Sound indicator development process provides an example for identifying, selecting, and monitoring diverse concepts of well-being related to environmental restoration in a way that promotes recognition, participation, and a fair distribution of environmental benefits across the region.

AB  - Although green interventions, like nature-based solutions, contribute to more sustainable urban environments and provide ecosystem services to urban populations, some impacts are not well understood. This particularly applies to social impacts in the domain of environmental justice, including (green) gentrification. Gentrification refers to a process in which green urban renewal raises property prices, which results in an influx of affluent people, displacing poorer residents. Our study conducts a meta-analysis based on 37 primary hedonic pricing studies, to estimate value transfer functions that can assess the effects of nature types on property prices in various urban settings. Urban nature has positive impacts on house value in the areas surrounding it, which depend on population density, distance to, and the type of, urban nature. We illustrate how the estimated benefit transfer function can be applied to natural interventions in a Dutch city, and visualize the obtained effects using mapping. These maps show the distance decay of the cumulative effects of urban nature interventions on the house value at the city and the neighbourhood levels. Our application estimated increases in local property values up to a maximum of 20 % compared with properties not affected by the interventions, with value equivalent of 62,650 USD, at average prevailing price level in a particular area in Utrecht. When new nature is being planned in urban areas our mapping approach can be used for guiding assessments of potential undesirable effects on property values that may lead to green gentrification, and for identifying where additional policies may be needed to contribute to environmental justice.

AB  - A long period of capitalist crisis has amplified uneven and combined development in most aspects of political economy and political ecology in most parts of the world, with a resulting increase in the eco-social metabolism of profit-seeking firms and their state supporters. This is especially with the revival of extraction-oriented corporations, especially fossil fuel firms, which remain the world's most profitable. What opportunities arise for as multi-faceted a critique of "extractivism" as the conditions demand? With ongoing paralysis of United Nations climate negotiators, to illustrate, the most critical question for several decades to come is whether citizen activism can forestall further fossil fuel combustion. In many settings, the extractive industries are critical targets of climate activists, for example, where divestment of stocks is one strategy, or refusing access to land for mining is another. Invoking climate justice principles requires investigating the broader socio-ecological and economic costs and benefits of capital accumulation associated with fossil fuel use, through forceful questioning both by immediate victims and by all those concerned about GreenHouse Gas emissions. Their solidarity with each other is vital to nurture and to that end, the most powerful anti-corporate tactic developed so far, indeed beginning in South Africa during the anti-apartheid struggle, appears to be financial sanctions. The argumentation for invoking sanctions against the fossil fuel industry (and its enablers such as international shipping) is by itself insufficient. Also required is a solid activist tradition. There are, in 2014, two inter-related cases in which South African environmental justice activists have critiqued multi-billion dollar investments, and thus collided with the state, with two vast parastatal corporations and with their international financiers. Whether these collisions move beyond conflicting visions, and actually halt the fossilintensive projects, is a matter that can only be worked out both through argumentation - for example, in the pages below - and through gaining the solidarity required to halt the financing of climate change.

AB  - A growing body of research documents the inequitable impact of environmental hazards on poor and minority communities. This paper uses the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory for 1987-1990 and the 1990 Census of Population and Housing to analyze the spatial distribution of toxic industrial pollution and demographic groups in Ohio. In apparent support of the previous body of research, we report high correlations between racial variables and level of toxic release at the county level. The highest levels of toxic release in Ohio occur in the state's most urban counties, fourteen of which contain approximately 90 percent of the state's minority population. However, a census-tract examination of the most urban of these counties, Cuyahoga, reveals no relationships between race and toxicity. The tract-level data do provide some evidence of income-environment inequity, and these findings prompt several methodological advisories for further research. The principal conclusion of the paper is that spatial scale is critical in studies of industrial environmental hazards and environmental justice.

AB  - Background: Diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) are industrial chemicals found in consumer products that may increase risk of adverse health effects. Although use of personal care/beauty products is known to contribute to phthalate exposure, no prior study has examined feminine hygiene products as a potential phthalate source. In this study, we evaluate whether vaginal douching and other feminine hygiene products increase exposure to phthalates among US reproductive-aged women. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 739 women (aged 20-49) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2004 to examine the association between self-reported use of feminine hygiene products (tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal douches, feminine spray, feminine powder, and feminine wipes/towelettes) with urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), metabolites of DEP and DnBP, respectively. Results: A greater proportion of black women than white and Mexican American women reported use of vaginal douches, feminine spray, feminine powder, and wipes/towelettes in the past month whereas white women were more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to report use of tampons (p < 0.05). Douching in the past month was associated with higher concentrations of MEP but not MnBP. No other feminine hygiene product was significantly associated with either MEP or MnBP. We observed a dose-response relationship between douching frequency and MEP concentrations (p(trend) < 0.0001); frequent users (>= 2 times/month) had 152.2 % (95 % confidence intervals (CI): (68.2 %, 278.3 %)) higher MEP concentrations than non-users. We also examined whether vaginal douching mediates the relationship between race/ethnicity and phthalates exposures. Black women had 48.4 % (95 % CI: 16.8 %, 88.6 %; p = 0.0002) higher MEP levels than white women. Adjustment for douching attenuated this difference to 26.4 % (95 % CI:-0.9 %, 61.2 %; p = 0.06). Mediation effects of douching were statistically significant for black-white differences (z = 3.71, p < 0.001) but not for differences between Mexican Americans and whites (z = 1.80, p = 0.07). Conclusions: Vaginal douching may increase exposure to DEP and contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in DEP exposure. The presence of environmental chemicals in vaginal douches warrants further examination.

AB  - A challenge for the theorising of climate justice is that even when the agents whose actions are supposed to be regulated are cooperative and act in good faith, they may still disagree about how the burdens and benefits of dealing with climate change should be distributed. This article is a contribution to the formulation of a useful role for normative theorising in light of this bounded nature of climate justice. We outline a theory of pure procedural climate justice; its content, function in relation to international climate diplomacy, and justification. The theory is 'pure' in the sense that it does not rely on an independent criterion of what are just outcomes in negotiations of climate responsibilities. Rather, it specifies procedural fairness norms, such as transparency, reciprocity and participation, which make the process of negotiation fair independently of which account of substantive climate justice happens to be correct. Such procedural fairness norms are justified in part by being expressions of an ideal of a reasonable negotiator, an ideal which itself commands respect. They are also justified as means to an effective coordinated response to dangerous climate change in virtue of their capacity to create trust, predictability and accountability.

AB  - Background: Researchers and policymakers are increasingly focused on combined exposures to social and environmental stressors, especially given how often these stressors tend to co-locate. Such exposures are equally relevant in urban and rural areas and may accrue disproportionately to particular communities or specific subpopulations. Objectives: To estimate relationships between racial isolation (RI), a measure of the extent to which minority racial/ethnic group members are exposed to only one another, and long-term particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 mu (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) levels in urban and nonurban areas of the eastern two-thirds of the US. Methods: Long-term (5 year average) census tract-level PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations were calculated using output from a downscaler model (2002-2006). The downscaler uses a linear regression with additive and multiplicative bias coefficients to relate ambient monitoring data with gridded output from the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. A local, spatial measure of RI was calculated at the tract level, and tracts were classified by urbanicity, RI, and geographic region. We examined differences in estimated pollutant exposures by RI, urbanicity, and demographic subgroup (e.g., race/ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, age), and used linear models to estimate associations between RI and air pollution levels in urban, suburban, and rural tracts. Results: High RI tracts (>= 80th percentile) had higher average PM2.5 levels in each category of urbanicity compared to low RI tracts (<20th percentile), with the exception of the rural West. Patterns in O-3 levels by urbanicity and RI differed by region. Linear models indicated that PM2.5 concentrations were significantly and positively associated with RI. The largest association between PM2.5 and RI was observed in the rural Midwest, where a one quintile increase in RI was associated with a 0.90 mu g/m(3) (95% confidence interval: 0.83, 0.99 mu g/m(3)) increase in PM2.5 concentration. Associations between O-3 and RI in the Northeast, Midwest and West were positive and highest in suburban and rural tracts, even after controlling for potential confounders such as percentage in poverty. Conclusion: RI is associated with higher 5 year estimated PM2.5 concentrations in urban, suburban, and rural census tracts, adding to evidence that segregation is broadly associated with disparate air pollution exposures. Disproportionate burdens to adverse exposures such as air pollution may be a pathway to racial/ethnic disparities in health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Air pollution health studies often use outdoor concentrations as exposure surrogates. Failure to account for variability of residential infiltration of outdoor pollutants can induce exposure errors and lead to bias and incorrect confidence intervals in health effect estimates. The residential air exchange rate (AER), which is the rate of exchange of indoor air with outdoor air, is an important determinant for house-to-house (spatial) and temporal variations of air pollution infiltration. Our goal was to evaluate and apply mechanistic models to predict AERs for 213 homes in the Near-Road Exposures and Effects of Urban Air Pollutants Study (NEXUS), a cohort study of traffic-related air pollution exposures and respiratory effects in asthmatic children living near major roads in Detroit, Michigan. We used a previously developed model (LBL), which predicts AER from meteorology and questionnaire data on building characteristics related to air leakage, and an extended version of this model (LBLX) that includes natural ventilation from open windows. As a critical and novel aspect of our AER modeling approach, we performed a cross validation, which included both parameter estimation (i.e., model calibration) and model evaluation, based on daily AER measurements from a subset of 24 study homes on five consecutive days during two seasons. The measured AER varied between 0.09 and 3.48 h(-1) with a median of 0.64 h(-1). For the individual model-predicted and measured AER, the median absolute difference was 29% (0.19 h(-1)) for both the LBL and LBLX models. The LBL and LBLX models predicted 59% and 61% of the variance in the AER, respectively. Daily AER predictions for all 213 homes during the three year study (2010-2012) showed considerable house-to-house variations from building leakage differences, and temporal variations from outdoor temperature and wind speed fluctuations. Using this novel approach, NEXUS will be one of the first epidemiology studies to apply calibrated and home-specific AER models, and to include the spatial and temporal variations of AER for over 200 individual homes across multiple years into an exposure assessment in support of improving risk estimates.

AB  - Although sharing some common origins with environmental justice, in recent years, climate justice has emerged as a separate domain, one that entails both greater uncertainties and greater temporal and spatial distance between its causes in human activities and climatic shifts or extreme events. This article situates climate justice in relation to environmental justice and wider justice debates. It reflects on the multi-scalarity of climate justice and its bi-dimensional character (the justice of adaptation and mitigation). It then explores three different variants of distributive justice - welfare, equity and equality distribution - through examples from both international climate negotiations and UK and China national energy efficiency retrofit policy. The article aims to illustrate the kinds of differences and problems that originate with three very different ways of interpreting the meaning of a just distribution of the benefits and burdens related to tackling human-origin climate change, and to show how these are in many cases being pitched against considerations of social justice.

AB  - As the site of origin for nearly all herbicide-tolerant corn seed, and with more experimental field trials of genetically engineered crops than anywhere else in the United States, Hawai'i is placed at the epicenter of the agrochemical+seed+biotechnology industry's global chains of production. This paper offers a critical reading of why most genetically engineered corn seed sold globally can be traced back to the most isolated islands in the world. Contra dominant narratives, it is argued that it is more than sunshine that makes Hawai'i's soils ideal for growing patented seeds engineered to withstand pesticide. Ideas of naturalness and inevitability are interrogated for what they elide and sustain. It is suggested that true alternatives require attention especially to the things assumed most immutable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental health research involving community participation has increased substantially since the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) environmental justice and community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships began in the mid-1990s. The goals of these partnerships are to inform and empower better decisions about exposures, foster trust, and generate scientific knowledge to reduce environmental health disparities in low-income, minority communities. Peer-reviewed publication and clinical health outcomes alone are inadequate criteria to judge the success of projects in meeting these goals; therefore, new strategies for evaluating success are needed. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the methods used to evaluate our project, "Linking Breast Cancer Advocacy and Environmental Justice," to help identify successful CBPR methods and to assist other teams in documenting effectiveness. Although our project precedes the development of the NIEHS Evaluation Metrics Manual, a schema to evaluate the success of projects funded through the Partnerships in Environmental Public Health (PEPH), our work reported here illustrates the record keeping and self-reflection anticipated in NIEHS's PEPH. DISCUSSION: Evaluation strategies should assess how CBPR partnerships meet the goals of all partners. Our partnership, which included two strong community-based organizations, produced a team that helped all partners gain organizational capacity. Environmental sampling in homes and reporting the results of that effort had community education and constituency-building benefits. Scientific results contributed to a court decision that required cumulative impact assessment for an oil refinery and to new policies for chemicals used in consumer products. All partners leveraged additional funding to extend their work. CONCLUSIONS: An appropriate evaluation strategy can demonstrate how CBPR projects can advance science, support community empowerment, increase environmental health literacy, and generate individual and policy action to protect health.

AB  - Ambient air monitoring and phone survey data were collected in three environmental justice (EJ) and three non-EJ communities in Sacramento County during winter 2016-2017 to understand the differences in air toxics and in wood smoke pollution among communities. Concentrations of six hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel (BCff) were significantly higher at EJ communities versus non-EJ communities. BC from wood burning (BCwb) was significantly higher at non-EJ communities. Correlation analysis indicated that the six HAPs were predominantly from fossil fuel combustion sources, not from wood burning. The HAPs were moderately variable across sites (coefficient of divergence (COD) range of 0.07 for carbon tetrachloride to 0.28 for m- and p-xylenes), while BCff and BCwb were highly variable (COD values of 0.46 and 0.50). The BCwb was well correlated with levoglucosan (R-2 of 0.68 to 0.95), indicating that BCwb was a robust indicator for wood burning. At the two permanent monitoring sites, wood burning comprised 29-39% of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on nights when PM2.5 concentrations were forecasted to be high. Phone survey data were consistent with study measurements; the only significant difference in the survey results among communities were that non-EJ residents burn with indoor devices more often than EJ residents.

AB  - Background: Growing up in poverty is associated with poor health, and the American Dream of upward mobility is becoming an illusion for many low-income children. But nearby green space can support academic achievement, creativity, and emotional regulation, and these traits might help children rise out of poverty. Objectives: To examine the relationship between recent incomes of children born into poverty in the ten largest U.S. cities and densities of residential green space during childhood. Methods: We calculate park proximity, park acreage, new park development, and NDVI greenness for 1980-1990 from Landsat and Trust for Public Land data. We obtain the 2014 income for children born between 1978 and 1982 into families in poverty from The Opportunity Atlas cohort, aggregated at the tract level (n = 5849). Results: Conditional autoregressive (CAR) models of tracts show statistically significant associations between income rank and above-average levels of greenness but not between income rank and park measures, adjusting for individual and neighborhood confounders and spatial autocorrelation. We estimate that, over a 30-year career, children growing up in tracts with the most vegetative cover will earn cumulatively $28,000 more than children growing up in tracts with the least cover, on average. Tracts with lower than average levels of precipitation, higher disadvantage, higher population density, or higher annual temperatures do not show beneficial effects of green space. Conclusions: Greenness may be weakly associated with children rising out of poverty in wetter, cooler, less dense, more advantaged census tracts.

AB  - Background: Environmental factors are a major cause of poor health worldwide. The most solid evidence is for air pollution, leading to increased disability-adjusted life years. Outdoor temperature and other seasonal climate changes may also influence cardiovascular health, according to their direct modulation of air pollution. Moreover, an increasing body of evidence associates environmental exposure to noise with poor cardiovascular outcome, and in particular with hypertension. Methods: This review is aimed at reviewing current evidence about the role of these environmental factors in cardiovascular disease and specifically hypertension. In particular, the impact of air pollution, with its short-term and long-term effects, the outdoor temperature and noise pollution will be investigated. Conclusions: People belonging to low social classes, as well as children, women, older people and those with established cardiovascular diseases, seem to have a greater susceptibility to the effects of environmental stressors, recalling the concept of "environmental justice". The accumulating strong scientific evidence may thus support public health policies aimed at reducing social inequalities in cardiovascular health.

AB  - Background: Playgrounds are a central resource when it comes to physical activity among minors. This study assesses the association between area deprivation and the quality of playgrounds. Methods: All playgrounds in the city of Mannheim, Germany (145 km(2), 311,000 inhabitants) were visited between July 2016 and January 2017 as part of a systematic audit. Each playground's amenities, attractiveness, cleanliness, and safety were operationalized using well-established, validated instruments. Global and geographically weighted regression models were fitted to investigate the association of the amenities, attractively, cleanliness, and safety of playgrounds with sociodemographic indicators on the social area level. Results: A total of 271 playgrounds were identified. Overall, population density showed the strongest association with all quality variables in the global models, followed by the central official poverty indicator. Significant spatial variation in parameter estimates was found for most of the deprivation indicators with regard to attractiveness, cleanliness, and safety of playgrounds indicating locally negative associations between area-level deprivation and quality. Conclusion: Our findings illustrate the importance of a qualitative approach by analyzing physical activity resources. Concerning the quality of playgrounds, the data from this study support the deprivation amplification hypothesis, meaning that children who are already socially disadvantaged might experience a further contextual disadvantage.

AB  - A growing body of evidence reveals that people of color and low-income persons have borne greater environmental and health risks than the society at large in their neighborhoods, workplace, and playgrounds. Over the last decade or so, grassroots activists have attempted to change the way government implements environmental, health, and civil rights laws. Grassroots groups have organized, educated and empowered themselves to improve the way government regulations and environmental policies are administered. A new movement emerged in opposition to environmental racism and environmental injustice. Over the last 2 decades or so. grassroots activists have had some success in changing the way the federal government treats communities of color and their inhabitants. Grassroots groups have also organized, educated, and empowered themselves to improve the way health and environmental policies are administered. Environmentalism is now equated with social justice and civil rights.

AB  - Assessing environmental quality often requires selection of indicators that can be employed over large spatial scales and over long-time periods to assess the health and well-being of species, natural communities, and ecosystems, and to detect changes warranting intervention. Typically, the ecologic environment and the human environment are evaluated separately and selection of indicators and monitoring approaches are not integrated even though ecological indicators may also provide information on risk to human consumers from contaminants (e.g., eco-cultural indicators) or because of disease levels. This paper is a call for ecologists and managers to consider diverse cultural and environmental injustice disparities and health issues when selecting indicators for environmental assessment and monitoring. There is an opportunity for managers and community members to work together to preserve ecological and cultural resources and heritages. We propose a paradigm that selects indicators and monitoring approaches that lend themselves to the integration of human-diversity and uniqueness in the same manner that the selection of ecological indicators and monitoring approaches consider biological species diversity and uniqueness. The proposed paradigm builds on ecological risk assessment techniques, developing analogous endpoints for neighboring communities. For example, identification and protection of human communities, particularly culturally diverse and environmental justice communities, identification of contaminant corridors (e.g., through water or green corridors) into communities, and eco-monitoring of vulnerable communities are not routine at contaminated sites. Green corridors refers to a width of wild habitat (forest, grasslands) that connects other similar habitat paths (usually a corridor runs through an urban or suburban habitat). We coin the term Eco-EJ indicators for these endpoints, including examination of (1) unique cultural relationships to resources; (2) connectedness of on-site and off-site resources and habitats; (3) health of threatened, rare, and unique cultures and communities; and (4) linkages between ecological, eco-cultural, and public health for monitoring and assessment. We also propose that assessment and monitoring include these Eco-EJ indicators, especially for communities near facilities that have extensive chemical or radiological contamination. Developing these indicators to assess risk to culturally diverse and environmental justice communities would be an equivalent goal to reducing risk for significant ecological resources (e.g., endangered species, species of special concern). These Eco-EJ indicators are complementary to the usual human health-risk assessments, would include surveys of neighboring vulnerable communities, and require time and re-organization of current data and additional data collection at site boundaries and in adjacent communities, as well as rethinking the human component of indicators. This approach lends itself to addressing some diverse cultural and environmental justice issues with current indicator selection and biomonitoring, and helps identify specific hotspots of unique ecosystem risk and environmental justice community risk. We briefly discuss ecological and eco-cultural monitoring already on-going at three Department of Energy sites to illustrate how the addition of these indicators might work and add value to environmental management and to their relationships with surrounding communities. We recommend that managers of contaminated sites convene people from culturally diverse communities, environmental justice communities, local and federal government, Tribes, resource trustees, managers, and other stakeholders to develop appropriate site-specific indicators to address environmental inequities around contaminated facilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Residential moves (displacement) owing to climate- and weather-related disasters may significantly impact mental health. Despite the growing risk from climate change, health impacts of environmental-mobility remain understudied. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effects of displacement on the association between landslides and changes in perceived mental well-being in Banjarnegara, Indonesia. We also investigated whether sociodemographics (age, sex, level of education, household-level income, or employment in agriculture) and landslide characteristics (number and severity of landslides) were associated with differing odds of relocation after experiencing landslides. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 420 individuals who experienced landslides between 2014 and 2018 to assess perceived changes in mental well-being, comparing after landslide exposure to before landslide exposure. We used a novel six-item measure that was created in collaboration with the local community to compare perceived changes between those who were displaced by landslides and those who were not displaced, using logistic and multinomial regressions adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. We then assessed whether the odds of displacement differed based on sociodemographic characteristics and landslide exposure characteristics, using logistic regressions. RESULTS: Those who were displaced were more likely than those who were not displaced to report perceived increases in economic stability [odds ratio (OR)=3.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45, 6.46], optimism (OR=4.01; 95% CI: 1.87, 8.61), safety (OR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.44, 5.10), religiosity (OR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.65), and closeness with community (OR=1.90; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.33) after landslides compared with before their first landslide during the study period. More frequent landslide exposures were associated with reduced odds of relocation, but more severe landslides were associated with increased odds of relocation. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that landslides affect the mental well-being not only of those who are displaced but also of those who are left behind. Further, this work supports the need for community-based participatory research to fully capture the health impacts of environmental mobility.

AB  - Background: According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Superfund is a federal government program implemented to clean up uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Twenty-six sites in South Carolina (SC) have been included on the National Priorities List (NPL), which has serious human health and environmental implications. The purpose of this study was to assess spatial disparities in the distribution of Superfund sites in SC. Methods: The 2000 US census tract and block level data were used to generate population characteristics, which included race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), education, home ownership, and home built before 1950. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to map Superfund facilities and develop choropleth maps based on the aforementioned sociodemographic variables. Spatial methods, including mean and median distance analysis, buffer analysis, and spatial approximation were employed to characterize burden disparities. Regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the number of Superfund facilities and population characteristics. Results: Spatial coincidence results showed that of the 29.5% of Blacks living in SC, 55.9% live in Superfund host census tracts. Among all populations in SC living below poverty (14.2%), 57.2% were located in Superfund host census tracts. Buffer analyses results (0.5mi, 1.0mi, 5.0mi, 0.5km, 1.0km, and 5.0km) showed a higher percentage of Whites compared to Blacks hosting a Superfund facility. Conversely, a slightly higher percentage of Blacks hosted (30.2%) a Superfund facility than those not hosting (28.8%) while their White counterparts had more equivalent values (66.7% and 67.8%, respectively). Regression analyses in the reduced model (Adj. R-2 = 0.038) only explained a small percentage of the variance. In addition, the mean distance for percent of Blacks in the 90th percentile for Superfund facilities was 0.48mi. Conclusion: Burden disparities exist in the distribution of Superfund facilities in SC at the block and census tract levels across varying levels of demographic composition for race/ethnicity and SES.

AB  - A good ecological environment is the prerequisite of human survival and the basis of economic and social sustainable development. As human society has experienced rapid economic development and wealthy life brought about by technological revolutions, it may feel threatened by environmental damage and ecological crisis brought to human survival at the same time. In this context, the global concern of ecological progress promotion and green development is increasing continuously and needs the support from green government indeed. Green government, is such a kind of government agency which using its own resources and advantages to make effective environmental strategies that can reduce the adverse environmental impact to the minimum during its running and exert good influences on and constraints over interested parties. However, nowadays Chinese government work in this aspect is not perfect and needs to be further improved. The theory of ecological civilization was used to elaborate the significance of strengthening the construction of green government and analyze the current problems in such aspects as extensive resource management, high environmental resources costs, and ineffective environmental policies. Thus, the construction of green government from the perspective of ecological progress was proposed to promote the ecological construction from such aspects as the relationship between economic regulation and the environment, the supervision of government's green service, the optimization of administrative law enforcement and the management system, the reinforcement of administrative construction system and the improvement of government assessment. Ultimately, the goal is to build the system of green culture and green assessment, advance green government building, promote the environmental justice of the whole society, and achieve the coordinated development of economy, society, and environment which can improve the green government management functions, ensuring the sustainable development of social and economic efficiency and social equity.

AB  - Air pollution and road traffic noise are considered to be the two most important nuisances that could negatively affect the quality of life. A prolonged exposure to high concentrations of these pollutants could conduct to various health problems. Studies in environmental equity have often considered these nuisances individually whenever it comes from the same source. The main objective of this paper is to determine if the 15 years of age, those aged 65 and over, visible minorities and low income individuals located in a portion of the Island of Montreal are overrepresented in city blocks characterized by having among the highest levels of transportation-related air pollutants (i.e., ambient concentrations of NO(2)d and road traffic noise in decibels (dB(A)). The results show that low-income individuals and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities, are significantly overrepresented in city blocks characterized by the higher levels of NO2 and road traffic noise in dB(A). Multinomial logistic regression analysis confirms these results, and also shows that young people under 15 years are under-represented in the most polluted areas. However, contrary to the previous bivariate results, people aged 65 and over are negatively and significantly associated with the likelihood of their living in a city block located in an advantaged area after controlling for the independent effects of the other explanatory variables. Moreover, visible minorities are significantly overrepresented in advantaged areas. Considering the observed results, some solutions are identified to reduce road traffic noise and air pollution in the city blocks localized near major traffic arteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although environmental justice scholars have been addressing spatial scale for at least thirty years, one of its components remains largely overlooked, namely extent. In this paper, we investigate the effects of extent variation in environmental (in)justice patterns by analyzing the statistical associations between socio-economic marginality and environmental vulnerability at three different spatial scopes: metropolitan areas, municipalities, and boroughs. Using census and geospatial data, our case study focuses on the relations between income and color/race, on the one hand, and susceptibility to flooding and landslides, on the other, in Brazil's two largest cities (Sa & SIM;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro). We constructe an integrated, census tract-level database using areal weighting interpolation combining census with susceptibility data to perform k-means multivariate clustering analysis. Although our results show that the most vulnerable to landslides and flooding are non-white, low-income people - confirming common environmental justice claims - they also suggest that spatial extent impinges on statistical patterns. While the clusters are very similar in the metropolitan and municipal scales, pointing to a fractal-like structure, they differ significantly at the borough scale. This smaller scale reveals a different picture, one in which well-to-do white people are just as exposed to hazards (especially flooding) as non-white, middle-to lower-middle-class people. We argue this is a result of elite self-exposure to risk, which is supported by sociospatially unjust distribution of risk-mitigation infrastructures. Policymakers should pay attention to such scale-dependent complexities in devising ways to cope with the increasing inequities brought about by climate change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research has reported disparities in environmental exposures in the United States, hut, to our knowledge, no nationwide studies have assessed inequality in noise pollution. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to a) assess racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in noise pollution in the contiguous United States; and I)) consider the modifying role of metropolitan level racial residential segregation. METHODS: We used a geospatial sound model to estimate census block group level median (L-50) nighttime and daytime noise exposure and 90th percentile (L-10) daytime noise exposure. Block group variables from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) included race/ethnicity, education, income, poverty, unemployment, homeownership, and linguistic isolation. We estimated associations using polynomial terms in spatial error models adjusted for total population and population density. We also evaluated the relationship between race/ethnicity and noise, stratified by levels of metropolitan area racial residential segregation, classified using a multigroup dissimilarity index. RESULTS: Generally, estimated nighttime and daytime noise levels were higher for census block groups with higher proportions of nonwhite and lower-socioeconomic status (SES) residents. For example, estimated nighttime noise levels in urban block groups with 75% vs. 0% black residents were 46.3 A-weighted decibels (dBA) [interquartile range (IQR): 44.3-47.8 dBA] and 42.3 (IBA (IQR: 40.4-45.5 dBA), respectively. In urban block groups with 50% vs. 0% of residents living below poverty, estimated nighttime noise levels were 46.9 dBA (IQR: 44.7-48.5 dBA) and 44.0 dBA (IQR: 42.2-45.5 dBA), respectively. Block groups with the highest metropolitan area segregation had the highest estimated noise exposures, regardless of racial composition. Results were generally consistent between urban and suburban/rural census block groups, and for daytime and nighttime noise and robust to different spatial weight and neighbor definitions. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in model-based estimates of noise exposure throughout the United States. Additional research is needed to determine if differences in noise exposure may contribute to health disparities in the United Stales.

AB  - Air pollution levels are uneven within cities, contributing to persistent health disparities between neighborhoods and population sub-groups. Highly spatially resolved information on pollution levels and disease rates is necessary to characterize inequities in air pollution exposure and related health risks. We leverage recent advances in deriving surface pollution levels from satellite remote sensing and granular data in disease rates for one city, Washington, DC, to assess intra-urban heterogeneity in fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-attributable mortality and morbidity. We estimate PM2.5-attributable cases of all-cause mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, and asthma emergency department (ED) visits using epidemiologically derived health impact functions. Data inputs include satellite-derived annual mean surface PM2.5 concentrations; age-resolved population estimates; and statistical neighborhood-, zip code- and ward-scale disease counts. We find that PM2.5 concentrations and associated health burdens have decreased in DC between 2000 and 2018, from approximately 240 to 120 cause-specific deaths and from 40 to 30 asthma ED visits per year (between 2014 and 2018). However, remaining PM2.5-attributable health risks are unevenly and inequitably distributed across the District. Higher PM2.5-attributable disease burdens were found in neighborhoods with larger proportions of people of color, lower household income, and lower educational attainment. Our study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the inequity in air pollution exposure levels and pollution health risks between population sub-groups, and highlights the need for both high-resolution disease rates and concentration estimates for understanding intra-urban disparities in air pollution-related health risks.

AB  - Background: Pictou Landing First Nation (PLFN), a small Mi'kmaw community on the Canadian east coast, has had a relationship with a tidal estuary known as A'se'k for millennia. In the 1960s, it became the site of effluent disposal from a nearby pulp mill. Almost immediately, health concerns regularly and consistently reverberated throughout the community. Objectives: The Pictou Landing Native Women's Group (PLNWG) formed a community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership with an academic team to conceptualize community well-being in the context of environment and human health connections. This paper documents Mi'kmaw Elders' stories of A'se'k before it became contaminated. Methods: Using narrative inquiry vis-a-vis oral histories, we carried out conversational interviews with 10 Elders from PLFN. These interviews were thematically analyzed and 're storied' through a process of (w)holistic content analysis. Results: Our findings present four broad story layers, recounting the themes that emerged through analysis and presenting a broad Mi'kmaw narrative of A'se'k. These story layers share: what A'se'k originally provided, the historical/cultural context of PLFN, changes to land and health after the mill was put in, and reflections on the past and future of A'se'k. Conclusions: Our research offers a novel contribution to the literature by showing how Mi'kmaw perspectives on the pollution at A'se'k reveal the close connection between Mi'kmaw livelihood, local ecologies, and health and wellbeing. Our research also provides insights into the way the research relationship developed between the PLNWG and the academic team, providing a pathway for others seeking to decolonize the research landscape.

AB  - A civic engagement and data science design was used to develop a report-back intervention to address stakeholder concerns related to air emissions surrounding a coke oven factory near Buffalo, NY. This factory had historically emitted high levels of benzene pollution and ceased operation in October 2018 because of violations of the US Clean Air Act and US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Using publicly available air pollution and weather data, descriptive time series and wind-rose data visualizations were developed using open-source software as part of a two-page report-back brief. Data from two air toxics monitoring sites in this direction suggest that industrial sources were likely the major contributor to the benzene in the air at these locations prior to May 2018, after which traffic emissions became the likely major contributor. Wind-rose visualizations demonstrated that the wind typically blew toward the northeast, which was qualitatively consistent with locations of stakeholder concerns. With the factory closed, collective efforts subsequently shifted to address traffic emission air pollution sources, factory site cleanup, and ground and water pollution mitigation. Because this intervention utilized open-source software and publicly available data, it can serve as a blueprint for future data-driven nursing interventions and community-led environmental justice efforts.

AB  - A B S T R A C T All else equal, disparities in environmental exposure are associated with disparities in health and economic well-being. Here, we combine 9 years of data on toxic water pollution discharges from more than 1600 industrial facilities across urban Mexico with geographic, economic, and sociodemographic data from approximate to 50,000 Mexican urban block groups. We first show that industrial facilities pollute more in marginalized neighborhoods and in neighborhoods that are becoming more marginalized over time. In contrast, we find no evidence for relationships between toxic water pollution and indigenous race. We then explore channels driving observed exposure disparities. We find evidence that environmental disparities in urban Mexico are associated with collective action, community pressure, and Coasian bargaining. We do not find evidence consistent with political economic or amenity-based sorting mechanisms. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although environmental justice (EJ) research in the United States has traditionally focused on technological hazards such as air pollution or hazardous waste, the adverse and unequal impacts of Hurricane Katrina have prompted researchers to examine the EJ implications of natural events such as hurricanes and floods. This paper contributes to this emerging literature on EJ and social vulnerability to natural hazards by analyzing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in the distribution of flood risk exposure in the Miami Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), Florida-one of the most hurricane-prone areas in the world and one of the most ethnically and socioeconomically diverse MSAs in the United States. Although previous studies have relied exclusively on the 100-year floodplain to assess the spatial extent of flood exposure, this study makes a systematic distinction between different types of flood zones on the basis of both the probability (100-year versus 500-year versus low/no risk) of flooding and location/nature (coastal versus inland) of the 100-year floodplain. The analysis integrates information from floodplain maps with census tract level sociodemographic data. The results demonstrate how the significance of various sociodemographic predictors of flood risk differs across relevant flood zone categories. Specifically, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic residents are significantly overrepresented in inland flood zones and underrepresented in coastal flood zones characterized by significantly higher median income and housing values. These disparities have important implications for EJ research on flood hazards and related public policy in and beyond the Miami MSA. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Although the environmental and social burdens associated with the production of beef are well-un-derstood, due to supply chain complexities, we rarely know precisely where these impacts occur or who is affected. This limitation is a barrier to more sustainable production and consumption of animal products. In this study, we combine life cycle thinking with an environmental justice approach to map Costco's beef supply chain in California and to explore the environmental burden of air pollution (PM2.5) due to beef production in the San Joaquin Valley, a region that has some of the worst air quality in the United States. To map the supply chain of one of Costco's primary suppliers, Harris Ranch, and the feedlots they operate, the study uses a methodological framework known as Tracking Corporations Across Space and Time (TRACAST). Our modeling revealed that feedlots produce similar to 95% of total PM2.5 emissions across the beef supply chain, and they alone account for approximately 1/3 of total anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions in the Valley. PM2.5 concentrations are markedly higher around these facilities. The spatial analysis revealed that communities living near feedlots are often poor, predominantly Latinx and have increased PM2.5 related disease burdens, including asthma, heart disease and low weight birth. Based on company documents and news reports, neither Costco nor Harris Ranch are addressing this environmental injustice. Documenting the geographically specific impacts of livestock production opens up opportunities for corporations to address environmental injustices in their supply chains through more sustainable sourcing and production practices, and for consumers to rethink their consumption of meat.

AB  - Aim Urban biodiversity, and its associated ecosystem services, is an important component of the quality of life of urban residents. The "luxury effect" posits a positive association between biodiversity and socioeconomic status in urban areas, and is thus reflective of environmental injustice, as the benefits associated with biodiversity are not equitably shared across society. We aimed to determine the generality of the luxury effect, and to identify the factors causing its variation across published studies. Location Urbanized landscapes globally. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Terrestrial animals and plants. Methods We tested the luxury effect across a sample of 337 estimates of the relationship between biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status from 96 studies via a meta-analysis, addressing three hypotheses: (a) the luxury effect is more pronounced where water availability is limited, (b) the luxury effect is more pronounced in developing than developed countries, (c) the luxury effect is stronger in exotic compared to native species. Results There was a significant overall luxury effect: there was a positive association between terrestrial biodiversity measures and socioeconomic status. The strength of the luxury effect was greater in arid areas. There was limited support for a stronger luxury effect in exotic species, but no support for any association with development status. Main conclusions Many key and emerging climate impacts are concentrated in urban areas. Therefore, the degree of environmental injustice represented by the luxury effect may be amplified in the future, especially in arid regions. The objective to increase urban biodiversity through more equitable management and provision of water resources could form part of a wider strategy for sustainable development of cities to promote environmental justice, enhancing the quality of life of urban residents across all sectors of society. Challenges remain to ensure that any such strategy prioritizes conservation goals for native biodiversity.

AB  - Across Canada, the Raging Grannies are renowned for appearing, invited or not, in spaces not typically open to older women, with outrageous Granny' costumes and satirical songs. A movement of predominantly non-Indigenous, settler women, the Raging Grannies regularly work in diverse activist coalitions in pursuit of social and environmental justice; many are seeking to ally themselves with contemporary Indigenous movements. However, while analyses have so far focused on their highly visible and iconic activist strategies, their solidarity-building efforts remain under-examined. Based on focus groups, interviews, and participant observation carried out in 2014-2015, this paper probes why and how Raging Grannies are building alliances with Indigenous movements in Canada. What emerges is an important tension. While many view their irreverent and theatrical strategies as quintessential to their Granny Activism,' such tactics were unanimously deemed inappropriate for engaging with Indigenous movements. Underpinned by reflections on their own settler histories, feelings of outrage at ongoing and state-sanctioned colonial practices, fears of inadvertently reproducing colonial relations, and a sense of interconnected futures with Canada's First Peoples, they sought different, less-visible ways of practicing their solidarities. Many chose to attend rallies dressed in their everyday clothes, provide resources to Indigenous-led protests, invite Indigenous activists to speak at their gatherings, and work through their churches to redress past harm. Their solidarity efforts incorporated small acts, often pivoting around individual members' personal connections. This article thus depicts the Raging Grannies as more diverse in their practices than typically recognized. It also addresses an important gap in scholarship on older women's roles in solidarity movements. Finally, it extends existing scholarship on solidarity-building, suggesting that how solidarity is understood cannot be disconnected from how it is practiced, and thus demonstrating how solidarity can be relational, performative, and contingent.

AB  - Background Advocacy is a core component of medical professionalism. It is unclear how educators can best prepare trainees for this professional obligation. We sought to assess medical students' attitudes toward advocacy, including activities and issues of interest, and to determine congruence with professional obligations. Methods A cross-sectional, web-based survey probed U.S. medical students' attitudes around 7 medical issues (e.g. nutrition/obesity, addiction) and 11 determinants of health (e.g. housing, transportation). Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and regression analysis investigated associations with demographic characteristics. Results Of 240 students completing the survey, 53% were female; most were white (62%) or Asian (28%). Most agreed it is very important that physicians encourage medical organizations to advocate for public health (76%) and provide health-related expertise to the community (57%). More participants rated advocacy for medical issues as very important, compared to issues with indirect connections to health (p < 0.001). Generally, liberals and non-whites were likelier than others to value advocacy. Conclusions Medical students reported strong interest in advocacy, particularly around health issues, consistent with professional standards. Many attitudes were associated with political affiliation and race. To optimize future physician advocacy, educators should provide opportunities for learning and engagement in issues of interest.

AB  - AIM: This paper articulates how political ecology can be a useful tool for asking fundamental questions and applying relevant methods to investigate structures that impact relationship between neighborhood and health. Through a narrative analysis, we identify how political ecology can develop our future agendas for neighborhood-health research as it relates to social, political, environmental, and economic structures. Political ecology makes clear the connection between political economy and neighborhood by highlighting the historical and structural processes that produce and maintain social inequality, which affect health and wellbeing. These concepts encourage researchers to examine how people construct neighborhood and health in different ways that, in turn, can influence different health outcomes and, thus, efforts to address solutions.

AB  - Adapted from the six 2010 Star Island Chapel Talks, the paper introduces the readers to contemporary Catholic Social Teaching and its application and implementation, particularly in the fields of environmental justice and human rights. An opening vignette explains how ideas about the common good contributed to the defeat of "Takings" legislation aimed at undoing environmental regulation in the 104th Congress (1995-1996). The teaching is presented as a vision of society centered on the communion of persons and creation rather than a discrete set of principles, with human rights and charity being the twin pillars of an evolving tradition. The interaction among ideas, historic events, and social movements is stressed throughout.

AB  - Addressing concerns of justice related to energy has gained increased international attention with the adoption of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. However, scholarship has largely neglected connections between the concepts of sustainable development and energy justice, and offers few related evaluative tools. Moreover, the dominant energy development paradigm-what I term `energy privilege'-has received limited attention and theoretical grounding. By critically engaging theory from Karl Polanyi with concepts from environmental justice and political theory, the article develops a framework to differentiate between `embedded' and `disembedded' sustainable development. This framework is then applied to develop a set of principles and criteria by which energy projects, initiatives, and systems can be assessed in terms of contributing to energy justice as compared to energy privilege. The resulting framework focuses on how energy-related resources, rights, and representation take shape across the three interlocking spheres of sustainable development: the economic, the environmental, and the social. It provides a practicable tool for communities and decision-makers to evaluate the extent to which individual projects and broader energy systems are both just and sustainable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disparities in exposure to air pollution by race-ethnicity and by socioeconomic status have been documented in the United States, but the impacts of declining transportation-related air pollutant emissions on disparities in exposure have not been studied in detail. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to estimate changes over time (2000 to 2010) in disparities in exposure to outdoor concentrations of a transportation-related air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in the United States. METHODS: We combined annual average NO2 concentration estimates from a temporal land use regression model with Census demographic data to estimate outdoor exposures by race-ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics (income, age, education), and by location (region, state, county, urban area) for the contiguous United States in 2000 and 2010. RESULTS: Estimated annual average NO2 concentrations decreased from 2000 to 2010 for all of the race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status groups, including a decrease from 17.6 ppb to 10.7 ppb (-6.9 ppb) in nonwhite [non-(white alone, non-Hispanic)] populations, and 12.6 ppb to 7.8 ppb (-4.7 ppb) in white (white alone, non-Hispanic) populations. In 2000 and 2010, disparities in NO2 concentrations were larger by race-ethnicity than by income. Although the national nonwhite white mean NO2 concentration disparity decreased from a difference of 5.0 ppb in 2000 to 2.9 ppb in 2010, estimated mean NO2 concentrations remained 37% higher for nonwhites than whites in 2010 (40% higher in 2000), and nonwhites were 2.5 times more likely than whites to live in a block group with an average NO2 concentration above the WHO annual guideline in 2010 (3.0 times more likely in 2000). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that absolute NO2 exposure disparities by race-ethnicity from 2000 to 2010, but relative NO2 exposure disparities persisted, with higher NO2 concentrations for nonwhites than whites in 2010.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disproportionate-life stress and consequent physiologic alteration (i.e., immune dysregulation) has been proposed as a major pathway linking socioeconomic position, environmental exposures, and health disparities. Asthma, for example, disproportionately affects lower-income urban communities, where air pollution and social stressors may be elevated. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the role of exposure to violence (ETV), as a chronic stressor, in altering susceptibility to traffic-related air pollution in asthma etiology. METHODS: We developed geographic information systems (GIS)-based models to retrospectively estimate residential exposures to traffic-related pollution for 413 children in a community-based pregnancy cohort, recruited in East Boston, Massachusetts, between 1987 and 1993, using monthly nitrogen dioxide measurements for 13 sites over 18 years. We merged pollution estimates with questionnaire data on lifetime ETV and examined the effects of both on childhood asthma etiology. RESULTS: Correcting for potential confounders, we found an elevated risk of asthma with a 1-SD (4.3 ppb) increase in NO2 exposure solely among children with above-median ETV [odds ratio (OR) = 1.63; 95% confidence interval (0), 1.14-2-33)]. Among children always living in the same community, with lesser exposure measurement error, this association was magnified (OR = 2.40; 95% Cl, 1.48-3.88). Of multiple exposure periods, year-of-diagnosis NO2 was most predictive of asthma, outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between traffic-related air pollution and asthma solely among urban children exposed to violence. Future studies should consider socially patterned susceptibility, common spatial distributions of social and physical environmental factors, and potential synergies among these. Prospective assessment of physical and social exposures may help determine causal pathways and critical exposure periods.

AB  - Although imported from the United States, the discourse of environmental justice has been radicalized in South Africa, as elsewhere in the Global South. Activists in South Africa go beyond symptoms to identify and. challenge the structural causes of the current environmental crisis. The case of Steel Valley illustrates the power of the more radical concept of environmental justice by showing how a small, local environmental justice organization was able to challenge toxic pollution by the most powerful steel corporation in the world, The traveling and adaptive discourse of environmental justice has the capacity to connect local, particularistic struggles, generalize them, and forge global alliances.

AB  - Amazon deforestation has been growing since 2012 and more recently under record rates. In fact, a new wave of rainforest destruction is on, challenging environmental agencies and policymakers. Political negligence has boosted deforestation in the Amazon, when coupled with deforestation drives that we already know about, as well as exempting environmental offenders and clearing the way to major infrastructure projects, in addition to weakening environmental agencies and command and control policies. In this letter, we share perspectives on the dynamics of deforestation alerts in the Brazilian Amazon and the action of public enforcement agencies, to draw attention to the urgency of supporting these entities for resuming the fight against deforestation. Our results reveal the few enforcement actions on deforestation alerts (1.3%) by the major environmental agency from the federal government. When compared with state government agencies, our in-depth case study showed a higher number of enforcement actions, promoting accountability for illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. It is evident that budget cuts for federal environmental agencies and changes in enforcement procedures have jeopardized actions to combat illegal deforestation. Our analysis calls for federal agencies to resume their powers, and for state agencies to recognize their role in environmental reinforcement and assigning liability. In the end, we list five key factors for reestablishing enforcement actions by public agencies for fighting deforestation and improving dissuasive effects.

AB  - Background: Recent advances in molecular source tracking make answering questions from residents regarding their exposure to microbial contaminants from industrial hog operations (IHOs) possible. Associations between residential distance to IHOs and exposure can be addressed by measuring livestock-associated (Staphylococcus aureus) and pig-specific bacteria in the air, on household surfaces, and in participants' nasal and saliva swabs. Objectives: Here we assess the mechanics, feasibility, capacity-building, and lessons learned during a pilot study employing this novel technology in community-based participatory research of bacterial exposure and human health. Methods: Together, our team of academics and community members designed a field- and laboratory-based pilot study. Air samples, surface and human swabs, and questionnaires from households at varying distances from IHOs were collected. Data were assessed for completeness and quality by two independent reviewers. These metrics were defined as: missingness (completeness), incorrect data type (validity), out of range (validity), and outliers (accuracy). Lessons Learned: While critical field equipment was obtained, and knowledge exchange occurred, leading to an increased capacity for future work, after review, 38 of 49 households were deemed eligible for inclusion in the study. Of eligible participants, 98% of required electronic survey questions were complete and 100% were valid; an improvement over prior work which employed paper surveys. While all human microbial and air samples were collected from eligible households (n = 231), (5%) of environmental swabs were reported missing. Conclusions: Using community-appropriate sampling protocols, a pilot study of residential exposure to bacteria from IHOs was completed. While high-quality data was collected from those eligible, we learned the necessity of early and continual data review.

AB  - Adaptation finance is primarily allocated to multilateral entities and national governments, rather than local organizations. This means that the social, political and economic processes that create and sustain inequalities within a country will be the same processes that determine how adaptation finance is used. Using an urban lens, we consider the obstacles currently faced by local governments and local civil society groups in accessing adaptation finance, and show that these are a function of systemic power imbalances between levels of government, and between government and vulnerable communities. We argue that even relatively small amounts of adaptation finance could have a catalytic effect on the capacities and impacts of local organizations, contributing to greater levels of both distributive and procedural justice. We analyse different financial intermediaries and planning systems that could be used to make disbursements from multilateral climate funds fairer and more effective. This could potentially create political opportunities both to respond to direct climate threats and to address underlying drivers of vulnerability, such as marginalization and exclusion. In this way, channelling adaptation finance to the local level could deliver more just processes and outcomes.Key policy insights More multilateral climate funds should establish direct access modalities, and introduce fit-for-purpose' accreditation procedures and approval processes. Those that have already established such enabling frameworks should prioritize providing readiness support to local organizations, and incentivize state and citizen collaboration in adaptation projects.National governments should consider clearly enshrining the rights and responsibilities of local authorities in National Adaptation Plans, and help them to collect the information, build the capacities and acquire the resources needed to plan and implement adaptation measures. National governments should further encourage local authorities to adopt participatory planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation procedures to encourage citizen participation.Local civil society groups should identify or establish collective entities that can seek accreditation with multilateral funds and then disburse money to their members. Collaboration between groups can facilitate up-scaling through replication (particularly where peer-to-peer learning is embedded in the network) and reduce the transaction costs associated with myriad small projects.

AB  - Air pollution is deleterious to human health, and numerous studies have documented racial and socioeconomic inequities in air pollution exposures. Despite the marginalized status of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations, no national studies have examined if they experience inequitable exposures to air pollution. This cross-sectional study investigated inequities in the exposure of same-sex partner households to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) in the US. We examined cancer and respiratory risks from HAPs across 71,207 census tracts using National Air Toxics Assessment and US Census data. We calculated population-weighted mean cancer and respiratory risks from HAPs for same sex male, same-sex female and heterosexual partner households. We used generalized estimating equations (GEES) to examine multivariate associations between sociodemographics and health risks from HAPs, while focusing on inequities based on the tract composition of same-sex, same-sex male and same-sex female partners. We found that mean cancer and respiratory risks from HAPs for same-sex partners are 12.3% and 23.8% greater, respectively, than for heterosexual partners. GEES adjusting for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status, population density, urban location, and geographic clustering show that living in census tracts with high (vs. low) proportions of same-sex partners is associated with significantly greater cancer and respiratory risks from HAPs, and that living in same-sex male partner enclaves is associated with greater risks than living in same-sex female partner enclaves. Results suggest that some health disparities experienced by LGBT populations (e.g. cancer, asthma) may be compounded by environmental exposures. Findings highlight the need to extend the conceptual framework for explaining LGBT health disparities beyond psycho-behavioral mechanisms translating social stress into illness to include environmental mechanisms. Because psycho-behavioral and environmental factors may together exacerbate health disparities, we call for a shift toward interdisciplinary research on LGBT health that takes into account cumulative risks, including the role of environmental exposures.

AB  - Air pollution at any given time is unequally distributed across locations. Average concentrations of fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) have fallen over time. However, we do not know how the spatial distribution of PM2.5 has evolved. Here, we provide early evidence. We combine 36 years of PM2.5 concentrations measured over similar to 8.6 million grid cells with geographic, economic, and demographic data from similar to 65,000 U.S. census tracts. We show that differences in PM2.5 between more and less polluted areas declined substantially between 1981 and 2016. However, the most polluted census tracts in 1981 remained the most polluted in 2016. The least polluted census tracts in 1981 remained the least polluted in 2016. The most exposed subpopulations in 1981 remained the most exposed in 2016. Overall, absolute disparities have fallen, but relative disparities persist.

AB  - Access and allocation is one of the five analytical themes of the science plan of the Earth System Governance (ESG) project. Concerns over access and allocation are at the core of struggles and conflicts brought about by the often ineluctable trade-offs related to biodiversity conservation and the global, national and local governance systems that aim to contribute to global biodiversity conservation. Access and benefit-sharing mechanisms, integrated conservation and development projects, payments for ecosystem services or community conservation programmes have all tried balancing environmental objectives with concerns for the allocation of natural resources and associated rights within society, and for access to basic human needs. As a contribution to this special issue on access and allocation, this paper aims to contribute to the analysis of the relevance of questions of access and allocation to ESG by providing an in-depth review of the literature on access and allocation in biodiversity conservation at different scales. We describe how the concepts of access and allocation have been used and conceptualized in the literature produced between 2008 and 2018, and we discuss the two key issues which dominate the literature (1) benefit-sharing; and (2) the role of local institutions. By drawing on the trends and evidence from the literature, we consider the lessons for the next generation of ESG scholars and draw out some key policy implications to be included in the debates on the post-2020 strategic plan for biodiversity.

AB  - Action on climate change has enjoyed popular support in most Western countries. Despite this, successive governments have struggled to implement policy to tackle this issue. Using the case of opposition to the Clean Energy Act, passed in Australia to establish an emissions trading scheme, this paper argues that a growing and broad sentiment of distrust in political elites, described as 'anti-politics', can explain some of this contradiction. Particular forms of climate policy, in particular emissions trading schemes, have been successfully framed as policies that appeal to the interests of a new class of liberal elites while hurting ordinary working people. This frame was used successfully in Australia by conservative forces to oppose the Clean Energy Act. While used cynically by political leaders in this case, the paper argues that anti-political sentiment reflects genuine concerns about the detachment between the state and voting population. This detachment is reflected in neoliberal climate policies. Through briefly examining the cases of the Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Gilets Jaunes protest movement, the paper argues that while formulating climate policy we must consider anti-political sentiment, developing responses to the climate crisis from a bottom-up rather than top-down approach.

AB  - Activists in the environmental justice movement are challenging expert-driven scientific research by taking the research process into their own hands and speaking for themselves by defining, analyzing, and prescribing solutions for the environmental health hazards confronting communities of the poor and people of color. I highlight the work of El Puente and The Watchperson Project-two community-based organizations in the Greenpoint/Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, that have engaged in community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address asthma and risks from subsistence-fish diets. The CBPR process aims to engage community members as equal partners alongside scientists in problem definition, information collection, and data analysis-all geared toward locally relevant action for social change. In the first case I highlight how El Puente has organized residents to conduct a series of asthma health surveys and tapped into local knowledge of the Latino population to understand potential asthma triggers and to devise culturally relevant health interventions. In a second case I follow The Watchperson Project and their work surveying subsistence anglers and note how the community-gathered information contributed key data inputs for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Cumulative Exposure Project in the neighborhood. In each case I review the processes each organization used to conduct CBPR, some of their findings, and the local knowledge they gathered, all of which were crucial for understanding and addressing local environmental health issues. I conclude with some observations about the benefits and limits of CBPR for helping scientists and communities pursue environmental justice.

AB  - Although public health and urban planning emerged with the common goal of preventing urban outbreaks of infectious disease, there is little overlap between the fields today. The separation of the fields has contributed to uncoordinated efforts to address the health of urban populations and a general failure to recognize the links between, for example, the built environment and health disparities facing low-income populations and people of color. I review the historic connections and lack thereof between urban planning and public health, highlight some challenges facing efforts to recouple the fields, and suggest that insights from ecosocial theory and environmental justice offer a preliminary framework for reconnecting the fields around a social justice agenda.

AB  - Across the applied ethics literatures are a growing number of ethical tools: decision-support methodologies that encourage multi-stakeholder deliberative engagement with the social and moral issues arising from technology assessment and environmental management processes. This article presents a novel ethical tool for deliberation on the issue of environmental justice between current and future generations over long time frames. This ethical tool combines two approaches, linking John Dewey's concept of dramatic rehearsal - an empathetic and imaginative ethical deliberation process; with the methodologies of backcasting a type of scenario planning technique drawn from the future studies literature. The proposed hybrid `Deweyan Backcasting' approach combines a creative process of devising multi-stakeholder visions of potentially desirable futures, with practical evaluation of the technical, social and political networks necessary to make such futures happen. It is suggested that such a model can provide a fruitful means for evaluating intergenerational environmental equity issues in long-range policy and planning.

AB  - Australia came very close to legislating an emissions trading scheme as part of a climate policy package in 2009. This climate policy was driven by a new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who had made addressing climate change his signature policy commitment both before and after the 2007 election that brought the Australian Labor Party to power. His climate policy was underpinned by two main interrelated narratives: ecological modernisation and climate justice. In this paper I consider the story of the Rudd government's climate policy experience through an ecological modernisation lens. In the end, it was the seeming disjuncture between political rhetoric and policy outcomes that brought the Rudd prime ministership down. The telling of the Rudd climate story through these narratives reveals some of the limitations of (mainstream) ecological modernisation as a major environmental management approach, as well as highlighting the vagaries of political leadership.

AB  - As the organizers of an event on women in the global city, we wanted to create a forum exploring the intersections of class, gender and other forms of inequality that fracture 'global Chicago'. In the panelists' discussion of the intersections of struggles relating to housing, education and environmental justice in Chicago's particular version of the global city, we found evidence of lives disrupted by neoliberal trends, as well as possible sites to contest these disruptions. These struggles reverberate to shape a new urban vision, as the academics and activists assembled for our panel aim not just to work on the local issues of specific women, but to create a city in which work is well compensated, housing is affordable for everyone, schools educate all children well, all neighborhoods are safe both from crime and environmental pollutants, and everyone has the time to fully engage as active citizens of the city.

AB  - Background Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heatwaves. Prior studies associate high temperature with preterm birth. Objectives We tested the hypotheses that acute exposure to extreme heat was associated with higher risk of live spontaneous preterm birth (>= 20 and <37 completed weeks), and that risks were higher among people of colour and neighbourhoods with heat-trapping landcover or concentrated racialised economic disadvantage. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of people giving birth between 2007 and 2011 in Harris County, Texas (Houston metropolitan area) (n = 198,013). Exposures were daily ambient apparent temperature (AT(max) in 5 degrees C increments) and dry-bulb temperatures (T-max and T-min >historical [1971-2000] summertime 99(th) percentile) up to a week prior for each day of pregnancy. Survival analysis controlled for individual-level risk factors, secular and seasonal trends. We considered race/ethnicity, heat-trapping neighbourhood landcover and Index of Concentration at the Extremes as effect modifiers. Results The frequency of preterm birth was 10.3%. A quarter (26.8%) of people were exposed to AT(max) >= 40 degrees C, and 22.8% were exposed to T-max and T-min >99(th) percentile while at risk. The preterm birth rate among the exposed was 8.9%. In multivariable models, the risk of preterm birth was 15% higher following extremely hot days (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 1.30) for AT(max) >= 40 degrees C vs. <20 degrees C; HR 1.15 (95% CI 1.02, 1.28) for T-max and T-min >99(th) percentile). Censoring at earlier gestational ages suggested stronger associations earlier in pregnancy. The risk difference associated with extreme heat was higher in neighbourhoods of concentrated racialised economic disadvantage. Conclusions Ambient heat was associated with spontaneous preterm birth, with stronger associations earlier in pregnancy and in racially and economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, suggesting climate change may worsen existing social inequities in preterm birth rates.

AB  - A growing body of literature suggests that more unequal societies have more polluted and degraded environments, perhaps helping explain why more unequal societies are often less healthy. We summarize the mechanisms by which inequality can lead to environmental degradation and their relevance for public health. We review the evidence of a relationship between environmental quality and social inequality along the axes of income, wealth, political power, and race and ethnicity. Our review suggests that the evidence is strongest for air- and water-quality measures that have more immediate health implications; evidence is less strong for more dispersed pollutants that have longer-term health impacts. More attention should be paid in research and in practice to links among inequality, the environment, and health, including more within-country studies that may elucidate causal pathways and points of intervention. We synthesize common metrics of inequality and methodological considerations in an effort to bring cohesion to such efforts.

AB  - A just and sustainable energy transition will require not only new fuels, but new energy stories. The dominant, 'fossil' myth of energy, depoliticizes the forward march of energy intensity over human history. Instead, we need energy stories that more fully account for the role of political domination in major energy transitions of the past. Fossil domination is historically unique in its marriage of racial capitalism and imperialism, but it may also reflect broader patterns of fuel transition. I draw upon recent research on two momentous energy transitions - the rise of grain states and fossil fuel empires - that show howpoliticalinnovations in labor extraction and domination were the main catalysts for transition, rather than superior fuel technologies or a public thirst for more energy. Emphasizing the role of domination across energy history disrupts the fossil myth, while also making space for more transformative energy stories.

AB  - As the world continues to urbanize, ensuring that urban residents have access to green infrastructure and the ecosystem services it provides will be critical. Furthermore, the distribution of green infrastructure within cities should be equitable so that no socioeconomic group is underserved in terms of the benefits derived from ecosystem services. Our goal was to test whether there were any differences among socioeconomic groups in terms of (1) proximity to open space, (2) proximity to Lake Michigan, (3) tree canopy cover, or (4) bird biodiversity in census tracts across Chicago, IL (USA). These four variables were used as proxies for a number of different ecosystem services. We characterized the first three variables with GIS operations using classified Quickbird imagery and other datasets that describe the urban and natural environment. We used MaxEnt to model suitable bird habitat for 52 species that are regularly observed in the area and combined the habitat maps to estimate bird biodiversity in a spatially explicit manner. Our results suggest that census tracts with more low-to mid-income Hispanic residents were farther away from both open space and Lake Michigan, and had less tree canopy cover and bird biodiversity than other census tracts. Tracts characterized mostly by low-income African Americans were not statistically different in terms of proximity to open space, nor in terms of tree canopy cover or bird biodiversity, than those characterized by higher income residents. Those tracts were, however, significantly farther from Lake Michigan compared to the higher income census tracts. This research suggests the potential for environmental injustice in Chicago and we discuss some possible causes and implications of our findings.

AB  - Background Having the ability to scan the entire country for potential "hotspots" with increased risk of developing chronic diseases due to various environmental, demographic, and genetic susceptibility factors may inform risk management decisions and enable better environmental public health policies. Objectives Develop an approach for community-level risk screening focused on identifying potential genetic susceptibility hotpots. Methods Our approach combines analyses of phenotype-genotype data, genetic prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms, and census/geographic information to estimate census tract-level population attributable risks among various ethnicities and total population for the state of California. Results We estimate that the rs13266634 single nucleotide polymorphism, a type 2 diabetes susceptibility genotype, has a genetic prevalence of 56.3%, 47.4% and 37.0% in Mexican Mestizo, Caucasian, and Asian populations. Looking at the top quintile for total population attributable risk, 16 California counties have greater than 25% of their population living in hotspots of genetic susceptibility for developing type 2 diabetes due to this single genotypic susceptibility factor. Conclusions This study identified counties in California where large portions of the population may bear additional type 2 diabetes risk due to increased genetic prevalence of a susceptibility genotype. This type of screening can easily be extended to include information on environmental contaminants of interest and other related diseases, and potentially enables the rapid identification of potential environmental justice communities. Other potential uses of this approach include problem formulation in support of risk assessments, land use planning, and prioritization of site cleanup and remediation actions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental health risks are disproportionately colocated with communities in poverty and communities of color. In some cases, participatory research projects have effectively addressed structural causes of health risk in environmental justice (EJ) communities. However, many such projects fail to catalyze change at a structural level. OBJECTIVES: This review employs Critical Interpretive Synthesis (CIS) to theorize specific elements of participatory research for environmental health that effectively prompt structural change in EJ communities. METHODS: Academic database search was used to identify peer-reviewed literature describing participatory research with ET communities to address environmental health. Synthetic constructs were developed iteratively related to study characteristics, design elements, and outcomes; and data were extracted for included records. Statistical analyses were performed to assess correlations between study design elements and structural change outcomes. Through critical, comparative, and contextual analyses of the "structural change" case study group and "non- structural change" group, informed by relevant theoretical literature, a synthesizing argument was generated. RESULTS: From 505 total records identified, eligibility screening produced 232 case study articles, representing 154 case studies, and 55 theoretical articles for synthesis. Twenty-six case studies resulted in a structural change outcome. The synthesizing argument states that participatory research with ET communities may be more likely to result in structural change when a) community members hold formal leadership roles; b) project design includes decision-makers and policy goals; and c) long term partnerships are sustained through multiple funding mechanisms. The assumption of El community benefit through research participation is critically examined. DISCUSSION: Recommended future directions include establishing structural change as a goal of participatory research, employing participatory assessment of community benefit, and increased hiring of faculty of color at research institutions. The power, privilege, and political influence that academic institutions are able to leverage in partnership with EJ communities may be as valuable as the research itself.

AB  - A national interpretation process involving diverse actors and interests is required to transform global environmental initiatives into policies appropriate to the national or subnational context. These processes of localising norms are critical spaces to formulate equitable pathways to environmental conservation, yet have received limited attention from policy makers and researchers. We explored national policy processes for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD + ) in Uganda and Nepal from the perspectives of 'intermediaries', state and civil society actors at subnational and national scale who promote the interests of various stakeholder groups. Through think-tank meetings and semi-structured interviews with a range of intermediaries, we uncovered that REDD + implementation processes in both countries are dominated by international actors, applying a demanding administrative agenda and restricting space for deliberation. Consequently, social aspects of policy were compartmentalised, reduced to technical exercises and local equity concerns inadequately addressed in national REDD + policies. For example, social safeguards approaches were perceived to lack substantive guidelines to promote equity. Limited national political space to criticise government policy and lack of attention to relevant evidence further restricted ability to address entrenched injustices such as status inequalities faced by marginalised groups. Although civil society organisations choose to maintain official involvement with REDD + , many expressed a possibility they would oppose REDD + in future, or serious doubts about its design and expected outcomes. Concerns centred on lack of recognition of indigenous peoples' and local communities' values, identities, practices and institutions such as customary tenure systems, alongside possible detrimental impacts to decentralised forest governance regimes, well established in Nepal and emerging in Uganda. We suggest features to be enshrined in REDD + policy for adapting national interpretation processes to become more effective spaces for empowering diverse intermediaries to negotiate and influence localisation of international norms, ultimately to promote more equitable pathways to reduced deforestation and degradation.

AB  - A case study of 102 surface and underground coal miners in the western United States randomly selected from a telephone survey of two mining communities was conducted, examining their perceptions of working conditions and health both before and after the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. Miners working since 1970 reported lower amounts of dust breathed in, increased dust-mask use, and better mine ventilation. Respiratory illnesses, including coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), were most often reported by those who worked largely prior to the Act; respiratory symptoms, such as persistent cough and shortness of breath, were reported by miners who worked primarily after the act. Miners' perceptions of the federal black-lung compensation process and concerns about diesel equipment are presented. These data are further discussed within the environmental-justice and risk-perception frameworks. Recommendations are suggested regarding regulations and public policy.

AB  - Background: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) holds tremendous promise for addressing public health disparities. As such, there is a need for academic institutions to build lasting partnerships with community organizations. Herein we have described the process of establishing a relationship between a research university and a Black church in rural North Carolina. We then discuss Harvest of Hope, the church-based pilot garden project that emerged from that partnership. Methods: The partnership began with a third-party effort to connect research universities with Black churches to address health disparities. Building this academic-community partnership included collaborating to determine research questions and programming priorities. Other aspects of the partnership included applying for funding together and building consensus on study budget and aims. The academic partners were responsible for administrative details and the community partners led programming and were largely responsible for participant recruitment. Results: The community and academic partners collaborated to design and implement Harvest of Hope, a church-based pilot garden project involving 44 youth and adults. Community and academic partners shared responsibility for study design, recruitment, programming, and reporting of results. The successful operation of the Harvest of Hope project gave rise to a larger National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, Faith, Farming and the Future (F3) involving 4 churches and 60 youth. Both projects were CBPR efforts to improve healthy food access and reducing chronic disease. This partnership continues to expand as we develop additional CBPR projects targeting physical activity, healthy eating, and environmental justice, among others. Benefits of the partnership include increased community ownership and cultural appropriateness of interventions. Challenges include managing expectations of diverse parties and adequate communication. Lessons learned and strategies for building and maintaining similar partnerships are discussed. Conclusions: The benefits of community-based research for addressing health disparities are many, and there are lessons to be learned that can strengthen community-academic partnerships.

AB  - Air pollution disproportionately burdens communities of color and lower-income communities in US cities. We have generally lacked city-wide concentration measurements that resolve the steep spatiotemporal gradients of primary pollutants required to describe intra-urban air pollution inequality. Here, we use observations from the recently launched TROPospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite sensor and physics-based oversampling to describe nitrogen dioxide (NO2) disparities with race, ethnicity, and income in 52 US cities (June 2018-February 2020). We report average US-urban census tract-level NO2 inequalities of 28 +/- 2% (race-ethnicity and income combined), with many populous cities experiencing even greater inequalities. Using observations and inventories, we find diesel traffic is the dominant source of NO2 disparities, and that a 62% reduction in diesel emissions would decrease race-ethnicity and income inequalities by 37%. We add evidence that TROPOMI resolves tract-scale NO2 differences using relationships with urban segregation patterns and spatial variability in column-to-surface correlations.

AB  - Accurate and timely population information is essential for public planning and commercial applications. Traditional population estimates, however, are only available at aggregated geographic levels (e.g., state, county, etc.). To address this problem, a new bottom-up method was proposed for population estimation at the census block level by integrating high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and geographic information system (GIS) data and a demographic housing unit (HU) model. Two major components of the HU model, HU numbers and persons per household (PPH), were estimated by employing detailed information extracted from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and GIS data. Further, population counts for each census block were generated through applying the HU model. Analysis of results suggests that the proposed integrated method performs reasonably well, as indicated by relatively small estimation errors. For a better assessment, the estimation accuracies of HU numbers, PPH, and population counts were compared with other widely applied techniques, and results indicated that this method significantly improved the accuracy. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the sources of errors for population estimates. Results indicate that, when compared to PPH estimates, the error associated with HU number estimates is a major source of small-area population estimation errors.

AB  - Background Low-cost sensors have the potential to democratize air pollution information and supplement regulatory networks. However, differentials in access to these sensors could exacerbate existing inequalities in the ability of different communities to respond to the threat of air pollution. Objective Our goal was to analyze patterns of deployments of a commonly used low-cost sensor, as a function of demographics and pollutant concentrations. Methods We used Wilcoxon rank sum tests to assess differences between socioeconomic characteristics and PM2.5 concentrations of locations with low-cost sensors and those with regulatory monitors. We used Kolomogorov-Smirnov tests to examine how representative census tracts with sensors were of the United States. We analyzed predictors of the presence, and number of, sensors in a tract using regressions. Results Census tracts with low-cost sensors were higher income more White and more educated than the US as a whole and than tracts with regulatory monitors. For all states except for California they are in locations with lower annual-average PM2.5 concentrations than regulatory monitors. The existing presence of a regulatory monitor, the percentage of people living above the poverty line and PM2.5 concentrations were associated with the presence of low-cost sensors in a tract. Significance Strategies to improve access to low-cost sensors in less-privileged communities are needed to democratize air pollution data.

AB  - Background Environmental health disparity research involves the use of metrics to assess exposure to community-level vulnerabilities or inequities. While numerous vulnerability indices have been developed, there is no agreement on standardization or appropriate use, they have largely been applied in urban areas, and their interpretation and utility likely vary across different geographies. Objective We evaluated the spatial distribution, variability, and relationships among different metrics of social vulnerability and isolation across urban and rural settings to inform interpretation and selection of metrics for environmental disparity research. Methods For all census tracts in North Carolina, we conducted a principal components analysis using 23 socioeconomic/demographic variables from the 2010 United States Census and American Community Survey. We calculated or obtained the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), residential racial isolation index (RI), educational isolation index (EI), Gini coefficient, and social vulnerability index (SVI). Statistical analyses included Moran's I for spatial clustering, t-tests for urban-rural differences, Pearson correlation coefficients, and changes in ranking of tracts across metrics. Results Social vulnerability metrics exhibited clear spatial patterning (Moran's I >= 0.30, p < 0.01). Greater educational isolation and more intense neighborhood deprivation was observed in rural areas and greater racial isolation in urban areas. Single-domain metrics were not highly correlated with each other (rho <= 0.36), while composite metrics (i.e., NDI, SVI, principal components analysis) were highly correlated (rho > 0.80). Composite metrics were more highly correlated with the racial isolation metric in urban (rho: 0.54-0.64) versus rural tracts (rho: 0.36-0.48). Census tract rankings changed considerably based on which metric was being applied. Significance High correlations between composite metrics within urban and rural tracts suggests they could be used interchangeably; single domain metrics cannot. Composite metrics capture different facets of vulnerabilities in urban and rural settings, and these complexities should be examined by researchers applying metrics to areas of diverse urban and rural forms.

AB  - Background The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) has evolved as an umbrella concept to describe approaches to learning from and using nature to create sustainable socio-ecological systems. Furthermore, NBS often address multiple societal challenges that humans are facing in the medium to long-term and as such can enhance human well-being (HWB). This study was commissioned to fulfil the need for a targeted systematic evidence map on the linkage between NBS and HWB to support focused research going forward that addresses the key knowledge needs of policy makers in the UK and beyond. Methods A consultation with policy makers and government agency staff (n = 46), in the four component parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) was conducted in spring 2019. This identified four key societal challenges of operational experience lacking a scientific evidence base. Three of these challenges related to management issues: NBS cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice. The fourth challenge related to the acoustic environment (soundscape). Using systematic methods, this study searched for and identified studies that assessed NBS on HWB with regard to these four selected societal challenges. Review findings A total of 7287 articles were returned from the systematic search and screened for suitability at the level of title and abstract. A total of 610 articles passed screening criteria to warrant full text screening. Of these, 115 studies met the full text criteria for eligibility in the final systematic map database. Included studies were coded for twelve NBS interventions and ten HWB related outcome categories. Most of the evidence reviewed referred to natural, blue or green infrastructure in the urban environment and focused on economic, material and health aspects of HWB. Less than 2% of studies identified in the searches robustly reported the role of NBS actions or interventions on HWB compared with non-NBS actions or interventions Conclusion This systematic map found the evidence base is growing on NBS-HWB linkages, but significant biases persist in the existing literature. There was a bias in favour of the urban environment and restoration studies focused on conservation aspects, with only a few studies investigating the full suite of advantages to HWB that can be delivered from NBS actions and interventions. The soundscape was the least studied of the societal challenges identified as being of key importance by policy makers, with cost-efficiency the most reported. There was a lack of robust long-term studies to clearly test the potential of NBS regarding the HWB outcomes compared with non-NBS alternatives. This lack of robust primary knowledge, covering all four key societal challenges identified, confirms that the knowledge gaps identified by the policy makers persist, and highlights a clear research need for long-term, transdisciplinary studies that focus on comparisons between NBS and non-NBS alternatives

AB  - Background The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) has evolved as an umbrella concept embracing concepts such as Green/Blue/Nature Infrastructure, Ecosystem Approach, Ecosystem Services, but at their core, they cluster into the general theme of learning from and using nature to create sustainable socio-ecological systems, which enhance human well-being (HWB). NBS address societal challenges across a broad range of spatial scales-local, regional and global-and temporal scales-medium to long-term. While there are many reviews and a clear evidence base linking certain NBS to various elements of HWB, particularly urban greenspace and human health, no comprehensive mapping exists of the links between NBS interventions and the associated multiple positive and negative HWB outcomes across a range of habitats. The initial research phase used a participatory co-design process to select four priority societal challenges facing the United Kingdom: three related to management issues i.e. NBS cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice, and the fourth threats to the acoustic environment. These challenges collectively address priority management issues which stakeholders requested be investigated widely i.e. across landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes and soundscapes. Results of the study are intended to identify and define potential future environmental evidence challenges for UK science. Methods This protocol describes the methodology for approaching the research question: What evidence is there for nature based solutions and their impacts on human wellbeing for societal challenges related to cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice, and the acoustic environment? Using systematic mapping, this study will search for and identify studies that seek to assess nature-based solutions on human well-being with regard to these four societal challenges. Systematic searches across a number of academic/online databases are tested against a number of test articles. Search results are refined using eligibility criteria through a three stage process: title, abstract, full text. Data from screened studies are extracted using a predefined coding strategy. Key trends in data will be synthesized according to a range of secondary questions and be presented in a graphical matrix illustrating the knowledge gaps and clusters for research into nature-based solutions and human well-being for each societal challenge.

AB  - A model describing parents' preferences to relieve their own and their children's acute illnesses is estimated using stated-preference data. Estimated marginal rates of substitution (MRS) between child and parent illness are about two, indicating that parents value children's illness attributes twice as highly as their own. The MRS is larger for younger children, falls toward unity as the child approaches adulthood, and appears to reflect parental altruism rather than parent-child differences in initial health or illness costs. Intra-family allocations may compensate for chronic health impairments. Parents' willingness to pay to avoid own or child illness increases with income, declines with fertility, increases at a decreasing rate with duration and number of symptoms, and depends on perceived discomfort and activity restrictions. Current methods of assessing morbidity benefits of environmental regulations may understate substantially the value of children's health, particularly in African-American families.

AB  - Although states continue to work together under the UNFCCC, it is increasingly apparent that not enough is being done, and that a just response to climate change is not being pursued. This paper asks whether non-state actors, such as cities, corporations, and non-governmental organisations might, by contrast, offer hope for such a response to emerge. Using the city of Bristol as an empirical case study, the paper puts forward that non-state actors can not only lower emissions and/or contribute to adaptation efforts, but more importantly have the potential to significantly shift the context of climate change action and create space for systemic change. They therefore offer room for cautious optimism.

AB  - Australian air pollution standards are set at national and state levels for a number of chemicals harmful to human health. However, these standards do not need to be met when ad hoc pollution licences are issued by state environment agencies. This situation results in a highly unequal distribution of air pollution between towns and cities, and across the country. This paper examines these pollution regulations through two case studies, specifically considering the ability of the regulatory regime to protect human health from lead and sulphur dioxide pollution in the communities located around smelters. It also considers how the proposed National Clean Air Agreement, once enacted, might serve to reduce this pollution equity problem. Through the case studies we show that there are at least three discrete concerns relating to the current licencing system. They are: non-onerous emission thresholds for polluting industry; temporal averaging thresholds masking emission spikes; and ineffective penalties for breaching licence agreements. In conclusion, we propose a set of new, legally-binding national minimum standards for industrial air pollutants must be developed and enforced, which can only be modified by more (not less) stringent state licence arrangements.

AB  - A consistent critique of the theory and empirical research on collaborative governance is a lack of conceptualization and analysis of the role of political power and inequality. Our paper contributes to this discussion by analyzing the formal representation of small disadvantaged communities in the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in California. Employing primary and secondary data, we model the likelihood of representation in the state's new Groundwater Sustainability Agencies based on key attributes of both the communities and governance settings. We find that the overall collaborative governance is associated with increased representation of these marginalized stakeholders. Importantly, however, even in collaborative settings representation of the smallest, most low-income communities and those lacking political recognition via incorporated cities or public water districts still lags far behind their more advantaged counterparts. In fact, disparities in representation along these lines increased. Using a uniquely interdisciplinary approach our analysis highlights the opportunity afforded by integrating collaborative governance and environmental justice in the shared pursuit of effective and equitable institutions and the inter-related goals of equity and sustainability.

AB  - A consensus of the Workgroup on Community and Socioeconomic Issues was that improving and sustaining healthy rural communities depends on integrating socioeconomic development and environmental protection. The workgroup agreed that the World Health Organization's definition of health, "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity," applies to rural communities. These principles are embodied in the following main points agreed upon by this workgroup. Healthy rural communities ensure a) the physical and mental health of individuals, b) financial security for individuals and the greater community, C) social well-being, d) social and environmental justice, and e) political equity and access. This workgroup, evaluated impacts of the proliferation of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) on sustaining the health of rural communities. Recommended policy changes include a more stringent process for issuing permits for CAFOs, considering bonding for manure storage basins, limiting animal density per watershed, enhancing local control, and mandating environmental impact statements.

AB  - Background: Redlining was a racialized zoning practice in the U.S. that blocked fair access to home loans during the 1930s, and recent research is illuminating health problems in the current residents of these historically redlined areas. However, this work has not yet been holistically summarized. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis comparing health outcomes in redlined versus non-redlined neighborhoods in U.S. cities.& nbsp;Methods: We extracted relevant articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Science Direct databases published from January 2010 to September 2021.& nbsp;Results: The search revealed 12 studies on preterm births (n = 3), gunshot-related injuries (n = 2), cancer (n = 1), asthma (n = 1), self-rated health (n = 1), multiple health outcomes (n = 2), heat-related outcomes (n = 1) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality (n = 1). A meta-analysis of three studies found the odds of having preterm birth was significantly higher (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.88; p = 0.02) among women living in redlined areas compared to those in non-redlined areas. Review of other outcomes revealed that gunshot-related injuries, asthma, heat-related outcomes, and multiple chronic conditions were worse in redlined areas, while associations with cancer varied by cancer type. In terms of cause-specific mortality, one study revealed no link between residential redlining and infant mortality rate, while one study on COVID-19 outcomes was inconclusive.& nbsp;Conclusions: Overall, this review presents evidence that living in historically redlined areas is associated with increased risk of multiple serious adverse health outcomes. Further research on mechanisms, remediation, and neighborhood-level interventions is needed to strengthen the understanding of the impacts of redlining on health.

AB  - Associations between contaminated land and socio demographics are well documented in high-income countries. In low- and middle-income countries, however, little is known about the extent of contaminated land and possible demographic correlations. This is an important yet sparsely researched topic with potentially significant public health implications as exposure to pollution remains a leading source of morbidity and mortality in low-income countries. In this study, we review the associations between several socio demographic factors (population, population density, unemployment, education, and literacy) and contaminated sites in Ghana. Within this context, both correlation and association intend to show the relationship between two variables, namely contaminated sites and socio demographics. Aggregated district level 2010 census data from Ghana Statistical Service and contaminated site location data from Pure Earth's Toxic Sites Identification Program (TSIP) were spatially evaluated using the number of sites per kilometer squared within districts as the unit of measurement. We found a low to medium positive correlation ( range: 0.285 to 0.478) between contaminated sites and the following socio demographics: higher population density, higher unemployment, greater education, and higher literacy rate. These results support previous studies and suggest that several socio demographic factors may be reasonably accurate predictors of contaminated site locations. More research and targeted data collection is needed to better understand these associations with the ultimate goal of developing a predictive model.

AB  - Background: Despite indoor home environments being where people spend most time, involving residents in testing those environments has been very limited, especially in marginalized communities. We piloted participatory testing and reporting that combined relatively simple tests with actionable reporting to empower residents in Main South/Piedmont neighborhoods of Worcester, Massachusetts. We answered: 1) How do we design and implement the approach for neighborhood and household environments using participatory methods? 2) What do pilot tests reveal? 3) How does our experience inform testing practice? Methods: The approach was designed and implemented with community partners using community-based participatory research. Residents and researchers tested fourteen homes for: lead in dust indoors, soil outdoors, paint indoors and drinking water; radon in basement air; PM2.5 in indoor air; mold spores in indoor/outdoor air; and drinking water quality. Monitoring of neighborhood particulates by residents and researchers used real-time data to stimulate dialogue. Results: Given the newness of our partnership and unforeseen conflicts, we achieved moderate-high success overall based on process and outcome criteria: methods, test results, reporting, lessons learned. The conflict burden we experienced may be attributable less to generic university-community differences in interests/culture, and more to territoriality and interpersonal issues. Lead-in-paint touch-swab results were poor proxies for lead-in-dust. Of eight units tested in summer, three had very high lead-in-dust (> 1000 mu g/ft(2)), six exceeded at least one USEPA standard for lead-in-dust and/or soil. Tap water tests showed no significant exposures. Monitoring of neighborhood particulates raised awareness of environmental health risks, especially asthma. Conclusions: Timely reporting back home-toxics' results to residents is ethical but it must be empowering. Future work should fund the active participation of a few motivated residents as representatives of the target population. Although difficult and demanding in time and effort, the approach can educate residents and inform exposure assessment. It should be considered as a core ingredient of comprehensive household toxics' testing, and has potential to improve participant retention and the overall positive impact of long-term environmental health research efforts.

AB  - Asthma can be exacerbated by environmental factors including airborne particulate matter (PM) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). We report on a study designed to characterize PM levels and the effectiveness of filters on pollutant exposures of children with asthma. 126 households with an asthmatic child in Detroit, Michigan, were recruited and randomized into control or treatment groups. Both groups received asthma education; the latter also received a free-standing high efficiency air filter placed in the child's bedroom. Information regarding the home, emission sources, and occupant activities was obtained using surveys administered to the child's caregiver and a household inspection. Over a one week period, we measured PM, carbon dioxide (CO2), environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) tracers, and air exchange rates (AERs). Filters were installed at midweek. Before filter installation, PM concentrations averaged 28 mu g m(-3), number concentrations averaged 70,777 and 1471 L-1 in 0.3-1.0 and 1-5 mu m size ranges, respectively, and the median CO2 concentration was 1018 ppm. ETS tracers were detected in 23 of 38 homes where smoking was unrestricted and occupants included smokers and, when detected, PM concentrations were elevated by an average of 15 mu g m(-3). Filter use reduced PM concentrations by an average of 69-80%. Simulation models representing location conditions show that filter air flow, room volume and AERs are the key parameters affecting PM removal, however, filters can achieve substantial removal in even "worst" case applications. While PM levels in homes with asthmatic children can be high, levels can be dramatically reduced using filters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Air change rates (ACRs) and interzonal flows are key determinants of indoor air quality (IAQ) and building energy use. This paper characterizes ACRs and interzonal flows in 126 houses, and evaluates effects of these parameters on IAQ. ACRs measured using weeklong tracer measurements in several seasons averaged 0.73 +/- 0.76 h(-1) (median = 0.57 h(-1), n = 263) in the general living area, and much higher, 1.66 +/- 1.50 h(-1) (median = 1.23 h(-1), n = 253) in bedrooms. Living area ACRs were highest in winter and lowest in spring; bedroom ACRs were highest in summer and lowest in spring. Bedrooms received an average of 55 +/- 18% of air from elsewhere in the house; the living area received only 26 +/- 20% from the bedroom. Interzonal flows did not depend on season, indoor smoking or the presence of air conditioners. A two-zone IAQ model calibrated for the field study showed large differences in pollutant levels between the living area and bedroom, and the key parameters affecting IAQ were emission rates, emission source locations, air filter use, ACRs, interzonal flows, outdoor concentrations, and PM penetration factors. The single-zone models that are commonly used for residences have substantial limitations and may inadequately represent pollutant concentrations and exposures in bedrooms and potentially other environments other where people spend a substantial fraction of time.

AB  - Although mainstream banking institutions offer a suite of benefits to patrons, the proportion of U.S. households that are unbanked and underbanked remains persistently high. This study examines the spatial relationship between alternative financial service providers (AFSPs) and banks and neighborhood demographics in southeastern Pennsylvania. Results from spatial regression analyses reveal that AFSPs are disproportionately located in close proximity to neighborhoods with comparatively lower levels of educational attainment and higher rates of subprime mortgage lending, whereas banks are disproportionately located in close proximity to neighborhoods with comparatively higher levels of income and educational attainment and a lower percentage of minority residents.

AB  - A new variation of the user equilibrium-discrete network design problem (UE-DNDP) is proposed for achieving environmental justice (EJ) or equity among population groups. This research is motivated by the federal requirement that transportation plans using federal money include an evaluation of EJ and that the planning agency mitigate, where feasible, any disproportionate impacts on protected populations (i.e., minority and low-income groups). Eight potential objective functions focused on maximizing equity of congestion and travel time are developed and discussed with regard to their applicability for the upper level of this bilevel problem. On the basis of assumed knowledge of the origin-destination travel matrices by population group, numerical analysis is conducted to assess the performance of each proposed formulation. The lower-level UE problem is solved by using the Frank-Wolfe method, and because of the hard combinatorial nature of EJ-UE-DNDP, a selectorecombinative genetic algorithm is implemented to search the solution space for feasible network improvement strategies efficiently. The results of numerical analysis suggest that Pareto-optimal approaches can be successfully applied and that the most effective formulations minimize the difference between the change in congestion or travel time across population groups due to the selected improvement projects.

AB  - Adaptation decisions are necessarily about the distribution of risk and resources and thus are inherently political, with implications for equity and justice. These concerns are increasingly recognized to be pertinent in adaptation to urban flooding. Yet, the technical orientation of many flood adaptation interventions and decision-support may make these issues less visible in flood decision-processes. We draw from recent empirical case studies to identify thematic 'points of entry' that can facilitate attention to issues of justice and politics in urban flood decision-support. We map these entry points to four phases of the adaptation decision-process, highlighting lines of inquiry to enable researchers to make these concerns visible in collaboration with partnering organizations and stakeholders. We argue that researchers will need to work with stakeholders to make effective use of existing approaches and methods to explicitly make the political dimensions and issues of justice visible in decision-processes.

AB  - Air pollution and the urban heat island effect are consistently linked to numerous respiratory and heat-related illnesses. Additionally, these stressors disproportionately impact low-income and historically marginalized communities due to their proximity to emissions sources, lack of access to green space, and exposure to other adverse environmental conditions. Here, we use relatively low-cost stationary sensors to analyze PM2.5 and temperature data throughout the city of Richmond, Virginia, on the ten hottest days of 2019. For both hourly means within the ten hottest days of 2019 and daily means for the entire record for the year, the temperature was found to exhibit a positive correlation with PM2.5. Analysis of hourly means on the ten hottest days yielded a diurnal pattern in which PM2.5 levels peaked in the early morning and reached their minima in the mid-afternoon. Spatially, sites exhibiting higher temperatures consistently had higher PM2.5 readings, with vulnerable communities in the east end and more intensely developed parts of the city experiencing significantly higher temperatures and PM2.5 concentrations than the suburban neighborhoods in the west end. These findings suggest an uneven distribution of air pollution in Richmond during extreme heat events that are similar in pattern but less pronounced than the temperature differences during these events, although further investigation is required to verify the extent of this relationship. As other studies have found both of these environmental stressors to correlate with the distribution of green space and other land-use factors in cities, innovative and sustainable planning decisions are crucial to the mitigation of these issues of inequity going forward.

AB  - Background Eye irritation is a constant hazard for migrant and seasonal farmworkers, but there are few studies of the problem or how to address it. Researchers evaluated the effect of a community-based participatory eye health intervention on farmworker eye symptoms in the Hudson Valley, NY. Methods A randomized pre-post intervention with 2, 4-week follow-up periods was implemented with a sample of 97 farmworkers. Five eye symptoms were measured, along with utilization of protective eyewear and eye drops. Results Leading baseline eye symptoms were redness (49%), blurred vision (43%), itching (43%), and eye pain (29%). Significant reductions in eye pain (P = 0.009), and nonsignificant reductions in redness were observed for the intervention group while controls experienced increases in both. Conclusions The intervention was effective in significantly reducing eye pain, and to a lesser extent, redness. Future eyewear promotion programs should offer a range of eye wear, tailor offerings to local climate and tasks, evaluate eyewear durability, and include eye drops. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A key challenge in addressing the global degradation of natural resources and the environment is to effectively transfer successful strategies across heterogeneous contexts. Archetype analysis is a particularly salient approach in this regard that helps researchers to understand and compare patterns of (un)sustainability in heterogeneous cases. Archetype analysis avoids traps of overgeneralization and ideography by identifying reappearing but nonuniversal patterns that hold for well-defined subsets of cases. It can be applied by researchers working in inter- or transdisciplinary settings to study sustainability issues from a broad range of theoretical and methodological standpoints. However, there is still an urgent need for quality standards to guide the design of theoretically rigorous and practically useful archetype analyses. To this end, we propose four quality criteria and corresponding research strategies to address them: (1) specify the domain of validity for each archetype, (2) ensure that archetypes can be combined to characterize single cases, (3) explicitly navigate levels of abstraction, and (4) obtain a fit between attribute configurations, theories, and empirical domains of validity. These criteria are based on a stocktaking of current methodological challenges in archetypes research, including: to demonstrate the validity of the analysis, delineate boundaries of archetypes, and select appropriate attributes to define them. We thus contribute to a better common understanding of the approach and to the improvement of the research design of future archetype analyses.

AB  - Background A growing body of research has examined relationships between neighborhood characteristics and exposure to air toxics in the United States. However, a limited number of studies have addressed neighborhood isolation, a measure of spatial segregation. We investigated the spatial distribution of carcinogenic air toxics in the St. Louis metropolitan area and tested the hypothesis that neighborhood isolation and sociodemographic characteristics are associated with exposure to carcinogenic air toxics. Methods: We obtained lifetime air toxics cancer risk data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxic Assessment and sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey. We used geographic information systems to identify statistically significant clusters of census tracts with elevated all-site cancer risk due to air toxics in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Relative Risks (RR) were estimated for the association between neighborhood characteristics and air toxic hot spots. Using a local spatial isolation index to evaluate residential segregation, we also evaluated the association between neighborhood racial and economic isolation and air toxic hot spots. Results: Approximately 14% (85 of the 615) of census tracts had elevated cancer risk due to air toxics (p < 0.01). These air toxic hot spots were independently associated with neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and unemployment and low levels of education. Census tracts with the highest levels of both racial isolation of Blacks and economic isolation of poverty were more likely to be located in air toxic hotspots than those with low combined racial and economic isolation (RR = 5.34; 95% CI = 3.10-9.22). Conclusions: These findings provide strong evidence of unequal distribution of carcinogenic air toxics in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Study results may be used to inform public health efforts to eliminate sociodemographic inequalities in exposure to air pollutants.

AB  - A framework is constructed for how to relate ecosystem services to environmental justice. The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing "out there", but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decision-making, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban 'green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity-what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agroecology needs to increasingly integrate feminist contributions to understand and transform power relations in food systems. This study is based on the participation in and analysis of meetings led by women from different territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, in 2018 in Chiapas (Mexico), in which they addressed problems and alternatives related to food and agriculture. Our analysis identifies the matrix of oppressions: heteropatriarchy, capitalism and colonialism, to understand the power relations in the current corporate industrial food system. We sustain that it is necessary to continue exploring practical alternatives to transcend inequalities and allow the territorial expansion of agroecology with socio-environmental justice.

AB  - Although gold mining multinational or transnational companies continue to profit from their activities in resource endowed developing countries, the gap between company profits and social and environmental justice in these resource rich developing countries is a subject of intense debate. This debate is especially heightened when the gap is examined in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper employs the Environmental Justice concept to assess the activities of the Goldfields Damang mining company in Ghana vis-a-vis the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing on primary data from semi-structured interviews (n = 22) and secondary sources, the paper finds that the negative impacts of gold mining do not conform with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially goals 2, 6, 14 and 15. The study makes two recommendations: First, policies on land tenure and the Mineral and Mining Act need revisions to incorporate more rights for indigenous people; second, existing structures and legislation that spells out compensation and land dispossession practices must be revised thoroughly to align with the UN sustainable development goals. The paper concludes by considering the theoretical and policy implications of the findings for strengthening mining laws and policies in Ghana.

AB  - Background Communities need to efficiently estimate the burden from specific pollutants and identify those most at risk to make timely informed policy decisions. We developed a risk-based model to estimate the burden of black carbon (BC) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on coronary heart disease (CHD) across environmental justice (EJ) and non-EJ populations in Allegheny County, PA. Methods Exposure estimates in census tracts were modeled via land use regression and analyzed in relation to US Census data. Tracts were ranked into quartiles of exposure (Q1-Q4). A risk-based model for estimating the CHD burden attributed to BC and NO2 was developed using county health statistics, census tract level exposure estimates, and quantitative effect estimates available in the literature. Results For both pollutants, the relative occurrence of EJ tracts (> 20% poverty and/or > 30% non-white minority) in Q2 - Q4 compared to Q1 progressively increased and reached a maximum in Q4. EJ tracts were 4 to 25 times more likely to be in the highest quartile of exposure compared to the lowest quartile for BC and NO2, respectively. Pollutant-specific risk values (mean [95% CI]) for CHD mortality were higher in EJ tracts (5.49 x 10(- 5) [5.05 x 10(- 5) - 5.92 x 10(- 5)]; 5.72 x 10(- 5) [5.44 x 10(- 5) - 6.01 x 10(- 5)] for BC and NO2, respectively) compared to non-EJ tracts (3.94 x 10(- 5) [3.66 x 10(- 5) - 4.23 x 10(- 5)]; 3.49 x 10(- 5) [3.27 x 10(- 5) - 3.70 x 10(- 5)] for BC and NO2, respectively). While EJ tracts represented 28% of the county population, they accounted for about 40% of the CHD mortality attributed to each pollutant. EJ tracts are disproportionately skewed toward areas of high exposure and EJ residents bear a greater risk for air pollution-related disease compared to other county residents. Conclusions We have combined a risk-based model with spatially resolved long-term exposure estimates to predict CHD burden from air pollution at the census tract level. It provides quantitative estimates of effects that can be used to assess possible health disparities, track temporal changes, and inform timely local community policy decisions. Such an approach can be further expanded to include other pollutants and adverse health endpoints.

AB  - Ambient air pollution is a long-standing and significant public health issue. The aim of this review is to systematically examine the peer-reviewed evidence on social inequalities and ambient air pollution in the World Health Organization European Region. Articles published between 2010 and 2017 were analyzed in the review. In total 31 articles were included in the review. There is good evidence from ecological studies that higher deprivation indices and low economic position are usually linked with higher levels of pollutants such as particulate matter (particulate matter under 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter, PM2.5, PM10) and oxides of nitrogen (e.g., NO2, and NOx). There is also evidence that ethnic minorities experience a mixed exposure in comparison to the majority population being sometimes higher and sometimes lower depending on the ethnic minority under consideration. The studies using data at the individual level in this review are mainly focused on pregnant women or new mothers, in these studies deprivation and ethnicity are more likely to be linked to higher exposures of poor air quality. Therefore, there is evidence in this review that the burden of higher pollutants falls disproportionally on different social groups.

AB  - Air pollution levels are generally believed to be higher in deprived areas but associations are complex especially between sensitive population subgroups. We explore air pollution inequalities at national, regional and city level in England and the Netherlands comparing particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and publicly available population characteristics (deprivation, ethnicity, proportion of children and elderly). We saw higher concentrations in the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England (1.5 mu g/m(3) higher PM10 and 4.4 mu g/m(3) NO2). Concentrations in both countries were higher in neighbourhoods with >20% non-White (England: 3.0 mu g/m(3) higher PM-p) and 10.1 mu g/m(3) NO2; the Netherlands: 1.1 mu g/m(3) higher PM10 and 4.5 mu g/m(3) NO2) after adjustment for urbanisation and other variables. Associations for some areas differed from the national results. Air pollution inequalities were mainly an urban problem suggesting measures to reduce environmental air pollution inequality should include a focus on city transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although co-ordinated and comprehensive efforts at citywide greening had only emerged in the last two centuries, green spaces and vegetation have been a vital part of urban history, across periods and locales. Urban dwellers have inserted and maintained urban greenery for a wide variety of reasons. Some of these imperatives are persistent throughout time, while others have emerged with new knowledge and societal developments. More often than not, multiple motivations are embedded in urban greening projects. Based on a review of existing literature spanning multiple disciplines, we provide an overview of the range of reasons why urban dwellers have embarked on greening projects in their environments. We identify nine themes that continue to be highly relevant today, and provide brief historical perspective on each. By extending the discussion of urban greening beyond its potential to meet contemporary challenges, we hope to provide a more long-ranging view of why greenery has been incorporated in cities.

AB  - A common approach in scientific research and policy is a commitment to develop projects or legislation trying to improve problems experienced by low-income and rural communities; however, lack of interaction with community members during the process tends to produce unsatisfactory results. We visited disadvantaged communities in the San Joaquin Valley of California and interviewed local stakeholders (community members and leaders, policy advocates, attorneys, and educators). Then we analyzed a corpus related to disadvantaged communities from a pool of California-related publications containing 154,000 scientific papers, 2.6 million newspaper articles, and 11,000 state legislation bills from 2017 to 2020 to estimate the frequency and quality of disadvantaged community representation. Here we present our findings describing the biases and gaps of knowledge by scientific papers, California newspaper articles, and legislation bills with respect to disadvantaged communities in California, and we suggest opportunities for scientists, media communicators, and policymakers to amplify the voices of these stakeholders. In all corpus categories, disadvantaged communities are underrepresented: about one in four Californians live in disadvantaged communities, but only one in 2000 news articles and scientific papers cover them. The concerns and priorities of disadvantaged communities do not match the public perspective of them depicted by the corpus. Developing effective policies requires addressing placespecific nuances and co-occurrence of structural inequities in partnership with local stakeholders. Holistic coverage in newspapers and community-based approaches are necessary platforms to increase awareness and sensibility about disadvantaged communities, helping tailor policy solutions, and building the political leverage needed to implement them.

AB  - As the pressure to address the climate crisis builds, scientists must walk the line between research and activism. This was apparent at the 2019 United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change - Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC - COP), the largest annual meeting to address the climate crisis via supranational policymaking. COP has convened annually since 1995 in effort to establish international agreements for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and in 2015, was the launch pad for the UN Paris Climate Agreement (PCA). Here, we present our collective perspective as early-career researchers on COP, an institution that we believe plays a critical role in the future of our oceans. Given the current pledges from signatories to the PCA, Earth is expected to warm similar to 3 degrees C by 2100, with the majority of anthropogenic heat content stored throughout the ocean. For this reason, among others, we feel it is crucial for ocean scientists to have a baseline understanding of the negotiations unfolding at COP and within the UNFCCC. We also provide evidence that certain features/structures of COP formalize colonial hierarchies, marginalize certain groups, and threaten to perpetuate the drivers of the environmental crises we all face. Thus, we urge that the future of such gatherings include purposeful and self-reflective acts of restructuring the space they occupy, the solutions they advocate, and the ways in which power is distributed amongst participants. We balance our critique with examples of how this has already been successful at COP, particularly with respect to organizing around ocean-climate issues.

AB  - Allegations that disproportionate environmental risks fall on low-income and minority communities promote calls for '"environmental justice." A related claim suggests that higher rates of some diseases stem from unequal risks. The empirical evidence supporting these claims remains weak, but uncertainty and controversy are unlikely to abate in the near future. The environmental justice movement has successfully mobilized its constituents, and captured the attention of policymakers, with a politically potent rhetoric of "risk and racism." Ironically, the movement remains largely uninterested in, or even hostile to, formal risk assessment even while ostensibly calling for more of it.

AB  - A key feature of cumulative risk assessment (CRA) is the ability to estimate differential health risks from environmental exposures within populations. Identifying populations at increased risk from environmental exposures is the First step toward mitigating such risks as required by the fair treatment mandate of environmental justice. CRA methods remain under development except for a limited application in pesticide regulations. The goals of this research were to advance CRA methods and to test their application in a community case study. We compared cumulative risk and health assessments for South and Southwest Philadelphia communities. The analysis found positive correlations between cumulative risk and mortality measurements for total mortality in Whites and non-Whites when we conducted the risk assessment using a multi-end point toxicological database developed for this project. Cumulative risk scores correlated positively with cause-specific mortality in non-Whites. Statistically, significant increases in total and respiratory mortality rates were associated with incremental increases in the hazard ratio cumulative risk scores, with ranges of 2-6% for total and 8-23% for respiratory. Regression analyses controlled for percent non-White population and per capita income, indicating that risk scores represent an environmental effect on health independent of race and income. This case study, demonstrated the successful application of CRA at the community level. CRA adds a health dimension to pollutant concentrations to produce a more comprehensive understanding of environmental inequities that can inform decision making. CRA is a viable tool to identify high-risk areas and to guide surveillance, research, or interventions.

AB  - Background: Conservation decisions not only impact wildlife, habitat, and environmental health, but also human wellbeing and social justice. The inclusion of safeguards and equity considerations in the conservation field has increasingly garnered attention in international policy processes and amongst conservation practitioners. Yet, what constitutes an 'equitable' solution can take many forms, and how the concept is treated within conservation research is not standardized. This review explores how social equity is conceptualized and assessed in conservation research. Methods/Design: Using a structured search and screening process, we identified 138 peer-reviewed studies that addressed equity in relation to conservation actions. The authors developed a coding framework to guide the review process, focusing on the current state of, definitions used for, and means of assessing social equity in empirical conservation research. Review Results: Results show that empirical research on social equity in conservation is rapidly growing, with the majority of studies on the topic published only since 2009. Equity within conservation research is skewed toward distributional concerns and to a lesser extent procedural issues, with recognition and contextual equity receiving little attention. Studies are primarily situated in forested biomes of the Global South. Conservation interventions mostly resulted in mixed or negative impacts on equity. Synthesis and Discussion: Our results demonstrate the current limitations of research on equity in conservation, and raise challenging questions about the social impacts of conservation and how to ameliorate equity concerns. Framing of equity within conservation research would benefit from greater transparency of study motivation, more explicit definition of how equity is used within the study context, and consideration for how best to assess it. We recommend that the empirical conservation literature more deeply engage with different notions of equity when studying, planning, and implementing actions to address potential trade-offs among equity and conservation objectives and beneficiaries.

AB  - Although there is a growing interest in the concept of climate justice, both in academia and society in general, there is still no consensus regarding the best models and data to represent it. Thus, the objective of this paper is to test and statistically validate the confirmatory factor model for climate justice. To do this, we applied Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), which designs and tests statistically the significance of a multidimensional theoretical construct. The main results were: a) the individual freedoms derived from the capability approach and the climate actions of adaptation and mitigation were empirically confirmed as viable perspectives for assessing climate justice; b) the theoretical constructs of human development, climate actions and climate justice can be constructed based on a set of 25 indicators; and c) the three confirmatory models were successfully tested to validate a theoretical/measurement model for climate justice. We believe that the results observed will provide policymakers and national governments with a new perspective for the alignment of different types of human development programs with climate change actions, helping them on the establishment of possible links between actions taken at the national level and the definition of global goals.

AB  - Alcohol outlet oversaturation often exacerbates negative public health outcomes. Recently, Baltimore City passed an extensive zoning rewrite ("TransForm Baltimore") that sought to give local government and residents a tool to reduce alcohol outlet oversaturation through land use regulation. The present investigation evaluated the outlet and neighborhood characteristics of stores impacted by two components of TransForm Baltimore: (1) a requirement that taverns licensed for on-premise consumption in addition to off-premise, carryout sales generate at least 50% of their business from on-premise sales, and (2) a requirement to close, repurpose, or relocate all package stores (i.e., off-premise alcohol outlets) that have been operating as "non-conforming" in residential zones since 1971. Research assistants visited every off-premise alcohol outlet in the city (n = 685) to complete an observational assessment. Approximately 77% (n = 530) of these off-premise alcohol outlets were open, including 292 taverns and 238 package stores.ttests and chi-square tests were used to compare neighborhood characteristics (neighborhood disadvantage, median household income, and racial segregation) of sham taverns (i.e., taverns with less than 50% space dedicated for on-premise sales that were primarily operating as a package store) and non-conforming package stores. Of the 292 taverns accessible during the study, the remainder were chronically closed (n = 130); 24 (8.2%) were deemed sham taverns. Sham taverns were more likely to be located in communities with more economic disadvantage and lower median household income (ttest;p < 0.05). Compared to taverns, a lower proportion of sham taverns had visible dance floor space, patrons drinking, and menus available (chi-square test;p < 0.001). There were 80 residentially zoned, non-conforming alcohol outlets. These non-conforming alcohol outlets were disproportionately distributed in predominately poor and African American communities (ttest;p < 0.05). As compared to conforming alcohol outlets, more non-conforming alcohol outlets sold sex paraphernalia and healthy foods (chi-square test;p < 0.05). With active enforcement, TransForm Baltimore offers the opportunity for local government and residents to improve public health and increase health equity in vulnerable and marginalized neighborhoods.

AB  - Background: Advocates for environmental justice, local, state, and national public health officials, exposure scientists, need broad-based health indices to identify vulnerable communities. Longitudinal studies show that perception of current health status predicts subsequent mortality, suggesting that self-reported health (SRH) may be useful in screening-level community assessments. This paper evaluates whether SRH is an appropriate surrogate indicator of health status by evaluating relationships between SRH and sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health care factors as well as serological indicators of nutrition, health risk, and environmental exposures. Methods: Data were combined from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for 1372 nonsmoking 20-50 year olds. Ordinal and binary logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of reporting poorer health based on measures of nutrition, health condition, environmental contaminants, and sociodemographic, health care, and lifestyle factors. Results: Poorer SRH was associated with several serological measures of nutrition, health condition, and biomarkers of toluene, cadmium, lead, and mercury exposure. Race/ethnicity, income, education, access to health care, food security, exercise, poor mental and physical health, prescription drug use, and multiple health outcome measures (e.g., diabetes, thyroid problems, asthma) were also associated with poorer SRH. Conclusion: Based on the many significant associations between SRH and serological assays of health risk, sociodemographic measures, health care access and utilization, and lifestyle factors, SRH appears to be a useful health indicator with potential relevance for screening level community-based health and environmental studies.

AB  - Access to safe and reliable drinking water is commonplace for most Canadians. However, the right to safe and reliable drinking water is denied to many First Nations peoples across the country, highlighting a priority public health and environmental justice issue in Canada. This paper describes trends and characteristics of drinking water advisories, used as a proxy for reliable access to safe drinking water, among First Nations communities in the province of Ontario. Visual and statistical tools were used to summarize the advisory data in general, temporal trends, and characteristics of the drinking water systems in which advisories were issued. Overall, 402 advisories were issued during the study period. The number of advisories increased from 25 in 2004 to 75 in 2013. The average advisory duration was 294 days. Most advisories were reported in summer months and equipment malfunction was the most commonly reported reason for issuing an advisory. Nearly half of all advisories occurred in drinking water systems where additional operator training was needed. These findings underscore that the prevalence of drinking water advisories in First Nations communities is a problem that must be addressed. Concerted and multi-faceted efforts are called for to improve the provision of safe and reliable drinking water First Nations communities.

AB  - Air pollution has become a global environmental problem that directly affects the living quality of city residents. It not only does damages to the physical health of the human body but also has adverse effects on mood, outdoor activities, and social interactions, which further reduces the vitality of the city. Dining out is an important way of social interaction for city residents. Using Beijing as an example, this paper aims to study the impacts of different air pollutants on dining-out activities and satisfaction of urban and suburban residents. The results show that: (1) Air pollution can significantly reduce dining-out frequency and satisfaction; (2) Due to differences in environmental and health awareness, the impact of air pollution on dining-out behaviors varies among urban and suburban residents; and (3) O-3 pollution has a greater emotional impact on suburban residents than urban residents, possibly because of the differences in defense strategies and levels of pollution exposure in the workplace. The findings imply that improving air quality can obtain not only health benefits but also long-term social and economic vitality. The publicity of environment and health information should be strengthened on key urban air pollutants, especially on particulate matter and O-3, and on disadvantaged groups to enhance environmental justice.

AB  - A case study of environmental justice organizing in South Carolina explores how local activists can build an oppositional ideology that connects to a broader agenda for social justice. A multi-issue, state-wide workers' rights organization provided ideological context and strategic experience that enabled residents fighting to clean up a polluted pond to connect their concern to a wider effort for economic justice and undoing racism. The organization's worker-centered, multiracial identity and an organizing strategy that exposes contradictions of the dominant ideology are seen as enabling these wider connections.

AB  - Although it is often acknowledged that social and environmental factors interact to produce racial and ethnic environmental health disparities, it is still unclear how this occurs. Despite continued controversy, the environmental justice movement has provided some insight by suggesting that disadvantaged communities face greater likelihood of exposure to ambient hazards. The exposure-disease paradigm has long suggested that differential "vulnerability" may modify the effects of toxicants on biological systems. However, relatively little work has been done to specify whether racial and ethnic minorities may have greater vulnerability than do majority populations and, further, what these vulnerabilities may be. We suggest that psychosocial stress may be the vulnerability factor that links social conditions with environmental hazards. Psychosocial stress can lead to acute and chronic changes in the functioning of body systems (e.g., immune) and also lead directly to illness. In this article we present a multidisciplinary framework integrating these ideas. We also argue that residential segregation leads to differential experiences of community stress, exposure to pollutants, and access to community resources. When not counterbalanced by resources, stressors may lead to heightened vulnerability to environmental hazards.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-based research often involves additional ethical, legal, and social considerations beyond those of the specific individuals involved in the study. The traditional institutional review board (IRB) typically focuses on protecting the rights and ensuring the safety of the individuals involved. For projects involving community members, IRBs should be more sensitive to issues related to the broader community concerns. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to discuss the concept of community-based participatory research and the shortcomings of the traditional IRBs in dealing with ethical issues associated with broader community concerns such as implications for family members, neighborhood groups, and local businesses. I examine the rationale and benefits for expanding the roles and responsibilities of review boards related to community-based issues. DISCUSSION: I propose the development of environmental health and community review boards (EHCRBs) that combine the fundamental responsibilities and ethical concept of the traditional review boards with an expanded ethical construct of dignity, veracity, sustainability, and justice, with an added emphasis on community. CONCLUSIONS: Only by acknowledging the needs of and working with the community can we ensure ethically based and socially responsible research. An EHCRB will allow researchers and community members to more fully address their mutual interest in conducting scientific, ethical, and socially responsible research.

AB  - Background: Infographics are an effective way of communicating complex information due to their reliance on concise language and clear, uncluttered visuals. Research indicates that traffic-related ultrafine particles (UFPs) in air pollutions adversely affect human health, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we work with community-based adult literacy programs to develop an infographic about UFPs in air pollution with the goal of community-driven problem solving related to traffic-related UFPs within affected neighborhoods. Objective: In this paper, we discuss the development and evaluation of an infographic about the dangers of UFPs from traffic pollution, and actions that readers in affected communities can take to protect their health. We used the infographic format to conceptualize UFP pollution and its health effects visually for community members many of whom are new immigrants and do not speak English as their first language. Methods: We conducted 1 focus group and 4 interviews over Zoom, and collected 74 anonymous surveys among Boston Chinatown and Somerville, MA residents. Community partner organizations assisted us in recruiting participants by sending a recruitment flyer to their email contacts and identifying specific people who were interested in participating. Key Results: Data from the surveys, focus group, and interviews yielded 8 themes that guided the revision of the infographic. The majority of the participants responded positively to the infographic: 95.9% (n = 71) of respondents reported that the purpose of the infographic was clear, that the infographic contained a clear message, and that the infographic uses images to explain important points. Conclusions: Our experience developing and evaluating an infographic about near highway pollution in environmental justice communities suggests that infographics can be a viable communication tool in this context. Further research with infographics of a similar nature but in diverse communities is needed to strengthen our conclusion.

AB  - Attempts in Canada to include citizens in decision-making around extractive processes have been tokenistic at best and generally fail to meaningfully include the voices, opinions, and rights of people on whose land a given project is being planned. Therefore, informal avenues for influencing decision-making are being taken by communities, often Indigenous communities and often in the form of resistance. In this article we argue that resistance, in the form of blockades, occupations and other strategies are powerfully shaping outcomes in Canada, and indeed constitute a form of governance in and of themselves, helping drive the urgently needed transformative change that formal governance systems continue to fail to bring about. Our argument is based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of 57 cases of environmental conflict in Canada, accessed through the Global Environmental Justice Atlas. These cases provide concrete examples of this bottom-up, land-based governance through resistance led by communities on the front lines of extractivism. These diverse and inspiring cases ground our theorizing and raise important insights and lessons for understanding resistance as trans-formative governance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse cardiorespiratory health is associated with exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM). The highest PM concentrations in London occur in proximity to waste transfer stations (WTS), sites that experience high numbers of dust-laden, heavy-duty diesel vehicles transporting industrial and household waste. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to quantify the contribution of WTS emissions to ambient PM mass concentrations and oxidative potential. METHODS: PM with a diameter < 10 mu m (PM10) samples were collected daily close to a WTS. PM10 mass concentrations measurements were source apportioned to estimate local versus background sources. PM oxidative potential was assessed using the extent of antioxidant depletion from a respiratory tract lining fluid model. Total trace metal and bioavailable iron concentrations were measured to determine their contribution to PM oxidative potential. RESULTS: Elevated diurnal PM10 mass concentrations were observed on all days with WTS activity (Monday Saturday). Variable PM oxidative potential, bioavailable iron, and total metal concentrations were observed on these days. The contribution of WTS emissions to PM at the sampling site, as predicted by microscale wind direction measurements, was correlated with ascorbate (r = 0.80; p = 0.030) and glutathione depletion (r = 0.76; p = 0.046). Increased PM oxidative potential was associated with aluminum, lead, and iron content. CONCLUSIONS: PM arising from WTS activity has elevated trace metal concentrations and, as a consequence, increased oxidative potential. PM released by WTS activity should be considered a potential health risk to the nearby residential community.

AB  - Although fields such as industrial ecology have advanced our understanding of how cleaner technologies, recycling, and lifestyle changes can reduce the impacts of production and consumption on people and planet, environmental deterioration and social injustices stubbornly persist. New strategies are needed to achieve change in an era of increasing urgency. This paper proposes that academics study the supply chains of individual corporations and link them to environmental and social impacts in geographically specific areas. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have used this approach successfully, issuing reports about corporate activity related to deforestation, sweatshops, and other issues of social concern. But academics, by and large, have studied generic products, industries, and sectors. To verify this, after reviewing approximately 11,000 studies on supply chains, we identified just 27 academic papers that focused on individual corporations. These were primarily by NGOs and social scientists, with no studies by industrial ecologists meeting our review criteria. To uncover corporate supply chains, researchers used two distinct methodological approaches: in situ (interviews, surveys, and surveillance) and ex situ (trade data, document analysis, and maps). In this paper, we explain why and how academics should study the supply chains of individual corporations. This is done by combining approaches from industrial ecology, with those from geography, sociology, and other social sciences to develop a political-industrial ecology of supply chains. This both physically links actual product flows with their environmental impacts, and explores how they affect justice, equity, and welfare. The work we propose offers clear collaborative linkages with NGOs, industry, and the media.

AB  - A long history of overt discrimination left an enduring racialized imprint upon the geography of the East Bay. While the benefits of a metropolitan decentralization of jobs, housing, and public investment fell to Whites, discrimination in employment and housing trapped African Americans in urban neighborhoods burdened by infrastructure encroachment and divestment. By circa 1970, overt discrimination succumbed to new, racially neutral, legal, and administrative forms, including regional planning processes. Using an environmental racism framework, we show that these new forms reproduced the existing racialized geography by means of new inequalities in representation and transportation service provision. These new regional transportation policies, like those challenged by a 2005 civil rights lawsuit, favored the mobility needs of more affluent suburbanites over those of African American East Bay bus riders. These policies, layered onto an existing racialized geography, reinforced existing inequalities by failing to address racial barriers to opportunity in the built environment.

AB  - Background The presence of active or inactive (i.e., postproduction) oil and gas wells in neighborhoods may contribute to ongoing pollution. Racially discriminatory neighborhood security maps developed by the Home-Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the 1930s may contribute to environmental exposure disparities. Objective To determine whether receiving worse HOLC grades was associated with exposure to more oil and gas wells. Methods We assessed exposure to oil and gas wells among HOLC-graded neighborhoods in 33 cities from 13 states where urban oil and gas wells were drilled and operated. Among the 17 cities for which 1940 census data were available, we used propensity score restriction and matching to compare well exposure neighborhoods that were similar on observed 1940 sociodemographic characteristics but that received different grades. Results Across all included cities, redlined D-graded neighborhoods had 12.2 +/- 27.2 wells km(-2), nearly twice the density in neighborhoods graded A (6.8 +/- 8.9 wells km(-2)). In propensity score restricted and matched analyses, redlined neighborhoods had 2.0 (1.3, 2.7) more wells than comparable neighborhoods with a better grade. Significance Our study adds to the evidence that structural racism in federal policy is associated with the disproportionate siting of oil and gas wells in marginalized neighborhoods.

AB  - A key criterion of successful adaptation to climate change is that it avoids potential inequalities arising from climate impacts or from adaptation strategies themselves. Recent research on adaptation in developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and should be situated in the milieu of people's daily lives and temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second homeowners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of place-specific and people centric values for achieving fair adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although UNESCO has a stated aim to incorporate culture into all development policies, culturally integrated approaches to realising the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are arguably yet to gain widespread traction. Focusing on cultural practices relating to music and sound, this article explores the role of culture and cultural policy in advancing the SDGs in the Asia-Pacific, through three case studies. In Indonesia, a local project to document and sustain the music of the Indigenous Marapu people is generating positive health and wellbeing (SDG3), equality (SDG10) and community sustainability (SDG11) outcomes. In Australia, River Listening shows how artistic uses of underwater soundscapes can encourage local communities to learn about, and take action to support, life below water (SDG 14), while also increasing climate awareness and action (SDG13) and advancing sustainable cities and communities (SDG11). In Vanuatu, the Leweton Cultural Village is a community-led cultural enterprise advancing climate justice (SDG13), gender equality (SDG5), culturally appropriate education (SDG4), and economic prospects (SDG8) for the community, as well as increasing its resilience (SDG3). The authors consider how these and other examples might inspire deeper integration of culture, particularly cultural practices featuring music and sound, into policy efforts to achieve the SDGs in the Asia-Pacific.

AB  - Background: Although studies suggest that exposure to pollutants is associated with race/ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES), many studies are limited to the geographic regions where monitoring stations are located. Objectives: This study uses modeled predictive surfaces to examine the relationship between air pollution exposure, race/ethnicity, and measures of SES across the entire State of North Carolina. Methods: The daily predictions of particulate matter <2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) were determined using a spatial model that fused data from two sources: point air monitoring data and gridded numerical output. These daily predicted pollution levels for 2002 were linked with Census data. We examine the relationship between the census-tract level predicted concentration measures, SES, and racial composition. Results: SES and race/ethnicity were related to predicted concentrations of both PM2.5 and O-3 for census tracts in North Carolina. Lower SES and higher proportion minority population were associated with higher levels of PM2.5. An interquartile range (IQR) increase of median household income reduced the predicted average PM2.5 level by 0.10 mu g/m(3). The opposite relationship was true for O-3. An IQR increase of median household income increased the predicted average O-3 measure by 0.11 ppb. Conclusions: The analyses demonstrate that SES and race/ethnicity are related to predicted estimates of PM2.5 and O-3 for census tracts in North Carolina. These findings offer a baseline for future exposure modeling work involving SES and air pollution for the entire state and not just among the populations residing near monitoring networks.

AB  - A screening environmental justice analysis was conducted of 50 United States ports that manage more than 10 million tons of products. Using the U.S. EPA's EJSCREEN tool, the author examined seven demographic and 11 environmental metrics at distances of 2, 5, and 10 miles from the port centroids. The 2-mile zones were found to have higher values for 13 of the 18 environmental inequity indicators, including all three measures of air toxics, fine particles, proximity to hazardous waste sites, and facilities with risk management plans, as well as indicators of low socioeconomic status and minority populations. With ports expanding, the author discusses the need for maintaining and upgrading EPA's screening tool and considers that alternative futures for port neighborhoods depend upon the strength of their civic groups and elected officials, the role of their government port authorities, and civic values of their commercial users.

AB  - Background Children are sensitive to the health impacts of environmental contaminants, but research assessing outdoor environmental exposures for children and schools is underdeveloped. There are no national-level studies examining geographical and social disparities in air pollution exposure for children in school districts. Focusing on school districts is important because they are meaningful decision-making entities for schools. Methods Using data from the National Air Toxics Assessment, we spatially reallocated lifetime cancer risk (LCR) from hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) within US school district boundaries, and paired those estimates with school district level sociodemographic measures obtained through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series National Historic Geographic Information System. We employed local Moran's I to identify district-level hotpots and generalised estimating equations (GEEs) to quantify risk disparities. Results We identified hotspots of elevated LCR from all sources of HAPs (called 'total'). A regional hotspot extends throughout the southeastern USA and smaller regional hotspots are present in southern Arizona, southern California and in California's central valley. School districts with higher proportions of children, children with disabilities, foreign-born children, black children and multiracial/other race children, and lower proportions of Native American children, had greater total LCR (p<0.001). The effect of poverty on total LCR (p<0.001) was nonlinear; the lowest and highest poverty districts had lower total LCR. Conclusions Geographical and social disparities in LCR across US school districts may be affecting children's health and future potential. This new knowledge can inform policy changes, as school districts can advocate for the environmental health of children.

AB  - Although much environmental justice research tacitly assumes that unequal environmental exposures produce geographic disparities in adverse health outcomes, very few empirical environmental justice studies have tested that assumption. This article does so by using estimates of exposure to air toxics disaggregated by emission source (point and mobile) to predict children's hospitalization rates for both asthma and respiratory infections in El Paso, Texas. Air toxics emissions from most source categories were found to be significant predictors of children's respiratory infection hospitalization rates, but not asthma hospitalization rates, at the census tract level. Findings suggest that sociospatial disparities in respiratory infection rates might be linked to environmental inequalities.

AB  - A nature-based approach to climate resilience aims to challenge and re-frame conventional environmental management methods by refocusing solutions from technological strategies to socio-ecological principles such as human well-being and community-based governance models, thereby improving and legitimizing the delivery of ecosystem services (ES). There are, however, many challenges to applying a socio-ecological agenda to urban climate resilience and thereby re-framing ES delivery as community and people focused, a knowledge gap extensively outlined in the environmental governance literature. In this paper, we aim to contribute to this re-assesment of urban environmental governance by examining the City of Melbourne's approach to urban renaturing governance from a place-based perspective. Here we focus on the city's internationally-acclaimed urban forest strategy (UFS), investigating how and to which extent the governance arrangements embedded within the UFS draw strength from diverse perspectives and allow for institutional arrangements that support "situated" reflexive decision making and co-creation. We find that Melbourne's UFS governance process fosters green placemaking by re-focusing climate adaptation solutions from technological strategies to situated socio-ecological principles such as human well-being and community-based decision making. In this sense, this case provides valuable insight for the broader UGI governance field regarding the opportunities and challenges associated with a socio-cultural approach to urban re-naturing and ES delivery.

AB  - Air quality in street canyons is of major importance, since the highest pollution levels are often encountered in these microenvironments. The canyon effect (reduced natural ventilation) makes them "hot spots" for particulate pollution contributing to adverse health effects for the exposed population. In this study we tried to characterize the influence of UFP (ultrafine particle) emissions from traffic on population exposure in an urban street canyon, by applying the intake fraction (iF) approach. One month long measurements of UFP levels have been monitored and used for the need of this study. We applied a three dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model based on real measurements for the simulation of UFP levels. We used infiltration factors, evaluated on a daily basis for the under study area, to estimate the indoor UFP levels. As a result the intake fraction for the pedestrians, residents and office workers is in the range of (1E-5)-(1E-4). The street canyon is mostly residential justifying partially the higher value of intake fraction for residents (1E-4). The above iF value is on the same order of magnitude with the corresponding one evaluated in a relative street canyon study. The total iF value in this microenvironment is one order of magnitude higher than ours, explained partially by the different use and activities. Two specific applications of iF to assess prioritization among emission sources and environmental justice issues are also examined. We ran a scenario with diesel and gasoline cars and diesel fueled vehicle seems to be a target source to improve overall iF. Our application focus on a small residential area, typical of urban central Athens, in order to evaluate high resolution iF. The significance of source-exposure relationship study in a micro scale is emphasized by recent research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although research has shown that low socio-economic status (SES) and minority communities have higher exposure to air pollution, few studies have simultaneously investigated the associations of individual and neighborhood SES with pollutants across multiple sites. OBJECTIVES: We characterized the distribution of ambient air pollution by both individual and neighborhood SES using spatial regression methods. METHODS: The study population comprised 6,140 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Year 2000 annual average ambient PM2.5 and NOx concentrations were calculated for each study participant's home address at baseline examination. We investigated individual and neighborhood (2000 U. S. Census tract level) SES measures corresponding to the domains of income, wealth, education, and occupation. We used a spatial intrinsic conditional autoregressive model for multivariable analysis and examined pooled and metropolitan area-specific models. RESULTS: A 1-unit increase in the z-score for family income was associated with 0.03-mu g/m(3) lower PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.05, -0.01) and 0.93% lower NOx (95% CI: -1.33, -0.53) after adjustment for covariates. A 1-SD-unit increase in the neighborhood's percentage of persons with at least a high school degree was associated with 0.47-mu g/m(3) lower mean PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.40) and 9.61% lower NOx (95% CI: -10.85, -8.37). Metropolitan area-specific results exhibited considerable heterogeneity. For example, in New York, high-SES neighborhoods were associated with higher concentrations of pollution. CONCLUSIONS: We found statistically significant associations of SES measures with predicted air pollutant concentrations, demonstrating the importance of accounting for neighborhood-and individual-level SES in air pollution health effects research.

AB  - As the debate on sustainable development and environmental justice has gathered momentum, considerable attention has been paid to identifying key principles. In this paper, I highlight a number of core principles and then move on to examine differing styles of policy approach, which have gained favor among different sources, for moving toward the sustainable city from marker-based neoliberal reformism to deep green ecologically centered approaches. I highlight four broad categories of approach to sustainable urban development and begin linking those to the core principles of sustainable development.

AB  - Background: East Liverpool, Ohio, the site of a hazardous waste incinerator and a manganese (Mn) processor, has had air Mn concentrations exceeding United States Environmental Protection Agency reference levels for over a decade. Save Our County, Inc., a community organization, was formed to address community environmental health concerns related to local industry. Researchers from the University of Cincinnati partnered with Save Our County to determine if air Mn had an impact on the neurocognitive function of children in the community. Methods: Children 7-9 years of age from East Liverpool and its surrounding communities, were enrolled (N = 106) in the Communities Actively Researching Exposure Study from between March 2013 June 2014. Blood and hair were analyzed for Mn and lead, and serum was analyzed for cotinine. We used linear regression to assess associations between biological measures and IQ subscale scores. Results: Geometric mean blood lead (n = 67), blood Mn (n = 66), hair Mn (n = 98), and serum cotinine (n = 69) concentrations were 1.13 +/- 1.96 mu g/dL, 10.06 +/- 1.30 mu g/L, and 360.22 +/- 2.17 ng/g, 0.76 +/- 6.12 mu g/L respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, hair Mn was negatively associated with Full Scale IQ. Conclusions: Hair Mn was negatively associated with child IQ scores. Community partners were instrumental in the conception and implementation of this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Fish is a dietary staple in the United States. Risk of exposure to persistent contaminants through fish consumption is a significant health concern. Great Lakes basin states, along with the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Great Lakes Consortium for Fish Consumption Advisories, have developed and continuously updated fish consumption advisories specifically for the Great Lakes basin residents. Objectives: To characterize Great Lakes basin residents' fish consumption and advisory awareness, we conducted a point-in-time survey to describe fish consumption habits and awareness of state and EPA/FDA fish advisories. Methods: We used a randomized, address-based sampling approach to recruit respondents from the eight Great Lakes basin states. Weighted survey analysis procedures were used to estimate population prevalence of fish consumption habits, state and EPA/FDA advisory awareness, and demographic and background characteristics. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between demographic and background factors and fish consumption and awareness of advisories, respectively. Results: About 92% of respondents, representing an estimated 61 million adults, reported eating fish in the last 12 months. About 64% of respondents only consumed commercial fish, and an estimated 5 million fish consumers exceeded the EPA/FDA recommended limit for fish meals. Minorities were more likely to exceed the EPA/FDA recommended limit. About half of the respondents were aware of state or EPA/FDA advisories; however, minorities and women were less aware of the EPA/FDA advisory. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, sportfish consumption was significantly associated with state advisory awareness; commercial fish consumption was significantly associated with EPA/FDA awareness. Discussion: Most respondents only consumed commercial fish, but an estimated 18.6 million adults consumed sportfish. While half of the fish consumers were aware of state or EPA/FDA advisories, minorities and women continue to be less aware of fish advisories. Improved outreach strategies are needed to inform them about safe fish-consumption guidelines.

AB  - Background: Municipal solid waste landfills are sources of air pollution that may affect the health and quality of life of neighboring communities. Objectives: To investigate health and quality of life concerns of neighbors related to landfill air pollution. Methods: Landfill neighbors were enrolled and kept twice-daily diaries for 14 d about odor intensity, alteration of daily activities, mood states, and irritant and other physical symptoms between January and November 2009. Concurrently, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) air measurements were recorded every 15-min. Relationships between H(2)S, odor, and health outcomes were evaluated using conditional fixed effects regression models. Results: Twenty-three participants enrolled and completed 878 twice-daily diary entries. H(2)S measurements were recorded over a period of 80 d and 1-h average H(2)S=0.22 ppb (SD=0.27; range: 0-2.30 ppb). Landfill odor increased 0.63 points (on 5-point Likert-type scale) for every 1 ppb increase in hourly average H2S when the wind was blowing from the landfill towards the community (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.91). Odor was strongly associated with reports of alteration of daily activities (odds ratio (OR)=9.0; 95% Cl: 3.5, 23.5), negative mood states (OR=5.2; 95% CI: 2.8, 9.6), mucosal irritation (OR=3.7; 95% CI=2.0, 7.1) and upper respiratory symptoms (OR=3.9; 95% CI: 22, 7.0), but not positive mood states (OR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.5) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (OR=1.0: 95% CI: 0.4, 2.6). Conclusions: Results suggest air pollutants from a regional landfill negatively impact the health and quality of life of neighbors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Air quality has deteriorated in Hong Kong over more than 15 yr. As part of a program of public accountability, photographs on Poor and Better visibility days were used as representations of the relationships among visibility, air pollution, adverse health effects, and community costs for health care and lost productivity. Coefficients from time-series models and gazetted costs were used to estimate the health and economic impacts of different levels of pollution. In this population of 6.9 million, air quality improvement from the annual average to the lowest pollutant levels of Better visibility days, comparable to the World Health Organization air quality guidelines, would avoid 1335 deaths, 60,587 hospital bed days, and 6.7 million doctor visits for respiratory complaints each year. Direct costs and productivity losses avoided would be over US$240 million a year. The dissemination of these findings led to increased demands for pollution controls from the public and legislators, but denials of the need for urgent action arose from the government. The outcome demonstrates the need for more effective translation of the scientific evidence base into risk communication and public policy.

AB  - Ambient air pollution is among the most pressing environmental problems in our contemporary world that poses significant risks to global ecological and public health. This study analyzes cross-national heterogeneities in trajectories of death rates attributable to ambient air pollution. Compiling panel data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, the Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), and the World Development Indicators, we create a dataset that tracks 169 countries from 1991 to 2017. Using growth curve models (GCMs), we estimate countryspecific trajectories of death rates attributable to air pollution, and condition them on time-invariant and timevarying independent variables. The results suggest that while the global death rate attributable to air pollution has been continuously decreasing, there are heterogeneities in countries' death rate trajectories based on their geographic location and position in the world economy. High-income countries of the global North have perpetually witnessed lower death rates attributable to air pollution compared to middle- and low-income countries of the global South. Moreover, our results indicate that increased export to high-income countries, as a proxy for ecologically unequal exchange, leads to higher death rates from air pollution in middle- and lowincome countries.

AB  - A growing number of studies provide evidence of an association between exposure to maternal air pollution during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes including low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth. Prevention of these health effects of air pollution is critical to reducing the adverse infant outcomes, which can have impacts throughout the life course. However, there is no consensus on whether the association between air pollution exposure and birth outcomes varies by maternal risk factors including demographic characteristics and socio-economic status (SES). Such information is vital to understand potential environmental health disparities. Our search found 859 unique studies, of which 45 studies met our inclusion criteria (January 2000?July 2019). We systematically reviewed the 45 identified epidemiologic studies and summarized the results on effect modifications by maternal race/ethnicity, educational attainment, income, and area-level SES. We considered adverse birth outcomes of preterm birth, LBW, small for gestational age (SGA), and stillbirth. Suggestive evidence of higher risk of particulate matter (PM) in infants of African?American/black mothers than infants of other women was found for preterm birth and LBW. We found weak evidence that PM risk was higher for infants of mothers with lower educational attainment for preterm birth and LBW. Due to the small study numbers, we were unable to conclude whether effect modification is present for income, occupation, and area-level SES, and additional research is needed. Furthermore, adverse birth outcomes such as SGA and stillbirth need more study to understand potential environmental justice issues regarding the impact of PM exposure during pregnancy on birth outcomes.

AB  - Access to urban greenspace has many benefits such as improved health and social cohesion. If access differs by population, these benefits make access to greenspace an environmental justice issue, but little is known regarding accessibility of parks among different sub-groups in Seoul, South Korea. We explored potential socioeconomic inequities for access to parks in Seoul measuring two park provision metrics: total park area per capita (TPPC), and park accessibility index determined by size and proximity of parks. We assessed correlations between a deprivation index for the 25 Gus (administrative unit equivalent to the US borough) and each park provision metric. Regression analyses were applied for the associations between eight socioeconomic indicators of the 424 Dongs (equivalent to the US neighborhood) and each park provision metric. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in percent elderly (> 65 years) (3.2%) was significantly associated with larger TPPC (1.6 m(2)/person, 95% CI: 0.8, 2.4). Park accessibility index was associated with more socioeconomic variables than was TPPC. An IQR increase in percent elderly and divorce rates (1.2/1000 population) was associated with increased park accessibility by 3571 km (95% CI: 1103, 6040) and decreased park accessibility by 1387 (95% CI: -2706, -67), respectively. An IQR increase in percentage of the population receiving social low-income support aid (2.2%) was associated with increased park accessibility (reflecting park size and proximity of parks) of residential parks near residential areas by 1568 (95% CI: 15, 3120). Results suggest higher park access for socioeconomically disadvantaged regions. Findings indicate that measures of detailed park access considering spatial proximity and park size may more accurately measure park inequity compared to more basic metrics (e.g. TPPC), which may bias estimation of park inequity by capturing only one characteristic of parks. Detailed park measures should be considered in urban planning and health studies of greenspace.

AB  - Activists in seven US cities were interviewed about why they thought people in their communities mobilized against alcohol-related problems. The data were analyzed in light of the focus on resource mobilization theory in the social movement literature. In contrast with claims that resources are the primary catalyst for change, informants emphasized the role of grievances, and to a lesser extent, bridging factors that caused residents to be more aware of or frustrated by problems, and thus ready for change. Resources seemed to provide necessary but insufficient conditions for explaining movement participation, suggesting that, to be effective, resources must be channeled to address and be linked to the grievous social conditions of inner city communities.

AB  - Although a diversity of approaches to wildlife management persists in Canada and the United States of America, the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation (NAM) is a prevailing model for state, provincial, and federal agencies. The success of the NAM is both celebrated and refuted amongst scholars, with most arguing that a more holistic approach is needed. Colonial rhetoric permeates each of the NAM's constituent tenets-yet, beyond these cultural and historical problems are the NAM's underlying conservation values. In many ways, these values share common ground with various Indigenous worldviews. For example, the idea of safeguarding wildlife for future generations, utilizing best available knowledge to solve problems, prioritizing collaboration between nations, and democratizing the process of conserving wildlife all overlap in the many ways that the NAM and common models of Indigenous-led conservation are operationalized. Working to identify shared visions and address necessary amendments of the NAM will advance reconciliation, both in the interest of nature and society. Here, we identify the gaps and linkages between the NAM and Indigenous-led conservation efforts across Canada. We impart a revised NAM-the Indigenizing North American Model of Wildlife Conservation (I-NAM)-that interweaves various Indigenous worldviews and conservation practice from across Canada. We emphasize that the I-NAM should be a continuous learning process that seeks to update and coexist with the NAM, but not replace Indigenous-led conservation.

AB  - Agricultural biotechnology has long been criticized from an environmental justice perspective. However, an analysis, using golden rice as a case study, shows that golden rice is not susceptible to the main criticisms that are appropriate when directed at most products of agricultural biotechnology, and that golden rice has important humanitarian potential. For these reasons, an environmental justice evaluation of golden rice may need to be more nuanced and complex than a more traditional environmental ethics can provide. Study of the complexity of this issue may pay off in a more effective environmentalism on its own terms.

AB  - Attention to the urban and metropolitan growth of nature can no longer be denied. Nor can the intense scrutiny of racialized, postcolonial and indigenous perspectives on the press and pulse of uneven development across the planet's urban political ecology be deferred any longer. There is sufficient research ranging across antiracist and postcolonial perspectives to constitute a need to discuss what is referred to here as abolition ecology'. Abolition ecology represents an approach to studying urban natures more informed by antiracist, postcolonial and indigenous theory. The goal of abolition ecology is to elucidate and extrapolate the interconnected white supremacist and racialized processes that lead to uneven develop within urban environments.

AB  - Although studies have shown that air pollution can be devastating to population health, little is known about the health implications of the intersection of air pollution and income inequality. We investigate if air pollution is especially detrimental to the health of US state populations characterized by more inequitable distributions of income. In other words, are the populations of states with higher levels of income inequality especially vulnerable to similar levels of air pollution? We use two-way fixed-effects panel regression techniques to analyze longitudinal data for 49 US states and the District of Columbia (2000-2010) to model state-level life expectancy as a function of fine particulate matter, income inequality, and other state-level factors. We estimate models with interaction terms to formally assess whether the association between fine particulate matter and life expectancy varies by level of state income inequality. Across multiple life expectancy outcomes and additive models, states with higher PM2.5 levels tend to exhibit lower average life expectancy. This general pattern is observed with our specifications for raw and weighted PM2.5 and with adjustments for income share of the top 10%, total population, GDP per capita, median household income, median age, percent college degree or higher, percent black, and percent Hispanic/Latino. We also find that the association between state PM2.5 levels and average life expectancy intensifies in states with higher levels of income inequality. More specifically, PM2.5 levels are more detrimental to population life expectancy in states where a higher percentage of income is concentrated in the top 10% of the state income distribution. We discuss the implications of our results for future research in social epidemiology and environmental justice.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence indicates that environmental exposures are more prevalent among socially disadvantaged groups. We investigated the distribution of environmental exposures and health outcomes in preschool children, and examined the role of social position on their associations. Methods: We analysed data from a cross-sectional study on 968 preschool children from three districts in the Ruhr Area and one rural community in North Rhine-Westphalia in 2000. Parents filled in a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, environmental exposures, respiratory infections and allergic diseases. Residential annual total suspended particulate matter (TSP) mass concentrations were derived from a small-scale interpolation model. Lung function, allergic sensitisation and immunologic function were assessed. We analysed the associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes in social subgroups with logistic regression. Results: High TSP concentrations at the home address and unfavourable living conditions were more prevalent in the socially disadvantaged groups, while allergic and respiratory infectious diseases were reported more frequently in the privileged groups. The odds ratio for the association between TSP and history of allergic diseases was 1.17 (95% CI 0.95-1.45) in children without immigration background and 0.71 (95% CI 0.53-0.95) with immigration background. Heterogeneity for exposure-outcome associations was also seen between TSP and lung function as well as unfavourable living conditions and allergic diseases. Conclusions: We found evidence for an influence of social position on environment-health associations. Possible explanations for heterogeneity include social group-specific over- and underreporting and effect measure modification, which need to be taken into account when designing and analysing environmental health studies.

AB  - A common source of conflict at hazardous waste sites in the US Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program is the accuracy of scientific investigations and representations produced to inform cleanup decisions. Liable firms often produce these technical representations themselves, and communities surrounding sites frequently argue that such "voluntary" investigations are compromised by conflicts of interest. In order to challenge the representations of powerful firms, locally situated actors often develop trans-local connections with expertise and equipment concentrated at distant centers of calculation. Although some interpret the spatial politics of such connecting in terms of "jumping scales," another important spatial dimension of this network construction is differential positioning. In a conflict over groundwater models at the St. Regis Superfund Site in Minnesota, the counter-network that emerged to challenge the owner's representations of the site positioned some actors as "outsiders" and others as "insiders." This differential positioning enabled the counter-network to balance the need to demonstrate the reliability and impartiality of its claims with the requirement to maintain its accountability to local public interests. I argue that these requirements result from the prevalent view of the science-policy interface, which assumes a rigid separation between science and politics. Nonetheless, the conflict over groundwater at St. Regis reveals how at the science-policy interface, speaking for things and speaking for people are thoroughly entangled. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A rapid expansion in small-scale gold mining properties over the landscape since the late-2000s has generated new social and environmental pressures for both titled and untitled Amerindian communities in Guyana. Some commentators in Guyana claim that these negative impacts are 'governance problems' related to lapses in the monitoring of mining, a poor application and understanding of existing rules and rights, and delays in the Amerindian land titling process. However, using examples from two Amerindian villages in Guyana and employing extensive spatial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data, this article shows that these problems are rather rooted in deeper institutional and political biases against Amerindian notions of customary land and the ongoing privileging of mineral interests over other tenure types. The article nevertheless argues that resolving tensions between miners and Amerindian communities over land titling is being hamstrung by the perpetuation of binary framings of these claims according to which they are legitimate only when they are grounded in 'traditional' motivations. As a way of moving beyond this impasse, the article suggests recognizing the 'hybridity' of indigenous livelihoods and the legitimacy of indigenous participation in mining as necessary steps in re framing debates on indigenous communities and mining.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indigenous American communities face disproportionate health burdens and environmental health risks compared with the average North American population. These health impacts are issues of both environmental and reproductive justice. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary, we review five indigenous communities in various stages of environmental health research and discuss the intersection of environmental health and reproductive justice issues in these communities as well as the limitations of legal recourse. DISCUSSION: The health disparities impacting life expectancy and reproductive capabilities in indigenous communities are due to a combination of social, economic, and environmental factors. The system of federal environmental and Indian law is insufficient to protect indigenous communities from environmental contamination. Many communities are interested in developing appropriate research partnerships in order to discern the full impact of environmental contamination and prevent further damage. CONCLUSIONS: Continued research involving collaborative partnerships among scientific researchers, community members, and health care providers is needed to determine the impacts of this contamination and to develop approaches for remediation and policy interventions.

AB  - Background: Child poverty and social inequality in Western countries are growing both in scope and in complexity. The clustering of income poverty in urban settings reflects the complex process of residential segregation. Living in segregated neighbourhoods with much poverty and predominantly substandard housing is usually associated with poor physical, chemical and social environmental living conditions at the individual and community level which influence and shape children's health both directly and indirectly. Objective: This paper shows research data on the link between child poverty and income-related health inequalities according to the unequal exposure to environmental hazards as well as the unequal distribution of environmental resources in the domestic environment and within the local context as an increasing public health issue in Germany. The links between these factors are drawn from the conceptual framework of environmental justice. Examples are shown of integrated approaches to alleviate social and environmental disparities at the community level. Conclusion: The implications of environmental justice for public health include the need to uncover the link between socioeconomic factors and environmental health disparities related to the man-made environment. Developing relevant indicators for environmental inequalities in the context of housing and health is an important task for public health research. More emphasis should be placed on a comprehensive holistic approach to understand the mechanisms by which socioeconomic factors modify children's susceptibility and exposure to environmental hazards, particularly in low-income areas.

AB  - Almost regardless of ideological persuasion, the seemingly self-evident concept of "technological progress" inherited from early industrialism is resorted to as an article of faith serving to dispel the specter of truncated growth. The increasingly acknowledged threats of peak oil and global warming are thus generally countered with visions of a future civilization based on solar power. I discuss this technological scenario as a utopia that raises serious doubts about mainstream understandings of what "technology" really is. Technological utopianism raises difficult but fundamental analytical questions about the relation between thermodynamics and theories of economic value. While Marxism and some ecological economics share the ambition of grounding notions of economic value in physical parameters, notions of economic value and physical processes should be kept analytically distinct.

AB  - Air pollution caused by particulate matter <2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) imposes a severe health burden to people worldwide. Across the globe, and even within cities, the health burden of air pollution is not equally shared by citizens. Despite being the region suffering from the most severe air pollution, studies examining the inequity of the burdens of air pollution in Asia are limited. We aim to fill in this gap by analyzing the relationship between PM2.5 pollution and residents' socioeconomic characteristics in Beijing, the icon city for PM2.5 pollution. Our results show that household income and education were negatively correlated with ambient air quality (r = -0.62; p < 0.05 and r = -073; p < 0.01 respectively) in 2014. We found in Beijing air quality is worse where residents have less income and lower education rates and are less capable to protect themselves from the potential health risk. To counter the effects of air pollution in Beijing, aft filtration has been shown to be an effective means to reduce, at least, indoor PM2.5 levels. We illustrate through a simple scenario analysis that air filtration can reduce exposure (26-79%) to a similar extent as the structural mitigation programs (e.g. closing coal factories) achieved in recent years (53%,). We argue government intervention is needed to convey the benefit of air filtration to the socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Association rule mining (ARM) has been widely used to identify associations between various entities in many fields. Although some studies have utilized it to analyze the relationship between chemicals and human health effects, fewer have used this technique to identify and quantify associations between environmental and social stressors. Socio-demographic variables were generated based on U.S. Census tract-level income, race/ethnicity population percentage, education level, and age information from the 2010-2014, 5-Year Summary files in the American Community Survey (ACS) database, and chemical variables were generated by utilizing the 2011 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) census tract-level air pollutant exposure concentration data. Six mobile-and industrial-source pollutants were chosen for analysis, including acetaldehyde, benzene, cyanide, particulate matter components of diesel engine emissions (namely, diesel PM), toluene, and 1,3-butadiene. ARM was then applied to quantify and visualize the associations between the chemical and socio-demographic variables. Census tracts with a high percentage of racial/ethnic minorities and populations with low income tended to have higher estimated chemical exposure concentrations (fourth quartile), especially for diesel PM, 1,3-butadiene, and toluene. In contrast, census tracts with an average population age of 40-50 years, a low percentage of racial/ethnic minorities, and moderate-income levels were more likely to have lower estimated chemical exposure concentrations (first quartile). Unsupervised data mining methods can be used to evaluate potential associations between environmental inequalities and social disparities, while providing support in public health decision-making contexts.

AB  - Background: San Bernardino, California, is home to the San Bernardino Railyard (SBR), a major commerce hub with high associated air-pollution, identified as an environmental justice (EJ) issue by local community and air quality agencies. Alarmingly, one elementary school is located only a few hundred yards from SBR. Methods: The school, university researchers, and a local community-based organization (CBO) established a partnership to assess potential adverse health impacts in the children and develop interventions and mitigation plans. Results: Study results comparing target school with a demographically matched school verified community concerns finding significantly poorer respiratory health in children attending school near the railyard. Partners are working with local and state collaboratives, the school board, and funding agencies to address the resulting needs of children through education, mitigation, and prevention in an environment where necessary systems changes involving the railyard are elusive. Conclusions: This paper shares lessons learned in moving toward change when addressing an EJ community's health challenges.

AB  - A major challenge in traffic-related air pollution exposure studies is the lack of information regarding pollutant exposure characterization. Air quality modeling can provide spatially and temporally varying exposure estimates for examining relationships between traffic-related air pollutants and adverse health outcomes. A hybrid air quality modeling approach was used to estimate exposure to traffic-related air pollutants in support of the Near-Road Exposures and Effects of Urban Air Pollutants Study (NEXUS) conducted in Detroit (Michigan, USA). Model-based exposure metrics, associated with local variations of emissions and meteorology, were estimated using a combination of the American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) and Research LINE-source dispersion model for near-surface releases (RLINE) dispersion models, local emission source information from the National Emissions Inventory, detailed road network locations and traffic activity, and meteorological data from the Detroit City Airport. The regional background contribution was estimated using a combination of the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) and the Space-Time Ordinary Kriging (STOK) models. To capture the near-road pollutant gradients, refined "mini-grids" of model receptors were placed around participant homes. Exposure metrics for CO, NOx, PM2.5 and its components (elemental and organic carbon) were predicted at each home location for multiple time periods including daily and rush hours. The exposure metrics were evaluated for their ability to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of multiple ambient air pollutants compared to measurements across the study area.

AB  - After Hurricane Katrina's devastation of the United States' Gulf Coast, conversations about flooding became focused on the interconnections between so-called "natural" disasters, poverty, gender and race. Although research has long shown that women, people of color and low-income communities are more vulnerable to natural hazards, the disproportionate effects of Hurricane Katrina and subsequent federal and state disaster response efforts forced the national spotlight on the institutional and systemic nature of racism, classism and sexism. Using Black feminism and radical planning theory, two lenses that provides a comprehensive framework for understanding racism, classism and sexism, this article examines the concept and literature of social vulnerability. I argue while social vulnerability research has made significant contributions to planners' understandings of disasters and inequity, it fails to center community knowledge, identify intersectional oppressions and name them as such and encourage community activism, all of which are keys to making meaningful change.

AB  - Assessments of environmental and territorial justice are similar in that both assess whether empirical relations between the spatial arrangement of undesirable hazards (or desirable public goods and services) and sociodemographic groups are consistent with notions of social justice, evaluating the spatial distribution of benefits and burdens (outcome equity) and the process that produces observed differences (process equity). Using proximity to major highways in New York City as a case study, we review methodological issues pertinent to both fields and discuss choice and computation of exposure measures, but focus primarily on measures of inequity. We present inequity measures computed from the empirically estimated joint distribution of exposure and demographics and compare them with traditional measures such as linear regression, logistic regression, and Theil's entropy index. We find that measures computed from the full joint distribution provide more unified, transparent, and intuitive operational definitions of inequity and show how the approach can be used to structure siting and decommissioning decisions.

AB  - As traditional capture fisheries run into sustainability issues, including those brought on by climate change and overfishing, and the demand for seafood continues to increase, aquaculture operations and policymakers in the United States are looking toward the potentially lucrative frontier that is offshore aquaculture. Aquaculture operations do not currently operate in federal waters off the coast of the United States due to insurmountable permitting obstacles, including a slew of statutes to abide by and no central agency to point the way. Many policymakers agree that legislation is required to clarify the permitting structure in order to allow operations to enter the offshore arena. However, the creation of what is essentially a new food industry in the United States deserves a more in-depth analysis of the impacts the industry will have on local communities, public health, workers, and the environment. Recent proposals have not given much more than a cursory glance to these impacts. In particular, offshore aquaculture should look to the industry from which Americans currently receive a large amount of their protein: large-scale animal agriculture, or 'factory farming." Factory farming contributes to a myriad of problems, including human health issues associated with eating meat, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and exposure to pathogens and antibiotic resistance; animal welfare issues, including physical and psychological distress; worker safety issues, which have been exacerbated by COVID-19; environmental issues, including pollution and the industry's contribution to climate change; and environmental justice issues around the disproportional effects of air and water pollution on rural communities. This Note focuses on environmental issues around water pollution, antibiotic use, the externalization of costs, federal subsidization, and the lobbying power of large companies. The failure of factory farming in these areas serves as a giant warning to offshore aquaculture, an industry vulnerable to many of the same problems. A new offshore aquaculture industry must consider its place in the overall U.S. food system. It must learn from the things that have failed in that system, and it must implement solutions based on research. Only then can offshore aquaculture be not only a profitable but also a truly sustainable part of the domestic food supply.

AB  - Air pollution contributes to the global burden of disease, with ambient exposure to fine particulate matter of diameters smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) being identified as the fifth-ranking risk factor for mortality globally(1). Racial/ethnic minorities and lower-income groups in the USA are at a higher risk of death from exposure to PM2.5 than are other population/income groups(2-5). Moreover, disparities in exposure to air pollution among population and income groups are known to exist(6-17). Here we develop a data platform that links demographic data (from the US Census Bureau and American Community Survey) and PM2.5 data(18) across the USA. We analyse the data at the tabulation area level of US zip codes (N is approximately 32,000) between 2000 and 2016. We show that areas with higher-than-average white and Native American populations have been consistently exposed to average PM2.5 levels that are lower than areas with higher-than-average Black, Asian and Hispanic or Latino populations. Moreover, areas with low-income populations have been consistently exposed to higher average PM2.5 levels than areas with high-income groups for the years 2004-2016. Furthermore, disparities in exposure relative to safety standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency(19) and the World Health Organization(20) have been increasing over time. Our findings suggest that more-targeted PM2.5 reductions are necessary to provide all people with a similar degree of protection from environmental hazards. Our study is observational and cannot provide insight into the drivers of the identified disparities.

AB  - Background The petrochemical industry is a major source of hazardous and toxic air pollutants that are recognised to have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. A wealth of occupational epidemiology literature exists around the petrochemical industry, with adverse haematological effects identified in employees exposed to 'low' concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). Releases from the petrochemical industry are also thought to increase the risk of cancer incidence in fenceline communities. However, this emerging and at times inconclusive evidence base remains fragmented. The present study's aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies investigating the association between incidences of haematological malignancy and residential exposure to the petrochemical industry. Methods Epidemiological studies reporting the risk of haematological malignancies (Leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Multiple myeloma) were included where the following criteria were met: (i) Cancer incidence is diagnosed by a medical professional and coded in accordance to the International Classification of Diseases; (ii) A clear definition of fenceline communities is provided, indicating the proximity between exposed residents and petrochemical activities; and (iii) Exposure is representative of normal operating conditions, not emergency events. Two investigators independently extracted information on study characteristics and outcomes in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals were pooled across studies for the four categories of haematological malignancy, using a random effects meta-analysis. Results The systematic review identified 16 unique studies, which collectively record the incidence of haematological malignancies across 187,585 residents living close to a petrochemical operation. Residents from fenceline communities, less than 5 km from a petrochemical facility (refinery or manufacturer of commercial chemicals), had a 30% higher risk of developing Leukaemia than residents from communities with no petrochemical activity. Meanwhile, the association between exposure and rarer forms of haematological malignancy remains uncertain, with further research required. Conclusions The risk of developing Leukaemia appears higher in individuals living near a petrochemical facility. This highlights the need for further policy to regulate the release of carcinogens by industry.

AB  - Background: Pollutants released from the petrochemical industry are thought to increase the risk of mortality in fence-line communities, yet the results from previous studies are often inconsistent and lack a global perspective, hampered by the absence of cohesive cross-country research. Objectives: To provide the first Pan-European analysis of benzene exposures from the petrochemical industry, connecting polluting practices to pollution episodes and disparities in regional mortality rates, identifying the measures of best environmental practice to mitigate adverse outcomes. Methods: The activity, classification and location of onshore petrochemical facilities within EU-28 Member States were extracted from the 'European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register' (E-PRTR), which holds records on 31,753 industrial operations for the reporting period of 2007-15. Parent company records were collected from the Moody's Analytics Amadeus database of 487,338 active companies across Europe. The EUROSTAT census provided records of income, life expectancy, and the underlying demographics used to calculate standardised health outcomes based on 9,936 sub-populations within the NUTS2 regions. The European Environment Agency provided ambient concentrations of benzene from 579 air quality stations. Bayesian multilevel models were constructed to account for variability caused by spatial hierarchical structures, uncertainty in the estimates, and to incorporate both individual and group-level influences. Results: Higher levels of benzene emissions from petrochemical operations, both overall and in terms of specific pollution events, were associated with increased mortality rates for nearby residential populations, particularly in areas with socioeconomic deprivation. We identify uneven patterns of polluting practices within the industry, and locations that require epidemiological studies. Conclusions: While petrochemical facilities in all European Union regions are regulated to be compliant with the annual average benzene limit of 5 mu g/m(3), uneven exposures still present regional health inequalities. We recommend extending benzene regulations to an hourly or daily limit, alongside the strengthening of regulation for other toxic petrochemical releases.

AB  - A growing body of research highlights the decisive role that justice claims play in creating sustainable payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs. Employing Sikor et al.'s approach to the study of justice claims in ecosystem governance along three dimensions-distribution, procedure and recognition-we study the negotiation process behind China's flagship interprovincial PES agreement: the Xin'anjiang River eco-compensation agreement between Huangshan (Anhui province) and Hangzhou (Zhejiang province) prefectures. We find that divergent claims between stakeholders on matters of distributive and procedural justice undercut one party's commitment to the agreement. Local officials in the upstream locality (Huangshan) see themselves as having been disadvantaged in both procedural and distributive aspects of negotiation. They claim to have been insufficiently included in a bargaining process that involved not only the downstream locality (Hangzhou) but also the central government. Huangshan stakeholders also see themselves as largely excluded from the benefits of cleaner water and bearing too much of the pollution abatement cost. For their part, Hangzhou stakeholders have advanced a 'polluters pay' view of distributive justice and found partial support for this claim from Beijing. Our findings suggest that attending to environmental justice considerations should be given top priority in China's design of PES schemes.

AB  - A public participatory geographical information systems (PPGIS) demographic, environmental, socioeconomic, health status portal was developed for the Stambaugh-Elwood (SE) community in Columbus, OH. We hypothesized that soil at SE residences would have metal concentrations above natural background levels. Three aims were developed that allowed testing of this hypothesis. Aim 1 focused on establishing partnerships between academia, state agencies and communities to assist in the development of a community voice. Aim 2 was to design and conduct soil sampling for residents of the SE community. Aim 3 was to utilize our interactive, customized portal as a risk communication tool by allowing residents to educate themselves as to the potential risks from industrial sources in close proximity to their community. Multiple comparisons of means were used to determine differences in soil element concentration by sampling location at p < 0.05. The results demonstrated that eight metals (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Mo, Se, Tl, Zn) occurred at statistically-significantly greater levels than natural background levels, but most were below risk-based residential soil screening levels. Results were conveyed to residents via an educational, risk-communication informational card. This study demonstrates that community-led coalitions in collaboration with academic teams and state agencies can effectively address environmental concerns.

AB  - At hazardous waste sites, volatile chemicals can migrate through groundwater and soil into buildings, a process known as vapor intrusion. Due to increasing recognition of vapor intrusion as a potential indoor air pollution source, in 2015 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a new vapor intrusion guidance document. The guidance specifies two conditions for demonstrating that remediation is needed: (1) proof of a vapor intrusion pathway; and (2) evidence that human health risks exceed established thresholds (for example, one excess cancer among 10,000 exposed people). However, the guidance lacks details on methods for demonstrating these conditions. We review current evidence suggesting that monitoring and modeling approaches commonly employed at vapor intrusion sites do not adequately characterize long-term exposure and in many cases may underestimate risks. On the basis of this evidence, we recommend specific approaches to monitoring and modeling to account for these uncertainties. We propose a value of information approach to integrate the lines of evidence at a site and determine if more information is needed before deciding whether the two conditions specified in the vapor intrusion guidance are satisfied. To facilitate data collection and decision-making, we recommend a multi-directional community engagement strategy and consideration of environment justice concerns.

AB  - Background: Modern oil development frequently occurs in close proximity to human populations. Los Angeles, California is home to the largest urban oil field in the country with thousands of active oil and gas wells in very close proximity to homes, schools and parks, yet few studies have investigated potential health impacts. The neighborhoods along the Las Cienagas oil fields are situated in South LA, densely populated by predominantly low-income Black and Latinx families, many of whom are primarily Spanish-speakers. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted between January 2017 and August 2019 among residents living <1000 m from two oil wells (one active, one idle) in the Las Cienagas oil field. We collected self-reported acute health symptoms and measured FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation) and FVC (forced vital capacity). We related lung function measures to distance and direction from an oil and gas development site using generalized linear models adjusted for covariates. Results: A total of 961 residents from two neighborhoods participated, the majority of whom identify as Latinx. Participants near active oil development reported significantly higher prevalence of wheezing, eye and nose irritation, sore throat and dizziness in the past 2 weeks. Among 747 valid spirometry tests, we observe that living near (less than 200 m) of oil operations was associated with, on average, -112 mL lower FEV1 (95% CI: -213, -10) and -128 mL lower FVC (95% CI: -252, -5) compared to residents living more than 200 m from the sites after adjustments for covariates, including age, sex, height, proximity to freeway, asthma status and smoking status. When accounting for predominant wind direction and proximity, we observe that residents living downwind and less than 200 m from oil operations have, on average, -414 mL lower FEV1 (95% CI: -636, -191) and -400 mL lower FVC (95% CI: -652, -147) compared to residents living upwind and more than 200 m from the wells. Conclusions: Living nearby and downwind of urban oil and gas development sites is associated with lower lung function among residents, which may contribute to environmental health disparities.

AB  - Air pollution in Southern California does not impact all communities equally; communities of color are disproportionately burdened by poor air quality and more likely to live near industrial facilities and freeways. Government regulatory monitors do not have the spatial resolution to provide air quality information at the neighborhood or personal scale. We describe the A Day in the Life program, an approach to participatory air monitoring that engages youth in collecting data that they can then analyze and use to take action. Academics partnered with Los Angeles-based youth environmental justice organizations to combine personal air monitoring, participatory science, and digital storytelling to build capacity to address local air quality issues. Eighteen youth participants from four different neighborhoods wore portable personal PM2.5 (fine particles <2.5 mu m in diameter) monitors for a day in each of their respective communities, documenting and mapping their exposure to PM2.5 during their daily routine. Air monitoring was coupled with photography and videos to document what they experienced over the course of their day. The PM2.5 exposure during the day for participants averaged 10.7 mu g/m(3), although the range stretched from <1 to 180 mu g/m(3). One-third of all measurements were taken <300 m from a freeway. Overall, we demonstrate a method to increase local youth-centered understanding of personal exposures, pollution sources, and vulnerability to air quality.

AB  - Advocates for civil rights, environmental justice, and movements promoting social justice require data and may lack trust in public authorities, turning instead to academic scientists to help address their questions. Assessing historical exposure to toxic chemicals, especially in situations of a specific industrial source of pollution affecting a community, is critical for informing appropriate public health and policy responses. We describe a community-driven approach to integrate retrospective environmental hazard exposure assessment with community organizing to address concerns about the extent of exposure to toxic metals in a predominantly working-class, Latinx community living near a now-closed lead-acid battery smelter facility. Named the "Truth Fairy Project" by leaders of the community organization East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, this community-university partnership aimed to assess prenatal and early-life exposures to toxic metals through biomarkers of exposure in baby/deciduous teeth. This partnership integrated community mobilization with empirical research, informing residents about toxic metal exposures and improving the community's capacity to respond to a public health crisis.

AB  - 2020 has been a year of cascading crises for us all. The COVID-19 pandemic threatened to eclipse the longer term crisis of global climate change. Australia's Black Summer of unprecedented bushfires in 2019-20 and Vanuatu's experience of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April 2020 were both signs of the increasing severity of 'natural' disasters due to anthropogenic climate change. Combining personal and political reflections on these two disasters, this essay analyses how the discourse of 'resilience' can deflect blame from the ultimate causes of climate change in increased greenhouse gas emissions and from those countries and corporations who are primarily responsible for the climate crisis. In both Australia and Vanuatu, it interrogates where resilience is located: in government and corporate systems of disaster preparedness and infrastructure and/or the communities and people who are suffering disasters of increasing severity and frequency. Per capita, Australia is one of the most polluting countries in the world and its current retrograde policies on climate change and energy perpetuate both climate crisis and injustice, whereby those in the Pacific who contribute the least to climate change suffer the most. Global inequalities are both cause and consequence of climate change. Fighting climate change must entail fighting against inequalities to achieve climate justice.

AB  - Air pollution regulation requires knowing major sources on any given zone, setting specific controls, and assessing how health risks evolve in response to those controls. Receptor models (RM) can identify major sources: transport, industry, residential, etc. However, RM results are typically available for short term periods, and there is a paucity of RM results for developing countries. We propose to combine a cluster analysis (CA) of air pollution and meteorological measurements with a short-term RM analysis to estimate a long-term, hourly source apportionment of ambient PM2.5 and PM10. We have developed a proof of the concept for this proposed methodology in three case studies: a large metropolitan zone, a city with dominant residential wood burning (RWB) emissions, and a city in the middle of a desert region. We have found it feasible to identify the major sources in the CA results and obtain hourly time series of their contributions, effectively extending short-term RM results to the whole ambient monitoring period. This methodology adds value to existing ambient data. The hourly time series results would allow researchers to apportion health benefits associated with specific air pollution regulations, estimate source-specific trends, improve emission inventories, and conduct environmental justice studies, among several potential applications.

AB  - Although the environmentally harmful effects of widespread dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) use became well-known following Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962), its human health effects have more recently become clearer. A ban on the use of DDT has been in place for over 30 years, but recently DDT has been used for malaria control in areas such as Africa. Recent work shows that DDT has transgenerational effects in progeny and generations never directly exposed to DDT. These effects have health implications for individuals who are not able to have any voice in the decision to use the pesticide. The transgenerational effects of DDT are considered in light of some widely accepted ethical principles. We argue that this reframes the decision to use DDT, requiring us to incorporate new considerations, and new kinds of decision making, into the deliberative process that determines its ongoing use. Ethical considerations for intergenerational environmental justice are presented that include concern and respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, and justice. Here, we offer a characterization of the kinds of ethical considerations that must be taken into account in any satisfactory decisions to use DDT.

AB  - Background: Parks are important settings for physical activity (PA), but few studies have documented the actual behaviors of park users. The purpose of this study was to examine the individual and joint effects of various park user demographic characteristics on observed PA intensity levels. Methods: Four parks were observed using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities. Observers recorded the age group, gender, race, and intensity level of all park users in 83 activity areas over two weekends at each park. Logistic regression examined whether male/White, female/White, and male/non-White users were more likely than female/non-White users to be observed engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) rather than sedentary activity across 4 age groups. Results: In total, 8612 users were observed during the study. In the child age group, male/White users were significantly more likely to be observed in MVPA than female/non-White users. For teens, female/White and male/White users were less likely to engage in MVPA. For both adults and seniors, female/White and male/White users were more likely to be observed in MVPA. Conclusion: Observations revealed significant differences in intensity levels across gender, age, and race groups. Future interventions should emphasize park design that promotes increased MVPA among diverse groups.

AB  - African households are often models of sustainability, practicing daily behaviours, which, if even not directly associated by the individual with Western conceptualisations of 'recycling' or 'reuse', have dramatically positive impacts on the amounts of household waste generated. However, rarely has the African household been given the same consideration, and there is a poor understanding within the discipline how poor individuals, and Africans in particular, understand and conceptualise 'waste' as both a problem and a resource. Drawing on Kennedy and Appadurai's theoretical perspectives, the purpose of this article is to critically examine and contextualise household solid waste reuse practices in Chembe, Malawi, a rapidly densifying village and a constituent part of one of the nation's premier resort destinations. Drawing on extensive ethnographic fieldwork with residents and stakeholders, findings suggest that, within Chembe, reuse practices, and the motivations that drive them, are both widespread and diverse, with a multitude of 'waste' items living multiple 'lives' before being ultimately discarded as 'trash'. These behaviours are facilitated by the fact that many desirable waste items are widely available locally within Chembe, and although some of these reuse practices may be widespread within Malawi, others have been uniquely fostered by Chembe's position as an affluent tourism destination with abundant and easily accessible waste streams. This investigation is particularly important within the context of rural Africa, and the Global South more broadly. Moreover, it should critically inform circular economy, zero waste, and broader waste management studies discourse, where African households have been habitually treated as problems needing solutions, rather than potential sources of innovation and learning.

AB  - Background: People from low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by the global burden of adverse health effects caused by ambient air pollution (AAP). However, data from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are still scarce. We systematically reviewed the literature to describe the existing knowledge on AAP and health outcomes in SSA. Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline-OVID, EMBASE and Scopus databases to identify studies of AAP and health outcomes published up to November 15, 2017. We used a systematic review approach to critically analyze and summarize levels of outdoor air pollutants, and data on health effects associated with AAP. We excluded occupational and indoor exposure studies. Results: We identified 60 articles, with 37 only describing levels of AAP and 23 assessing the association between air pollution and health outcomes. Most studies (75%) addressing the relation between AAP and disease were cross-sectional. In general, exposure data were only obtained for selected cities in the framework of temporary international collaborative research initiatives without structural long-term continuation. Measurements of AAP revealed 10-20 fold higher levels than WHO standards. Of the 23 studies reporting health effects, 14 originated from South Africa, and most countries within SSA contributed no data at all. No studies, except from South Africa, were based on reliable morbidity or mortality statistics at regional or country level. The majority of studies investigated self-reported respiratory symptoms. Children and the elderly were found to be more susceptible to AAP. Conclusion: AAP and its negative health effects have been understudied in SSA compared with other continents. The limited direct measurements of air pollutants indicate that AAP in SAA cities is high compared with international standards. Efforts are needed to monitor AAP in African cities, to identify its main sources, and to reduce adverse health effects by enforcing legislation.

AB  - Background: Over the last two decades, various spatial techniques have been demonstrated using geographical information systems (GIS) to adequately estimate and characterize inequities of minority populations living near environmentally hazardous facilities. However, these methods have produced mixed results. In this study, we use recently developed variations of the "distance based" approach to spatially evaluate and compare demographic and socioeconomic disparities surrounding the worst hazardous waste sites in Florida. Methods: We used data from the 2000 US Census Bureau and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to identify selected socio and economic variables within one (1) mile of 71 National Priorities List (NPL) or Superfund sites in Florida. ArcMap (ESRI, v. 9.2) was used to map the centroid locations of each of the NPL sites as well as identify and estimate the number of host and non-host tracts. The unit of analysis in this study was at the census tract level. Logistic regression (SAS v9.1.3) was used to determine if race/ethnicity and socioeconomic indicators are significant predictors of the location of NPL sites. Results: There were significant differences in race/ethnicity composition and socio-economic factors between NPL host census tracts and non-host census tracts in Florida. The percentages of Blacks (OR = 5.7, p < 0.001), the percentage of Hispanic/Latino (OR = 5.84, p < 0.001), and percent employed in blue collar occupations (OR = 2.7, p < 0.01) were significant predictors of location of NPL facilities. Conclusion: The recently developed distance-based method supports previous studies and suggests that race and ethnicity play substantial roles in where hazardous facilities are located in Florida. Recommendations include using distance-based methods to evaluate socio and demographic characteristics surrounding other less known environmental hazardous facilities, such as landfills, or Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites.

AB  - Background: Asthma symptoms, severity, and mortality are known to be affected by personal, family, and neighborhood social factors. Many groups have become involved in asthma research, education, and activism in the past 20 years. This study explores the approaches to asthma taken by community-based organizations compared with those taken by other organizations that. have a focus on asthma. Methods: Priorities in asthma research and intervention were assessed through interviews with representatives of urban community-based participatory research (CBPR) coalitions; interviews with staff from charities focused on asthma, allergy, or lung diseases; interviews with physicians and scientists studying and treating asthma; participation in community forums; and participant observation Of urban asthma coalitions. Interviews and data analysis were conducted in 2008. Results: There are marked differences in priorities and approaches to asthma among experts in the field, organizations and coalitions at the national and local levels, and other stakeholders in asthma research and activism. CBPR coalitions are more likely than asthma-focused organizations to explore environmental and community-level structural factors that exacerbate asthma or complicate its management, while disease-focused organizations, especially physician specialty groups, place more emphasis on individual-level factors. CBPR coalitions have been particularly strong in producing the data needed to demonstrate that individual communities are affected by pollution hot spot,, or that local neighborhoods lack geographic access to affordable medical care, and in providing this data to improve local policy-making. Conclusions: Because of its focus on structural rather than individual factors, CBPR has helped to broaden the debate on asthma beyond clinical care and education into social and environmental justice.

AB  - African policy makers have ignored indigenous environmental ethics. The relation between responsible use of the planet's resources and ethics remains apparent in many cultural and social systems of traditional Africa. The local people have developed detailed interactive knowledge of the natural environment, and preserved biodiversity resources, which they have nurtured and developed since time immemorial. African environmental ethics is based on the worldviews of the African people, and can contribute to biodiversity conservation and environmental rehabilitation and protection. It can enlighten policy makers by providing a theoretical foundation for sustainable living. Furthermore, African environmental ethics can expose environmental injustice committed by different groups in Africa, and assist local communities to secure environmental justice and protect their environment. It can create awareness within countries and globally about the actions of transnational corporations, irresponsible countries, and local industries which damage the environment. African environmental ethics may also alert the African people to understand the long-range effects of environmental degradation that are beyond the purview of local people and understanding of which is otherwise unavailable. Modern environmental knowledge about global environmental problems will provide peasant farmers and pastoralists an opportunity to look at their own local concerns and issues within the context of a greater global perspective. Only by involving peasant farmers, pastoralists, and indigenous people at the grass-roots level will African policy makers have the political strength and will to implement serious changes needed to address serious environmental and developmental problems. If policy makers continue to neglect the major contributors to biodiversity conservation and environmentally friendly practices, environmental policies will not have significant impacts on development and environmental protection in Africa.

AB  - Although social work is optimally positioned to respond to the human implications of environmental change and stress, the profession largely lacks a presence in environmental practice, research and policy making. Given the accelerating need for creative, effective and justice-oriented responses to the human dimensions of global environmental challenges, this lack of involvement is increasingly untenable. In response, this paper assesses the current status of environmentally focused social work theory, research and practice. It concludes that crafting a vibrant and meaningful environmental presence will require efforts at multiple levels, from developing a creative, multi-faceted and well-specified menu of practice theories, models and interventions, supported by research and practice evidence, to an enhanced focus on environmental practice within social work education. It will also require both novel interdisciplinary partnerships and deep-rooted collaborations with local communities, where larger environmental threats and inequities come to ground in everyday lived experience.

AB  - Background Household air pollution from biomass cookstoves is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality, yet little is known about exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Objective To characterize NO(2)kitchen area concentrations and personal exposures among women with biomass cookstoves in the Peruvian Andes. Methods We measured kitchen area NO(2)concentrations at high-temporal resolution in 100 homes in the Peruvian Andes. We assessed personal exposure to NO(2)in a subsample of 22 women using passive samplers. Results Among 97 participants, the geometric mean (GM) highest hourly average NO(2)concentration was 723 ppb (geometric standard deviation (GSD) 2.6) and the GM 24-hour average concentration was 96 ppb (GSD 2.6), 4.4 and 2.9 times greater than WHO indoor hourly (163 ppb) and annual (33 ppb) guidelines, respectively. Compared to the direct-reading instruments, we found similar kitchen area concentrations with 48-hour passive sampler measurements (GM 108 ppb, GSD 3.8). Twenty-seven percent of women had 48-hour mean personal exposures above WHO annual guidelines (GM 18 ppb, GSD 2.3). In univariate analyses, we found that roof, wall, and floor type, as well as higher SES, was associated with lower 24-hour kitchen area NO(2)concentrations. Practical Implications Kitchen area concentrations and personal exposures to NO(2)from biomass cookstoves in the Peruvian Andes far exceed WHO guidelines. More research is warranted to understand the role of this understudied household air pollutant on morbidity and mortality and to inform cleaner-cooking interventions for public health.

AB  - After decades of fighting for clean air and green space in the face of environmental racism and urban disinvestment, Chicago's Latinx Little Village neighbourhood has begun to see environmental improvements take place. Activists are wary of the potential for gentrification in the wake of clean up, and are advocating for the right to stay put in the community they have worked so hard to improve. These ongoing contestations have recently intersected with accelerating racialized state violence as renewed anti-immigrant and white supremacist rhetoric, policies, and actions have targeted Latinx communities. In this paper we ask, how do struggles against environmental racism, gentrification, and xenophobia interlock, and how does the framework of environmental justice serve to enable activism across all three sites? For racialized minority communities, repeated experiences of forced migration and displacement often mean that an anti-displacement ethos is particularly well-articulated and grounded in collective historical memory. Drawing on an extensive analysis of media materials complemented by archival research, fieldwork, and interviews with community organisers, this paper argues that tight linkages between environmental justice and anti-displacement principles inform community responses to multiple forms of structural racialized violence.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the major risk factors contributing to adverse public health outcomes worldwide. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been repeatedly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks. Because PM2.5 is unequally distributed with elevated concentrations near high-traffic and industrial zones, PM2.5 is an environmental justice issue of major public health concern. In this study, we reviewed the relationship between PM2.5, emergency visits due to heart attacks, and environmental justice in San Diego County using data from CalEnviroScreen 3.0. Our results indicate that PM2.5, diesel PM emissions, and emergency visits due to heart attacks are weakly, but positively correlated (r = 0.3, R-2 < 0.1). Areas classified as environmental justice communities, communities comprised more dominantly of nonwhite populations, and communities closer to the San Diego-Tijuana border are exposed disproportionately to air pollution in San Diego County. Overall, this work demonstrates that there is an association between elevated local PM concentrations in San Diego County communities with emergency hospital visits due to heart attacks, and that these associations are an environmental justice issue disproportionally affecting disadvantaged communities. Implications: Particulate matter is an adverse contributor to overall health throughout the lifespan, contributing to diseases such as asthma, hypertension, stroke, and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Here, we assess the relationship between particulate matter and heart attacks in San Diego County using CalEnviroScreen3.0. Using these tools, we also examine correlations between this relationship and different sociodemographic indicators such as age, race, income, and proximity to the high-traffic U.S.-Mexico border. Overall, we show that specific communities around San Diego are more highly exposed to particulate matter, and that these relationships may be disproportionately contributing to heart attacks in disadvantaged communities.

AB  - All through the twentieth century transportation planning and the implementation of transportation facilities in the developing world was heavily weighted toward motorized transportation (MT), despite the fact that non-motorized transportation (NMT) constitutes a significant proportion of all trips. However, in the last two decades many researchers and practitioners all across the world have recognized the importance and advantages of NMT, and their investigations and findings have contributed toward identifying, if not mitigating, some of the more glaring problems in these countries. Unfortunately, most of these investigations have been performed in a piece-meal and disjointed fashion. This paper explores the complex and sometimes poorly understood set of relationships between transportation and its links to a myriad of other factors, such as landuse, sustainability, safety, energy, ethical issues, value of time, telecommunication, environmental justice, and equity. The main objective of this paper is to provide a systemic overview of NMT by describing its multi-dimensional aspects and to assist developing countries in formulating an "Agenda for Action".

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventive approaches to childhood lead poisoning are critical for addressing this longstanding environmental health concern. Moreover, increasing evidence of cognitive effects of blood lead levels < 10 mu g/dL highlights the need for improved exposure prevention interventions. OBJECTIVES: Geographic information system-based childhood lead exposure risk models, especially if executed at highly resolved spatial scales, can help identify children most at risk of lead exposure, as well as prioritize and direct housing and health-protective intervention programs. However developing highly resolved spatial data requires labor- and time-intensive geocoding and analytical processes. In this study we evaluated the benefit of increased effort spent geocoding in terms of improved performance of lead exposure risk models. METHODS: We constructed three childhood lead exposure risk models based on established methods but using different levels of geocoded data from blood lead surveillance, county tax assessors, and the 2000 U.S. Census for 18 counties in North Carolina. We used the results to predict lead exposure risk levels mapped at the individual tax parcel unit. RESULTS: The models performed well enough to identify high-risk areas for targeted intervention, even with a relatively low level of effort on geocoding. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of widespread replication of highly spatially resolved childhood lead exposure risk models. The models guide resource-constrained local health and housing departments and community-based organizations on how best to expend their efforts in preventing and mitigating lead exposure risk in their communities.

AB  - Assessing levels of equity inherent in the distributions of the public open spaces that they manage is an important responsibility of park and recreation agencies. Multivariate regression offers one way of conducting such assessments. However, traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques fail to explore important local variations in relationships among variables. This study explored the utility of geographically weighted regression (GWR) in an equity analysis of public beaches in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. The GWR models exhibited substantial improvements in model performance over the OLS models. GWR offers public leisure agencies a powerful technique through which to better understand local patterns of access and equity, ultimately leading to the formulation of more effective and efficient recreation planning and management policies.

AB  - After decades of preparation, the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel has reached the construction stage in Finland, and the neighboring Sweden is likely to soon follow in the footsteps. These Nordic countries rely on a similar technical concept based on passive safety, advocated as a means of minimizing the burden to future generations. The scholarly literature on the ethics of nuclear waste management has thus far paid little attention to the views of the broader publics on the associated ethical challenges. This article helps to fill the gap through a longitudinal and comparative analysis of ethical discussion of the final disposal of SNF in news articles and letters to the editor in four leading Finnish and Swedish daily newspapers in 2008-2015. The study period included major milestones in the licensing processes of the respective two repository projects. The article examines the attention paid to intra- and intergenerational distributive and procedural justice, the changes in the ethical agenda over time, and the societal actor groups that receive attention in the media. The analysis reveals two distinct ethical media agendas: (1) the news article agenda that is dominated by framings of the main players (industry, politicians, authorities, and experts) and largely excludes future generations from the scope of justice, and (2) the agenda represented by the letters to the editor, which focuses on intergenerational justice concerns. Particularly, in the Finnish letters to the editor the value of the lives of distant future generations was discounted implicitly.

AB  - Air pollution is a vexing problem for emerging countries that strike a delicate balance between environmental protection, health, and energy for growth. We examine these difficulties in a study of disparate levels of exposure to pollution from coal-fired power generation in India, a country with high levels of air pollution and large, marginalized populations. With data on coal plant locations, atmospheric conditions, and census demographics, we estimate exposure to coal plant emissions using models that predict emission transportation. We find that ethnic and poor populations are more likely to be exposed to coal pollution. However, this relationship is sometimes non-linear and follows an inverted u-shape similar to that of an Environmental Kuznets Curve. We theorize that this non-linear relationship is due to the exclusion of marginalized communities from both the negative and positive externalities of industrial development.

AB  - Acknowledging urban sprawl as one of the major threats to the functioning of urban environments, the article focuses on its possible association with urban green spaces (UGS). UGS can act as an attracting factor influencing housing demand in cities. However, the spatial distribution of UGS may affect sprawling dynamics. Therefore, the analysis focuses on finding linkages between urban sprawl and green space availability within three concentric zones of the city of Lodz. Hotspot analysis has been used as a method to describe sprawling dynamics in relation to UGS availability. UGS availability was defined as a percentage of the area of parks and forests in a 1000 m buffer. The results showed that the highest UGS availability in the peripheral zone of the city was linked to an increase in the number of residents between 2000 and 2015. The peripheral zone was also characterized by stronger clustering of hotspots of residential density. Starting from the peripheral zone, UGS availability was 6.01%, 3.45% and 2.86% of the area of each respective zone. ANOVA analysis confirmed that the average availability of UGS for newly registered residential buildings differs statistically between the rings at the 0.05 level. While most urban residents still live within the central (yet continuously depopulating) zone, it is characterized by the smallest UGS availability (2.86% covered by UGS), which might raise concerns regarding the occurrence of possible environmental injustice in terms of uneven access to benefits provided by UGS. Hotspot analysis can provide valuable input into the discussion regarding the application of specific spatially targeted measures, for the sake of sustainable urban planning.

AB  - A significant body of research suggests that environmental risks are more likely to be found in minority and low-income communities. Few studies have questioned whether communities of lower socioeconomic status may be less protected by regulatory agencies through the use of fines in instances of noncompliance. Using the Environmental Inequality Formation perspective (EIF) and data drawn from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) administrative enforcement cases within the U.S. Pacific Northwest from 2007 to 2011, this project finds that the factors primarily influencing fine severity include the type and severity of the offense. However, after controlling for other factors, fines are less severe against facilities surrounded by low-income households. This research confirms the need for scholars, policy makers, and activists to develop greater linkages between the EIF perspective and environmental sentencing by more clearly teasing out the roles that facilities, enforcement agencies, and especially communities play in these outcomes.

AB  - According to Deehon Ferris, a member of the EPA's Environmental Justice Advisory Panel,"The failure to recognize the inextricable link between the legacy of poverty and racism leads to [the] development of mono-dimensional solutions" (BNA National Environment Daily, May 5, 1995). Ferris's statement is indicative of how the dialogue in environmental justice is one of framing issues in the context of an existing debate: race versus class. Building on an earlier empirical study, this article reframes the "race versus class" debate in the context of methodological considerations. By including two different indicators of toxic hazards, I demonstrate that some research designs may not properly assess environmental injustice tin this case environmental racism). I conclude that the "race versus class" debate must be elaborated in light of the appropriateness of different toxic indicators.

AB  - A growing number of scientific studies in recent years have investigated disparate exposure to ecological hazards in American society. Working from an environmental justice perspective, this body of research consistently reveals that poor communities of color are most likely to bear a disproportionate burden of negative externalities. These studies utilize a wide range of research methodologies, including various indicators of ecological hazards (e.g., proximity to waste sites, industrial emissions, ambient air quality), but few, if any, utilize composite measures to approximate cumulative environmental impact. Consequently, the environmental justice (EJ) literature is characterized by a failure to effectively measure overall impact from an extensive range of ecological hazards. Limitations on available data make this a serious problem for present and future studies. We argue that cumulative measures of environmental impact can play an important role in furthering our understanding of environmental injustices in the United States. In this study of Massachusetts, we develop and implement such a cumulative measure of negative environmental impacts. By controlling for the density and severity of ecological hazardous sites and facilities within every community in the state, we demonstrate that exposure patterns take a generally linear distribution when analyzed by race and class. So, while our results reaffirm previous findings that low-income communities and communities of color bear significantly greater ecological burdens than predominantly White and more affluent communities, our findings also suggest that environmental injustices exist on a remarkably consistent continuum for nearly all communities. In other words, as the minority population and lower-income composition of a community increases, correspondingly, so does cumulative exposure to environmental hazards. In this respect, communities which are more racially mixed and of moderate income status that are not typically identified as meeting EJ criteria (in demographic terms) also face more significant ecological hazards. Thus, the strict bifurcation of communities into categories of Enviromnental Justice and Non-Environmental Justice is problematic, and poses a serious dilemma for policy makers, public health officials, and community activists. To overcome this challenge requires the adoption of a cumulative environmental justice impact assessment (CERA), which in addition to the demographic characteristics of a community, also takes into account the total environmental burden and related health impacts upon residents. Furthermore, through the adoption of the precautionary principle, source reduction, and alternative forms of "cleaner" production, environmental justice advocates must work for policies which reduce the environmental threat for the full range of communities, as well as their own.

AB  - Background: Scant data quantify associations between economic and racial/ethnic spatial polarization and individual's exposure to pollution. Methods: We linked data on the socioeconomic position (SEP) of 1757 urban working class white, black, and Latino adults (age 25-64; Boston, MA: 2003-2004; 2008-2010) to: (1) spatiotemporal model-based estimates of cumulative black carbon exposure at their exact residential address, and (2) their census tract values for the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) for SEP and race/ethnicity. Results: ICE measures, but not individual- and household-SEP, remained independently associated with black carbon exposure. Conclusions: The ICE may be useful for environmental health research.

AB  - Assuring equal accessibility to public outdoor and recreation services is important because of the potential health and social welfare implications. The focus has primarily been on parks and other green spaces but should be expanded to include also the aquatic environments and the numerous recreational opportunities they have to offer. As the accessibility standards and approaches on ensuring equal accessibility to green spaces are often based on purely spatial measurements, this research examined the equality of accessibility of aquatic environments by combining spatio-temporal dimensions of accessibility with person-based measures. Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) method used in the study provided multifaceted knowledge on the person-based accessibility patterns related to aquatic environments in Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. This paper demonstrates how an advanced GIS-based analysis combining both objective and subjective measurements of accessibility can result in more detailed and even contradictory outcomes compared to traditional spatial measures. The results indicate that a common presumption of a nearest service available made in studies on accessibility and environmental justice may have notable impacts on results or even return unfounded interpretations. Results also indicate that there are significant (p < 0.05) differences in accessibility in the study region related to income status and car ownership. We conclude that PPGIS approaches can provide valuable information to accessibility research, studies on environmental justice and provide additional approaches for the planning and management officials of public recreation and outdoor services.

AB  - Background Air pollution was responsible for an estimated 6.7 million deaths globally in 2019 and 197,000 deaths in the United States. Fossil fuel combustion is the major source. Hypothesis Mapping air pollution's health impacts at the community level using publicly available data and open-source software will provide a replicable strategy for catalyzing pollution prevention. Methods Using EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis (BenMAP-CE) software and state data, we quantified the effects of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution on disease, death and children's cognitive function (IQ Loss) in each city and town in Massachusetts. To develop a first-order estimate of PM2.5 pollution's impact on child IQ, we derived a concentration-response coefficient through literature review. Findings The annual mean PM2.5 concentration in Massachusetts in 2019 was 6.3 mu g/M-3, a level below EPA's standard of 12 mu g/M-3 and above WHO's guideline of 5 mu g/M-3. In adults, PM2.5 pollution was responsible for an estimated 2780 (Confidence Interval [CI] 2726 - 2853) deaths: 1677 (CI, 1346 - 1926) from cardiovascular disease, 2185 (CI, 941-3409) from lung cancer, 200 (CI, 66-316) from stroke, and 343 (CI, 222-458) from chronic respiratory disease. In children, PM2.5 pollution was responsible for 308 (CI, 105-471) low-weight births, 15,386 (CJ, 5433-23,483) asthma cases, and a provisionally estimated loss of nearly 2 million Performance IQ points; IQ loss impairs children's school performance, reduces graduation rates and decreases lifetime earnings. Air-pollution-related disease, death and IQ loss were most severe in low-income, minority communities, but occurred in every city and town in Massachusetts regardless of location, demographics or median family income. Conclusion Disease, death and IQ loss occur at air pollution exposure levels below current EPA standards. Prevention of disease and premature death and preservation of children's cognitive function will require that EPA air quality standards be tightened. Enduring prevention will require government-incentivized transition to renewable energy coupled with phase-outs of subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels. Highly localized information on air pollution's impacts on health and on children's cognitive function has potential to catalyze pollution prevention.

AB  - Although the chemical enterprise has provided numerous contributions to humanity, unintended consequences contribute to a disproportionate exposure of hazardous chemicals to certain populations based on race and socioeconomic status. Integrating concepts of social and environmental justice within chemistry curriculum provides an educational framework to help mitigate these impacts by training the next generation of chemists with justice-centered and green chemistry principles to guide their future work. Green and sustainable chemistry technologies can contribute to social equity and environmental justice. However, equity and social justice have only recently become a significant part of the green chemistry conversation. This article summarizes how the authors have explored issues of equity and environmental justice with the green and sustainable chemistry community. It offers a toolbox for college and university instructors containing foundational language, research, and idea-generation that can be used to strengthen the transition of a traditional chemistry curriculum toward a justice-centered one.

AB  - Although lead has been removed from paint and gasoline sold in the U.S., lead exposures persist, with communities of color and residents in urban and low-income areas at greatest risk for exposure. The persistence of and inequities in lead exposures raise questions about the scope and implementation of policies that address lead as a public health concern. To understand the multi-level nature of lead policies, this paper and case study reviews lead policies at the national level, for the state of California, and for Santa Ana, CA, a dense urban city in Southern California. Through a community-academic partnership process, this analysis examines lead exposure pathways represented, the level of intervention (e.g., prevention, remediation), and whether policies address health inequities. Results indicate that most national and state policies focus on establishing hazardous lead exposure levels in settings and consumer products, disclosing lead hazards, and remediating lead paint. Several policies focus on mitigating exposures rather than primary prevention. The persistence of lead exposures indicates the need to identify sustainable solutions to prevent lead exposures in the first place. We close with recommendations to reduce lead exposures across the life course, consider multiple lead exposure pathways, and reduce and eliminate health inequities related to lead.

AB  - Although many recent studies have emphasized the multiplicity of institutional logics and the competition among them, how some institutional logics become prioritized over others in shaping organizational decisions is undertheorized. Drawing on panel data of 118 industrial facilities across 34 communities in Texas and Louisiana, we show that the saliency of different kinds of community logics significantly affects environmental practices-specifically, toxic waste emissionsof facilities in a community. Our results show that community logics not only have direct effects but also have indirect effects by filtering organizational reactions to broader field-level institutional logics. We theorize how community logics can amplify or dampen the influence of broader field-level logics and discuss the implications for the study of institutional complexity, social movements, and values in the configuration of institutional logics.

AB  - Active transportation modes are increasingly being acknowledged for their individual and societal benefits. As a result, funding for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure in the United States has increased substantially in recent years. However, pedestrian and bicycle equity impacts often go overlooked, which has resulted in an inequitable distribution of active transportation costs and benefits. The paper contributes to this small but growing field by developing an enhanced understanding of active transportation equity, identifying limitations in research and in practice, and providing a set of recommendations for planners and researchers. These recommendations include considering other transportation-disadvantaged groups beyond low-income and minority populations in equity analysis, adopting new performance measures, increasing inter-agency coordination, the need for stronger guidance from the federal government, and more representation from transportation-disadvantaged groups in the public participation and decision-making process. If the costs and benefits of active transportation are to be fairly shared among all users, equity will need to be meaningfully addressed in the planning process.

AB  - Although post-apartheid South Africa has witnessed constraints on press freedom by the ruling party, there is limited understanding of how media discourse is contested and constructed by diverse social actors. This article is interested in the extent to which various social actors in the Durban network society, such as civil society, corporations and the state, shape public information and perception in their own interests regarding environmental discourse. Empirical evidence presents viewpoints from key social actors and a local case study. The article compares the urban regional and case study analyses, and highlights the complex relationship between various social actors and the numerous avenues used to shape public information and perception. While corporations causing pollution mainly serve as barriers to civil society using the media effectively to highlight environmental injustices (e.g. through corporate media sponsorships, media intimidation), this is further complicated by limitations within civil society and media outlets to influence media discourse (e.g. limited financial/human resources, individualized leadership, media remuneration issues). Alongside these limitations, and the power of government and corporations, the influence of media discourse and perceptions regarding industrial risks are also dependent upon successful horizontal and vertical networking between civil society actors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In deciding among competing approaches for emissions control, debates often hinge on the potential tradeoffs between efficiency and equity. However, previous health benefits analyses have not formally addressed both dimensions. OBJECTIVES: We modeled the public health benefits and the change in the spatial inequality of health risk for a number of hypothetical control scenarios for power plants in the United States to determine optimal control strategies. METHODS: We simulated various ways by which emission reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter (particulate matter < 2.5 mu m in diameter; PM2.5) could be distributed to reach national emissions caps. We applied a source-receptor matrix to determine the PM2.5 concentration changes associated with each control scenario and estimated the mortality reductions. We estimated changes in the spatial inequality of health risk using the Atkinson index and other indicators, following previously derived axioms for measuring health risk inequality. RESULTS: In our baseline model, benefits ranged from 17,000-21,000 fewer premature deaths per year across control scenarios. Scenarios with greater health benefits also tended to have greater reductions in the spatial inequality of health risk, as many sources with high health benefits per unit emissions Of SO2 were in areas with high background PM2.5 concentrations. Sensitivity analyses indicated that conclusions were generally robust to the choice of indicator and other model specifications. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates an approach for formally quantifying both the magnitude and spatial distribution of health benefits of pollution control strategies, allowing for joint consideration of efficiency and equity.

AB  - Against the background of growing aviation and protests against air traffic in many countries, we employ a factorial survey experiment to examine the social acceptance of airport expansion scenarios in two European cities located near the international airports of Frankfurt (Germany) and Zurich (Switzerland), respectively. In our experiment, respondents evaluated short descriptions of airport expansion scenarios that varied in several impact attributes. The experiment helps to disentangle to what extent environmental impacts (aircraft noise), economic impacts (job creation), participatory justice aspects (participation opportunities), and distributive justice aspects (noise distribution) affect social acceptance. The experimental results show that environmental and participatory justice aspects are much more influential than economic and distributive justice impacts. Higher expected exposure to aircraft noise and less opportunities of citizen participation in an aircraft expansion project lead to increased levels of expressed unfairness of the expansion, to a greater willingness to sign a petition, to participate in a demonstration, and to vote against the expansion. Combining survey data and data on actual noise exposure, we find that those with very low and very high actual exposure levels, respectively, express the lowest social acceptance. Further analyses reveal that age, environmental concern, own use of air travel, and perceived fairness of the local aircraft noise distribution explain heterogeneity in social acceptance.

AB  - Background Hurricane Harvey facilitated exposure to various toxic substances and floodwater throughout the greater Houston metropolitan area. Although disparities exist in this exposure and vulnerable populations can bear a disproportionate impact, no research has integrated disparities in exposure to toxic incidents following Hurricane Harvey. Objective The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between flooding, socioeconomic status (SES), and toxic site incidents. Methods Data on toxic site locations, reported releases, and flood water depths during Hurricane Harvey in the greater Houston area were compiled from multiple sources. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to predict the odds of a toxic site release by flooding at the site, SES and racial composition of the census tract. Results 83 out of 1403 toxic sites (5.9%) had reported releases during Hurricane Harvey. The proportion of toxic sites with reported incidents across increasing SES index quintiles were 8.35, 7.67, 5.14, 4.55, and 0.51, respectively. The odds of an incident were lower in the highest SES quintile areas (ORadj = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42) compared to the lowest SES quintile. Flooding was similar at toxic sites with and without incidents, and was distributed similarly and highest at toxic sites located in lower SES quintiles. Significance Despite similar flooding across toxic sites during Hurricane Harvey, areas with lower SES were more likely to have a toxic release during the storm, after accounting for number of toxic sites. Improving quality of maintenance, safety protocols, number of storm-resilient facilities may minimize this disproportionate exposure and its subsequent adverse outcomes among socioeconomically vulnerable populations.

AB  - Background: In 2000, the United Nations (UN) introduced the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), described as a global movement with the primary aim of ending world-wide poverty ("Millennium Summit," 2000). The second phase of the project, known as the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda offers an increased emphasis on lessening the mitigating factors associated with climate change and adapting to the negative effects of climate change. Nurses are in the unique position to address the health-related impacts related to climate change through community health approaches aimed at education and promotion of environmental stewardship. Purpose: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the relationships among the health consequences of climate change, nursing literature on climate change, and nursing implications. The following will be addressed: "What is nursing's role in policy, practice, and advocacy when addressing the effects of climate change? What is the importance of the SDGs as a framework for addressing climate change in the role of nursing?" Method: This scoping review of the literature was conducted which included the evaluation of a broad range of articles using scoping methods as frameworks. Findings: An overarching theme regarding the nursing community's responsibility in addressing the effects of climate change and their role as advocates, educators, and global citizens was extracted from the scoping review. Discussion: There are many opportunities for nurses to become actively involved in efforts aimed at mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts in climate change, including becoming involved in policy, advocacy, research, and practice opportunities.

AB  - A panel of subject matter experts systematically reviewed evidence linking neighborhood-level housing interventions, such as housing programs or policies, to health outcomes. One of the 10 interventions reviewed-the Housing Choice Voucher Program-had sufficient evidence for implementation or expansion. The evidence showed that voucher holders are less likely to suffer from overcrowding, malnutrition due to food insecurity, and concentrated neighborhood poverty than nonvoucher holders. Of the other reviewed interventions, 2 needed more field evaluation and 7 needed more formative research. None were determined to be ineffective. Although many of the reviewed interventions lacked sufficient evidence for widespread implementation solely based on their health benefits, this evidence review shows that many interventions positively affect other areas of social, economic, and environmental well-being. Efforts to improve neighborhood environments and to maintain and increase the number of affordable housing units are critical to ensuring safe, healthy, and affordable housing for all people in the United States. Given that people of color disproportionately reside in high-poverty neighborhoods, neighborhood-level interventions may be particularly important in efforts to eliminate health disparities.

AB  - Air toxics are of particular concern in Greater Houston, home to one of the world's largest petrochemical complexes and a quarter of the nation's refining capacity. Much of this complex lies along a navigable ship channel that flows 50 miles from east of the central business district through Galveston Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico. Numerous communities, including both poor and affluent neighborhoods, are located in close proximity to the 200 facilities along this channel. Our aim is to examine the spatial distribution of cumulative, air-pollution related cancer risks in Houston and Harris County,with particular emphasis on identifying ethnic, economic, and social disparities. We employ exposure estimates from NATA-1999 and census data to assess whether the cumulative cancer risks from air toxics in Houston (and Harris County) fall disproportionately on certain ethnicities and on the socially and economically disadvantaged. The cancer risk burden across Harris County census tracts increases with the proportion of residents who are Hispanic and with key indicators of relative social disadvantage. Aggregate disadvantage grows at each higher level of cancer risk. The highest cancer risk in Harris County is concentrated along a corridor flanking the ship channel. These high-risk neighborhoods, however, vary markedly in relative disadvantage, as well as in emission source mix. Much of the risk they face appears to be driven by only a few hazardous air pollutants. Results provide evidence of risk disparities from hazardous air pollution based on ethnicity and social disadvantage. At the highest levels of risk the pattern is more complex, arguing for a neighborhood level of analysis, especially when proximity to high-emissions industries is a substantial contributor to cumulative cancer risk.

AB  - Although the scientific basis of EPA's new ozone and particulate matter standards has been debated, the relative measure of protection these standards might afford various population sectors in pollutant-impacted areas has received little attention. To address this issue, anticipated changes in the distribution of air pollution impacts, associated with imposition of proposed standards, are examined. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are analyzed by comparing impacts in nonattainment areas with those in attainment areas; city nonattainment areas with non-city, nonattainment areas; and urban nonattainment areas with rural nonattainment areas. Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, African-Americans, and economically advantaged are overrepresented in nonattainment areas under current and proposed standards. Under the proposed standards, this disparity would be moderated because additional nonattainment areas with different population characteristics would be included. The most striking examples of disporportionate representation of Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans, and low-income populations occur and would continue to occur in large-city nonattainment areas.

AB  - Authoritarian environmentalism (AE) has become an important source of social injustice in China. Taking clues from the theory of just transition and a case study of forestry reform in Northeast China, this article discusses the tension between environmental protection and social justice in Chinese AE. From a procedural perspective, the belief in insulated eco-elites being best placed to make environmental decisions, and the emphasis on policy expediency, are manifested in the top-down imposition of a sweeping ban on logging of natural forests. However, this non-participatory approach prevents critical and nuanced viewpoints on local impacts to be recognized and addressed. From a distributional perspective, while AE does not inherently contradict the norm of distributive justice, the forestry reform has negatively affected the undercompensated and under-supported laid off workers, created new energy poverty issues, undermined local public services, and disproportionately affected smaller, remote communities, some of whom have been outright abandoned. The findings highlight the need for scholars to engage with social justice issues in AE by championing the importance of a just transition process, experimenting with public engagement in the context of authoritarianism, and generating policy knowledge that facilitates the transformation toward sustainability.

AB  - Advances in research concerning the mental health implications of dietary patterns and select nutrients have been remarkable. At the same time, there have been rapid increases in the understanding of the ways in which non-pathogenic microbes can potentially influence many aspects of human health, including those in the mental realm. Discussions of nutrition and microbiota are often overlapping. A separate, yet equally connected, avenue of research is that related to natural (for example, green space) and built environments, and in particular, how they are connected to human cognition and behaviors. It is argued here that in Western industrial nations a 'disparity of microbiota' might be expected among the socioeconomically disadvantaged, those whom face more profound environmental forces. Many of the environmental forces pushing against the vulnerable are at the neighborhood level. Matching the developing microbiome research with existing environmental justice research suggests that grey space may promote dysbiosis by default. In addition, the influence of Westernized lifestyle patterns, and the marketing forces that drive unhealthy behaviors in deprived communities, might allow dysbiosis to be the norm rather than the exception in those already at high risk of depression, subthreshold (subsyndromal) conditions, and subpar mental health. If microbiota are indeed at the intersection of nutrition, environmental health, and lifestyle medicine (as these avenues pertain to mental health), then perhaps the rapidly evolving gut-brain-microbiota conversation needs to operate through a wider lens. In contrast to the more narrowly defined psychobiotic, the term eco-psychotropic is introduced.

AB  - Asthma is an ongoing environmental justice concern in Roxbury, an urban neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. Residents, especially local youth, were the first to investigate the potential links between high asthma rates and air pollution, particularly from diesel buses and trucks. A youth-led march for clean air and community air monitoring projects drew governmental and media attention to these problems. In 1998, a collaboration of environmental justice, government, and research groups came together to develop a real-time air pollution monitoring system known as AirBeat. This community-based participatory research project was designed to answer community questions about whether there are pollution "hot spots" in Roxbury and the degree to which diesel emissions are contributing to health problems. AirBeat measures and reports levels Of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to2.5 mum), ozone, and black carbon on an hourly basis. These data are accessible via a website, telephone hotline, and a flag warning system. AirBeat is successful because community residents and organizations participate as equal partners with an equitable share of funding. The project also promotes a community sense of ownership and pride. Dozens of youth have developed leadership and scientific skills, The media have extensively covered the project as a community victory. The data support the claim that Dudley Square in Roxbury is a hot spot for air pollution. This information is now being used to advocate for alternative fuel transit buses and other clean air measures. Finally, this project has strengthened community partnerships with research and governmental institutions.

AB  - A series of recent studies has introduced the concept of "environmental ascription" (Legot et al. 2010a; Lucier et al. 2011; Rosofsky et al. 2013; Scharber et al. 2013). It is well known that children from marginalized racial and economic communities face diminished life chances, partly due to a lack of adequate educational opportunity. It is also well documented in the environmental injustice literature (see below) that these same communities carry a disproportionate burden of industrial pollution. Environmental ascription makes a connection between these two findings to argue that, along with race, class, and gender, place should be considered an additional and overlapping ascriptive force in the sense that it exerts a limiting effect on children's future life chances by harming their health and, in turn, hindering their school performance. The first study in this series (Legot et al. 2010a) was a simple, descriptive documentation of the problem of environmental ascription. Subsequent studies sought to specify the consequences of environmental ascription, including studies of the relationship between race and class, proximity to toxics, and (a) selected childhood illnesses (Legot et al. 2011) and (b) school performance scores (Lucier et al. 2011; Rosofsky et al. 2013; Scharber et al. 2013). Like much of the earlier sociological research on environmental injustice (cf. Bullard et al. (2007), these studies have focused in the United States (USA) overall as well as specific cities within the USA. This chapter will first provide an overview of the quantitative research on environmental injustice in the USA, as well as the existing research on the effects of toxic chemicals on child development (specifically as it relates to academic achievement). Then, the chapter will summarize existing research that connects evidence of environmental injustice with evidence of the effects of toxic pollution on school performance, which provides evidence for the existence of an environmental dimension of ascription.

AB  - Background The City of Dresden has no data on the perception of climate change and the associated increase in the average temperature during summer times yet. The data are needed to develop targeted action for vulnerable groups. Method To close this gap, a representative survey of the population was carried out in Dresden in 2017. Two urban districts, which differ from one another both in terms of urban planning and social structure, were compared, in particular, regarding the question of whether there was a fair distribution or procedural justice concerning the effects of subjective heat burden and influencing factors. Results The results showed that especially inhabitants of the urban area with predominantly prefabricated buildings, less green space and an increased proportion of socially disadvantaged felt more exposed to the summer heat and had fewer opportunities to adapt to the high temperature. Conclusion In addition to urban development measures, the results can be used to derive measures for the prevention of heat-related illnesses. These require, for example, increased advice and health education locally to reach people.

AB  - Background: Seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the northern hemisphere are well described in the literature. More recently age and gender differences in cardiac mortality and to a lesser extent morbidity have been presented. To date spatial differences between the seasonal patterns of cardiac disease has not been presented. Literature relating to seasonal patterns in cardiac disease in the southern hemisphere and in Australia in particular is scarce. The aim of this paper is to describe the seasonal, age, gender, and spatial patterns of cardiac disease in Melbourne Australia by using acute myocardial infarction admissions to hospital as a marker of cardiac disease. Results: There were 33,165 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) admissions over 2186 consecutive days. There is a seasonal pattern in AMI admissions with increased rates during the colder months. The peak month is July. The admissions rate is greater for males than for females, although this difference decreases with advancing age. The maximal AMI season for males extends from April to November. The difference between months of peak and minimum admissions was 33.7%. Increased female AMI admissions occur from May to November, with a variation between peak and minimum of 23.1%. Maps of seasonal AMI admissions demonstrate spatial differences. Analysis using Global and Local Moran's I showed increased spatial clustering during the warmer months. The Bivariate Moran's I statistic indicated a weaker relationship between AMI and age during the warmer months. Conclusion: There are two distinct seasons with increased admissions during the colder part of the year. Males present a stronger seasonal pattern than females. There are spatial differences in AMI admissions throughout the year that cannot be explained by the age structure of the population. The seasonal difference in AMI admissions warrants further investigation. This includes detailing the prevalence of cardiac disease in the community and examining issues of social and environmental justice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the United States, most of the treated sewage sludge (biosolids) is applied to farmland as a soil amendment. Critics suggest that rules regulating sewage sludge treatment and land application may be insufficient to protect public health and the environment. Neighbors of land application sites report illness following land application events. OBJECTIVES: We used qualitative research methods to evaluate health and quality of life near land application sites. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with neighbors of land application sites and used qualitative analytic software and team-based methods to analyze interview transcripts and identify themes. RESULTS: Thirty-four people in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia responded to interviews. Key themes were health impacts, environmental impacts, and environmental justice. Over half of the respondents attributed physical symptoms to application events. Most noted offensive sludge odors that interfere with daily activities and opportunities to socialize with family and friends. Several questioned the fairness of disposing of urban waste in rural neighborhoods. Although a few respondents were satisfied with the responsiveness of public officials regarding sludge, many reported a lack of public notification about land application in their neighborhoods, as well as difficulty reporting concerns to public officials and influencing decisions about how the practice is conducted where they live. CONCLUSIONS: Community members are key witnesses of land application events and their potential impacts on health, quality of life, and the environment. Meaningful involvement of community members in decision making about land application of sewage sludge will strengthen environmental health protections.

AB  - Assessing exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across disadvantaged communities is understudied, and the air monitoring network is inadequate. We leveraged emerging low-cost sensors (PurpleAir) and engaged community residents to develop a community-based monitoring program across disadvantaged communities (high proportions of low-income and minority populations) in Southern California. We recruited 22 households from 8 communities to measure residential outdoor PM2.5 concentrations from June 2021 to December 2021. We identified the spatial and temporal patterns of PM2.5 measurements as well as the relationship between the total PM2.5 measurements and diesel PM emissions. We found that communities with a higher percentage of Hispanic and African American population and higher rates of unemployment, poverty, and housing burden were exposed to higher PM2.5 concentrations. The average PM2.5 concentrations in winter (25.8 mu g/m(3)) were much higher compared with the summer concentrations (12.4 mu g/m(3)). We also identified valuable hour-of-day and day-of-week patterns among disadvantaged communities. Our results suggest that the built environment can be targeted to reduce the exposure disparity. Integrating low-cost sensors into a citizen-science-based air monitoring program has promising applications to resolve monitoring disparity and capture "hotspots" to inform emission control and urban planning policies, thus improving exposure assessment and promoting environmental justice.

AB  - A growing body of research shows that natural gas leaks at the distribution level are much more common and extensive than previously thought. Although scholars and advocates have raised alarms about the climate change and economic significance of these leaks, there has been little consideration of the problem from an environmental justice perspective. Using recently available high resolution leak data, this analysis of natural gas leaks across the state of Massachusetts shows that People of Color, limited English speaking households, renters, lower income residents, and adults with lower levels of education are disproportionately exposed to natural gas leaks and that their leaks take longer to repair, as compared to the general population, and particularly as compared to White residents and to homeowners. This pattern is evident for all leaks in the state, for leaks disaggregated by leak class or grade, and for leaks disaggregated by utility. This analysis shows that natural gas leaks are an environmental justice issue warranting further study and policy attention.

The mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage provisions of the Paris Agreement are not convincing. Adaptation offers only a modest response to climate change, compared with mitigation, and current financial commitments to fund adaptation in developing countries are far too low. Consequently, the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have a long way to go in their negotiations before they have any hope of meeting their agreed temperature goals, and protecting human and non-human Capabilities from climate disasters.

AB  - A remaining challenge for environmental inequality researchers is to translate the principles developed in the U.S. to China which is experiencing the staggering environmental impacts of its astounding economic growth and social changes. This study builds on U.S. contemporary environmental justice literature and examines the issue of environmental inequality in China through an analysis of the geographical distribution of industrial pollution sources in Henan province. This study attempts to answer two central questions: 1) whether environmental inequality exists in China and if it does, 2) what socioeconomic lenses can be used to identify environmental inequality. The study found that: 1) race and income the two common lenses used in many U.S. studies play different roles in the Chinese context; 2) rural residents and especially rural migrants are disproportionately exposed to industrial pollution.

AB  - A senior American specialist on China and noted geographer argues that the preoccupation of China geographers' with empirical analyses of that country's dramatic economic, social, and urban transformation over the last two decades-usually explained in terms of the now familiar quadruple forces of globalization, marketization, deregulation, and decentralization-should be broadened to reflect a concern for the problems of disadvantaged groups impacted negatively in dynamic urban and environmental settings. The methodology of reflexive activism is proposed as affording a framework for a more relevant geography focused on the study of China, with the potential to bring about positive and constructive change on behalf of China's disadvantaged population and its natural environment, and (as a possible side benefit) generate local epistemologies enriching the study of geography more broadly.

AB  - Air pollution is mostly caused by emissions from human activities, and exposure to air pollution is linked with numerous adverse human health outcomes. Recent studies have identified that although people only spend a small proportion of time on their daily commutes, the commuter microenvironment is a significant contributor to their total daily air pollution exposure. Schoolchildren are a particularly vulnerable cohort of the population, and their exposure to air pollution at home or school has been documented in a number of case studies. A few studies have identified that schoolchildren's exposure during commutes is linked with adverse cognitive outcomes and severe wheeze in asthmatic children. However, the determinants of total exposure, such as route choice and commute mode, and their subsequent health impacts on schoolchildren are still not well-understood. The aim of this paper is to review and synthesize recent studies on assessing schoolchildren's exposure to various air pollutants during the daily commute. Through reviewing 31 relevant studies published between 2004 and 2020, we tried to identify consistent patterns, trends, and underlying causal factors in the results. These studies were carried out across 10 commute modes and 12 different air pollutants. Air pollution in cities is highly heterogeneous in time and space, and commuting schoolchildren move through the urban area in complex ways. Measurements from fixed monitoring stations (FMSs), personal monitoring, and air quality modeling are the three most common approaches to determining exposure to ambient air pollutant concentrations. The time-activity diary (TAD), GPS tracker, online route collection app, and GIS-based route simulation are four widely used methods to determine schoolchildren's daily commuting routes. We found that route choices exerted a determining impact on schoolchildren's exposure. It is challenging to rank commute modes in order of exposure, as each scenario has numerous uncontrollable determinants, and there are notable research gaps. We suggest that future studies should concentrate on examining exposure patterns of schoolchildren in developing countries, exposure in the subway and trains, investigating the reliability of current simulation methods, exploring the environmental justice issue, and identifying the health impacts during commuting. It is recommended that three promising tools of smartphones, data fusion, and GIS should be widely used to overcome the challenges encountered in scaling up commuter exposure studies to population scales.

AB  - Although numerous studies have been conducted on the vulnerability of marginalized groups in the environmental justice (EJ) and hazards fields, analysts have tended to lump people together in broad racial/ethnic categories without regard for substantial within-group heterogeneity. This paper addresses that limitation by examining whether Hispanic immigrants are disproportionately exposed to risks from flood hazards relative to other racial/ethnic groups (including US-born Hispanics), adjusting for relevant covariates. Survey data were collected for 1283 adult householders in the Houston and Miami Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and flood risk was estimated using their residential presence/absence within federally-designated 100-year flood zones. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with binary logistic specifications that adjust for county-level clustering were used to analyze (separately) and compare the Houston (N = 546) and Miami (N = 560) MSAs in order to clarify determinants of household exposure to flood risk. GEE results in Houston indicate that Hispanic immigrants have the greatest likelihood, and non-Hispanic Whites the least likelihood, of residing in a 100-year flood zone. Miami GEE results contrastingly reveal that non-Hispanic Whites have a significantly greater likelihood of residing in a flood zone when compared to Hispanic immigrants. These divergent results suggest that human-flood hazard relationships have been structured differently between the two MSAs, possibly due to the contrasting role that water-based amenities have played in urbanization within the two study areas. Future EJ research and practice should differentiate between Hispanic subgroups based on nativity status and attend to contextual factors influencing environmental risk disparities.

AB  - Adapting methods from the income distribution literature, we use a normatively significant metric to rank emissions distributions from alternative policies in a manner consistent with an explicit well-behaved preference structure. The approach allows one to determine which policy has the most desirable outcome for a given demographic group as well as which groups benefit most from a given policy. Applying these methods to Southern California's NOx pollution-trading program and a counterfactual command-and-control policy suggests that in this case trading benefited all demographic groups and generated a more equitable overall distribution of emissions, even after considering the lower aggregate emissions. We find that Blacks experienced the largest gains from RECLAIM relative to the counterfactual, while Hispanics benefited least.

AB  - Although the United States Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) theoretically ensures drinking water quality, recent studies have questioned the reliability and equity associated with community water system (CWS) service. This study aimed to identify SDWA violation differences (i.e., monitoring and reporting (MR) and health-based (HB)) between Virginia CWSs given associated service demographics, rurality, and system characteristics. A novel geospatial methodology delineated CWS service areas at the zip code scale to connect 2000 US Census demographics with 2006-2016 SDWA violations, with significant associations determined via negative binomial regression. The proportion of Black Americans within a service area was positively associated with the likelihood of HB violations. This effort supports the need for further investigation of racial and socioeconomic disparities in access to safe drinking water within the United States in particular and offers a geospatial strategy to explore demographics in other settings where data on infrastructure extents are limited. Further interdisciplinary efforts at multiple scales are necessary to identify the entwined causes for differential risks in adverse drinking water quality exposures and would be substantially strengthened by the mapping of official CWS service boundaries.

AB  - Access to safe, clean water and sanitation is globally recognized as essential for public health. Public toilets should be accessible to all members of a society, without social or physical barriers preventing usage. A public toilet facility's design and upkeep should offer privacy and safety, ensure cleanliness, provide required sanitation-related resources, and be gender equitable, including enabling comfortable and safe management of menstruation. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) refers to the need to ensure that girls, women and all people who menstruate have access to clean menstrual products, privacy to change the materials as often as needed, soap and water for washing the body as required, and access to facilities to dispose of used materials. Challenges around menstruation faced by people experiencing homelessness, which tend to be greater than those facing the general population, include inadequate toilet and bathing facilities, affordability issues around menstrual products, and menstrual stigma. Public toilets are a vital resource for managing menstruation, particularly for vulnerable populations without reliable access to private, safe, and clean spaces and menstrual products. This mixed-methods study sought to: 1) understand the lived experiences of MHM among people experiencing homelessness in New York City with respect to public toilets; 2) describe general and MHM-related characteristics of public toilets in high need areas of Manhattan and analyze their interrelationships; and 3) examine the associations among neighborhood-level demographics and the public toilet characteristics in those areas. Qualitative methods included key informant interviews (n = 15) and in-depth interviews (n = 22) with people with experience living on the street or in shelters, which were analyzed using Malterud's 'systematic text condensation' for thematic cross-case analysis. Quantitative methods included audits and analyses of public toilet facilities (n = 25) using traditional statistics (e.g., Spearman's correlations) and spatial analyses (e.g., proximity buffers). Qualitative findings suggest cleanliness, access to restrooms, and availability of resources are critical issues for the participants or prospective users. Quantitative analyses revealed insufficiently provided, maintained, and resourced public toilets for managing menstruation in high-needs areas. Findings also suggest that toilets with more MHM-related resource availability, such as menstrual products and toilet stall disposal bins, were more difficult to access. Neighborhood-level characteristics showed a potential environmental injustice, as areas characterized by higher socioeconomic status are associated with more access to MHM-specific resources in public restrooms, as well as better overall quality.

AB  - Background: Proximity to parks and physical activity sites has been linked to an increase in active behaviors, and positive impacts on health outcomes such as lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Since populations with a low socio-economic status as well as racial and ethnic minorities tend to experience worse health outcomes in the USA, access to parks and physical activity sites may be an environmental justice issue. Geographic Information systems were used to conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of park accessibility in New York City, which included kernel density estimation, ordinary least squares (global) regression, geographically weighted (local) regression, and longitudinal case studies, consisting of field work and archival research. Accessibility was measured by both density of park acreage and density of physical activity sites. Independent variables included percent non-Hispanic black, percent Hispanic, percent below poverty, percent of adults without high school diploma, percent with limited English-speaking ability, and population density. Results: The ordinary least squares linear regression found weak relationships in both the park acreage density and the physical activity site density models (R-a(2) = .11 and .23, respectively; AIC = 7162 and 3529, respectively). Geographically weighted regression, however, suggested spatial non-stationarity in both models, indicating disparities in accessibility that vary over space with respect to magnitude and directionality of the relationships (AIC = 2014 and -1241, respectively). The qualitative analysis supported the findings of the local regression, confirming that although there is a geographically inequitable distribution of park space and physical activity sites, it is not globally predicted by race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status. Conclusion: The combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated the complexity of the issues around racial and ethnic disparities in park access. They revealed trends that may not have been otherwise detectable, such as the spatially inconsistent relationship between physical activity site density and sociodemographics. In order to establish a more stable global model, a number of additional factors, variables, and methods might be used to quantify park accessibility, such as network analysis of proximity, perception of accessibility and usability, and additional park quality characteristics. Accurate measurement of park accessibility can therefore be important in showing the links between opportunities for active behavior and beneficial health outcomes.

AB  - Australia does not have 'carbon democracy', but a 'carbon oligarchy,' in which the State defends the established and self-destructive relations of order, wealth and power built around fossil fuel energy. The article sketches interaction with carbon oligarchy in three NSW country towns of Lismore, Narrabri, and Bega, in relation to renewable energy. The aim is to uncover some problems of energy transition, and to suggest possible courses of action. In one town, a Local Council program to become self-supporting on renewables ran into problems of regulation and neoliberal economic values. In the second, transition was constrained by local fossil fuel supplies. In the third, some people embraced a form of 'climate generosity' which enabled support for transition against the requirements of carbon oligarchy. Climate generosity could usefully supplement Climate Justice, by circumventing demands for fairness and by providing an exemplar of action to help build community, support and meaning.

AB  - Adverse health effects due to waste management practices, and in particular of hazardous waste, potentially represent a public health issue in many less-developed regions and developing countries, because of growing waste production, inadequate waste management practices, lack of appropriate legislation and control systems, as well as of growing illegal hazardous waste transboundary movements driven by the most industrialized countries. According to the Report of the WHO Workshop held in Rome in 2007 " ... the scientific literature on the health effects of landfills provides some indication of the association between residing near a landfill site and adverse health effects. The evidence, somewhat stronger for reproductive outcomes than for cancer, is not sufficient to establish the causality of the association. However a public health response is warranted". Moreover, there is evidence and the global awareness of growing transboundary movements of hazardous waste from the most industrialized countries to less developed regions and developing countries. Export and import of hazardous wastes, as well as their regional final destination within a country, are driven by economic, political, environmental and technological factors such as differences in prices for treatments and disposal, different taxation levels for wastes, insufficient waste treatment capacity and technology, among several others. In this paper we aim to emphasize the need for developing international scientific cooperation activities in this field in the near future with the perspective to create an appropriate framework to promote studies, transfer of knowledge and technology as well as to widespread awareness on health risks from hazardous waste disposals.

AB  - Affordable access to safe drinking water is essential to community health, yet there is limited understanding of water insecurity among Native Americans. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to describe Apsaalooke (Crow Indian) tribal members' experiences with water insecurity. For Apsaalooke people, local rivers and springs are still vitally important for traditional cultural activities. We interviewed 30 Native American adults living on the Crow Reservation in Southeastern Montana. Participants answered six open-ended interview questions about their water access, costs of obtaining water and changes in their domestic and traditional water uses. Participants emphasized how the use of water has changed over time and described the complex challenges associated with addressing water insecurity in their community, including the importance of considering the spiritual and cultural impacts of water insecurity on health. Water insecurity is a growing global problem and more attention and efforts are needed to find appropriate and affordable solutions.

AB  - Background: Lead (Pb) exposure is a problem that disproportionately impacts low-income communities and communities of color. We applied a community-based participatory research approach to assess the distribution of soil Pb concentrations and related social vulnerabilities across Census tracts in Santa Ana, CA. Methods: Soil Pb samples (n = 1528) were collected by the jPlo-NOI Santa Anal Lead-Free Santa Anal partnership in 2018 across Santa Ana, CA, at a high spatial resolution and measured using XRF analysis. Pb concentrations were mapped and spatial interpolation was conducted to generate a continuous smoothed map of soil Pb concentrations across the city. American Community Survey data was used to examine Pb across Census tracts based on social and economic factors, and to allow for the development of a Cumulative Risk Index to identify areas at high risk of health impacts. Results: Soil Pb concentrations varied by landuse type and socioeconomic factors. Census tracts with a median household income below $50,000 had over five times higher soil Pb concentrations than high-income Census tracts. Soil samples collected in tertiles with the highest percent children, residents without health insurance, renter-occupied housing units, and lowest percent college educated residents had 90.0%, 96.1%, 75.2%, and 87.0% higher Pb concentrations on average, respectively, compared to their counterparts. Overall, 52.7% of residential samples had Pb concentrations in excess of the 80 ppm California EPA recommendation, and 11 Census tracts were characterized as high risk according to our Cumulative Risk Index. Discussion: This study underscores the need for precautionary measures relating to disturbances of the soil, particularly for areas where children play outside, given children's higher absorption of lead. It also informs environmental justice initiatives and identifies vulnerable subpopulations at greater risk of Pb exposure, thus warranting community-driven recommendations for policies and initiatives to remediate soil Pb and protect public health and health equity.

AB  - A marked feature of the political tactics of the transnational School Strike 4 Climate movement (also known as Fridays for Futures and Youth Strike for Climate) has been the use of humour on cardboard signs, digital memes and social media posts. Young people's cardboard signs, memes and social media posts have frequently mobilised humour as public pedagogy and political intervention - to emotionally stir and to politically engage others. In this article, we argue that the school strikers' creation and mobilisation of humour demonstrate a critical affective climate justice literacy that educators committed to pursuing climate justice have much to learn from. In analysing examples of humour in contemporary student climate justice activism, this article brings previous analyses of the potential of humour in social movement studies and climate change communication into conversation with calls from environmental education scholars to pay greater attention to the potency of emotion for climate justice education, beyond a rationalistic focus on climate science literacy. We outline four pedagogical propositions for working with humour, accompanied by their own perplexities, in moving towards critical affective climate justice literacies.

AB  - Air pollutant concentrations are often higher near major roadways than in the surrounding environments owing to emissions from on-road mobile sources. In this study, we quantified the gradient in black carbon (BC) and air toxics concentrations from the I-70 freeway in the Elyria-Swansea environmental justice neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, during three measurement campaigns in 2017-2018. The average hourly upwind-downwind gradient of BC concentrations from the roadway was 500-800 ng/m(3), equal to an increment of approximately 30-80% above local background levels within 180 m of the freeway. When integrated over all wind directions, the gradients were smaller, approximately 150-300 ng/m(3) (~11-18%) over the course of nearly four months of measurements. No statistically significant gradient in air toxics (e.g., benzene, formaldehyde, etc.) was found, likely because the uncertainties in the mean concentrations were larger than the magnitude of the gradient (<25%). This finding is in contrast to some earlier studies in which small gradients of benzene and other VOCs were found. We estimate that sample sizes of at least 100 individual measurements would have been required to estimate mean concentrations with sufficient certainty to quantify gradients on the order of +/- 10% uncertainty. These gradient estimates are smaller than those found in previous studies over the past two decades; more stringent emissions standards, the local fleet age distribution, and/or the steady turnover of the vehicle fleet may be reducing the overall impact of roadway emissions on near-road communities. Implications: Gradients of near-road pollution may be declining in the near-road environment as tailpipe emissions from the vehicle fleet continue to decrease. Near-road concentration gradients of mobile source air toxics, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and ethylbenzene, will require higher sample sizes to quantify as emissions continue to decline.

AB  - Addressing energy provision and access in Sub-Saharan Africa is a key global challenge. Drawing on interviews with key stakeholders, this paper applies an energy justice framework in overviewing energy realities and policies in Malawi, where electricity access remains among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The use of woodfuel remains high for meeting cooking, heating, and lighting needs leading to indoor air pollution, with serious health consequences, and widespread deforestation. Responses to these dual challenges, a lack of electricity access and ongoing woodfuel use, must be rooted in notions of equity, fairness, and justice. Application of energy justice theorising provides insights into how policy stakeholders are responding to complex and interconnected issues of energy generation and access in low-income settings. Overall, a just response to these energy challenges is possible, but only if it is built on local inclusive governance with fairer and effective systems of investment.

AB  - A fair and equitable low carbon future depends on a just transition which, in turn, requires leadership. Where the Arctic is concerned, this leadership is currently lacking. To gauge which states are most likely to provide leadership in the global energy transition, a quantitative rank-percentile assessment of 21 Arctic Council members and Observer states was conducted, using measures relevant to the just transition. Data from multiple open-access sources were combined, creating a model to 'evaluate energy and equity aspects of Distributional, Procedural and Restorative' justice (DeePeR). Results suggest normative leadership on a just transition for the Arctic comprises international climate contributions in line with carbon emission records and a commitment to both fair and green jobs. Reflections are made on the positive and negative effects of a more involved EU for the just transition agenda in the Arctic.

Methods: This CANS 2020 Keynote article describes the history of nursing environmental science and nurses important contributions to the US Environmental Justice Movement. Starting with Florence Nightingale's Notes on Nursing, which established Environmental Theory, the paper introduces key figures throughout nursing history who have studied and advocated for environmental health and justice. Findings: The paper emphasizes that nursing has always been about environmental health and that, regardless of specialty or practice setting, all nurses are called to incorporate environmental science and translation into their research and practice. Conclusion: This call to action is especially critical today in the context of urgent issues like climate change, environmental racism and racial health disparities, emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, and chemical exposures in the home and workplace (among others).

AB  - As urban agriculture grows in popularity throughout North America, vacant lots, underutilized parks, and other open spaces are becoming prime targets for food production. In many post-industrial landscapes and in neighborhoods with a high density of old housing stock, the risk of lead (Pb) contamination at such sites is raising concerns. This paper evaluates the extent to which soil Pb contamination may be an obstacle to the expansion of urban agriculture in Oakland, California. Using a combination of soil sampling at 112 sites, GIS, "hot spot" analysis, and reconstructed land use histories, the research reveals that soil Pb concentrations are generally lower than federal screening levels of 400 ppm, but significantly higher in West Oakland, the city's oldest area and home to a predominantly low-income and African American population. Lead levels are significantly lower in the affluent, predominantly white Oakland hills. Spatial analysis at city- and neighborhood-scales reveals clusters of Pb contamination related to land use history. Site-scale analyses at 12 sites reveals a high level of variability (in some cases related to land use history) that must be taken into consideration when planning for urban agriculture.

AB  - A phenomenological description of hunting and eating animals provides insight into many timely questions about environmental justice, the ethical relationships of human and non-human animals, the politics of food production and consumption, and the even larger questions of alienation, authenticity, and mind-fulness in our modern capitalist lifeworld. Despite this nexus of discourse, hunting has rarely been treated seriously as a site for food justice or ecological ethics. Informed by Iris Marion Young's concept of social justice and Val Plumwood's ecofeminist perspectives on predation, this essay proposes an ecophenomenological description of hunting whitetail deer in the Midwestern United States and other entanglements in the wild places of the Pacific Northwest where we ourselves may become prey. In particular, I offer examples from the decade-long public policy debate over 'canned hunting' in Indiana to show how our relationships with traditional game animals have ontological consequences that reverberate throughout broader environmental and food justice realities. Inspired by William Faulkner's phenomenological critique of private property in his novel Go Down, Moses and by my own evolution as an eater, I claim that our understandings of the arbitrary division of culture and nature play a key role in our ethical comportment towards nonhuman lifeworlds.

AB  - Adaptation needs in high mountain communities are increasingly well documented, yet most efforts to address these needs continue to befall mountain people who have contributed little to the problem of climate change. This situation represents a contravention of accepted norms of climate justice and calls attention to the need for better understanding of prospects for externally resourced adaptation initiatives in high mountain areas. In response, this paper examines the architecture of formal adaptation support mechanisms organized through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and how such mechanisms might help to meet adaptation needs in high mountain communities. It outlines key global adaptation initiatives organized through the UNFCCC, clarifies idealized linkages between these global adaptation initiatives and meeting local adaptation needs, and evaluates actual progress in connecting such support with discrete adaptation needs in the upper Manaslu region of Nepal. The paper then critically examines observed shortcomings in matching adaptation support organized through the UNFCCC with local adaptation needs, including complications stemming from the bureaucratic nature of formal adaptation support mechanisms, the intervening role of the state in delivering aid, and the ways in which these complexities intersect with the specific socio-cultural contexts of mountain communities. It concludes by highlighting several prospects for increasing the quantity and quality of adaptation support to mountain communities. These opportunities are considered alongside several salient concerns about formal adaptation support mechanisms in an effort to provide a well-rounded assessment of the prospects for planned adaptations in high mountain communities.

AB  - A distinct formulation of Indigenous environmental justice (IEJ) is required in order to address the challenges of the ecological crisis as well the various forms of violence and injustices experienced specifically by Indigenous peoples. A distinct IEJ formulation must ground its foundations in Indigenous philosophies, ontologies, and epistemologies in order to reflect Indigenous conceptions of what constitutes justice. This approach calls into question the legitimacy and applicability of global and nationstate political and legal mechanisms, as these same states and international governing bodies continue to fail Indigenous peoples around the world. Not only do current global, national and local systems of governance and law fail Indigenous peoples, they fail all life. Indigenous peoples over the decades have presented a distinct diagnosis of the planetary ecological crisis evidenced in the observations shared as part of Indigenous environmental declarations.

AB  - A core capability for sociologists who wish to respond to the complex interconnected social, cultural, political and economic challenges will be the ability to transcend disciplinary boundaries and to work with diverse perspectives. Thus those who inform the argument for this article include De Waal and Dawkins (primatology and philosophy), Kymlicka and Donaldson (animal rights and shared habitat), Hirschman and Hannah Arendt (on economics and politics), Amartya Sen (on economics and morality), Stuart Hall (on identity) and Martha Nussbaum (on social justice). The work of Stiglitz on wellbeing stocks is extended through drawing on Vandana Shiva (on the intersections spanning economics, politics and the environment) and a recognition of our interconnectedness as part of a living system. This provides the basis for intersectional policy approaches to address violence against the planet and violence against those without a voice. This capability is important if we are to inform praxis on governing the Anthropocene, in order to protect both human and animal rights along with their shared and separate habitats. Resume L'une des facultes essentielles pour les sociologues qui etudient les problemes politiques, economiques, culturels et sociaux etroitement interdependants et complexes est d'arriver a depasser le cloisonnement disciplinaire et d'adopter differentes perspectives de travail.

Il complete les travaux de Stiglitz sur les niveaux de bien-etre grace a la contribution de Vandana Shiva (sur les intersections de l'economie, de la politique et de l'environnement) et a la reconnaissance de notre interdependance comme une partie du systeme du vivant.

Cette capacite est importante si nous souhaitons eclairer les pratiques gouvernementales de l'Anthropocene et proteger les droits des humains et des animaux dans leurs habitats partages et separes. Resumen Una capacidad central para los sociologos que deseen responder a los complejos retos sociales, culturales, politicos y economicos interconectados sera la capacidad de trascender las fronteras disciplinarias y trabajar con diversas perspectivas. Asi, los autores con quienes este trabajo discute De Waal y Dawkins (primatologia y filosofia), Kymlicka y Donaldson (derechos de los animales y habitat compartido), Hirschman y Hannah Arendt (sobre economia y politica), Amartya Sen (sobre economia y moralidad), Stuart Hall (sobre la identidad) y Martha Nussbaum (sobre la justicia social). El trabajo de Stiglitz sobre reservas de bienestar se extiende a traves de Vandana Shiva (en las intersecciones que abarcan la economia, la politica y el medio ambiente) y un reconocimiento de nuestra interconexion como parte de un sistema vivo. Esto proporciona la base para enfoques de politicas interseccionales para abordar la violencia contra el planeta y la violencia contra quienes no tienen voz. Esta capacidad es importante si queremos informar la praxis sobre el gobierno del Antropoceno, a fin de proteger tanto los derechos humanos como los animales, junto con sus habitats compartidos y separados.

AB  - Background Economic and social marginalization among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) results in higher chronic disease prevalence. Potential causal associations between toxic environmental exposures and adverse health outcomes within AI/AN communities are not well understood. Objectives This review examines epidemiological literature on exposure to toxicants and associated adverse health outcomes among AI/AN populations. Methods PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Environment Complete, Web of Science Plus, DART, and ToxLine were searched for English-language articles. The following data were extracted: lead author's last name, publication year, cohort name, study location, AI/AN tribe, study initiation and conclusion, sample size, primary characteristic, environmental exposure, health outcomes, risk estimates, and covariates. Results About 31 articles on three types of environmental exposures met inclusion criteria: persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, and open dumpsites. Of these, 17 addressed exposure to POPs, 10 heavy metal exposure, 2 exposure to both POPs and heavy metals, and 2 exposure to open dumpsites. Studies on the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne; Yupik on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska; Navajo Nation; Gila River Indian Community; Cheyenne River Sioux; 197 Alaska Native villages; and 13 tribes in Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and South Dakota that participated in the Strong Heart Study support associations between toxicant exposure and various chronic conditions including cardiovascular conditions, reproductive abnormalities, cancer, autoimmune disorders, neurological deficits, and diabetes. Discussion The complex interplay of environmental and social factors in disease etiology among AI/ANs is a product of externally imposed environmental exposures, systemic discrimination, and modifiable risk behaviors. The connection between environmental health disparities and adverse health outcomes indicates a need for further study.

AB  - Although current environmental justice analyses shed light on fracking and fracking's environmental and public health policy, a comprehensive justice analysis framework is needed in order to cover the policy gap of fracking impacts on the total environment, communities, and sustainability. Based on a concise summary of the effects of fracking on the total environment, the society and economy, and land use, this brief communication designs a conception of fracking equity and its spatial justice analysis prototype. Fracking equity is much beyond the scope of current environmental justice or social justice that is spatially limited within certain distance to fracking wells. Fracking equity based on the benefit and harm associated with fracking, not only encompasses environmental justice, social justice, but also emphasizes all stakeholder groups, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the justice of fracking, sustainable development, and the integrated analyzing methods including GIS, decision making, demographic analysis, spatiotemporal modeling at different scales, and long term analysis of fracking equity. Spatial justice of fracking unites the environmental, social, economic, ecological factors and their processes that are temporally changing and reshaping the space people live in and depend on, and these complicated factors and their dynamic interactions are the core of spatial justice.

AB  - A transformative lens applied to research increases impact in the form of providing support for actions that increase social, economic, and environmental justice. Researchers who accept the role of supporting transformative change can enhance their abilities to do so through the use of a transformative lens that informs the design, implementation, and use of their research. The transformative ethical assumption informs methodological choices in that the research design consciously focuses on addressing inequities and providing a platform for transformative change. Engagement with members of marginalized and vulnerable communities is critical and needs to be approached in ways that value the knowledge they bring and addresses power inequities. Methodologies that are commensurate with a transformative approach include the use of mixed methods, viewing the role of the researcher as a social change agent, learning from social activism, and employing specific strategies for culturally responsive inclusion, addressing power differences, and planning for sustainability. Examples of research that increased social impact illustrate how these methodologies have been applied: social activism strategies to address structural racism for youth and for Black men in prison; culturally responsive strategies in research affecting members of sexual minorities in countries in which same-sex behaviors are prohibited by law and for incarcerated women; power inequities in research for people living in high poverty, including children in Nicaragua and Indigenous South Africans; and planning for sustainability with Indigenous youth in Canada and farmers in South Africa. The transformative approach to research asks researchers to critically examine their role in sustaining an oppressive status quo and to address the challenges of supporting increased justice.

AB  - A large number of 'environmental justice' studies show that wealthier people are less affected by environmental burdens and also consume more resources than poorer people. Given this double inequity, we ask, to what extent are affluent people prepared to pay to protect the environment? The analyses are couched within the compensation/affluence hypothesis, which states that wealthier persons are able to spend more for environmental protection than their poorer counterparts. Further, we take into account various competing economic, psychological and sociological determinants of individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for both public environmental goods (e.g., general environmental protection) and quasi-private environmental goods (e.g., CO2-neutral cars). Such a comprehensive approach contrasts with most other studies in this field that focus on a limited number of determinants and goods. Multivariate analyses are based on a general population survey in Switzerland (N = 3,369). Although income has a positive and significant effect on WTP supporting the compensation hypothesis, determinants such as generalized interpersonal trust that is assumed to be positively associated with civic engagement and environmental concern prove to be equally important. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that time preferences can considerably influence survey-based WTP for environmental goods; since investments in the environment typically pay off in the distant future, persons with a high subjective discount rate are less likely to commit.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change is a policy objective of rapidly growing importance for development programming across the Global South. This article offers an interrogation of the discursive politics surrounding the term based on insights from postcolonial theory. By employing a theoretical framework rooted in the concepts of imaginative geographies and discursive violence, this contribution seeks to deconstruct how adaptation is being imagined and promoted by development actors in a Global South context. The underlying study adopts a multisited, institutional ethnography to critically analyze an adaptation project in Sao Tome and Principe (STP) implemented jointly by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the national government. The article presents evidence for how agents of development (re)produce an imaginative geography of the country's vulnerability and engage in a discursive violence that renders project beneficiaries vulnerable on the one hand, and seeks to transform them into model adaptation subjects on the other. It discusses how local residents have been effectively excluded from the project based on their perceived vulnerabilities and points to critical political theory and "imaginative countergeographies" as ways in which the disempowering representations of the Global South as vulnerable and the discursive violence committed against its residents can be counteracted.

AB  - Background This paper has reviewed the international research on the terms "climate change" and "human migration" from 1999 to 2019. To this end, a bibliometric and a cluster analysis by fractional accounting have been carried out using two of the most important databases: Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The research found and studied 140 documents from WoS Core Collection and 193 from Scopus. Results The results show a continual increase in the number of articles published and citations received during the whole period studied. The U.S., U.K., Germany and China have been shown to be the most productive countries and there is a predominance of North American organizations supporting and fostering research on these topics. Conclusions The main contribution of this article is the analysis of new tendencies. The trend shows a transition from concepts such as vulnerability, climate change, land degradation, refugees and security to others such as concepts such as international migration, climate justice, sustainability, human rights and disaster risk reduction. Future research in this field should address the comparison of results from research focused on human beings to a focus on other living beings.

AB  - Background Many vulnerable populations experience elevated exposures to environmental and social stressors, with deleterious effects on health. Multi-stressor epidemiological models can be used to assess benefits of exposure reductions. However, requisite individual-level risk factor data are often unavailable at adequate spatial resolution. Objective To leverage public data and novel simulation methods to estimate birthweight changes following simulated environmental interventions in two environmental justice communities in Massachusetts, USA. Methods We gathered risk factor data from public sources (US Census, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and Massachusetts Department of Health). We then created synthetic individual-level data sets using combinatorial optimization, and probabilistic and logistic modeling. Finally, we used coefficients from a multi-stressor epidemiological model to estimate birthweight and birthweight improvement associated with simulated environmental interventions. Results We created geographically resolved synthetic microdata. Mothers with the lowest predicted birthweight were those identifying as Black or Hispanic, with parity > 1, utilization of government prenatal support, and lower educational attainment. Birthweight improvements following greenness and temperature improvements were similar for all high-risk groups and were larger than benefits from smoking cessation. Significance Absent private health data, this methodology allows for assessment of cumulative risk and health inequities, and comparison of individual-level impacts of localized health interventions.

AB  - Although they are accustomed to discussing risks in the medical arena through the process of informed consent, primary care clinicians may have difficulty communicating with their patients and communities about environmental health risks. Clinicians are generally trusted and can play important roles as educators, alert practitioners, or even advocates talking about environmental health risks with individuals and groups. Communication of risk requires an understanding of how scientists and clinicians assess risk-the process of quantitative or qualitative risk assessment. Risk is never a purely scientific issue; risk is perceived differently depending on some well-understood characteristics of the hazard, the individual perceiving the risk, and the social context. Many low-income communities of color have faced and continue to face disproportionate environmental exposures and disease burdens. The issue of environmental justice can significantly affect the context of a discussion about a specific environmental risk. The essence of risk communication has been well described and requires careful evaluation of the science and the social context, honesty, listening to and partnering with the community, and a clear, compassionate team approach.

AB  - A key aspect of teaching 'development' is understanding the conundrums and tensions between balance and imbalance with constructs of global (all humans, all societies, all populations) and planetary (all of Earth, including humans) spheres. This article deconstructs some key tenets of populist post-truth frameworks (termed as post-truthism in this article) as affecting how development and sustainability is taught within ecopedagogies and argues for structural grounding of ecopedagogical literacy within pedagogies as increasingly imperative. Rooted in critical theories and popular education movements in Latin America, through reinvention of Freirean Pedagogy, the literacy's root word ecopedagogy is transformative teaching in which educators dialectically problem-pose the politics of socio-environmental connections through local, global, and planetary lenses. Without deepened and widened readings of development and sustainability viewed within both global and planetary spheres, in conjunction with development's effects upon local societies and ecological systems, developmental actions are unsustainable and defies the definition of development. Discussed will be the ecopedagogical tenets, including emergent ecopedagogical literacies, of critical socio-historical analysis, local and diverse epistemologies, deconstruction of pedagogies on the environment, and problem-posing one's and others' livelihood to counter post-truthism.

AB  - A combination of the urban heat island effect and a rising temperature baseline resulting from global climate change inequitably impacts socially vulnerable populations residing in urban areas. This article examines racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in the spatial distribution of exposure to urban heat in the context of climate justice and residential segregation in the U.S. An urban heat risk index (UHRI) is calculated from measures of land surface temperature, structural density, and vegetation abundance, acquired from summer 2010 remote sensing imagery. Twenty of the largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the U.S. are selected and analysed using census tract-level socio-demographic data from the U.S. Census. Multilevel modelling is utilised to examine the statistical associations between urban heat, minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, and MSA-level segregation of racial/ethnic minority groups. Variables representing socioeconomic status (i.e. household income, home ownership, and education level) are consistently and significantly associated with greater urban heat exposure. Minority status and measures of segregation have a significant but varied relationship with urban heat exposure, indicating that there are inconsistent associations with urban heat due to differing social geographies. Urban heat and social vulnerability present a varying landscape of thermal inequity in different metropolitan areas, associated in many cases with residential segregation.

AB  - Air quality in Great Britain has improved in recent years, but not enough to prevent the European Commission (EC) taking legal action for non-compliance with limit values. Air quality is a national public health concern, with disease burden associated with current air quality estimated at 29 000 premature deaths per year due to fine particulates, with a further burden due to NO2. National small-area analyses showed that in 2001 poor air quality was much more prevalent in socio-economically deprived areas. We extend this social distribution of air quality analysis to consider how the distribution changed over the following decade (2001-2011), a period when significant efforts to meet EC air quality directive limits have been made, and air quality has improved. We find air quality improvement is greatest in the least deprived areas, whilst the most deprived areas bear a disproportionate and rising share of declining air quality including non-compliance with air quality standards. We discuss the implications for health inequalities, progress towards environmental justice, and compatibility of social justice and environmental sustainability objectives.

AB  - A considerable number of quantitative analyses have been conducted in the past several decades that demonstrate the existence of racial and socioeconomic disparities in the distribution of a wide variety of environmental hazards. The vast majority of these have been cross-sectional, snapshot studies employing data on hazardous facilities and population characteristics at only one point in time. Although some limited hypotheses can be tested with cross-sectional data, fully understanding how present-day disparities come about requires longitudinal analyses that examine the demographic characteristics of sites at the time of facility siting and track demographic changes after siting. Relatively few such studies exist and those that do exist have often led to confusing and contradictory findings. In this paper we review the theoretical arguments, methods, findings, and conclusions drawn from existing longitudinal environmental justice studies. Our goal is to make sense of this literature and to identify the direction future research should take in order to resolve confusion and arrive at a clearer understanding of the processes and contributory factors by which present-day racial and socioeconomic disparities in the distribution of environmental hazards have come about. Such understandings also serve as an important step in identifying appropriate and effective societal responses to ameliorate environmental disparities.

AB  - Although a large body of quantitative environmental justice research exists, only a handful of studies have examined the processes by which racial and socioeconomic disparities in the location of polluting industrial facilities can occur. These studies have had mixed results, we contend, principally because of methodological differences, that is, the use of the unit-hazard coincidence method as compared to distance-based methods. This study is the first national-level environmental justice study to conduct longitudinal analyses using distance-based methods. Our purposes are to: (1) determine whether disparate siting, post-siting demographic change, or a combination of the two created present-day disparities; (2) test related explanations; and (3) determine whether the application of distance-based methods helps resolve the inconsistent findings of previous research. We used a national database of commercial hazardous waste facilities sited from 1966 to 1995 and examined the demographic composition of host neighborhoods around the time of siting and demographic changes that occurred after siting. We found strong evidence of disparate siting for facilities sited in all time periods. Although we found some evidence of post-siting demographic changes, they were mostly a continuation of changes that occurred in the decade or two prior to siting, suggesting that neighborhood transition serves to attract noxious facilities rather than the facilities themselves attracting people of color and low income populations. Our findings help resolve inconsistencies among the longitudinal studies and builds on the evidence from other subnational studies that used distance-based methods. We conclude that racial discrimination and sociopolitical explanations (i.e., the proposition that siting decisions follow the 'path of least resistance') best explain present-day inequities.

AB  - Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure entails large health effects in many urban areas. Public measures aiming at decreasing air pollution are often designed without targeting an explicit health benefit. Our objective was to investigate the health and economic benefits and the social inequalities in exposure resulting from several scenarios of reduction of PM2.5 exposure, in order to support decisions about urban policies. Material and methods: In the French conurbations of Grenoble and Lyon (0.4 and 1.4 million inhabitants, respectively), PM2.5 yearly average exposure was estimated on a 10-m grid by coupling a PM2.5 dispersion model to population density. Changes in death cases, life expectancy, lung cancer and term low birth weight incident cases as well as associated health economic costs were estimated for ten PM2.5 reduction scenarios differing in terms of amplitude of reduction and spatial extent. Changes in social differences in PM2.5 exposure were also assessed. Results: During the 2015-2017 period, PM2.5 average exposure was 13.9 mu g/m(3) in Grenoble and 15.3 mu g/m(3) in Lyon conurbations. Exposure to PM2.5 led to an estimated 145 (95% Confidence Interval, CI, 90-199) and 531 (95% CI, 330-729) premature deaths, 16 (95% CI, 8-24) and 65 (95% CI, 30-96) incident lung cancers, and 49 (95% CI, 19-76) and 193 (95% CI, 76-295) term low birth weight cases each year in Grenoble and Lyon conurbations, respectively, compared to a situation without PM2.5 anthropogenic sources, i.e. a PM2.5 concentration of 4.9 mu g/m(3). The associated costs amounted to 495 (Grenoble) and 1767 (Lyon) M(sic)/year for the intangible costs related to all-cause non-accidental mortality and 27 and 105 M(sic) for the tangible and intangible costs induced by lung cancer. A PM2.5 exposure reduction down to the WHO air quality guideline (10 mu g/m(3)) would reduce anthropogenic PM2.5-attributable mortality by half while decreases by 2.9 mu g/m(3) (Grenoble) and 3.3 mu g/m(3) (Lyon) were required to reduce it by a third. Scenarios focusing only on the most exposed areas had little overall impact. Scenarios seeking to reach a homogeneous exposure in the whole study area were the most efficient in alleviating social inequalities in exposure. Conclusions: Reduction scenarios targeting only air pollution hotspots had lithe expected impact on population health. We provided estimates of the PM2.5 change required to reduce PM2.5-attributable mortality by one third or more. Our approach can help targeting air pollution reduction scenarios expected to entail significant benefits, and it could easily be transposed to other urban areas.

AB  - Background: Environmental justice research suggests that inequalities in the distribution of environmental exposure to chemical pollution systematically disadvantage the lower social strata of society. The effects of these inequalities on the human exposure to pollution are however to a large extend unknown. The purpose of this study is to assess social gradients in human biomonitoring results of a representative sample of Flemish adolescents. Methods: We investigate the associations between individual socioeconomic status (SES), measured by parental educational attainments, and internal body concentration of seven chemical compounds in biological samples of 1642 adolescents aged 14-15 in Flanders (Belgium): PCBs, HCB, DDE, lead, cadmium, benzene and PAHs. Social gradients in average and high exposure to these biomarkers were examined with geometric means and odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals), using multiple regression models, controlling for covariates and confounders. Results: Depending on the (type of) pollutant, adolescents with a lower SES either have higher or lower internal concentrations. Chlorinated compounds (PCBs and pesticides HCB and DDE) are positively associated with SES (higher exposures for higher SES), while heavy metals (lead and cadmium) are negatively associated (higher exposures for lower SES). For metabolites of organic compounds (benzene and PAHs) we find no association with SES. Socially constructed factors, such as dietary and lifestyle habits, play an important role in these relations. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the association between individual SES and the internal body concentration of exposure to environmental pollutants in Flemish adolescents is more complex than can be assumed on the basis of the environmental justice hypothesis.

AB  - Background: Environmental justice research shows how socially disadvantaged groups are more exposed and more vulnerable to environmental pollution. At the same time, these groups are less represented and, thus, less visible in biomedical studies. This socioeconomic participation bias is a form of environmental injustice within research practice itself. Methods: We designed, implemented and evaluated a targeted recruitment strategy to enhance the participation of socially disadvantaged pregnant women in a human biomonitoring study in Belgium. We focused on women of Turkish and Moroccan descent and developed a setup using personal buddies that enabled information transfer about study conditions in the pre-parturition period as well as support and follow-up with questionnaires in the post-parturition period. Results: We identified four barriers to the participation of women with a vulnerable social and ethnic background which were related to psychosocial and situational factors. Lack of trust in researchers and no perceived study benefits were important personal barriers; the complex study design and difficult self-administered questionnaires were equally significant barriers. Conclusion: By investing in direct, person-to-person contact with trusted buddies and supported by practical advice about cultural and linguistic sensitivity, it was possible to increase study participation of socially disadvantaged people. Above all, this required openness and flexibility in the mind-set of researchers so that study design and procedures could be better grounded in the experiences and circumstances of underprivileged groups.

AB  - A series of studies show the health consequences of people exposed to pesticides either because of their work activity or because they live or study near agricultural land. Occupational exposure to a series of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides is mainly associated with cancer, neurocognitive and motor damage, peripheral polyneuropathy, depression and anxiety, malformations in children at birth, endocrine and reproductive system difficulties, kidney damage and genotoxic effects. Through a review of the literature, the objective of the following article was to elucidate the situation of exposure to pesticides in rural school communities, unveil the bioethical dilemmas in which they are located and the need to apply elements of environmental justice to generate a change and actions to improve their quality of life and health, for the right to live free of environmental pollution. Environmental justice seeks much more than equity and fair treatment and quality similar to that of other non-vulnerable communities, aims to make the same communities demand the need for a more egalitarian society that ensures the right to live in an environment cleansed.

AB  - Academic debates over the spatial implications of energy transitions and the realization of sustainable futures have predominantly focused on urban areas, which has resulted in the notion of 'urban energy transitions'. The idea of 'rural energy transitions', however, has remained rather underexplored. This is surprising because resources needed to produce renewable energy constitute a key element of energy transitions and are inextricably tied to rural spaces. In particular, rural regions accommodate the majority of renewable energy infrastructures, such as wind turbines, solar, and biogas plants, as well as transmission grids. In that sense, urban energy transitions are simply impossible without rural energy transitions. Nevertheless, 'rural' dimensions of energy transition processes in the Global North have received only little scholarly interest, while the main focus of academic work has been on urban agglomerations. Despite the growing attention afforded to energy-related issues in the social sciences, in general, and urban studies and human geography, in particular, rural studies have only slowly started engaging with energy transitions as a research field. This paper, therefore, combines social science research on energy and rural studies to address this research gap. It identifies three intersections of both research traditions; namely, rural areas as locations for the materialization of energy transitions, contestations around energy issues in rural areas, and the emancipatory potentials of rural energy transitions. We argue that linking social science energy research and rural studies can yield valuable insights into the rural character of energy transitions and the role of energy within rural change.

AB  - Although studies on environmental conflicts have engaged with the subject of violence, a multidimensional approach has been lacking. Using data from 95 environmental conflicts in Central America, we show how different forms of violence appear and overlap. We focus on direct, structural, cultural, slow, and ecological forms of violence. Results suggest that the common understanding of violence in environmental conflicts as a direct event in time and space is only the tip of the iceberg and that violence can reach not only environmental defenders, but also communities, nature, and the sustainability of their relations.

AB  - Background: Health professionals have a key role in addressing the health impacts of climate change at several levels: direct patient care, client and community education, health professions education, and through advocacy and health policy development. Method: Recognizing that nurses are the first line in health education, nursing faculty at the MGH Institute of Health Professions developed the first nurse-led Center for Climate Change, Climate Justice and Health (CCCCJH). Results: A steering committee of nurse climate change scholars and interested faculty developed a mission, vision, core values, and a strategic plan for the CCCCJH and are working on integrating climate change topics into nursing curricula at all levels. Conclusion: Nurses are in the ideal position to lead the way to increase awareness among health professionals and students about the health impacts of climate change. Curricular integration of climate change topics at all levels will prepare our students to meet the needs and challenges of the future.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that characteristics of the neighborhood environment in urban areas significantly impact risk for drug use behavior and exposure to violent crime. Identifying areas of community need, prioritizing planning projects, and developing strategies for community improvement require inexpensive, easy to use, evidence-based tools to assess neighborhood disorder that can be used for a variety of research, urban planning, and community needs with an environmental justice frame. This study describes validation of the Neighborhood Inventory for Environmental Typology (NIfETy), a neighborhood environmental observational assessment tool designed to assess characteristics of the neighborhood environment related to violence, alcohol, and other drugs, for use with Google Street View (GSV). GSV data collection took place on a random sample of 350 blocks located throughout Baltimore City, Maryland, which had previously been assessed through in-person data collection. Inter-rater reliability metrics were strong for the majority of items (ICC >= 0.7), and items were highly correlated with in-person observations (r >= 0.6). Exploratory factor analysis and constrained factor analysis resulted in one, 14-item disorder scale with high internal consistency (alpha = 0.825) and acceptable fit indices (CFI = 0.982; RMSEA = 0.051). We further validated this disorder scale against locations of violent crimes, and we found that disorder score was significantly and positively associated with neighborhood crime (IRR = 1.221, 95% CI = (1.157, 1.288), p < 0.001). The NIfETy provides a valid, economical, and efficient tool for assessing modifiable neighborhood risk factors for drug use and violence prevention that can be employed for a variety of research, urban planning, and community needs.

AB  - A comprehensive approach using hazard screening, demographic analysis, and a geographic information system (GIS) for mapping is employed to address environmental equity issues in Oregon. A media-specific chronic toxicity index [or chronic index (CI)I was used to compare environmental chemical releases reported in the EPA's Toxic Chemical Release Inventory (TRI) database. In 1992, 254 facilities reportedly released more than 40 million pounds of toxic chemicals directly into the environment on-site or transferred them to sewage treatment plants or other off-sire facilities for disposal and recycling. For each reported on-site TRI chemical release, a CI based on oral toxicity factors and total mass was calculated. CIs were aggregated on a media-, facility-, and chemical-specific basis. Glycol ethers, nickel, trichloroethylene, chloroform, and manganese were ranked as the top five chemicals released statewide based on total CI. In contrast, based on total mass, methanol, nickel, ammonia, acetone, and toluene were identified as the top five TRI chemicals released in Oregon. TRI facility rankings were related to the demographics and household income of surrounding neighborhoods using bivariate GIS mapping and statistical analysis. TRI facilities were disproportionately located in racial and ethnic minority neighborhoods. They were also located in areas with lower incomes compared to those in the surrounding county. No relationship was observed between the hazard ranking of the TRI facilities overall and socioeconomic characteristics of the community in which they were located.

AB  - A California Department of Health Services program dealt with possible health effects from Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF) from power lines. With the advice of stakeholders, and well before any risk determinations were made, transparent policy analyses about the power grid and schools asked the question, "How confident must one be of how big an effect before one would adopt cheap or expensive EMF avoidance measures?" A risk evaluation was carried out with features that promoted transparency. It was formatted to provide a policy-neutral "degree of certainty of causality" to adherents of utilitarian, environmental justice, and libertarian policy frameworks. Though the program had many features advocated by adherents of the precautionary principle, it might be better characterized as following "Transparent Democratic Foresight Strategies," since no single principle justifies the strategies used in this participatory program, and it examined the pros and cons of options but made no recommendations, precautionary or otherwise.

AB  - A major health consequence of climate change is an increased prevalence of vector-borne diseases due to changes in temperatures and the environments in which vectors can survive and carry out transmissible activity. Because of climate change, emerging health challenges related to the warming of the planet have led to an increase in vector-borne diseases in broadening geographic areas. Individuals affected with Lyme disease may present with a variety of symptoms, which highlights the importance of illness recognition to ensure that a patient can receive timely treatment and effective support. Despite the focus on early detection and treatment of acute Lyme disease, chronic health problems associated with Lyme disease are an emerging problem in the 21st century. This article focuses on the role of nurse practitioners and members of the health professional team in the recognition, clinical care, patient education, and management of increasing rates of chronic Lyme disease.

AB  - At the local scale in Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP), MN, urban farms, community gardens, and home gardens support diverse individual and community goals, including food access and sovereignty, recreation and outdoor activity, youth education, and racial, economic, and environmental justice. Collaborations between urban growers, policymakers, scholars, and communities that leverage urban farms and gardens as sites of ecological, social, and political transformation represent spaces of urban agroecology. Participatory research can play a vital role in urban agroecology by facilitating integration of science, movement, and practice, but frameworks to accomplish this are still emerging. This paper, therefore, proposes a "learning framework" for urban agroecology research that has emerged from our community-university partnership. We-a group of growers, community partners, and researchers-have worked with each other for 5 years through multiple projects that broadly focused on the socio-ecological drivers and impacts of urban farms and gardens in MSP. In fall 2019, we conducted our first formal evaluation of the participatory processes implemented in our current project with the objectives to (1) identify processes that facilitated or were barriers to authentic collaboration and (2) understand the role of relationships in the participatory processes. Qualitative surveys and interviews were developed and conducted with researchers, partners, and students. Analysis revealed that urban agroecology research provided a space for shared learning, which was facilitated through co-creation of research, embodied processes, and relationships with people, cohorts, and place. As part of our partnership agreements, we as researchers wrote this article-in close consultation with partners-to share this framework in the hopes that it will serve as a model for other research collaborations working within complex urban agroecological systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the United States, nationwide estimates of public drinking water arsenic exposure are not readily available. We used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Six-Year Review contaminant occurrence data set to estimate public water arsenic exposure. We compared community water system (CWS) arsenic concentrations during 2006-2008 vs. after 2009-2011, the initial monitoring period for compliance with the U.S. EPA's 10 lg/L arsenic maximum contaminant level (MCL). OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize potential inequalities in CWS arsenic exposure over time and across sociodemographic subgroups. METHODS: We estimated 3-y average arsenic concentrations for 36,406 CWSs (98%) and 2,740 counties (87%) and compared differences in means and quantiles of water arsenic (via quantile regression) between both 3-y periods for U.S. regions and sociodemographic subgroups. We assigned CWSs and counties MCL compliance categories (High if above the MCL; Low if below) for each 3-y period. RESULTS: From 2006-2008 to 2009-2011, mean and 95th percentile CWS arsenic (in micrograms per liter) declined by 10.3% (95% CI: 6.5%, 14.1%) and 11.5% (8.3%, 14.8%) nationwide, by 11.4% (4.7%, 18.1%) and 16.3% (8.1%, 24.5%) for the Southwest, and by 36.8% (7.4%, 66.1%) and 26.5% (12.1%, 40.8%) for New England, respectively. CWSs in the High/High compliance category (not MCL compliant) were more likely in the Southwest (61.1%), served by groundwater (94.7%), serving smaller populations (mean 1,102 persons), and serving Hispanic communities (38.3%). DISCUSSION: Larger absolute declines in CWS arsenic concentrations at higher water arsenic quantiles indicate declines are related to MCL implementation. CWSs reliant on groundwater, serving smaller populations, located in the Southwest, and serving Hispanic communities were more likely to continue exceeding the arsenic MCL, raising environmental justice concerns. These estimates of public drinking water arsenic exposure can enable further surveillance and epidemiologic research, including assessing whether differential declines in water arsenic exposure resulted in differential declines in arsenic-associated disease.

Our objective was to determine if incarcerated persons are at risk for chronic, elevated arsenic exposure relative to the non-incarcerated US population, particularly in the Southwestern US where public water and groundwater arsenic concentrations are high compared to the rest of the US. Methods: We analyzed 230,158 arsenic monitoring records from 37,086 community water systems (CWSs) from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Third Six Year Review of Contaminant Occurrence dataset (covering 2006-2011). We compared six-year average arsenic concentrations and the odds of exceeding the EPA's 10 mu g/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) for CWSs exclusively serving correctional facilities versus all other CWSs in the Southwestern US, where groundwater arsenic concentrations are high. Results: Average six-year water arsenic concentrations were higher for Southwestern correctional facility CWSs (6.41 mu g/L, 95% CI 3.48, 9.34) compared to all other Southwestern CWSs (3.11 mu g/L, 95% CI 2.97, 3.24) and to other CWSs across the rest of the US (1.39 mu g/L, 95% CI 1.35, 1.42). In the Southwest, 26.1% (N = 6) of correctional facility CWSs versus 5.8% (509) of other CWSs reported six-year arsenic averages exceeding 10 mu g/ L, corresponding to an odds ratio of 5.70 (95% confidence interval 2.24, 14.52). Correctional facility CWSs in the Southwest were also more likely to report six-year averages exceeding 5 mu g/L (the MCL for New Jersey and New Hampshire, N = 8, odds ratio 2.77, 95% CI 1.17, 6.54). Discussion: Persons incarcerated in the Southwestern US were at disproportionate risk of elevated drinking water arsenic exposure and related disease from 2006 to 2011. Strict enforcement of EPA regulations and additional technical and financial support for CWSs serving correctional facilities in the Southwest is necessary to protect the health and human rights of incarcerated persons.

AB  - A growing coalition of degrowth scholar-activist(s) seeks to transform degrowth into an interdisciplinary and international field bridging a rising network of social and environmental justice movements. We offer constructive decolonial and feminist critiques to foster their productive alliances with multiple feminisms, Indigenous, post-development and pluriversal thought and design (Escobar, 2018), and people on the ground. Our suggested pathway of decolonial transition includes re-situating degrowth relative to the global south and to Indigenous and other resistance movements. We see this decolonial degrowth as a profoundly material strategy of recovery, renewal, and resistance (resurgence) through practices of re-rooting and re-commoning. To illustrate what we mean by resurgence we draw from two examples where people are engaged in ongoing struggles to protect their territories from the impacts of rampant growth-Zapatista and allied Indigenous groups in Mexico, and three Adivasi communities in the Attappady region of southern India. They are building economies and ecologies of resurgence and simultaneous resistance to growth by deterritorialization. We argue that a decolonized degrowth must be what the growth paradigm is not, and imagine what does not yet exist: our separate and collective socio-ecological futures of sufficiency and celebration in the multiple worlds of the pluriverse. Together, the two cases demonstrate pathways to autonomy, sufficiency, and resurgence of territories and worlds, through persistence, innovation, and mobilization of traditional and new knowledges. We offer these as teachers for the transition to decolonial degrowth.

AB  - Background The urgency to pursue sustainable consumption or use energy in a manner that does not negatively impact the environment has become an important theme in recent times. As a major fluctuation in the atmosphere, climate change will be one of the major challenges faced by youth. As a result, there have been a growing number of young South Africans advocating for environmental justice. Surprisingly, their effort has not yielded the expected result as the country continues to emit a high amount of greenhouse gases. The notion of youth may be construed as those between the ages of 15 and 24. The age bracket suggests that the adult lives of this population will be shaped by environmental crises such as famines, vector-borne diseases, and hikes in commodity prices which may impinge on their basic rights to life, health, and property. This development triggers an ancient discourse, what role can youth play towards decarbonization? In other words, which effective avenue could be used by young people for capping emissions? Methods An analysis of South Africa's energy policy documents relevant to sustainability was conducted through the application of desktop research. We use (inter)national instruments and jurisprudence to understand how a state structure, like the judiciary, could nudge the executive to cap rising green gas emissions. South Africa is used as a case study because of its over-reliance on coal for electricity, and how young people could use the existing legal framework to cap rising emissions. Drawing from existing literature, the paper interrogates the lack of activism around climate litigation and under what conditions this pattern could be reversed in South Africa. Results The paper found that while litigation has an important role to play in mitigating climate change, it ought to be complemented with other forms of advocacy. Conclusions The study concludes that given the government's perceived slow steps towards shifting from coal to renewables, youth (who will bear the brunt of high emissions) ought to use both courtrooms and advocacy to trigger political action.

AB  - Although the fields of urban planning and public health share a common origin in the efforts of reformers to tame the ravages of early industrialization in the 19th century, the 2 disciplines parted ways in the early 20th century as planners increasingly focused on the built environment while public health professionals narrowed in on biomedical causes of disease and disability. Among the unfortunate results of this divergence was a tendency to discount the public health implications of planning decisions. Given increasingly complex urban environments and grave health disparities in cities worldwide, urban planners and public health professionals have once again become convinced of the need for inclusive approaches to improve population health and achieve health equity. To make substantive progress, intersectoral collaboration utilizing ecological and systems science perspectives will be crucial as the solutions lie well beyond the control of any single authority. Grounded in the social determinants of health, and with a renewed sense of interconnectedness, dedicated and talented people in government agencies and communities who recognize that our future depends on cultivating local change and evaluating the results can come to grips with the enormous challenge that lies ahead to create more equitable, sustainable, and healthier cities worldwide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern has been expressed in North Carolina that solid waste facilities may be disproportionately located in poor communities and in communities of color, that this represents an environmental injustice, and that solid waste facilities negatively impact the health of host communities. OBJECTIVE: Our goal in this study was to conduct a statewide analysis of the location of solid waste facilities in relation to community race and wealth. METHODS: We used census block groups to obtain racial and economic characteristics, and information on solid waste facilities was abstracted from solid waste facility permit records. We used logistic regression to compute prevalence odds ratios for 2003, and Cox regression to compute hazard ratios of facilities issued permits between 1990 and 2003. RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence odds of a solid waste facility was 2.8 times greater in block groups with a 50% people of color compared with block groups with < 10% people of color, and 1.5 times greater in block groups with median house values < $60,000 compared with block groups with median house values a $100,000. Among block groups that did not have a previously permitted solid waste facility, the adjusted hazard of a new permitted facility was 2.7 times higher in block groups with a 50% people of color compared with block groups with < 10% people of color. CONCLUSION: Solid waste facilities present numerous public health concerns. In North Carolina solid waste facilities are disproportionately located in communities of color and low wealth. In the absence of action to promote environmental justice, the continued need for new facilities could exacerbate this environmental injustice.

AB  - Advocating for healthy environments is a matter of justice. Changes in environments have tremendous impacts on the health of communities, and oftentimes, individuals are unable to safeguard themselves through individual actions alone. Efforts frequently require collective action and are often most effective when led by the communities most impacted. In this spirit, we launched "Vibrations", an African environment photo essay contest. Through funding and publicity, we aimed to support community-led environmental improvement and education initiatives presently taking place on the continent. We received nearly two dozen submissions and selected eight winners. The winners come from five countries (Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa) and have taken on a range of projects aimed at improving environments across a variety of African regions. Projects included efforts to combat pollution, create environmentally conscious school curricula, utilize clean energy sources, and spread awareness about environmental justice concerns in local communities. It is our hope that this report highlights these transformative community-driven efforts, promotes continued conversations on environmental justice in Africa, and encourages meaningful action via policy changes and collaborations throughout the African continent and beyond.

AB  - Background In 2015 alone, community water systems serving about 21 million Americans violated the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (US-EPA) water quality standards. While water at community treatment and distribution centers is regularly monitored and tested, little is known about pollutants in the water systems at the household level. Aims This pilot study assessed the feasibility of (1) testing for the presence and concentration of 14 contaminants and physicochemical parameters in household tap water in a low-income neighborhood and (2) using community engagement for recruitment and citizen science approaches to data collection. Methods We used a multistage approach that included geo-mapping to delineate testing sites, community engagement for recruitment and citizen science approaches to increase the response rate. We used a 14-in-one dipstick test designed to measure trace amounts of heavy metals, non-metallic elements, and physicochemical water properties in drinking water in a sample of 70 homes. Results In 50%, 25%, and 7% of water samples tested, the concentration of mercury, lead, and chromium, respectively, were higher than US-EPA drinking water standards. Citizen science approaches were effective for increasing response rates and low-income household participation in water quality testing. Significance The overlap between poverty, older homes, and high concentrations of potentially toxic metals in drinking water presents concerns for community health. Our pilot community engagement and citizen science approaches are likely scalable and would be of benefit to both the scientific community and to municipalities with constrained budgets. Future studies may examine the role of the principles of environmental justice in the distribution and prevalence of toxic elements in drinking water.

AB  - Airports are often located near densely populated residential areas, affecting a large number of people. Thus, knowing socio-demographic characteristics of the noise-affected areas is important for the development of policies on noise control and abatement. This study proposes a new methodology that combines airport noise models with spatial statistics and geographical information systems to identify spatial clusters of socio-demographic characteristics in relationship to the noise level. Statistically significant 'hot' and 'cold' socio-demographic clusters represent spatial concentrations of certain social groups, corresponding to various levels of vulnerability to environmental impacts. Results show that the population 'paying' for the cost of noise from Logan International Airport in Boston, USA, is highly vulnerable as there are more minority and lower-income populations, and lower house prices in the noise-affected areas. These results should draw the attention of policy-makers and the public as policies for noise abatement are being developed.

AB  - Availability of green amenities in cities often raises environmental justice issues. This study empirically examines Seoul, South Korea, where minority populations, such as foreigners, the poor, the old, the young, and the disabled, are generally increasing but the land area of parks and green spaces is gradually decreasing. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalised least squares (GLS) regression models, this study finds that foreign population is mostly negatively associated with green amenities. The old and the young are positively associated with the green amenities in general but negatively with small and children's parks. Neighbourhood parks do not seem to be associated with concentrations of any minority populations. Findings of this study argue for securing more lands for green amenities in cities and provide lessons to local planning practice.

AB  - Background The World Health Organisation reports that road traffic accidents (accidents) could become the seventh leading cause of death globally by 2030. Accidents often occur in spatial clusters and, generally, there are more accidents in less advantaged areas. Infrastructure changes, such as new roads, can affect the locations and magnitude of accident clusters but evidence of impact is lacking. A new 5-mile motorway extension was opened in 2011 in Glasgow, Scotland. Previous research found no impact on the number of accidents but did not consider their spatial location or socio-economic setting. We evaluated impacts on these, both locally and city-wide. Methods We used STATS19 data covering the period 2008 to 2014 and describing the location and details of all reported accidents involving a personal injury. Poisson-based continuous scan statistics were used to detect spatial clusters of accidents and any change in these over time. Change in the socio-economic distribution of accident cluster locations during the study period was also assessed. Results In each year accidents were strongly clustered, with statistically significant clusters more likely to occur in socio-economically deprived areas. There was no significant shift in the magnitude or location of accident clusters during motorway construction or following opening, either locally or city-wide. There was also no impact on the socio-economic patterning of accident cluster locations. Conclusions Although urban infrastructure changes occur constantly, all around the world, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of such changes on road accident clusters. Despite expectations to the contrary from both proponents and opponents of the M74 extension, we found no beneficial or adverse change in the socio-spatial distribution of accidents associated with its construction, opening or operation. Our approach and findings can help inform urban planning internationally.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change needs to reflect local level priorities. Principles for country ownership of adaptation within the UNFCCC emphasise on infra-state multi-stakeholder engagement. Multilaterally-funded projects therefore embed multi-level stakeholder collaborations (MSCs) into their approaches. MSCs enable integration of diverse stakeholder voices into adaptation decision making. This supports equitable adaptation, as these stakeholders can highlight local level vulnerabilities and addresses adaptation needs. This paper uses a case study of a project in Tanzania administered by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to understand whether multi-stakeholder engagement in MSCs enables infra-state stakeholder influence in adaptation decision making. Social exchange theory is used to understand power and influence in MSC decision-making. Influence is framed as a factor of resources exchanged, organisational and institutional structures, and rules determining stakeholder engagement. Results from interviews with adaptation stakeholders (n = 47) show that most stakeholders perceived governments control of adaptation finance as a country ownership principle acting as enabling disproportionate government influence and exclusion of other stakeholders from adaptation decision making. The projects national level structures and the international level country ownership requirements limited the engagement of non-government and local actors in project design. These findings suggest that in seeking to implement projects that reflect country ownership principles, multilateral finance mechanisms may be reproducing injustices by creating structures that reinforce marginalization and exclusion of local level communities. The research recommends a re-evaluation of approaches for achieving country ownership, e.g. through identification of practical options for direct engagement with non-government and local level actors.

AB  - A range of determinants at multiple socio-ecological levels operate in small farm households' use and handling of hazardous pesticides, suggesting the need for integrated health and agriculture promotion approaches. The aim is to assess changes in health promotion outcomes relevant to highly hazardous pesticide use associated with a multicomponent community program. A longitudinal evaluation design using mixed methods was employed in 18 agricultural communities in Ecuador. Over a 7-month period, health education and agricultural interventions focused upon: health risks associated with hazardous pesticides, more adequate use and handling of pesticides, and better crop management techniques. Data collection included field forms, focus groups, structured observations and repeat surveys. In the qualitative analysis, communities were compared by extent of leadership and involvement with the interventions. For the quantitative analysis, hypothesized paths were constructed including factors relevant to pesticide-related practices and use. Testing involved gender-role stratified (household and crop manager) multivariable regression models. Information on pesticide health impacts and the pesticide use and handling, shared in focus groups, showed substantial improvement, as a result of health promotion activities though people were still observed to engage in risky practices in the field. In path models, community leadership and intervention intensity lead to changes in the household managers' pesticide-related knowledge and practices and to reduction in farm use of hazardous pesticides (both significant, p < 0.05). Integrated, community programs can promote pesticide-related risk reduction among small farm households. Changing practices in the use and management of pesticides among crop managers appears limited by deeper structural and cultural factors.

AB  - Background: Communities with large minority populations often are located near sources of pollution and have higher crime rates, which may work in combination with other factors to influence health. Poor self-rated health is related to chronic health conditions and premature mortality, with minority populations most likely to report poor health. To address how both resident perception of neighborhood environments and chronic health conditions individually and collectively influence health, we examined self-rated health and its association with multiple types of perceived environmental hazards in a majority-Hispanic urban population. Methods: We conducted interviews with 354 residents of Chelsea, Massachusetts, US and asked about self-rated health, perceptions of their neighborhood, including participant-reported environmental hazards (e.g., air quality, odors and noise), aspects of the social environment (e.g., feeling safe, neighborhood crime, social cohesion), and culture-related stressors (e.g., immigration status, language stress, ethnic identity). Log-linear models examined the independent and multivariable associations between these factors and fair/poor self-rated health, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and preexisting health conditions. Results: Forty-one percent of participants reported fair/poor self-rated health. Participants frequently perceived environmental hazards such as problems with pests and regular noise disturbance as well as feeling unsafe. In a multivariable model, a greater number of reported noise disturbances (>= 2 noise sources = 1.53 [1.04-2.26]) and reported insecurity with immigration status (1.66 [1.01-2.73]) were positively associated with fair/poor self-rated health. High social cohesion was inversely associated (0.74 [0.48-1.14]) with fair/poor self-rated health in the multivariable model. Conclusions: Negative perceptions of environmental hazards and reported cultural stressors were significantly associated with fair/poor self-rated health among residents in a low-income majority-minority community, with social cohesion having a beneficial association with self-rated health. Efforts to improve health should recognize the importance of public perceptions of social and environmental hazards found in neighborhood environments, and benefits of strengthening community connections.

AB  - Although environmental problems continue to worsen, the mainstream environmental movement seems to be losing strength. Part of this declination rests on the movement's historical roots in and elevation of conservation, preservation, and wilderness protection as the headlining goals of environmentalism. These goals were promoted at the expense of other perhaps more popular motivators such as health ecology and environmental justice. In addition, such goals have not taken seriously the deleterious effects of environmental contamination on women, the poor, people of color, and residents of urban areas. Despite a somewhat diverse history, the mainstream environmental movement chose to most vigorously promote the protection of wild species and places, utilized a very limited understanding of the term 'environment' and has not promulgated a way of dealing with environmental destruction's concomitant shame. Taken together, these failings could be part of the movement's waning social significance. Beginning with an historical investigation of health ecology and environmental justice, this paper argues that the mainstream movement could be reinvigorated by contemporaneous attention to health ecology, environmental justice, and ecological restoration, all of which remain on the borders of the movement, and all of which have ample precedent within the sidelined history of American environmentalism.

AB  - Air pollution has been shown to have adverse effects on many health outcomes including respiratory effects, cardiovascular effects, and mortality. However, evidence on the effects of prenatal exposure is still limited. We investigate the causal impact of prenatal exposure to air pollution on neonatal health in Italy in the 2000s. We exploit variation in rainfall shocks to instrument for non-random air pollution exposure. Our empirical setting combines detailed information on mother's residential location from birth certificates with PM10 concentrations from air pollution monitors. Ten additional units in the average PM10 level (approximately one standard deviation) would decrease birth weight by about 0.5% and gestational age by 0.16%; it would increase the prevalence of low birth weight by 22% and of preterm birth by 16%. The effects are stronger in magnitude for third trimester exposure and for less educated mothers. These findings suggest that the health impacts of air pollution on newborns are unequally distributed in the population.

AB  - Background In March 2016, citizens of Merrimack, New Hampshire, learned that their public water supply was contaminated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A subsequent state-led investigation revealed widespread contamination of both public and private well water with PFOA and several related chemicals, broadly termed per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This research examines the local response to PFAS contamination of the public water system and well water in Merrimack and the results from the health survey administered by a local advocacy group, Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water (MCFCW). Methods MCFCW designed and implemented a community health survey (n = 596) representing 213 households exposed to PFAS through drinking water. The surveys were conducted in the summer of 2017. Respondents used an online survey platform to report demographic information, exposure sources, and health conditions. Logistic regression was used to analyze the community-based health survey results . Results There were several important associations that warrant further investigation and more immediate attention, especially: 1) elevated incidence of developmental, autoimmune and kidney disorders among those under 18 years of age; 2) elevated levels of health concerns, multiple health concerns, autoimmune disorders, and reproductive disorders among women, 3) elevated levels of health concerns, multiple health conditions, cardiovascular, respiratory, reproductive, and liver disorders in those with industrial occupational exposures, and; 4) elevated incidence of health concerns, cardiovascular, and developmental disorders among those who have been living in Merrimack for a long time versus newer residents. Conclusions The limitations inherent in the study design warrant caution in interpreting the results, however the associations found in this study merit further investigation. This health survey highlights foremost the critical gap in information-lack of access to blood testing, medical monitoring and physician guidance of PFAS-exposed residents. This study provides a model for conducting community-based health studies to advocate for pathways to state supported biomonitoring and medical monitoring for those exposed to industrial toxins and to take into consideration the human health burden in shaping the future of chemical regulation.

AB  - A senior American specialist on China and noted geographer evaluates the merits of an essay by an equally prominent specialist who advocates reflexive activism as a method designed to generate more relevant studies of the country. The author of the evaluation stresses the value of empirically based work, noting a number of contributions by geographers to the study of China's transition from doctrinaire communism to "socialism with Chinese characteristics." While not denying the need for geographical research focused on deficiencies in social and environmental justice, he is not in favor of excessive activism that may overlook advances in economic development and related accomplishments of China's governing regime.

AB  - A ghetto land pedagogy begins with two axioms that align it with land education more broadly, and that distinguish it from the general umbrella of environmental education. First, ghetto colonialism is a specialization of settler colonialism. Second, land justice requires decolonization, not just environmental justice. A ghetto land pedagogy thus attends to an analysis of settler colonialism, offers a critique of settler environmentalism, and forwards a decolonizing cartography as a method for land education. This article discusses storied land' as a critical cartographic method for land education, illustrated through a discussion of land in the San Francisco Bay Area.

AB  - A land use regression (LUR) model for the mapping of NO2 concentrations in Ottawa, Canada was created based on data from 29 passive air quality samplers from the City of Ottawa's National Capital Air Quality Mapping Project and two permanent stations. Model sensitivity was assessed against three spatial representations of population: population at the dissemination area level, population at the dissemination block level and a dasymetrically derived population representation. A spatial database with land use, roads, population, zoning, greenspaces and elevation was created. Polycategorical zoning data were used in dasymetric mapping to spatially focus population data derived from the dissemination blocks to a sub-block level for comparison purposes. Dasymetric population mapping provided no significant LUR model improvement in explained variance when compared to block level population; however, both the former were significantly better than the dissemination area level population representations. However, where block level population is not available or too costly to acquire, our method using polycategorical zoning data provides a viable alternative in LUR modelling endeavours.

AB  - Although South Korea introduced the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register system in 1996, there is relatively limited evidence on how socioeconomic status at both individual and municipal levels is associated with exposure to toxic chemicals in Korea because of limited data sources. Using a multi-level negative binomial model, this study examined the socioeconomic status of both individuals and municipalities with a higher level of exposure to carcinogenic emissions from industrial facilities in Gyeonggi province, South Korea. The results reveal that economic minority individuals (national basic livelihood security recipients, unemployed people, and tenants), municipalities with higher percentages of industrial land use, and foreign-born populations had more facilities that produce carcinogenic emissions. While similar findings have been reported by many environmental justice studies conducted in other countries, this is the first Korean case study that reports the relationship between socioeconomic status at both individual and municipal levels and exposure to toxic chemicals.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the most significant environmental hazards. The elderly, young, and poor are more vulnerable to air pollution. The risk of air pollution was assessed based on the risk framework published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in terms of three aspects: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. This study determined the concentrations of hazardous pollutants using satellite images from 2015 at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. In addition, the study identified vulnerable groups who are exposed to hazardous air pollutants. The study highlighted the degree of vulnerability based on environmental sensitivity and institutional abilities, such as mitigation and social adaption policies, using statistical data. Based on the results, Seoul City and Gyeonggi Province have low air pollution risk owing to good institutional abilities, while the western coastal area has the highest air pollution risk. Three adaption pathway scenarios were assessed in terms of the effect of increases in the budget for social adaptation policies on the level of risk. The study found that the risk can be reduced when the social adaptation budget of 2015 base level is increased by 20% in Gyeonggi Province and by 30% in the western coastal area. In conclusion, this risk assessment can support policy-making to target more vulnerable groups based on scientific evidence and to ensure environmental justice at the national level.

AB  - As the earth's climate begins to shift into a hotter and less predictable period, there is a basic injustice in who will suffer worst and first. Nations facing rising oceans and drought are those least responsible for the problem, and they have the least resources to cope with them. To evaluate claims of environmental injustice, we examine three cases where the first signs of climate change are being felt worst and first: murderous flooding from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, rising sea levels swamping entire Pacific Island atoll nations, and devastation from flooding among squatter settlements in Mozambique. In each case these nations are suffering not only because of bad geography or management. Rather, because of their colonial past and current positions in the world economy, they are brutally vulnerable to forces outside their control. We conclude by offering an explanation for generalized mistrust among Southern nations vis-a-vis Northern nations and the Kyoto treaty.

AB  - Background: Aerobic exercise is recommended to improve health. However, the increased ventilation might increase the doses of inhaled air pollutants, negating the health benefits in highly polluted areas. Our objective was to estimate the inhaled dose of air pollutants during two simulated exercise sessions at cleanest and dirtiest cities reported by World Health Organization (WHO) considering air quality. Methods: Minute ventilation data were extracted from laboratory-based exercise of 116 incremental running tests and used to calculate total ventilation of a hypothetical 30-min moderate continuous exercise routine. Afterwards, total ventilation values were combined with particulate matter (PM) data reported by the WHO for the 10 cleanest and 10 dirtiest cities, to calculate inhaled doses and the relative risk of all-cause mortality by exercising in different air pollution concentrations. Findings: The dirtiest cities are located at less developed countries compared to cleanest cities. The inhaled dose of PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly higher in the dirtiest cities compared to the cleanest cities at rest and exercise, and significantly higher during exercise compared to the rest at dirtiest cities. The relative risk of all-cause mortality analysis showed that, while exercise in the cleanest cities improved health benefits throughout up to 90 min, there were no further health benefits after 15 min of exercise in the dirtiest cities, and the air pollution health risks surpassed the exercise benefits after 75 min. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that a traditional 30-min of moderate aerobic exercise session might induce inhalation of high levels of pollutants when performed at dirtiest cities. Considering several adverse health effects from air pollutants inhalation, so the results suggest that the air pollution levels of the cities should be taken into account for physical exercise recommendations.

AB  - A significant body of previous research on environmental justice has demonstrated a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards on low-income and minority residents. In this paper we evaluate spatially indexed data on estimated respiratory and cancer risks associated with exposures to ambient air toxics to show that children of color in the Los Angeles Unified School District suffer potentially disparate health impacts, and that disparities in environmental risks may be associated with diminished school performance-even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic covariates that generally explain much of the variation in student scores. Remediating environmental health risks in distressed neighborhoods could, therefore, improve both health and human capital.

AB  - Background Ambient air pollution is well known to cause inflammatory change in respiratory epithelium and is associated with exacerbations of inflammatory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, limited work has been done on the impact of air pollution on pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis and there are no reports in the literature of how pollutant exposure may impact sinonasal histopathology in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Objective This study aims to identify associations between certain histopathologic characteristics seen in sinus tissue of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and levels of particulate air pollution (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone in their place of residence. Methods A structured histopathology report was created to characterize the tissues of CRS patients undergoing sinus surgery. An estimate for each patient's exposure to air pollutants including small particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone was obtained using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool (EJSCREEN). Mean pollutant exposures for patients whose tissues exhibited varying histopathologic features were compared using logistic regression models. Results Data from 291 CRS patients were analyzed. Higher degree of inflammation was significantly associated with increased ozone exposure (p = 0.031). Amongst the patients with CRSwNP (n=131), presence of eosinophilic aggregates (p = 0.018) and Charcot-Leyden crystals (p = 0.036) was associated with increased ozone exposure. Conclusion Exposure to ambient air pollutants may contribute to pathogenesis of CRS. Increasing ozone exposure was linked to both higher tissue inflammation and presence of eosinophilic aggregates and Charcot-Leyden crystals in CRSwNP patients.

AB  - A declared need is around for geoinformatic surveillance statistical science and software infrastructure for spatial and spatiotemporal hotspot detection. Hotspot means something unusual, anomaly, aberration, outbreak, elevated cluster, critical resource area, etc. The declared need may be for monitoring, etiology, management, or early warning. The responsible factors may be natural, accidental, or intentional. This proof-of-concept paper suggests methods and tools for hotspot detection across geographic regions and across networks. The investigation proposes development of statistical methods and tools that have immediate potential for use in critical societal areas, such as public health and disease surveillance, ecosystem health, water resources and water services, transportation networks, persistent poverty typologies and trajectories, environmental justice, biosurveillance and biosecurity, among others. We introduce, for multidisciplinary use, an innovation of the health-area-popular circle-based spatial and spatiotemporal scan statistic. Our innovation employs the notion of an upper level set, and is accordingly called the upper level set scan statistic, pointing to a sophisticated analytical and computational system as the next generation of the present day popular SaTScan. Success of surveillance rests on potential elevated cluster detection capability. But the clusters can be of any shape, and cannot be captured only by circles. This is likely to give more of false alarms and more of false sense of security. What we need is capability to detect arbitrarily shaped clusters. The proposed upper level set scan statistic innovation is expected to fill this need.

AB  - Background Most U.S. studies that report racial/ethnic disparities in increased risk of low birth weight associated with air pollution exposures have been conducted in California or northeastern states and/or urban areas, limiting generalizability of study results. Few of these studies have examined maternal racial/ethnic groups other than Non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White and Hispanic, nor have they included paternal race. We aimed to examine the independent effects of PM2.5 on birth weight among a nationally representative sample of U.S. singleton infants and how both maternal and paternal race/ethnicity modify relationships between prenatal PM2.5 exposures and birth outcomes. Methods We used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a longitudinal nationally representative cohort of 10,700 U.S. children born in 2001, which we linked to U.S.EPA's Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ)-derived predicted daily PM2.5 concentrations at the centroid of each Census Bureau Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for maternal residences. We examined relationships between term birthweight (TBW)(,) term low birthweight rate (TLBW) and gestational PM2.5 pollutant using multivariate regression models. Effect modification of air pollution exposures on birth outcomes by maternal and paternal race was evaluated using stratified models. All analyses were conducted with sample weights to provide national-scale estimates. Results The majority of mothers were White (61%). Fourteen percent of mothers identified as Black, 21% as Hispanic, 3% Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) and 1% American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN). Fathers were also racially/ethnically diverse with 55% identified as White Non-Hispanic, 10% as Black Non-Hispanic, 19% as Hispanic, 3% as AAPI and 1% as AIAN. Results from the chi-square and ANOVA tests of significance for racial/ethnic differences indicate disparities in prenatal exposures and birth outcomes by both maternal and paternal race/ethnicity. Prenatal PM2.5 was associated with reduced birthweights during second and third trimester and over the entire gestational period in adjusted regression models, although results did not reach statistical significance. In models stratified by maternal race and paternal race, one unit increase in PM2.5 was statistically significantly associated with lower birthweights among AAPI mothers, -5.6 g (95% CI:-10.3, -1.0 g) and AAPI fathers, -7.6 g (95% CI: -13.1, -2.1 g) during 3(rd) trimester and among births where father's race was not reported, -14.2 g (95% CI: -24.0, -4.4 g). Conclusions These data suggest that paternal characteristics should be used, in addition to maternal characteristics, to describe the risks of adverse birth outcomes. Additionally, our study suggests that serious consideration should be given to investigating environmental and social mechanisms, such as air pollution exposures, as potential contributors to disparities in birth outcomes among AAPI populations.

AB  - A multitude of studies have demonstrated that individual circumstances throughout life influence subsequent health and well-being outcomes. The life-course perspective emphasises that health is affected by the accumulation of social and economic (dis)advantages over an individual's life but, importantly, also that there can be critical periods where the effects of exposure can be greater. Yet few researchers have applied a life-course perspective to the study of health and place, which has resulted in a partial understanding of the dynamics of person-health-place relations. By explicitly recognising that places are spatial-temporal products, and applying a novel longitudinal life-course approach, this study examines the opportunities for incorporating aspects of place into a life-course framework. The focus is the influence of neighbourhood social deprivation and provision of local green space on mental health (particularly anxiety and depression). Historical and contemporary place-based information from the Lothian region of Scotland is combined with data from a cohort of individuals born in 1936 (the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936) to consider the influence of these environmental factors over the life course on mental health outcomes later in life. The results establish the utility of the life course of place approach, and demonstrate how this concept can be operationalised using historical data sources. The findings suggest that, after adjustment, residing in the most socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods in childhood was detrimental to mental health outcomes at age 70. Further, green space provision in early life environments is related to mental health outcomes in later life, but any effect may be restricted to those residing in socially disadvantaged places, and dependent on the specific mental health outcome being considered. The findings emphasise the potential of the life course of place approach for enhancing the evidence base considering the relationships between health and place.

AB  - Addressing environmental governance conflicts requires the adoption of a complexity approach to carry out an adaptive process of collective learning, exploration, and experimentation. In this article, we hypothesize that by integrating community-based participatory mapping processes with internet-based collaborative digital mapping technologies, it is possible to create tools and spaces for knowledge co-production and collective learning. We also argue that providing a collaborative web platform enables these projects to become a repository of activist knowledge and practices that are often poorly stored and barely shared across communities and organizations. The collaborative Webmap ofWater Conflicts in Andalusia, Spain, is used to show the benefits and potential of mapping processes of this type. The article sets out the steps and methods used to develop this experience: (i) background check; (ii) team discussion and draft proposal; (iii) in-depth interviews, and (iv) integrated participative and collaborative mapping approach. The main challenge that had to be addressed during this process was to co-create a tool able to combine the two perspectives that construct the identity of integrated mapping: a data-information-knowledge co-production process that is useful for the social agents-the environmental activists-while also sufficiently categorizable and precise to enable the competent administrations to steer their water management.

AB  - Background: Epistemological biases in environmental epidemiology prevent the full understanding of how racism's societal impacts directly influence health outcomes. With the ability to focus on "place" and the totality of environmental exposures, environmental epidemiologists have an important opportunity to advance the field by proactively investigating the structural racist forces that drive disparities in health. Objective: This commentary illustrates how environmental epidemiology has ignored racism for too long. Some examples from environmental health and male infertility are used to illustrate how failing to address racism neglects the health of entire populations. Discussion: While research on environmental justice has attended to the structural sources of environmental racism, this work has not been fully integrated into the mainstream of environmental epidemiology. Epidemiology's dominant paradigm that reduces race to a mere data point avoids the social dimensions of health and thus fails to improve population health for all. Failing to include populations who are Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in health research means researchers actually know very little about the effect of environmental contaminants on a range of population health outcomes. This commentary offers different practical solutions, such as naming racism in research, including BIPOC in leadership positions, mandating requirements for discussing "race", conducting far more holistic analyses, increasing community participation in research, and improving racism training, to address the myriad of ways in which structural racism permeates environmental epidemiology questions, methods, results and impacts.

AB  - Although 'environmental justice' is an increasingly important issue for policy makers and researchers, it remains for many a vague and abstract notion that is hard to define in practical, real-world terms. Part of the problem is that environmental justice is a complex, multidimensional construct that cannot easily be defined. Our aim in this article is to identify fundamental dimensions of environmental justice and highlight the resulting questions that are an inherent part of putting principles into practice. We argue that to have a constructive and informed debate about this emotionally charged topic, it is necessary to have a clear and workable definition of environmental justice. We do not propose our own definition, but instead point out that there are many possible legitimate definitions depending on one's beliefs, opinions, and values. The central point is not that a particular definition is right or wrong, but rather that choosing a definition has distinct implications for the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of both policy and science. These critical choices should be made explicit so that public dialogue can focus on the substance of this important policy issue.

AB  - Background Residential greenness has been associated with health benefits, such as lower risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, obesity, adverse birth outcomes and asthma and better psychological health. However, the variation in greenness across socioeconomic and demographic characteristics in urban areas of Canada has not been well documented. Data and methods Respondents to the 2016 Census long-form questionnaire were assigned estimates of exposure to residential greenness based on the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (from 2012 or the most recent year available) within a 500 m buffer around their home, based on postal code. Census weights were used to determine differences in average exposure to greenness according to selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results Mean residential greenness among the 5.3 million census respondents in urban Canada was 0.44 units of the NDVI (standard deviation = 0.18 units). Greenness was lower among immigrants (particularly recent immigrants), some groups designated as visible minorities (particularly people of Filipino ancestry), lower-income households and tenants (i.e., NDVI values ranging from 0.40 to 0.43 units). Greenness values were highest among White non-immigrants and higher-income households (i.e., NDVI values ranging from 0.46 to 0.47 units). Interpretation Given the potentially multifaceted role that greenness plays in health outcomes, the inequalities in residential greenness described here may contribute to producing or exacerbating existing health inequalities in the Canadian population.

AB  - Background: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with a greater risk of non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Canada. Research based on Canadian cohorts suggests that exposure to PM2.5 varies by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Studies of NO2, another pollutant, indicate that persons of lower socioeconomic status and some visible minority groups have greater exposure in urban centres. Data and methods: National residential PM2.5 was estimated from a similar to 1 km(2) spatial layer for respondents to the 2006 Census long-form questionnaire. Weighted PM2.5 estimates from personal-level estimates were determined for white, Aboriginal, visible minority and immigrant populations, as well as for socioeconomic groups (household income, educational attainment) and stratified by urban core, urban fringe and rural residence. Descriptive statistics were provided for selected comparisons. Results: In Canada, PM2.5 exposure was 1.61 mu g/m(3) higher for visible minority (versus white) populations, and 1.55 mu g/m(3) higher for immigrants (versus non-immigrants). When the relatively high percentages of these groups in large cities were taken into account, exposure differences in urban cores were much smaller. Exposure among urban immigrants did not decrease substantially with time since immigration (< 0.5 mu g/m(3) between any two years). In urban cores, residents of low-income households had marginally higher exposure (0.56 mu g/m(3)) than did people who were not in low-income households. Interpretation: Differences between specific population groups in exposure to PM2.5 are due, at least in part, to higher percentages of these groups living in urban cores where air pollution levels are elevated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates, politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators. in the United States as well as in other countries) across major political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical problems with the value-free ideal. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives are to discuss the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free ideal. DISCUSSION: We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises questions about the relationship between methodological and practical standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods, and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation, adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general public on issues of environmental knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Reflecting on the aims of regulatory science-such as protecting human health and the environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities of environmental justice and Indigenous communities-can clarify when values have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

AB  - Air pollution is the cause of many health problems. In cities, combustion vehicles are a major contributor to emissions of key air pollutants. While many studies have focused on populations exposed to pollutants and the resulting environmental and social inequalities, few compare exposures and contributions. In this research, the population of the House-hold Travel Survey of the Paris region is studied by confronting two elements: the average individual exposure to NO2 during an average working day and the average traffic NOx emitted during a day by the motorized trips for each res-ident surveyed. The dynamic exposure to NO2 of each resident is estimated according to activities in an average working day. The results confirm an environmental inequality according to the place of residence: on average, the center residents contribute little to pollutant emissions but are highly exposed. Some categories of the population, including women and the socially disadvantaged, are the most affected by these inequalities.

AB  - Background: Differential exposure to environmental hazards is one component of the social gradient in health. Few studies have investigated the association between socioeconomic characteristics and environmental hazards in a Canadian context. We assessed the relationships between pollution emissions and socio-economic characteristics for 27 municipalities on Montreal Island. Methods: Pollution emissions were determined using Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) for the periods 1995-1996 and 2000-2001. Variables included the number of reporting industries, the average annual releases, and the average annual releases density. These data were cross-referenced with socio-economic data from the 1996 and 2001 Canadian Censuses, respectively. Results: For both periods, pollution measures were inversely related to the average monthly amount of owners' major payments, the average income of households, the proportion of workers in the tertiary sector, and the proportion of individuals with a university education. Pollution measures were positively associated with the unemployment rate, the proportion of workers in the secondary sector, and the proportion of individuals with less than high school education. Conclusion: Socio-economic characteristics are associated with municipal-level pollution emissions on Montreal Island. Whether higher emissions are indicative of higher pollution exposure requires further investigation.

AB  - Across the United States, recreational freshwater fisheries are not only an important leisure activity, but can also provide a relatively inexpensive source of protein in local diets. However, recreational freshwater fisheries are generally not well-monitored in terms of fish consumption vs. catch and release, nor are all recreational surface waters regularly monitored for the presence of potentially harmful contaminants in water or fishes. In six urban lakes that support recreational fisheries in Phoenix, Arizona, a majority of surveyed anglers reported eating recreationally caught fishes, even though they thought the water might be polluted. Surface water samples collected from the six urban recreational fishery lakes showed varying levels of organic contaminants, including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phthalates. As many Phoenix urban recreational fisheries lakes and ponds are located in low income and high minority neighborhoods, the results of this pilot study could be used to inform urban fisheries management and other agencies of the potential need for fish consumption advisories, inform actions to improve water quality in urban lakes and ponds that support urban fisheries, and support further research and monitoring, in order to reduce potential risks to public health.

AB  - Background The transition from family tobacco production to dependence on hired labor has placed migrant and seasonal farmworkers (MSF) at risk for green tobacco sickness (GTS). No previous studies of GTS have focused on MSF: Methods One hundred and forty-four Hispanic MSF working in tobacco production in North Carolina were surveyed to obtain self-reports of GTS, preventive behaviors, and treatments. Results Forty-one percent reported having GTS at least once during the summer Most had taken no precautions to prevent GTS. Ninety-six percent of those with GTS had tried to treat it. Antinausea medications were the most common treatments. Only 9% sought medical treatment; 7% lost work time. Conclusions The incidence of GTS obtained by interviewing MSF is much higher than that in other studies, which have relied on rates of medical treatment or farmers' reports for their workers. MSF constitute a population at risk for GTS who have little control over work conditions to prevent GTS or seek treatment. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: Immigrant farmworkers are a population at risk for numerous environmental and occupational exposures. The metals arsenic, lead. mercury, and cadmium are known neurotoxins to which workers can be exposed both in the US and in their country of origin. Because farmworkers are exposed to neurotoxic pesticides, they may be at risk for adverse health effects from the combined exposure. Objectives: To examine the relationship between exposure to metals, as measured in urine, with personal and work-related characteristics of Mexican migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the US. Methods: We analyzed data on metals found in urine of 258 farmworkers recruited from 44 camps in eastern North Carolina in 2007. Geometric means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to compare data with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used multivariate regression models fitted for each metal to estimate the association of creatinine-corrected urinary metals and worker characteristics related to environmental and occupational exposures. Results: Geometric mean urinary metals concentrations (mu g/g creatinine) exceeded NHANES reference values for arsenic (13.23 [CI 11.11, 15.35] vs. 8.55 [CI 7.23, 9.86]) and lead (1.26 [CI 1.08,1.43] vs. 0.63 [CI 0.60, 0.66]). Age, being from the central region of Mexico, and pack years of cigarette smoking were significant predictors of metals exposure; being a current smoker and years worked in US agriculture were not. Conclusions: This first study to examine indicators of worker body burdens of metals shows that workers have body burdens related to exposures other than work in the US. Further research should address their risk for adverse health outcomes due to combined exposures to neurotoxins in pesticides. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - At US-Mexico border Ports of Entry, vehicles idle for long times waiting to cross northbound into the US. Long wait times at the border have mainly been studied as an economic issue, however, exposures to emissions from idling vehicles can also present an exposure risk. Here we present the first data on in-vehicle exposures to driver and passengers crossing the US-Mexico border at the San Ysidro, California Port of Entry (SYPOE). Participants were recruited who regularly commuted across the border in either direction and told to drive a scripted route between two border universities, one in the US and one in Mexico. Instruments were placed in participants' cars prior to commute to monitor-1-minute average levels of the traffic pollutants ultrafine particles (UFP), black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the breathing zone of drivers and passengers. Location was determined by a GPS monitor. Results reported here are for 68 northbound participant trips. The highest median levels of in-vehicle UFP were recorded during the wait to cross at the SYPOE (median 29,692 particles/cm(3)) significantly higher than the portion of the commute in the US (median 20,508 particles/cm(3)) though not that portion in Mexico (median 22, 191 particles/cm(3)). In-vehicle BC levels at the border were significantly lower than in other parts of the commute. Our results indicate that waiting in line at the SYPOE contributes a median 62.5% (range 15.5%-86.0%) of a cross-border commuter's exposure to UFP and a median 44.5% (range (10.6-79.7%) of exposure to BC inside the vehicle while traveling in the northbound direction. Reducing border wait time can significantly reduce in-vehicle exposures to toxic air pollutants such as UFP and BC, and these preventable exposures can be considered an environmental justice issue.

AB  - Background: Exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with adverse health effects. Previous studies have indicated higher levels of air pollution in socially deprived areas. Aim: To investigate associations between air pollution and socio-demographic variables, comorbidity, stress, and green space at the residence in Denmark. Methods: We included 2,237,346 persons living in Denmark, aged 35 years or older in 2017. We used the high resolution, multi-scale DEHM/UBM/AirGIS air pollution modelling system to calculate mean concentrations of air pollution with PM2.5, elemental carbon, ultrafine particles and NO2 at residences held the preceding five years. We used nationwide registries to retrieve information about socio-demographic indicators at the individual and neighborhood levels. We used general linear regression models to analyze associations between sociodemographic indicators and air pollution at the residence. Results: Individuals with high SES (income, higher white-collar worker and high educational level) and of nonDanish origin were exposed to higher levels of air pollution than individuals of low SES and of Danish origin, respectively. We found comparable levels of air pollution according to sex, stress events and morbidity. For neighborhood level SES indicators, we found high air pollution levels in neighborhoods with low SES measured as proportion of social housing, sole providers, low income and unemployment. In contrast, we found higher air pollution levels in neighborhoods with higher educational level and a low proportion of manual labor. People living in an apartment and/or with little green space had higher air pollution levels. Conclusion: In Denmark, high levels of residential air pollution were associated with higher individual SES and non-Danish origin. For neighborhood-level indicators of SES, no consistent pattern was observed. These results highlight the need for analyzing many different socio-demographic indicators to understand the complex associations between SES and exposure to air pollution.

AB  - Background: Environmental exposures play a critical role in the genesis of some child mental health problems. Methods: We open with a discussion of children's vulnerability to neurotoxic substances, changes in the distribution of toxic exposures, and cooccurrence of social and physical exposures. We address trends in prevalence of mental health disorders, and approaches to the definition of disorders that are sensitive to the subtle effects of toxic exposures. We suggest broadening outcomes to include dimensional measures of autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and child learning capacity, as well as direct assessment of brain function. Findings: We consider the impact of two important exposures on children's mental health: lead and pesticides. We argue that longitudinal research designs may capture the cascading effects of exposures across biological systems and the full-range of neuropsychological endpoints. Neuroimaging is a valuable tool for observing brain maturation under varying environmental conditions. A dimensional approach to measurement may be sensitive to subtle subclinical toxic effects, permitting the development of exposure-related profiles and testing of complex functional relationships between brain and behavior. Questions about the neurotoxic effects of chemicals become more pressing when viewed through the lens of environmental justice. Conclusions: Reduction in the burden of child mental health disorders will require longitudinal study of neurotoxic exposures, incorporating dimensional approaches to outcome assessment, and measures of brain function. Research that seeks to identify links between toxic exposures and mental health outcomes has enormous public health and societal value.

AB  - Background The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently sets maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for ten metals or metalloids in public drinking water systems. Our objective was to estimate metal concentrations in community water systems (CWSs) across the USA, to establish if sociodemographic or regional inequalities in the metal concentrations exist, and to identify patterns of concentrations for these metals as a mixture. Methods We evaluated routine compliance monitoring records for antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, selenium, thallium, and uranium, collected from 2006-11 (2000-11 for uranium; timeframe based on compliance monitoring requirements) by the US EPA in support of their second and third Six-Year Reviews for CWSs. Arsenic, barium, chromium, selenium, and uranium (detectable in >10% records) were included in the main analyses (subgroup and metal mixture analyses; arsenic data reported previously). We compared the mean, 75th percentile, and 95th percentile contaminant concentrations and the percentage of CWSs with concentrations exceeding the MCL across subgroups (region, sociodemographic county-cluster, size of population served, source water type, and CWSs exclusively serving correctional facilities). We evaluated patterns in CWS metal concentration estimate profiles via hierarchical cluster analysis. We created an online interactive map and dashboard of estimated CWS metal concentrations for use in future analyses. Findings Average metal concentrations were available for a total of 37 915 CWSs across the USA. The total number of monitoring records available was approximately 297 000 for arsenic, 165 000 for barium, 167 000 for chromium, 165 000 for selenium, and 128 000 for uranium. The percentage of analysed CWSs with average concentrations exceeding the MCL was 2.6% for arsenic (MCL=10 mu g/L; nationwide mean 1.77 mu g/L; n=36 798 CWSs), 2.1% for uranium (MCL=30 mu g/L; nationwide mean 4.37 mu g/L; n=14 503 CWSs), and less than 0.1% for the other metals. The number of records with detections was highest for uranium (63.1%). 75th and 95th percentile concentrations for uranium, chromium, barium, and selenium were highest for CWSs serving Semi-Urban, Hispanic communities, CWSs reliant on groundwater, and CWSs in the Central Midwest. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two distinct clusters: an arsenic-uranium-selenium cluster and a barium-chromium cluster. Interpretations Uranium is an under-recognised contaminant in CWSs. Metal concentrations (including uranium) are elevated in CWSs serving Semi-Urban, Hispanic communities independent of location or region, highlighting environmental justice concerns.

AB  - Background: Age-friendly environments promote healthy and active aging by building and maintaining capacity across the life course and allowing people who have a loss of capacity to continue engaging in activities that they value. Existing research demonstrates that municipalities are conducting age-friendly assessments worldwide. Purpose: The current study aims to create a rich description of older adults? experiences with outdoor spaces, buildings, and transportation as part of an age-friendly assessment. Method: A qualitative interpretive meta-synthesis (QIMS) was conducted to increase the number of studies eligible for analysis by allowing the inclusion of several existing qualitative studies from several countries. The QIMS included a systematic sampling and data analysis (i.e., theme extraction, theme synthesis, and methodological reduction) procedures and establishment of evidence credibility. Results: The themes that emerged regarding older adults? experiences with outdoor space and buildings included 1) accessibility and 2) appropriate infrastructure. Regarding transportation, the theme of accessibility included subthemes of 1) availability and 2) affordability. Further reduction indicated that age-friendliness could be conceptualized as an environmental justice (EJ) issue. Conclusions: The three areas of EJ (i.e., distributional justice, procedural justice, and recognition) provide a helpful framework to guide the systematic documentation and evaluation of agefriendly community efforts. Moreover, interprofessional collaborations are needed to address transportation equity and inclusion better.

AB  - A sustainable community seeks to protect and enhance the environment, meet social needs, and promote economic success. On average, local governments lack meaningfully connecting their environmental and economic sustainability efforts to equity and social justice. Community-based organizations (CBOs) have emerged as local leaders with a growing capacity for pursuing community sustainability. Based on data from a national survey National Community Action Partnership member organizations, this study explores (1) how CBO leaders define sustainable communities; (2) how important each of the three pillars of sustainability are to their mission; and (3) with what organizations do CBOs collaborate in their pursuit of sustainable communities. A content analysis of responses to an open-ended query to define sustainable communities revealed a significant focus on the social equity pillar of sustainability which is closely linked to economic sustainability. Similarly, CBO leaders ranked social equity and economic sustainability as the highest priority for their core mission. Lastly, CBO leaders heavily engaged in local collaboration in their sustainable community efforts. Therefore, serious pursuit of sustainable cities and communities must shift from a go-at-it-alone, centralized government approach to more inclusive, collaborative efforts that take advantage of the economic-social equity sustainability focus of CBOs in both planning and implementation.

AB  - Background: Multiple lines of evidence have associated exposure to ambient air pollution with an increased risk of respiratory malignancies. However, there is a dearth of evidence from low-middle income countries, including those within South America, where the social inequalities are more marked. Objectives: To quantify the association between exposures to traffic related air pollution and respiratory cancer incidence and mortality within Sao Paulo, Brazil. Further, we aim to investigate the role of socioeconomic status (SES) upon these outcomes. Methods: Cancer incidence between 2002 and 2011 was derived from the population-based cancer registry. Mortality data (between 2002 and 2013) was derived from the Municipal Health Department. A traffic density database and an annual nitrogen dioxide (NO2) land use regression model were used as markers of exposure. Age-adjusted Binomial Negative Regression models were developed, stratifying by SES and gender. Results: We observed an increased rate of respiratory cancer incidence and mortality in association with increased traffic density and NO2 concentrations, which was higher among those regions with the lowest SES. For cancer mortality and traffic exposure, those in the most deprived region, had an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 2.19 (95% CI: 1.70, 2.82) when comparing the highest exposure centile (top 90%) to the lowest (lowest 25%). By contrast, in the least deprived area, the IRR for the same exposure contrast was.1.07 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.20). For NO2 in the most deprived regions, the IRR for cancer mortality in the highest exposed group was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.88) while in the least deprived area, the IRR for the highest exposed group was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.23). Conclusions: Traffic density and NO2 were associated with an increased rate of respiratory cancer incidence and mortality in Sao Paulo. Residents from poor regions may suffer more from the impact of traffic air pollution.

AB  - Air pollution can increase mortality risk and may also exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities in health outcomes. This New Zealand study investigated whether exposure to particulate air pollution (PM10) was associated with mortality and health inequalities. Annual mean PM10 estimates for urban Census Area Units (CAUs) were linked to cause-specific mortality data. A dose-response relationship was found between PM10 and respiratory disease mortality, including at concentrations below the existing annual average guideline value of 20 mu g m(-3). Establishing and enforcing a lower guideline value is likely to have population health benefits. However, socioeconomic inequalities in respiratory disease mortality were not significantly elevated with PM10 exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Environmental disparities may underlie the unequal distribution of health across socioeconomic groups. However, this assertion has not been tested across a range of countries: an important knowledge gap for a transboundary health issue such as air pollution. We consider whether populations of low-income European regions were a) exposed to disproportionately high levels of particulate air pollution (PM10) and/or b) disproportionately susceptible to pollution-related mortality effects. Methods: Europe-wide gridded PM10 and population distribution data were used to calculate population-weighted average PM10 concentrations for 268 sub-national regions (NUTS level 2 regions) for the period 2004-2008. The data were mapped, and patterning by mean household income was assessed statistically. Ordinary least squares regression was used to model the association between PM10 and cause-specific mortality, after adjusting for regional-level household income and smoking rates. Results: Air quality improved for most regions between 2004 and 2008, although large differences between Eastern and Western regions persisted. Across Europe, PM10 was correlated with low household income but this association primarily reflected East-West inequalities and was not found when Eastern or Western Europe regions were considered separately. Notably, some of the most polluted regions in Western Europe were also among the richest. PM10 was more strongly associated with plausibly-related mortality outcomes in Eastern than Western Europe, presumably because of higher ambient concentrations. Populations of lower-income regions appeared more susceptible to the effects of PM10, but only for circulatory disease mortality in Eastern Europe and male respiratory mortality in Western Europe. Conclusions: Income-related inequalities in exposure to ambient PM10 may contribute to Europe-wide mortality inequalities, and to those in Eastern but not Western European regions. We found some evidence that lower-income regions were more susceptible to the health effects of PM10.

AB  - A community-integrated geographic information systems (CIGIS) study assimilating qualitative and quantitative information about human exposures and health was conducted in Colfax, Louisiana, which hosts a commercial open burn/open detonation thermal treatment (TT) facility that destroys hazardous waste from Superfund sites, explosives, military ordnances, and propellants. Fifty-eight percent of residents identified as Black, and median annual income was $16,318, with 90% of the population living below the poverty line. We conducted oral history interviews of twenty-nine residents and mined public records to document the community's experiences. Interviews focused on themes of Colfax's history, changing community fabric, resident health, and air pollution. The oral histories and public comments by community members provided information about lived experiences, including several health conditions, toleration of noise and vibration, property damage, and resulting changes to activity levels. These statements provided insight into the extent of suffering experienced by the local community. We also ran dispersion models for dates in 2020 when the waste stream composition, mass, and burn/smoldering times were provided in the facility's public records. The dispersion models placed the air pollution at the homes of residents during some of the time, and waste stream records from the TT facility agree with community testimony about health effects based on the known health effects of those compounds. CIGIS integration of our community-based qualitative data and maps with quantitative air pollution dispersion model output illustrated alignment between community complaints of impacts to health and property, known toxicological information about waste stream compounds, and dispersion model output.

AB  - Background: Given the absence of binding standards for noise action planning according to the European Noise Directive, citizens' engagement in public information and consultation processes are crucial for procedural environmental justice. Drawing on a conceptual model on cognitive-motivational determinants, we examined (1) engagement-specific self-efficacy and communal mastery as conceptual links between exposure to road traffic noise and intended and performed civic engagement for noise protection, (2) condition and object resources as additional predictors, and (3) residents' social position (gender, individual education, and social welfare rates in the residential neighbourhood) as vulnerability-related effect modifiers in these associations. Methods: Our cross-sectional analysis included 1691 participants aged 60-90 years from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, a population-based study in the Ruhr Area, Germany. We merged our questionnaire data with exposure to road traffic noise (L-den) at the most exposed facade. Assumed relations were investigated by a path model consisting of linear regressions on engagement-specific self-efficacy and communal mastery scales and pmbit regressions on binary intended and performed engagement variables. We applied the path model to the whole sample and to stratified samples to detect potential effect modification as assessed by Chi-Square difference tests. Results: Exposure to mad traffic noise was negatively associated with engagement-specific self-efficacy and communal mastery that both emerged as predictors of intended engagement. While engagement-specific self-efficacy was estimated to predict performed engagement directly, communal mastery appeared to effect performed engagement through intended engagement. We observed a positive association between intended and performed engagement. Difference tests indicated a few group-specific vulnerabilities, e.g. in the association of engagement-specific self-efficacy and performed engagement among participants living in neighbourhoods with higher social welfare while being affected by higher exposure levels. Conclusions: Within our conceptual frame, our results give indications of how engagement-specific self-efficacy and communal mastery can contribute to procedural environmental justice.

AB  - A growing body of research shows affluent White neighborhoods have more acres of parks and more park facilities than low-income ethnic minority communities in many Global North cities. Most of these investigations focused on neighborhood-level differences and did not analyze broader inequities across cities. This is a particularly significant limitation in the U.S., where changes in the political economy of parks due to a reduced local tax base have led cities to compete against each other to secure park funding from national nonprofits and public agencies. To address this gap, we examined whether the quality of urban park systems - measured through The Trust for Public Land's ParkScore - varies depending on a city's median income and ethnic composition. Based on multivariate regressions in which we control for features of the urban fabric, we found U.S. cities with higher median incomes and lower percentages of Latino and Non-Hispanic Black residents have higher ParkScores than other cities. Some inequities also emerged for park coverage, park spending per person, and park facilities, with majority-Latino cities being particularly disadvantaged. These findings echo the results of neighborhood-level studies in Global North contexts, suggesting neighborhood-level inequities in park provision might scale up to inequities across cities. This study contributes to environmental justice theory and advocacy by demonstrating the importance of scaling up analyses of park provision to cross-city comparisons. Implications for landscape planning, public policy, and grant-making are discussed.

AB  - Aldo Leopold shot a wolf a hundred years ago, the most iconic wolf kill in conservation history, a shooting now historically confirmed, which three decades later he elevated into his "green fire" metaphor and symbol. There are tensions. Was Leopold a hypocrite? He spent the rest of his life hunting and trying to produce more game to kill. Thinking like a mountain, thinking big in the big outdoors, there is a dramatic shift of focus from a dying wolf's eyes to a land ethic. Thinking big enough, globally, Leopold saving wolves, or wilderness, or game management seems simplistic and parochial before global warming or environmental justice. Still, Leopold is on a moral frontier.

AB  - Alternative food supporters claim that food produced outside the corporate system can improve the wellbeing of communities. A closer look at these claims raises the question: How are members of the alternative food movement defining "community" and who is being included in and excluded from these definitions? We draw from in-depth interviews with (1) urban famers and their supporters and (2) neighborhood members of gentrifying East Austin to examine irreconcilable disputes on the process of rewriting Austin's urban farm code. We use Stanley Fish's concept of "interpretive communities" to understand competing definitions of "community" and theorize beyond this point by noting that when communities feel at threat, they come together as coalesced communities to gain support for their stance. The discussions in this paper can be situated within dialogues of critical geography, gentrification, alternative foodways, and public health to show how class, race, and ethnicity remain tied to environmental justice.

AB  - Although the term social exclusion is rarely used in the US, many of the issues that fall under that rubric have long been part of US policy debates in the transportation arena. This paper's goal is to critically evaluate US experiences to suggest to Australian policymakers the complex causes of different kinds of social exclusion and some potential policy solutions to address them. This paper first distinguishes seven types of social exclusion in the transportation area and then identifies five major causes. The paper next describes three major US approaches to a range of social exclusion issues in transportation (and other areas): the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Environmental Justice mandates, and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. Each is interesting because it addresses different kinds of social exclusion in transportation with different policy instruments. The US experience illustrates how complex a phenomenon social exclusion is and demonstrates that continuing efforts to 'blame' transportation deficiencies for many other types of social exclusion over-simply what are very complicated processes. In fact, US experiences illustrate the many interests that may be in conflict in distributing scarce resources to address social exclusion, attest to the real difficulties in using transportation systems and services alone to address social exclusion, and suggest that transportation must be part of a package of policies and programs to have any real impact.

AB  - Background: Low-income communities and communities of color have been shown to experience disproportionate exposure to agricultural pesticides, which have been linked to poorer neurobehavioral outcomes in infants and children. Few studies have assessed health impacts of pesticide mixtures in the context of socioeconomic adversity. Objectives: To examine associations between residential proximity to toxicity-weighted organophosphate (OP) and carbamate pesticide use during pregnancy, household- and neighborhood-level poverty during childhood, and IQ scores in 10-year-old children. Methods: We evaluated associations between both nearby agricultural pesticide use and poverty measures and cognitive abilities in 10-year-old children (n = 501) using data from a longitudinal birth cohort study linked with data from the California Pesticide Use Reporting system and the American Community Survey. Associations were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Results: Children of mothers in the highest quartile compared to the lowest quartile of proximal pesticide use had lower performance on Full Scale IQ [beta = -3.0; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = (-5.6, -0.3)], Perceptual Reasoning [beta = -4.0; (-7.6, -0.4)], and Working Memory [beta = -2.8; (-5.6, -0.1)]. Belonging to a household earning an income at or below the poverty threshold was associated with approximately two point lower scores on Full Scale IQ Verbal Comprehension, and Working Memory. Living in the highest quartile of neighborhood poverty at age 10 was associated with approximately four point lower performance on Full Scale IQ Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, and Working memory. Conclusions: Residential proximity to OP and carbamate pesticide use during pregnancy and both household- and neighborhood-level poverty during childhood were independently associated with poorer cognitive functioning in children at 10 years of age.

AB  - Access to green space (GS) is vital for children's health and development, including during daycare. In Japan, deregulation to alleviate daycare shortages has created a new category of so-called unlicensed daycare centers (UDCs) that often lack dedicated GS. UDCs rely on surrounding GS, including parks, temples and university grounds, but reports of conflicts highlight the precarity of children's well-being in a rapidly aging country. Knowledge about GS access in Japanese UDCs remains scarce. Our mail-back survey (n = 173) of UDCs and online survey (n = 3645) of parents investigated threats to GS access during daycare across 14 Japanese cities. Results suggest that UDCs use a variety of GS and aim to provide daily access. Caregivers are vital in mediating children's access, but locally available GS diversity, quality and quantity as well as institutional support were perceived as lacking. Parents did not rank GS high among their priorities when selecting daycare providers, and showed limited awareness of conflicts during GS visits. Implications of this study include the need for caregivers and parents to communicate and collaborate to improve GS access, and the importance of strong public investment into holistically improving GS diversity, quality and quantity from the perspective of public health and urban planning.

AB  - A human rights paradigm for environmental health research makes explicit the relationship between poor health and poverty, inequality, and social and political marginalization, and it aims at civic problem solving. In so doing, it incorporates support for community-based, participatory research and takes seriously the social responsibilities of researchers. For these reasons, a human rights approach may be better able than conventional bioethics to address the unique issues that arise in the context of pediatric environmental health research, particularly the place of environmental justice standards in research. At the same time, as illustrated by disagreements over the ethics of research into lead abatement methods, bringing a human rights paradigm to bear in the context of environmental health research requires resolving important tensions at its heart, particularly the inescapable tension between ethical ideals and political realities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No overarching federal agencies or policies are responsible for ensuring environmental health at schools in the United States, potentially allowing many inequities for low-income and minority communities to persist. This article examines emergent research, policy, and practice-based efforts that may be used to identify and address environmental justice at school. METHODS: A brief literature review was conducted to understand (1) major mental, behavioral, and physical outcomes associated with environmental risk for school-aged children and (2) current research methods for assessing these relationships. Documents prepared by government agencies, school districts, and advocacy groups were also collected and synthesized to improve understanding of the state of planning and policies for maintaining or improving school environments. RESULTS: Environmental risk can manifest in diverse ways such as mold, poor air quality, poor community design, or contaminated playgrounds. Deeply rooted in national and state structures of school funding and planning, such risks can lead to outcomes including respiratory illness, poor performance in school, and reduced levels of physical activity. With growing attention to these concerns, methods for measuring environmental risks and underlying disparities have advanced tremendously in the last few decades, yet development of innovative research approaches may be necessary to further advance and evaluate appropriate interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental injustice is generally unacknowledged during decision-making in US school districts. Continued dialogue reflective of translatable science is necessary to support school districts with limited funding in ensuring safe, healthy environments for learning.

AB  - Background: Environmental Health Research-to-Action (EHRA) is a community-academic partnership focused on building skills and intergenerational knowledge in environmental health, community science, and policy advocacy to address cumulative exposures in Dearborn, Michigan and nearby communities, primarily through a youth academy. Objectives: This article outlines our EHRA Youth Academy curriculum with sample recruitment materials, and we describe its beginnings, steering committee (SC), learning objectives, design, implementation, and recommendations from ongoing program evaluation and reflections of the SC. Methods: In 2018 and 2019, we piloted the EHRA Academy with a total of forty-five fellows (16-18 years old), primarily Arab youth living in or near frontline communities. Fellows participated in a 2-week academy of interactive sessions, including a tour of local industry, participatory mapping, practice using handheld monitors to measure air pollution, and a policy advocacy 101 training. Applying lessons in accessing secondary data and environmental health literacy, fellows then created scientifically-informed materials including infographics and oral presentations for varied audiences. They completed a pre-survey, brief daily surveys, and a post-survey, and reported increased likelihood of advocacy behaviors and knowledge related to all content areas. Conclusions: In Southeast Dearborn, Michigan, threats to environmental health are constant, and intergenerational community mobilization remains necessary to reduce their adverse effects. Grounded in the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) and using high-impact active learning strategies, the EHRA Academy may provide one effective model for centering youth to build community capacity towards environmental justice (EJ).

AB  - Background In the last decade there has been an increase in community-based organizations providing support and educational outreach to populations effected by hazards. Prior research has demonstrated various roles that community social capital can play in both the enhancement of disaster preparedness and the mitigation of physical and mental health impacts following a natural disaster. Methods To assess self-reported health of residents of South Houston, Texas impacted by Hurricane Harvey, attendees of a community event completed a survey that included the 12 item short form health survey version 2 (SF-12v2). Results Although survey participants were older and more likely to be African-American than the overall population of Houston, they had higher mental health composite scores that the national average, with increases in mental wellbeing associated with a longer length of residence in their neighborhood. Conclusions The City of Houston, with highly segregated, socially vulnerable populations at high risk from natural hazards, should consider ways to support community engagement around disaster preparedness, response, and recovery that may build community cohesion and improve post-disaster mental health.

AB  - At a time of great urgency for transitions to sustainability in light of climate mitigation targets, energy infrastructure is in a state of flux. Expansions in renewable energy and the persistent grasp of fossil fuels over a historically centralised sector surface new challenges of socio-spatial and environmental justice. Where does new energy infrastructure appear, how is this decided, who benefits and who is burdened? What land uses are displaced and with what socio-ecological implications? This collection pulls together insights from environmental and land governance, ethnographic studies of situated social identities, and emerging conceptualisations of energy infrastructure to address these concerns. It features contributions focused at multiple scales - the urban, regional, national and trans-local - and informed by a variety of cognate conceptual lenses: political ecology, human geography, social anthropology, urban studies, socio-technical transitions and epistemic politics. Examining cases from three continents, both the Global South and North, the theme issue presents an array of perspectives from established and emerging scholars. It seeks to combine empirically rich and theoretically rigorous enquiry at the conjuncture of energy infrastructure transitions, changing land use and morphing social identity. The aim is thus to further interdisciplinary knowledge on socio-ecological implications of cross-sectoral transitions.

AB  - A core question still remains after the Paris Agreement: who receives how much of the remaining CO2 budget (resource/burden/effort sharing), so that the increase in the global average temperature is kept to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels? If converging per capita emissions serve as a possible answer to this question, the discussion focuses primarily on the approach Contraction and Convergence' (C&C). The Regensburg Model now offers a further option for the mathematical implementation of converging per capita emissions. The authors identify features common to C&C and differences from C&C. They show that, of the convergence models they examined, the Regensburg Model is the most favourable option for industrialized countries.Policy relevanceIn politics, the concept of converging per capita emissions is often accepted at the abstract level. Civil society in particular can then take politicians at their word wherever they take values calculated using the Regensburg Model as points of reference; then prosperous developed countries in particular whose nationally determined contributions do not come up even to these reference values will find it difficult to justify their contributions.

AB  - After the Working Group on Climate Change and Development recognised the challenge that climate change poses to development, a number of environmental and aid, trade and development organisations formed a new politically active coalition, Stop Climate Chaos (SCC), to demand that stronger climate laws be adopted in the UK. The coalition now frames the issue of climate change as a 'global climate justice' one, emphasising the severity of the issue for people in poor countries, who will suffer the worst consequences, but have contributed least to it. The extent to which SCC member organisations address climate change as a global justice issue is explored through a content analysis of their websites, and a survey of participants in the SCC I-Count march, London, 3 November 2006. There is certainly evidence that environmental organisations are 'facing South', just as aid, trade and development organisations are 'turning green'.

AB  - Academic and popular literatures have addressed growing concerns about the ways we produce, harvest, distribute, and consume food; manage fisheries and inputs to agriculture; and deal with waste. Throughout the 20th century, a series of issue-specific frames emerged that explicitly addressed issues of social justice, the environment, and human health in the food system. During the mid-1990s that comprehensive master frames were established in attempts to bring disparate ideas and actions together into a more inclusive food movement. In this chapter, we explore the development of these collective action frames and turn to Canada as a case study to examine the key moments that have brought together diverse actors through collaborative networks to assert their place within a broader social movement. We argue that recognizing the increasing development of food networks and making these relationships visible opens new theoretical and practical possibilities for food system transformation.

AB  - Although window views of residential greenery are the main daily nature contact for Berlin residents, studies that examine this experience are rare but crucial to improving environmental justice and the health outcomes of green planning and policy. We analyzed 504 photos of the window views of residential greenery taken at 32 study sites for the four main Central European building types in Berlin, Germany. Visible green and structural elements were quantified from the perspective of the window and compared to presence on the ground. The window perspective is significantly distinct from the perspective at ground level. In general, lower numbers of plants and structural elements are visible from the window. In this study, we identified specific compositions of window views for different building types but also a high variability of compositions across sites. Moreover, 98 participants, including the elderly, lay people, and professionals, ranked 24 representative photos of window views according to preference. Preference has closely been linked to beneficial functions. Vegetation is perceived as a highly positive factor, trees more so than groups of shrubs. Structures for recreation are perceived positively while structures for practical use, like waste storage and parking, are perceived negatively. Accordingly, we show that residential greenery has the potential to reconcile different interests among neighbors. A multifunctional design can provide recreational space for active users as well as aesthetically pleasing window views. However, the highly individual nature of window perspectives requires individual solutions according to available size and the resident's needs.

AB  - After independence, and in accordance with global environmental policies, the government of Namibia partly transferred the responsibility for managing wildlife and water to local communities. In this article, we use the concept of environmental justice as a theoretical guide to explore the combined effects that these new policies have had for pastoralists in arid, rural Namibia. We find, firstly, that partly due to conservation efforts, the elephant population has increased significantly. While a healthy elephant population supports exclusive, international tourism, the elephants are causing ever-increasing destruction at communal water points thus leading to increasing local financial costs. Only a small fraction of the revenues from community-based tourism, however, remains in the communities, and relatively few people profit from these revenues directly. Secondly, as new community-level sharing institutions for water emerge, pastoralists who are economically marginalized are subsidizing the financial costs of water for both their wealthy neighbours and the tourism industry. Looking at the combined effects of CBNRM policies for water and wildlife management, these policies are likely to lead to better resource management but greater economic inequality. To interpret these findings, we consider how CBNRM transforms landscapes and wildlife into global commodities. This process pulls communities into new common property regimes as well as towards privatization at the same time and helps to explain the social-ecological changes we observe.

AB  - Although no one can deny the profound importance of John Rawls's work in political philosophy, which covered both an original theory of justice and extensive work and teaching on the history of moral and political philosophy, we are now at the point where his contributions more clearly suggest certain historical limitations. Such topics as gender justice, racial justice, and environmental justice figured in Rawls's work only belatedly and in less than satisfactory ways. Surely the wide influence of the Rawlsian revolution should suggest that the erasures and blindspots in his historical reconstructions ought to be acknowledged and addressed, rather than avoided out of some misguided conception of charity in interpretation.

AB  - Asthma prevalence is reportedly low for children of Mexican descent compared with other ethnic groups and Latino subgroups. The results of our exploratory ethnographic research among children of farmworkers in California dramatically suggest otherwise. Unstructured and semi-structured openended interviews and photovoice methods were combined to explore the lived experiences of members of a marginalized farmworker community. This research gives voice to a population of families living in the highly toxic, yet agriculturally wealthy environment of the San Joaquin Valley. Little work has been reported employing photovoice, a community-based participatory research method, to study childhood exposure to pesticides. A rich narrative about perceptions of pesticide exposure emerged from the ethnographic interviews. Thematic analysis yielded beliefs about the relationship between air quality and childhood asthma. The findings suggest that childhood asthma should be reviewed within the context of local levels of environmental exposure and the principles of environmental justice., (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Air quality and climate change policies are finding new common grounds today as increasing social complexity requires better integration of separate knowledge domains. This chapter addresses the complex relationship between these two policy domains, their scientific background and the related acceptability issue, which varies substantially among countries and social groups and is influenced by social and cultural factors. The first section of this chapter describes the relationship between air quality and climate change policies. Indeed, global CO2 reduction objectives require complex adaptations of socio-economic behaviours that might not directly appear to be related to pollution reduction or to improvement the exposure of citizens to harmful pollutants. Recent studies, however, have confirmed that air pollution and its impacts are one of the main environmental concerns for citizens, even if relevant differences in public perception between countries still remain. This section also addresses the ambiguities and conflicts that characterise communication between experts and citizens. The second section briefly describes recent scientific evidence that shows the possibility of coupling air quality and climate change mitigation benefits with policies targeted at specific pollutants called short lived climate forcers (SLCF). The third section spells out some preliminary research questions on the acceptability of these policies and their complex relationship with individual interests and cultural contexts. Linking air quality to climate change could be a win-win strategy to increase the social acceptability of specific policies and their implementation if knowledge and communication gaps between citizens and policy makers will be reduced.

AB  - Although scientific evidence is scarce and uneven, there are mounting concerns mat environmental health risks are borne disproportionately by members of the population who are poor and nonwhite. From an environmental health perspective, research to reduce critical uncertainties in health risk assessment must necessarily be at the heart of efforts to evaluate and resolve issues of environmental justice-helping to define the dimensions of the problem, understand its causes, and identify effective and efficient solutions. The full range of environmental health sciences, including exposure analysis, epidemiology, toxicology, biostatistics, and surveillance monitoring, is needed to build a strong scientific foundation for informed decision making. This is the best and surest way to promote health and safety for all members of our society, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, health condition, race, or socioeconomic status.

AB  - Air pollution is not spread evenly across demographic groups. Exposures and associated health risks appear to fall disproportionately on populations that are poor and nonwhite. Although scientific evidence documenting disparities in air pollution exposures, doses, and health effects is scant, the available data strongly support the contention that disadvantaged groups, many of whom are ethnic and racial minorities, routinely encounter levels of air pollution that are higher than average. The extent to which exposure differentials contribute to observed differences in health status by class and race is unknown, but worthy of further investigation. We recommend several steps, all of them feasible and most of them relatively inexpensive, to improve our understanding and ability to address environmental health disparities.

In this article, we (a) catalog the classic criticisms of conventional health risk assessment, (b) create a typology that orders the critiques according to their focus on either input errors or output biases, and (c) identify selected allegations that fall within each category. We also note that the risk assessment-risk management paradigm has evolved over the past several decades, partially in accordance with the general direction and spirit of these classic critiques. The debate continues today along familiar lines invoking the traditional critiques and rebuttals outlined here.

We examine the central role of environmental health research in defining the dimensions of the problem, understanding its causes, and identifying solutions. Environmental health sciences, including epidemiology, exposure analysis, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and surveillance monitoring, must be employed to determine the extent to which society has achieved ''equity'' and ''justice'' in safeguarding the health and safety of its citizens. By improving our ability to identify, evaluate, prevent, and/or reduce risks for all members of society, environmental health research can contribute directly to fair and equitable protection for everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, race, or socioeconomic status.

AB  - Agricultural and reproductive technologies ostensibly represent opposing poles within discourses on population growth: one aims to 'feed the world,' while the other seeks to limit the number of mouths there are to feed. There is, however, an urgent need to critically interrogate new discourses linking population size with climate change and promoting agricultural and reproductive technologies as a means to address associated problems. This article analyses the specific discourses produced by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in relation to these 'population technologies' and 'climate-smart' agriculture in particular. Drawing on concepts and approaches developed by Black, postcolonial and Marxist feminists including intersectionality, racial capitalism, social reproduction, and reproductive and environmental justice, we explore how within these discourses, the 'geo-populationism' of the BMGF's climate-smart agriculture initiatives, like the 'demo-populationism' of its family planning interventions, mobilises neoliberal notions of empowerment, productivity and innovation. Not only do these populationist discourses reinforce neoliberal framings and policies which extend existing regimes of racialised and gendered socio-spatial inequality, but they also underwrite global capital accumulation through new science and technologies. The BMGF's representations of its climate-smart agriculture initiatives offer the opportunity to understand how threats of climate change are mobilised to reanimate and repackage the Malthusian disequilibrium between human fertility and agricultural productivity. Drawing upon our readings of these discourses, we critically propose the concept of 'necro-populationism' to refer to processes that target racialised and gendered populations for dispossession, toxification, slow death and embodied violence, even while direct accountability for the effects of these changes is dispersed. We also identify a need for further research which will not only trace the ways in which the BMGF's global policies are materialised, spatialised, reproduced and reoriented by multiple actors in local contexts, but will also recognise and affirm the diverse forms through which these 'necro-populationist' processes are disavowed and resisted.

In practice, however, when new energy projects are proposed in specific places and regions, their proponents often face public resistance. This paper is a synthesis of a multi-investigator study of community responses to new energy developments in four Canadian provinces. We identify three questions that communities are asking about the governance of these projects: (1) Are the decision-making and regulatory processes open, rigorous, and accountable? (2) Have local people been meaningfully engaged? (3) Are the costs and benefits fairly distributed? Overall, we argue that public resistance is often a legitimate response stemming from inadequate governance of energy development. Specifically, and partly because of the changing role of government in policy-making and regulation, local communities lose trust that governance reflects and will protect their social and ecological values. We conclude that innovation in community engagement is needed, particularly in the context of rapid institutional change and governments that might be unable or unwilling to oversee inclusive decision-making processes.

AB  - Background: Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a methodology for predicting the effects of a proposed policy or plan on health. A proposed environmental restoration and development plan presented an opportunity for an HIA in an environmental justice community surrounding the Martin Pena channel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The HIA focused on the dredging of the channel, debris removal, road, sewer, and storm water infrastructure improvements, housing demolition, and resident relocation. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the potential effects of the proposed plan on the community's health to inform the funding decision by the Puerto Rican legislature. As the first HIA in Puerto Rico, a secondary objective was to build HIA capacity in Puerto Rico. Methods: This HIA used community training, literature reviews, existing local studies, focus groups, interviews, and disease surveillance data to assess baseline health, determine expected effects, and build capacity. Findings: The Martin Pena community is experiencing deteriorating environmental conditions. Flooding and negative environmental exposures, such as mold, limits to physical activity, stress, chemical toxicants, pathogenic bacteria, and pests, are worsening. The higher rates of diseases, such as asthma and diarrhea, in the community compared with elsewhere in Puerto Rico appear to be largely attributable to these factors. Overall, the proposed plan is expected to improve many of these health disparities but the successful implementation depends on continued community acceptance and participation, particularly with the relocation process. Recommendations are for full financing and several mitigation efforts to avoid negative and preserve beneficial health consequences. Conclusions: As the first HIA in Puerto Rico, this assessment provided specific recommendations to benefit the health of the community affected by an environmental restoration and development plan and also capacity building for a larger audience in Puerto Rico. This approach could be generalized to other Latino environmental justice communities in Puerto Rico and abroad.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Global climate change will have multiple effects on human health. Vulnerable populations-children, the elderly, and the poor-will be disproportionately affected. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed projected impacts of climate change on children's health, the pathways involved in these effects, and prevention strategies. DATA SOURCES: We assessed primary studies, review articles, and organizational reports. DATA SYNTHESIS: Climate change is increasing the global burden of disease and in the year 2000 was responsible for > 150,000 deaths worldwide. Of this disease burden, 88% fell upon children. Documented health effects include changing ranges of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue; increased diarrheal and respiratory disease; increased morbidity and mortality from extreme weather; changed exposures to toxic chemicals; worsened poverty; food and physical insecurity; and threats to human habitation. Heat-related health effects for which research is emerging include diminished school performance, increased rates of pregnancy complications, and renal effects. Stark variation in these outcomes is evident by geographic region and socioeconomic status, and these impacts will exacerbate health disparities. Prevention strategies to reduce health impacts of climate change include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation through multiple public health interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Further quantification of the effects of climate change on children's health is needed globally and also at regional and local levels through enhanced monitoring of children's environmental health and by tracking selected indicators. Climate change preparedness strategies need to be incorporated into public health programs.

AB  - A spatial cumulative distribution function (SCDF) gives the proportion of a spatial domain D having the value of some response variable less than a particular level w. This article provides a fully hierarchical approach to SCDF modeling, using a Bayesian framework implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The approach generalizes the customary SCDF to accommodate density or indicator weighting. Bivariate spatial processes emerge as a natural approach for framing such a generalization. Indicator weighting leads to conditional SCDFs, useful in studying, for example, adjusted exposure to one pollutant given a specified level of exposure to another. Intensity weighted (or population density weighted) SCDFs are particularly natural in assessments of environmental justice, where it is important to determine if a particular sociodemographic group is being excessively exposed to harmful levels of certain pollutants. MCMC methods (combined with a convenient Kronecker structure) enable straightforward estimates or approximate estimates of bivariate, conditional, and weighted SCDFs. We illustrate our methods with two air pollution datasets, one recording both nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) ambient levels at 67 monitoring sites in central and southern California, and the other concerning ozone exposure and race in Atlanta, GA.

AB  - Against a backdrop of scant scholarly evidence regarding the effectiveness of E-Participation (EP) in enabling broader macro-level outcomes, we posit that electronic participation use by governments in engaging citizens leads to a more inclusive human development and superior environmental performance, directly as well as indirectly through corruption control. Towards this, we employ human-centered development perspective, the "just" environmental sustainability paradigm, agency theory, and rent-seeking theory to draw linkages between EP, Corruption Control, Inclusive Human Development, and Environmental Performance. Using publicly available archival data for 132 countries, we carry out an empirical analysis and establish that higher EP is positively associated with Inclusive Human Development and subsequently Environmental Performance. Specifically, our results substantiate the role of Corruption Control as an intervening mechanism via which EP's impact on Environmental Performance assumes effectiveness. Our findings contribute to the theoretical discourse on EP by extending the analysis of EP impacts beyond its immediate outcomes (such as Corruption Control) to include higher-order macro-level impacts (such as Inclusive Human Development and Environmental Performance). In doing so, we uncover fresh evidence of EP's effectiveness in enabling Inclusive Human Development and Environmental Performance on a global scale. Based on these observations, we draw implications for theory and practice, and avenues for future research.

AB  - Although it is well-established that urban green infrastructure is essential to improve the population's wellbeing, in many developed countries, the availability of green spaces is limited or its distribution around the city is uneven. Some minority groups may have less access or are deprived of access to green spaces when compared with the rest of the population. The availability of public green spaces may also be directly related to the geographical location of the city within Europe. In addition, current planning for urban regeneration and the creation of new high-quality recreational public green spaces sometimes results in projects that reinforce the paradox of green gentrification. The aim of this study was to explore the concept of environmental justice in the distribution of the public green spaces in two contrasting cities, Tartu, Estonia; and Faro, Portugal. Quantitative indicators of public green space were calculated in districts in each city. The accessibility of those spaces was measured using the "walkability" distance and grid methods. The results revealed that there was more availability and accessibility to public green spaces in Tartu than in Faro. However, inequalities were observed in Soviet-era housing block districts in Tartu, where most of the Russian minority live, while Roma communities in Faro were located in districts without access to public green space. The availability of public green spaces varied from 1.22 to 31.44 m(2)/inhabitant in the districts of Faro, and 1.04 to 164.07 m(2)/inhabitant in the districts of Tartu. In both cities, 45% of the inhabitants had accessible public green spaces within 500 m of their residence. The development of targeted new green infrastructure could increase access to 88% of the population for the city of Faro and 86% for Tartu, delivering environmental justice without provoking green gentrification. The outcome of this study provides advice to urban planners on how to balance green space distribution within city neighbourhoods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydraulically fractured wells produce 2-14 million liters of wastewater, which may contain toxic and radioactive compounds. The wastewater is predominantly disposed of using Class II injection wells. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and injection well locations in Ohio. METHODS: Using state and federal data sources, we classified Ohio census block groups by presence of injection wells, number of hydraulically fractured wells, sociodemographic factors (median household income, % white, population density, % >= high school education, median age, voter turnout), and geographic information (land area, water area, situated over shale). We modeled the odds of having at least one injection well within a block group with respect to all covariatcs using three multivariable models incorporating different spatial components to account for similarities in neighboring block groups. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, block groups with injection wells (n = 156) compared with those without (n = 9,049) had lower population density (71 vs. 2,210 people/mi(2) or 27 vs. 854 people/km(2)), larger median area (43.5 vs. 1.35 km(2)), higher median age (42.8 vs. 40.2 y), and higher % white (98.1% vs. 92.1%). After adjustment using a spatial logistic regression model, the odds of a block group containing an injection well were 16% lower per $10,000 increase in median income [oddsiratio(OR) = 0.837; 95% credible interval (CE: 0.719, 0.9611 and 97% lower per 1,000 people/mi(2) (or per 386 people/km(2)) increase (OR = 0.030; 95% CI = 0.008, 0.072). Block groups on shale and those containing fewer hydraulically fractured wells were more likely to include an injection well. Percentage white, median age, % >= high school education, and % voter turnout were not significant predictors of injection well presence. CONCLUSION: In Ohio, injection wells were inversely associated with block groups' median incomes after adjusting for other sociodemographic and geographic variables. Research is needed to determine whether residents in census blocks with injection wells face increased risk of chemical exposures or adverse health outcomes.

AB  - Background The natural removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through land conservation, restoration, and management is receiving increasing attention as a scalable approach for climate change mitigation. However, different land-use sectors compete for resources and incentives within and across geopolitical regions, resulting in divergent goals and inefficient prioritization of CO2 removal efforts. Thus, a unifying framework is needed to accelerate basic research and coordinated interventions to accelerate climate change mitigation. Scope We propose a generalizable framework for Enhanced Natural Climate Solutions (NCS +), which we define as activities that can be coordinated to increase carbon drawdown and permanence on land while improving livelihoods and the provision of natural resources in vulnerable communities and ecosystems. The framework builds on interdisciplinary scientific convergence, including critical socioecological interactions, to inform both top-down policy incentives and bottom-up adoption by industries and managers. To achieve this goal, we suggest a multi-tiered approach for the prioritization of projects at local to regional scales that would simultaneously accelerate scientific discovery and broad implementation of CO2 removal projects. Conclusions Our vision leverages input from hundreds of researchers and land managers, including social and environmental scientists as well as representatives from tribal governments, state, and federal agencies in the Pacific Northwest of the USA, as a model system. Five guiding principles orient the framework which would be applicable in any region. As evidence of feasibility, we provide a synthesis of interdisciplinary studies that illustrate how coordinated action, with explicit consideration of system-specific technical and socioecological limitations, can lead to scalable projects with multiple co-benefits. Using theory as a linchpin for innovation, we propose that NCS + could better align climate change mitigation, adaptation, and justice goals at multiple scales.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Communities with lower socioeconomic status and higher prevalence of racial/ethnic minority populations are often more exposed to environmental pollutants. Although studies have shown associations between aircraft noise and property values and various health outcomes, little is known about how aircraft noise exposures are sociodemographically patterned. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to describe characteristics of populations exposed to aviation noise by race/ethnicity, education, and income in the United States. METHODS: Aircraft noise contours characterized as day-night average sound level (DNL) were developed for 90 U.S. airports in 2010 for DNL >= 45 dB(A) in 1-dB(A) increments. We compared characteristics of exposed U.S. Census block groups at three thresholds (>= 45, >= 55, and >= 65 dB(A)), assigned on the basis of the block group land area being >= 50% within the threshold, vs. unexposed block groups near study airports. Comparisons were made across block group race/ethnicity, education, and income categories within the study areas (n =4,031-74,253). We performed both multinomial and other various multivariable regression approaches, including models controlling for airport and models with random intercepts specifying within-airport effects and adjusting for airport-level means. RESULTS: Aggregated across multiple airports, block groups with a higher Hispanic population had higher odds of being exposed to aircraft noise. For example, the multinomial analysis showed that a 10-percentage point increase in a block group's Hispanic population was associated with an increased odds ratio of 39% (95% CI: 25%, 54%) of being exposed to >= 65 dB(A) compared with block groups exposed to <45 dB(A). Block groups with higher proportions of residents with only a high school education had higher odds of being exposed to aircraft noise. Results were robust across multiple regression approaches; however, there was substantial heterogeneity across airports. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that across U.S. airports, there is indication of sociodemographic disparities in noise exposures.

AB  - Although various governmental entities in the USA are required to consider environmental justice (EJ) impacts of their actions during decision-making, socially vulnerable groups continue to be disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards. Tools and programs to quantify and mitigate environmental injustices are limited by existing data, which may not capture the full range of health disparities exacerbated by the complex interactions between environmental exposures and social stressors. In this study, we analyzed how the scientific literature approaches EJ issues in the USA. We searched PubMed for journal articles discussing at least one sociodemographic or environmental variable in the context of cumulative impacts and analyzed the relative frequency with which various EJ topics were studied. Our findings indicate that demographic variables are commonly used in epidemiologic studies, though some areas (e.g., age) are better studied than others. Similarly, occupational exposure and ambient air pollution were more studied than other types of exposures. Word frequency analyses revealed which toxicants and health outcomes are the most frequently studied. In addition, temporality analyses showed that the rate of occupational publications rose rapidly in the 1970-1980s and has since plateaued, while other publication rates increased two decades later and are still on the rise. Cumulative impacts are considered in a relatively small portion of journal articles across all topics; nevertheless, they have seen an exponential climb in the last decade. A more equitable distribution of scientific efforts might be needed for a better distribution of funding, policy-making efforts, and other resources to socially and environmentally vulnerable communities.

AB  - Background: Access to safe, affordable and accessible drinking water is a human right and foundational to the third and sixth World Health Organization's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Unsafe drinking water is a risk factor for chronic and enteric diseases. Both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diarrheal disease are highly prevalent in the Lake Chapala basin, Jalisco, Mexico, suggesting disparities in factors leading to successful achievement of these two SDGs. Methods: This study aimed to assess progress towards SDG three and six in the Lake Chapala basin. Qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial data were collected between May and August of 2019 from three towns within the municipalities of Poncitlan and Chapala. Results: Ninety-nine households participated in this study. Water sampling analyses determined 81.18% of samples from water jugs (garrafones) and 70.05% of samples from tap water were contaminated with total coliform bacteria, often including E. coli. Additionally, 32% of garrafon samples and 61.9% of tap water samples had detectable levels of arsenic. Approximately 97.94% of respondents stated that they believe clean water is a human right, but 78.57% feel the Mexican government does not do enough to make this a reality. Conclusions: This mixed methods approach highlights water quality as a serious issue in communities around Lake Chapala, and demonstrates inadequate drinking water as a key hazard, potentially perpetuating the high disease burden of both CKD and enteric disease in the region.

AB  - Although gentrification is occurring at increasing rates across the United States, our understanding of what this means for public health is limited. While positive changes, such as increases in property values and reduced crime rates occur, negative consequences, such as residential displacement, also ensue. Individuals living through gentrification experience major changes in social and environmental conditions often in short periods of time, which can result in disrupted social networks and stress, both associated with decrements in health. As neighborhoods across the United States undergo revitalization, understanding health effects of gentrification, positive and negative, is paramount. We posit that gentrification may be beneficial in some aspects of health and detrimental in others. To address current challenges in the gentrification-health literature, we recommend future research: 1) examine the gentrification processes and stages; 2) integrate built, natural, and social environment metrics; and 3) assess mediating and moderating associations. As gentrification expands across the United States, research conducted in this area is poised for timely contributions to equitable development and urban planning policies.

AB  - Aviation noise is a harmful pollutant, which has yet to be studied in the environmental justice literature. This paper uses Tobit and logit multivariate regression analyses to analyze noise pollution exposure from a major commercial-service airport. It addresses the issue of whether people moved to the aviation noise-impacted areas or the noise encroached on the people, and controls for economic and political costs as well as the possibility of racial and ethnic prejudice. The results indicate that ethnicity is the primary cause of the disproportionate burden of aviation noise pollution borne by Hispanics in the area analyzed.

AB  - Background: Several studies have reported environmental disparities regarding exposure to concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Public health implications of environmental justice from the intensive livestock industry are of great concern in North Carolina (NC), USA, a state with a large number and extensive history of CAFOs. Objectives: We examined disparities by exposure to CAFOs using several environmental justice metrics and considering potentially vulnerable subpopulations. Methods: We obtained data on permitted animal facilities from NC Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Using ZIP code level variables from the 2010 Census, we evaluated environmental disparities by eight environmental justice metrics (i.e., percentage of Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, or Hispanic; percentage living below the poverty level; median household income; percentage with education less than high school diploma; racial residential isolation (RI) for Non-Hispanic Black; and educational residential isolation (ERI) for population without college degree). We applied two approaches to assign CAFOs exposure for each ZIP code: (1) a count method based on the number of CAFOs within ZIP code; and (2) a buffer method based on the area-weighted number of CAFOs using a 15 km buffer. Results: Spatial distributions of CAFOs exposure generally showed similar patterns between the two exposure methods. However, some ZIP codes had different estimated CAFOs exposure for the different approaches, with higher exposure when using the buffer method. Our findings indicate that CAFOs are located disproportionately in communities with higher percentage of minorities and in low-income communities. Distributions of environmental justice metrics generally showed similar patterns for both exposure methods, however starker disparities were observed using a buffer method. Conclusions: Our findings of the disproportionate location of CAFOs provide evidence of environmental disparities with respect to race and socioeconomic status in NC and have implications for future studies of environmental and health impacts of CAFOs.

AB  - A growing body of evidence has proven that urban greenspace is beneficial to improve people's physical and mental health. However, knowledge of population exposure to urban greenspace across different spatiotemporal scales remains unclear. Moreover, the majority of existing environmental assessments are unable to quantify how residents enjoy their ambient greenspace during their daily life. To deal with this challenge, we proposed a dynamic method to assess urban greenspace exposure with the integration of mobile-phone locating-request (MPL) data and high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. This method was further applied to 30 major cities in China by assessing cities' dynamic greenspace exposure levels based on residents' surrounding areas with different buffer scales (0.5 km, 1 km, and 1.5 km). Results showed that regarding residents' 0.5-km surrounding environment, Wenzhou and Hangzhou were found to be with the greenest exposure experience, whereas Zhengzhou and Tangshan were the least ones. The obvious diurnal and daily variations of population exposure to their surrounding greenspace were also identified to be highly correlated with the distribution pattern of urban greenspace and the dynamics of human mobility. Compared with two common measurements of urban greenspace (green coverage rate and green area per capita), the developed method integrated the dynamics of population distribution and geographic locations of urban greenspace into the exposure assessment, thereby presenting a more reasonable way to assess population exposure to urban greenspace. Additionally, this dynamic framework could hold potential utilities in supporting urban planning studies and environmental health studies and advancing our understanding of the magnitude of population exposure to greenspace at different spatiotemporal scales.

AB  - Background In the United States, 88.3% of all 1,163,000 maids and housekeeping cleaners are female, and approximately half of them Latinas. Latinas are understudied and underrepresented in health research, particularly involving chemical exposure in cleaning practices, lack of job training, and inadequate access to personal protective equipment. The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) to examine the knowledge (via training experiences), attitudes and behaviors of a heterogeneous group of Latinas who clean occupationally and 2) to assess their cleaning practices at work and at home. Methods This mixed-method study consisted of two phases: 1) three focus groups to explore knowledge (via training experiences), attitudes, and behaviors regarding cleaning practices (N = 15) and 2) a 43-question cross-sectional survey. Focus group audio recordings were analyzed using descriptive and in vivo coding and then coded inductively to explore thematic analysis. Statistical analysis of the survey evaluated means, frequency and percentage for each of the responses. Results Participants (n = 9) were women (mean age = 48.78 and SD = 6.72) from South America (n = 5), Mexico (n = 1), El Salvador (n = 1) and Dominican Republic (n = 2). The mean length of time living in the US was 18.78 years and over half (55.6%) worked in the cleaning industry for 10 or more years. Findings from the three focus groups (n = 15) included that training in cleaning often occurred informally at a very young age at home. Participants reported cleaning in groups where tasks are rotated and/or shared. Most were the primary person cleaning at home, suggesting increased exposure. Gloves and masks were the most frequently used PPE, but use was not consistent. For participants who purchase their own products, driving factors included price, smell and efficacy. Some participants used products supplied or preferred by the employer. Conclusions Latinas in cleaning occupations face a range of social and health barriers including lack of safety and health training, inadequate PPE and low literacy. To address these issues, the development of an intervention is warranted to provide training and resources for this critical population of essential workers.

AB  - A new political geography has emerged that stresses the political conflict behind the production of space. This orientation in the subdiscipline constitutes a turn away from traditional political geography, where the emphasis had previously been on the spatial distribution of political phenomena. The ''new'' political geographic theory has been applied to the study of environmental issues, turning the attention of scholars to the political struggle behind the construction of nature as well as space. This article reviews how the new political geography of the environment (NPGE) perspective has impacted the study of such environmental phenomena as hazards, siting issues, human-land relationships, resources, development, and international environmental governance. It concludes by suggesting how the NPGE perspective can inform pedagogy in environmental education.

AB  - Background: Graphical materials can be effective communication tools, and maps in particular are a potentially powerful means of conveying spatial information. Previous reviews have provided insights on the application of cartographic best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and considerations related to risk perception and communication, but none has reviewed primary studies of the effectiveness or utility of maps to users, nor have they addressed the issue from the perspective of health literacy, environmental health literacy, or public health ethics. Objectives: To systematically identify and review the literature pertaining to evaluation of maps in general, or specific map features, as environmental exposure and health risk communication tools; to formulate best practice recommendations; and to identify future research priorities. Methods: A health science librarian searched the literature for commentaries, reviews, and primary studies. Titles, abstracts, and full-text papers were screened for inclusion, and details of methods and results were extracted from 4 reviews and commentaries and 18 primary studies. This was supplemented by one additional review and 13 additional primary studies pertaining to use of maps for communication about wildfires and floods. One additional paper was identified by reviewing reference lists of all relevant papers. Results: and Discussion: While there are significant gaps in the evidence, we formulated best practice recommendations highlighting the perspectives of health literacy and environmental health literacy. Key recommendations include: understanding the map developer's societal role and mental model underlying map design; defining, understanding and iteratively engaging with map users; informing map design using key theoretical constructs; accounting for factors affecting risk perception; adhering to risk communication principles and cartographic best practices; and considering environmental justice and public health ethics implications. Recommendations for future research are also provided.

AB  - Background: Previous research has documented an underuse of long-term control medications among children with asthma, in nonadherence with national guidelines on asthma care. Objectives: To determine if factors related to access and quality of asthma care are associated with underuse of long-term control medication among children with asthma. Research Design: A parent-report cross-sectional survey conducted in 26 randomly selected New York City public elementary schools. Subjects: Five thousand two hundred fifty children, of whom 912 had asthma. Results: Twenty-nine percent of children with asthma reported using a long-term control medication. Among children with persistent asthma, defined as having one or more sleep disturbances due to asthma per week, 59.0% reported using a long-term control medication. After adjusting for demographic factors, children who had an asthma plan, had visited a doctor in the previous 6 months for nonurgent asthma care, or were enrolled in an asthma education program were more likely to use long-term control medication (odds ratios: 6.00, 4.11, 2.88, respectively). Children of Spanish-speaking parents, African American children, and children with no health insurance were the least likely to use long-term control medication (odds ratios: 0.51, 0.49, 0.20, respectively). Children who reported recommended components of asthma care were the most likely to use their medication with appropriate frequency. Conclusions: Children who reported markers of high quality, personalized medical care, were more likely to use long-term control medication. These findings illustrate that components of the medical care received, and not only the demographic characteristics of the patient, are key factors in understanding the underuse of long-term control medication in urban children with asthma.

AB  - Background: Criteria pollutants have been associated with exacerbation of children's asthma, but the role of air toxics in relation to asthma is less clear. Our objective was to evaluate whether exposure to outdoor air toxics in early childhood increased asthma risk or severity. Methods: Air toxics exposure was estimated using the 2002 National Air toxics Assessment (NATA) and linked to longitudinal data (n=6950) from a representative sample of US children born in 2001 and followed through kindergarten-age in the Early Child Longitudinal Study - Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). Results: Overall, 17.7% of 5.5 year-olds had ever been told by a healthcare professional they had asthma, and 6.8% had been hospitalized or visited an emergency room for an asthma attack. Higher rates of asthma were observed among boys (20.1%), low-income (24.8%), and non-Hispanic black children (30.0%) (p <= 0.05). Air toxics exposure was greater for minority race/ethnicity (p<0.0001), low income (p<0.0001), non-rural area (p<0.001). Across all analyses, greater air toxics exposure, as represented by total NATA respiratory hazard index, or when limited to respiratory hazard index from onroad mobile sources or diesel PM, was not associated with a greater prevalence of asthma or hospitalizations (p trend >0.05). In adjusted logistic regression models, children exposed to the highest respiratory hazard index were not more likely to have asthma compared to those exposed to the lowest respiratory hazard index of total, onroad sources, or diesel PM. Conclusions: Early childhood exposure to outdoor air toxics in a national sample has not previously been studied relative to children's asthma. Within the constraints of the study, we found no evidence that early childhood exposure to outdoor air toxics increased risk for asthma. As has been previously reported, it is evident that there are environmental justice and disparity concerns for exposure to air toxics and asthma prevalence in US children.

AB  - A sustainable world is one in which human needs are met equitably and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Human well-being is described by four primary elements-basic human needs, economic needs, environmental needs, and subjective well-being. These elements can interact in a myriad of ways to influence overall well-being. What makes changes in human well-being sustainable for a population or a nation? Two major interactional concepts can push changes in human well-being toward a sustainable state in space and time-social equity and intergenerational equity. The concept of social equity distributes well-being over space, ensuring the fair treatment of all members of society promoting spatial sustainability of a well-being decision. The concept of intergenerational equity distributes well-being through time, ensuring the well-being of present and future generations of a population or nation, promoting temporal sustainability of a well-being decision. The roles of social and intergenerational equity in terms of their influence on human well-being are examined with a focus on more sustainable decision-making.

AB  - A rapid transition towards a CO2-neutral steel industry is required to limit climate change. Such a transition raises questions of justice, as it entails positive and negative impacts unevenly distributed across societal stakeholders. To enable stakeholders to address such concerns, this paper assesses the justice implications of three options that reduce emissions: CO2 capture and storage (CCS) on steel (up to 70%), bio-based steelmaking (up to 50%), and green hydrogen-based steel production (up to 100%). We select justice indicators from the energy, climate, labour and environmental justice literature and assess these indicators qualitatively for each of the technological routes based on literature and desk research. We find context-dependent differences in justness between the different technological routes. The impact on stakeholders varies across regions. There are justice concerns for local communities because of economic dependence on, and environmental impact of the industry. Communities elsewhere are impacted through the siting of infrastructure and feedstock production. CCS and biobased steelmaking routes can help retain industry and associated economic benefits on location, while hydrogen based steelmaking may deal better with environmental concerns. We conclude that, besides techno-economic and environmental information, transparency on sector-specific justice implications of transforming steel industries is essential for decision-making on technological routes.

AB  - Background From 2006 to 2011, the City of Houston received nearly 200 community complaints about air pollution coming from some metal recycling facilities. The investigation by the Houston Health Department (HHD) found that while operating within legal limits, emissions from facilities that use torch cutting, a technique generating metal aerosols, may increase health risks for neighboring residents. Choosing to use collaborative problem solving over legislative rulemaking, HHD reached out to The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) to further evaluate and develop plans to mitigate, if necessary, health risks associated with metal emissions from these facilities. Methods Utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, we constituted a research team from academia, HHD and an air quality advocacy group and a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to draw diverse stakeholders (i.e., frustrated and concerned residents and wary facility managers acting within their legal rights) into an equitable, trusting and respectful space to work together. Next, we investigated metal air pollution and inhalation health risks of adults living near metal recyclers and ascertained community views about environmental health using key informant interviews, focus groups and surveys. Finally, working collaboratively with the CAB, we developed neighborhood-specific public health action plans to address research findings. Results After overcoming challenges, the CAB evolved into an effective partnership with greater trust, goodwill, representation and power among members. Working together to translate and share health risk assessment results increased accessibility of the information. These results, coupled to community survey findings, set the groundwork for developing and implementing a stakeholder-informed action plan, which included a voluntary framework to reduce metal emissions in the scrap yard, improved lines of communication and environmental health leadership training. Tangible outcomes of enhanced capacity of our community and governmental partners included trained residents to conduct door-to-door surveys, adaptation of our field training protocol and survey by our community partner and development of a successful HHD program to engage residents to improve environmental health in their neighborhood. Conclusions Academic-government-community-industry partnerships can reduce environmental health disparities in underserved neighborhoods near industrial facilities.

AB  - A transitional polity in the third wave of democratization may adopt many western institutional forms, yet its minority and disadvantaged groups may continue to face greater obstacles in addressing environmental injustice issues than those in more mature democracies. In a recent case in Taiwan, residents in a disadvantaged community were initially unaware of or reluctant to acknowledge the environmental harms that had been inflicted upon them. They were not mobilized until policy entrepreneurs from outside the community began to press the issue on their behalf by gaining their trust and support and by navigating various political and policy institutions, which at the same time were undergoing democratic transformations toward more inclusiveness. The case illustrates the interactions of identity politics and social movement leadership in the context of changing political opportunity structures.

AB  - Air quality monitoring has traditionally been conducted using sparsely distributed, expensive reference monitors. To understand variations in PM2.5 on a finely resolved spatiotemporal scale a dense network of over 40 low-cost monitors was deployed throughout and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Monitor locations covered a wide range of site types with varying traffic and restaurant density, varying influences from local sources, and varying socioeconomic ( environmental justice, EJ) characteristics. Variability between and within site groupings was observed. Concentrations were higher near the source-influenced sites than the Urban or Suburban Residential sites. Gaseous pollutants ( NO2 and SO2) were used to differentiate between traffic ( higher NO2 concentrations) and industrial ( higher SO2 concentrations) sources of PM2.5. Statistical analysis proved these differences to be significant ( coefficient of divergence > 0.2). The highest mean PM2.5 concentrations were measured downwind ( east) of the two industrial facilities while background level PM2.5 concentrations were measured at similar distances upwind ( west) of the point sources. Socioeconomic factors, including the fraction of non-white population and fraction of population living under the poverty line, were not correlated with increases in PM2.5 or NO2 concentration. The analysis conducted here highlights differences in PM2.5 concentration within site groupings that have similar land use thus demonstrating the utility of a dense sensor network. Our network captures temporospatial pollutant patterns that sparse regulatory networks cannot.

AB  - A transformation to sustainability calls for radical and systemic societal shifts. Yet what this entails in practice and who the agents of this radical transformation are require further elaboration. This article recenters the role of environmental justice movements in transformations, arguing that the systemic, multi-dimensional and intersectional approach inherent in EJ activism is uniquely placed to contribute to the realization of equitable sustainable futures. Based on a perspective of conflict as productive, and a "conflict transformation" approach that can address the root issues of ecological conflicts and promote the emergence of alternatives, we lay out a conceptual framework for understanding transformations through a power analysis that aims to confront and subvert hegemonic power relations; that is, multi-dimensional and intersectional; balancing ecological concerns with social, economic, cultural and democratic spheres; and is multi-scalar, and mindful of impacts across place and space. Such a framework can help analyze and recognize the contribution of grassroots EJ movements to societal transformations to sustainability and support and aid radical transformation processes. While transitions literature tends to focus on artifacts and technologies, we suggest that a resistance-centred perspective focuses on the creation of new subjectivities, power relations, values and institutions. This recenters the agency of those who are engaged in the creation and recuperation of ecological and new ways of being in the world in the needed transformation.

AB  - At COP20 in Lima, Peru, there was a measurably diminished youth presence within the conference venue. This chapter focuses on the various climate justice movements seen at the COP in an effort to highlight the younger generation's passion to see change in the best way possible, rather than the easiest way possible. In addition, this chapter examines the ways in which individuals can effectively communicate the reality and urgency of the climate issue to those who may still be uninformed. These tactics include highlighting how to appeal to a wider audience and focusing on the appeals of social media as a new stage for major climate communication efforts.

AB  - Background Numerous studies conducted in the United States found associations between prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM) and adverse birth outcomes, and some studies identified vulnerable populations, including certain racial/ethnic groups and people with low-socioeconomic status. However, their findings are not always consistent. In this review, we compared the risk of adverse birth outcomes due to PM exposures among subpopulations and investigated whether any particular population is more vulnerable. Methods We selected U.S. studies examining associations between PM exposure during pregnancy and birth outcomes that included results for effect modification by race/ethnicity and/or maternal education. We summarized the findings for various sizes of PM and birth outcomes. Meta-analysis was conducted to quantify vulnerable race/ethnicity for the association between fine PM (PM2.5) and birthweight. Results In total, 19 studies were assessed, and PM-related risks of adverse birth outcomes, particularly those related to fetal growth, likely differ across subpopulations. A meta-analysis from five studies showed that a 10 mu g/m(3)increase of PM(2.5)during the full-gestation reduced birthweight by 21.9 g (95% confidence interval 11.7, 32.0), 15.7 g (10.1, 21.4), 9.3 g (2.7, 15.8), and 5.8 g (- 9.0, 20.7) for Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian mothers, respectively. Conclusion Our review indicated that Black mothers and mothers with low educational attainment are more vulnerable subpopulations. More investigation is needed for effect modification by other maternal factors, such as household income. Characterizing and quantifying vulnerable subpopulations are essential for addressing environmental justice since it can help regulatory agencies allocate resources and design policy interventions.

AB  - Although there is a robust body of literature exploring the relationship between biophilic urban planning (BUP) and public health and well-being, there is a dearth of scholarship on the emotional components of BUP. It is crucial to understand these sentiment-related elements, so planners can assign "human value" to green spaces as a strategy for emphasizing the need to thoughtfully implement and properly maintain them in urban environments. Furthermore, humans' emotional experiences with green spaces may also reveal hidden or unexpected functions of those spaces. To confirm this lack of emphasis on emotions in BUP, we used Scopus to conduct a bibliometric analysis on relevant literature published within the last twenty years (2001-2021), ultimately collecting 589 relevant peer-reviewed articles. We then utilized VOSviewer (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands) to visualize our results and identify thematic, geographic, authorship/co-authorship, publication, and temporal trends. "Green space" appeared as our most frequently occurring keyword and scholars affiliated with institutions located within the United States, the United Kingdom and China were the top producers of relevant results. Our authorship analysis resulted in 67 different clusters and three major but isolated networks. Urban Forestry and Urban Greening was the most prevalent source of publication and 2019-2021 was the most prolific period of activity to date. While the goal of our review is to underscore the dearth of controlled, interdisciplinary research on the emotional components of BUP, we also uncovered additional key gaps in scholarship that could promote future avenues of inquiry. First, by focusing on the emotional value of green spaces, practitioners can ascribe them an intangible "human value" that could, in turn, generate more community-focused designs that provide access across socioeconomic, racial and age brackets. Second, an increase in scholarly representation from developing countries could help address the "human value" of green spaces not simply as a "first-world" phenomenon. Finally, a global focus on the emotional, human connections to green spaces may help scholars and practitioners alike mitigate the growing trend of green gentrification.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma management is an environmental justice concern for immigrant Latino parents. Photovoice methods have empowered our community-based participatory research (CBPR) team of Latino parents of children with asthma to investigate and educate others about indoor environmental threats in our community. Methods: Data collection and management in evaluating interventions in such settings is under-described in the literature. We developed a culturally tailored educational intervention, guided by social cognitive theory, using photographs from our archive. We pilot tested this intervention with a convenience sample of Latino parents (n = 19) attending an English language literacy class. We designed and implemented a pre- and post-evaluation survey on self-efficacy and knowledge and collected observational notes. However, we found that the responses to the knowledge questions were of limited value. Lessons Learned: We describe the lessons we learned regarding data collection, management and evaluation. Conclusions: We provide suggestions for improving survey design and data management for culturally tailored educational interventions.

AB  - Across the United States, development, gentrification, and water quality degradation have altered our access to the coasts, redistributing the benefits from those spaces. Building on prior coastal and green space access research, we examined different populations' relative travel distances to all public coastal access and to public marine swimming beaches across the state of Rhode Island, by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomics. Next, we assessed relative travel distances to high quality public coastal amenities, i.e., sites with no history of water quality impairment. We used three state-level policy attributes to identify sites with the best water quality: Clean Water Act Section 303(d) impaired waters, shellfishing restrictions, and bacterial beach closure histories. Our analysis revealed statewide disparities in access to Rhode Island's public coastal amenities. With robust socioeconomic and geographic controls, race and ethnicity remained strongly correlated to travel distance. Higher proportions of Black and Latinx populations in census block groups were associated with longer travel distances to public access, in particular to public coastal sites with better water quality and to public swimming beaches. This translates to added costs on each trip for areas with higher Black and Latinx populations.

AB  - Background Children residing in communities near metalworking industries are vulnerable to multiple toxic metal exposures. Understanding biomarkers of exposure to multiple toxic metals is important to characterize cumulative burden and to distinguish potential exposure sources in such environmental justice neighborhoods impacted by industrial operations. Exposure to metal mixtures has not been well-characterized among children residing in the United States, and is understudied in communities of color. Methods In this study we used toenail clippings, a noninvasive biomarker, to assess exposure to arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), and vanadium (V). We used nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify "source" signatures and patterns of exposure among predominantly working class Latinx children residing near an industrial corridor in Southeast Los Angeles County. Additionally, we investigated the association between participant demographic, spatial, and dietary characteristics with identified metal signatures. Results Through NMF, we identified three groupings (source factors) for the metal concentrations in children's toenails. A grouping composed of Sb, Pb, As, and Cd, was identified as a potential industrial source factor, reflective of known airborne elemental emissions in the industrial corridor. We further identified a manganese source factor primarily composed of Mn, and a potential dietary source factor driven by Se and Hg. We observed differences in the industrial source factor by age of participants, while the dietary source factor varied by neighborhood. Conclusion Utilizing an unsupervised dimension reduction technique (NMF), we identified a "source signature" of contamination in toenail samples from children living near metalworking industry. Investigating patterns and sources of exposures in cumulatively burdened communities is necessary to identify appropriate public health interventions.

AB  - As user charging increasingly supplements taxation as a transport financing mechanism worldwide, the need to measure and understand its distributional impacts across affected groups grows more critical. The case of the 185-km Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project in the Johannesburg Pretoria area of South Africa offers an opportunity to empirically examine the equity impacts of large-scale road pricing in middle-income countries. The paper reports on the novel use of GPS data from multiple sources to assess the distribution of benefits and costs of electronic tolling across passenger and freight users. GPS data from commercial truck fleets are combined with multiday GPS tracks from a panel of private vehicle drivers to derive measures of user benefit by class. Compared with an alternative hypothecated fuel tax, electronic tolling is more progressive in regard to income and vehicle class because such tolling transfers costs from private to commercial vehicles, in line with the greater pavement damage caused by trucks. Time-of-day discounts favoring commercial vehicles suggests that the injudicious application of discounts and exemptions can distort rather than enhance equity in road pricing projects.

AB  - As urban greening has become a prevalent tool in the context of global climate governance, this paper examines Lisbon's greening strategies in the context of its election as European Green Capital 2020. While applying an analytical framework based on environmental justice, we perform a cross-analysis of the city-wide greening strategies, together with a peculiar and unusual planning process for a new green space in the neighbourhood of Marvila. Based on qualitative research carried outin-situ, we argue that Lisbon's greening strategies are based on a discourse of ecological benefits, without aiming to ensure access to green space for different population groups. Procedural justice concerns are widely undervalued, resulting in limited space available for community involvement. We show how urban greening is essentially a multiscalar exercise, impacted by and affecting multiple scales simultaneously. Hence procedural justice deserves a much more prominent role in urban greening, as participation and recognition can give local communities the opportunity to adapt global urban agendas toward their particular needs and desires. Our findings lead us to conclude that environmental justice is ultimately an exercise of multiscalar governance, where local decision-making needs to attend to contextual challenges but also to a long-term sustainability vision at a larger scale.

AB  - Agriculture in the United States employs youth ages ten and older in work environments with high pesticide levels. Younger children in rural areas may also be affected by indirect pesticide exposures. The long-term effects of pesticides on health and development are difficult to assess and poorly understood. Yet, epidemiologic studies suggest associations with cancer as well as cognitive deficits. We report a practical and cost-effective approach to assess environmental pesticide exposures and their biological consequences in children. Our approach combines silicone wristband personal samplers and DNA damage quantification from hair follicles, and was tested as part of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project involving ten Latino children from farmworker households in North Carolina. Our study documents high acceptance among Latino children and their caregivers of these noninvasive sampling methods. The personal samplers detected organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids in the majority of the participants (70%, 90%, 80%, respectively). Pesticides were detected in all participant samplers, with an average of 6.2 +/- 2.4 detections/participant sampler. DNA damage in epithelial cells from the sheath and bulb of plucked hairs follicles was quantified by immunostaining 53BP1-labled DNA repair foci. This method is sensitive, as shown by dose response analyses to gamma radiations where the lowest dose tested (0.1 Gy) led to significant increased 53BP1 foci density. Immunolabeling of DNA repair foci has significant advantages over the comet assay in that specific regions of the follicles can be analyzed. In this cohort of child participants, significant association was found between the number of pesticide detections and DNA damage in the papilla region of the hairs. We anticipate that this monitoring approach of bioavailable pesticides and genotoxicity will enhance our knowledge of the biological effects of pesticides to guide education programs and safety policies.

AB  - Background: Exposure to fine particulate matter (<2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter, PM2.5 ) pollution, even at low concentrations is associated with increased mortality. Estimates of the magnitude of the effect of particulate air pollution on mortality are generally done on a coarse spatial scale, such as 0.5 degrees, and may fail to capture small spatial differences in exposure and baseline rates, which can bias results and impede the ability to consider environmental justice. We estimated the burden of mortality attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 among adults in the Continental United States on a 1 km scale, in order to provide information for decision makers setting health priorities. Methods: We conducted a health impact assessment for 2015 using a model predicting U.S. PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 1 km cells. We applied a concentration-response curve from a recently published meta-analysis of long-term PM2.5 mortality association which incorporates new findings at high and low PM2.5 concentrations. We computed the change in deaths in each grid cell, based on its grid cell population, Zip code level baseline mortality rates, and exposure under two scenarios; a decrease of PM2.5 exposure levels by 40% and a decrease of PM2.5 exposure levels to the county minimum PM2.5 concentrations. Results: We estimated the deaths would fall by 104,786 (95% CI 57,016-135,726) and 112,040 (95% CI 63,261-159,116) attributable to 40% reduction and reduction to the county minimum PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The greatest mortality impact due to 40% reduction in PM2.5 was observed in California with; 11,621 (95% CI; 7156-15,989) and Texas with; 9616 (95% CI; 5798-13,352) excess deaths attributable to annual mean PM2.5 concentrations of 9.54 and 9.12 mu g m(-)(3), respectively. Within city analyses showed substantial heterogeneity in risk. The estimated Attributable fraction (AF %) in locations with high PM2.5 levels was 8.6% (95% CI 5.4-11.7) compared to the overall AF% of 4.9% (95% CI; 2.9-6.8). In comparison, results using county average PM2.5 were smaller than the estimates from the 1 km PM2.5 datasets. Similarly, estimates using county-level mortality rates were smaller than estimates based on Zip-code level mortality rates. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of major health benefits expected from reducing PM2.5 exposure, even in regions with relatively low PM2.5 concentrations. Spatial characteristics of exposure and baseline mortality (e.g., accuracy, scales, and variations) in disease burden studies can significantly impact the results.

AB  - Background: Recent empirical studies stress the impact of features related to the small-area context on individual health. However, so far there exists no standard explanatory model that integrates the different kinds of such features and that conceptualises their relation to individual characteristics of social inequality. Methods: A review of theoretical publications on the relationship between social position and health as well as existing conceptual models for the impact of features related to the small-area context on health was undertaken. Results: In the present article we propose a conceptual model for the health impact of the small-area context. This model conceptualises the location of residence as one dimension of social inequality that affects health through the resources as well as stressors which are inherent in the small-area context. Conclusion: The proposed conceptual model offers an orientation for future empirical studies and can serve as a basis for further discussions concerning the health relevance of the small-area context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjusting to incarceration is traumatic. An under-utilized strategy understood to buffer and counteract the negative impacts of incarceration are nature interventions. OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of an interdisciplinary design studio course focused on developing masterplans for a women's prison in the Pacific Northwest (US) are presented. Course objectives included comprehension and application of therapeutic and culturally expressive design principles to increase the benefits of environmental design within a carceral setting; collaboration, developing a deeper, more representative understanding of how design processes can improve the lives of marginalized populations; and enhancing design skills, including at masterplan and schematic scale using an iterative process and reflection. METHODS: A landscape architect, occupational therapist, and architect teaching team, with support from architects and justice specialists facilitated an elective design studio course to redesign the Washington Corrections Center for Women campus. RESULTS: In a ten-week academic quarter, six student design teams created conceptual masterplans for therapeutic outdoor spaces at the Washington Corrections Center for Women. Students presented their plans to prison staff, current and ex-offenders, and architects and landscape architects in practice, and then received positive feedback. CONCLUSION: Despite well-documented need for and value of nature interventions to improve health and wellbeing for everyone regardless of circumstance or situation, the project awaits administrative approval to move forward to installation.

AB  - A series of powerful focusing events established solid waste as a national problem in Canada and a provincial and local problem in Nova Scotia. The traditional approach, expanding and improving disposal options, was rejected at the provincial and local levels. Instead, both levels simultaneously developed and implemented policies that focused on maximizing the recovery of solid waste. In both cases, crucial to policy adoption was the reframing of solid waste from a useless by-product to a valuable economic resource. This reframing was the result of the intervention of powerful policy actors, environmental justice concerns, media attention, and the sustained presence of the issue on the agenda. This case study provides important lessons to governments interested in developing an alternative policy for solid waste other than the traditional disposal-reliance paradigm.

AB  - Access to affordable energy is a core dimension of energy justice, with recent work examining the relation between energy use and well-being in these terms. However, there has been relatively little examination of exactly which energy uses should be considered basic necessities within a given cultural context and so of concern for energy justice. We examine the inclusion of energy-using necessities within the outcomes of deliberative workshops within members of the public focused on defining a minimum-standard of living in the UK and repeated biannually over a six year period. Our secondary analysis shows that energy uses deemed to be necessities are diverse and plural, enabling access to multiple valued energy services, and that their profile has to some degree shifted from 2008 to 2014. The reasoning involved is multidimensional, ranging across questions of health, social participation, opportunity and practicality. We argue that public deliberations about necessities can be taken as legitimate grounding for defining minimum standards and therefore the scope of 'doing justice' in fuel poverty policy. However we set this in tension with how change over time reveals the escalation of norms of energy dependency in a society that on climate justice grounds must radically reduce carbon emissions.

AB  - A central concept raised by the climate justice movement is climate debt. Here, the claims and warrants of the movement support for climate debt is identified through an argumentation analysis of their central manifestos. It is found that the climate debt claim is understood as primarily restorative, in the sense that the environmental space of the developing countries must be returned, "decolonized." The damage caused by climate change also gives rise to a compensatory adaptation debt. The result is compared with an earlier study on ecological debt. Both concepts are framed within an unjust power relation between North and South, but there are differences. Ecological debt is mainly analyzed in terms of an unjust economic exploitation, which is congenial with its use as an argument for cancellation of Southern external debts; climate debt is rather seen as a violation of communal rights and territories, an argument for climate justice.

AB  - Although assessing green space provisions is essential to understand environmental justice, few studies have focused on the age perspective and the inequality in access regarding elderly people. This study aims at un-derstanding the spatial disparity in access to urban green and blue infrastructure (UGBI), with a special focus on the elderly. An enhanced "2SFCA" approach was applied to measure the per capita UGBI area by considering different vegetation types and water elements, natural attractiveness, street network, and the many-to-many relationship between the supply and demand locations. Using a case study in Hannover, Germany, this study applied two different "assumptions" of distance thresholds (the near proximity assumption and the far proximity assumption) of UGBI. Our case study showed that in Hannover, elderly people are generally not disadvantaged in their access to UGBI compared with other age groups, but that the degree of accessibility differs between neighborhoods considered. The study also showed that access limitations can be partly compensated by increasing the mobility of the elderly so that they can reach high quality green spaces located farther away. The findings recommend key locations for allocating green spaces and improving the connection between residential areas and UGBI.

AB  - Background With elderly people comprising a growing share of the population, landscape planners need to consider their specific requirements to enhance the opportunities for them to engage in nature-based recreation (NBR). However, few studies have spatially assessed the recreation potential, demand, and opportunities for elderly people in cities. Thus, this paper aimed to spatially model and investigate the NBR opportunities for and demand of elderly people in urban areas. A spatial framework based on the ESTIMAP recreation model was developed, considering special factors to better reflect elderly people's preferences regarding NBR at the city scale. In particular, NBR opportunities were assessed considering landscape aesthetics, various types of facilities, and proximity. The street network was used to understand elderly people's walking behaviours regarding green spaces and related facilities. Results A case study in Hannover, Germany, demonstrated the applicability of the proposed method. The results illustrate the spatial heterogeneity of recreation options for the elderly. Only parts of Hannover's green spaces offer high recreation opportunities for elderly people. Many of the existing green spaces lack diverse landscape components and sufficient supply of facilities, resulting in a compromise to aesthetics and recreational opportunities. Conclusions The proposed method contributes to research on spatial planning and environmental justice by incorporating vulnerable groups' preferences and needs in spatially assessing NBR. The planning implications highlight pocket gardens and greenways connecting communities and parks as development opportunities in the city.

AB  - Abandoned industrial sites known as "brownfields" have created severe environmental problems across the United States, affecting public health and the livability of urban neighborhoods. This article starts from the basic proposition that cities-not private parties, not states, and not the federal government-are in the best position to cleanup contaminated;properties within their borders. It explores the disincentives that federal Superfund law gives cities to cleanup these sites and the trouble cities have under this law recovering costs of cleanup from responsible parties. Absent congressional overhaul of Superfund, this. article recommends state law solutions to supplement federal law. It shows how California's Polanco Redevelopment Act has given redevelopment agencies the ability to recover all their costs of cleanup from responsible parties and how it has enabled cities in California to cleanup brownfields within their borders.

AB  - A successful 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) is vital to keep the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on track and put us on a pathway to avert the worst impacts of the climate crisis. COP both shapes and is shaped by its location and timing, and this must be utilised by people inside and outside of the official negotiations to make meaningful progress in the fight for climate justice. Because COP26 will be held in Glasgow, a unique situation emerges. Scotland's devolved government has a far more ambitious climate policy than the UK, which holds the official COP Presidency. As a sub-national government, Scotland has no formal standing to negotiate within COP26. These unprecedented circumstances offer significant opportunities for Scotland to use soft-power as quasi-COP hosts to champion change, and have a positive influence over the negotiations.

AB  - Background: Environmental justice research has shown that many communities of color and low-income persons are differentially burdened by noxious land uses including Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facilities. However, limited work has been performed to assess how these populations tend to be both overburdened and medically underserved. We explored this "double disparity" for the first time in Maryland. Methods: We assessed spatial disparities in the distribution of TRI facilities in Maryland across varying levels of sociodemographic composition using 2010 US Census Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) data. Univariate and multivariate regression in addition to geographic information systems (GIS) were used to examine relationships between sociodemographic measures and location of TRI facilities. Buffer analysis was also used to assess spatial disparities. Four buffer categories included: 1) census tracts hosting one or more TRI facilities; 2) tracts located more than 0 and up to 0.5 km from the closest TRI facility; 3) tracts located more than 0.5 km and up to 1 km from a TRI facility; and 4) tracts located more than 1 km and up to 5 km from a TRI facility. Results: We found that tracts with higher proportions of non-white residents and people living in poverty were more likely to be closer to TRI facilities. A significant increase in income was observed with an increase in distance between a census tract and the closest TRI facility. In general, percent non-white was higher in HPSA tracts that host at least one TRI facility than in non-HPSA tracts that host at least one TRI facility. Additionally, percent poverty, unemployment, less than high school education, and homes built pre-1950 were higher in HPSA tracts hosting TRI facilities than in non-HPSA tracts hosting TRI facilities. Conclusions: We found that people of color and low-income groups are differentially burdened by TRI facilities in Maryland. We also found that both low-income groups and persons without a high school education are both overburdened and medically underserved. The results of this study provide insight into how state agencies can better address the double disparity of disproportionate environmental hazards and limited access to health care resources facing vulnerable communities in Maryland.

AB  - Background: As part of the Charleston Area Pollution Prevention Partnership (CAPs), studies have been performed to address environmental health issues using various techniques including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping. Most of the mapping has been conducted by academic team members; however, there is a need for more community-based mapping to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of community-driven efforts to eliminate environmental hazards and health disparities. The emergence of public participatory GIS (PPGIS) has been shown as a way to democratize science, build community capacity, and empower local citizens to address environmental health issues. Purpose: This article describes the development of the Environmental Justice (EJ) Radar, a PPGIS tool that provides stakeholders in South Carolina with a way to raise environmental awareness and improve citizen participation in local environmental decision-making. We describe the functionality of EJ Radar and discuss feedback received from stakeholders to improve the utility of the PPGIS tool.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Odors can affect health and quality of life. Industrialized animal agriculture creates odorant compounds that are components of a mixture of agents that could trigger symptoms reported by neighbors of livestock operations. OBJECTIVE: We quantified swine odor episodes reported by neighbors and the relationships of these episodes with environmental measurements. METHODS: Between September 2003 and September 2005, 101 nonsmoking volunteers living within 1.5 mi of industrial swine operations in 16 neighborhoods in eastern North Carolina completed twice-daily odor diaries for approximately 2 weeks. Meteorological conditions, hydrogen sulfide, and particulate matter <= 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) were monitored in each neighborhood. We used mixed models to partition odor variance within and between people and between neighborhoods, and to quantify relationships between environmental factors and odor. RESULTS: Participants reported 1,655 episodes of swine odor. In nine neighborhoods, odor was reported on more than half of study-days. Odor ratings were related to temperature, PM10, and sentivolatile PM10 in standard but not mixed models. In mixed models, odor increased 0.15 +/- 0.05 units (mean SE) for a 1-ppb increase in H2S, and 0.45 +/- 0.14 units for a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM10 at wind speeds > 6.75 miles per hour. The odds of reporting a change in daily activities due to odor increased 62% for each unit increase in average odor during the prior 12 hr (t-value = 7.17). CONCLUSIONS. This study indicates that malodor from swine operations is commonly present in these communities and that the odors reported by neighbors are related to objective environmental measurements and interruption of activities of daily life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Industrial swine operations emit odorant chemicals including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and volatile organic compounds. Malodor and pollutant concentrations have been associated with self-reported stress and altered mood in prior studies. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a repeated-measures study of air pollution, stress, and blood pressure in neighbors of swine operations. METHODS: For approximately 2 weeks, 101 nonsmoking adult volunteers living near industrial swine operations in 16 neighborhoods in eastern North Carolina sat outdoors for 10 min twice daily at preselected times. Afterward, they reported levels of hog odor on a 9-point scale and measured their blood pressure twice using an automated oscillometric device. During the same 2- to 3-week period, we measured ambient levels of H2S and PM10 at a central location in each neighborhood. Associations between systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) and pollutant measures were estimated using fixed-effects (conditional) linear regression with adjustment for time of day. RESULTS: PM10 showed little association with blood pressure. DBP [beta (SE)] increased 0.23 (0.08) mmHg per unit of reported hog odor during the 10 min outdoors and 0.12 (0.08) mmHg per 1-ppb increase of H2S concentration in the same hour. SBP increased 0.10 (0.12) mmHg per odor unit and 0.29 (0.12) mmHg per 1-ppb increase of H2S in the same hour. Reported stress was strongly associated with BP; adjustment for stress reduced the odor-DBP association, but the H2S-SBP association changed little. CONCLUSIONS: Like noise and other repetitive environmental stressors, malodors may be associated with acute blood pressure increases that could contribute to development of chronic hypertension.

AB  - Alaskan wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe, but very little is known regarding exposure to wildfire smoke, a risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. We estimated long-term, present-day and future exposure to wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across Alaska for the general population and subpopulations to assess vulnerability using observed data for the present day (1997-2010), modelled estimates for the present day (1997-2001), and modelled estimates for the future (2047-2051). First, we assessed wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure by estimating monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels across 1997-2010 for 158 Alaskan census tracts, using atmospheric transport modelling based on observed area-burned data. Second, we estimated changes in future (2047-2051) wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure compared to the present-day (1997-2001) by estimating the monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels for 29 boroughs/census areas (county-equivalent areas), under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B scenario from an ensemble of 13 climate models. Subpopulation risks for present and future exposure levels were estimated by summing area-weighted exposure levels utilizing the 2000 Census and State of Alaska's population projections. We assessed vulnerability by several subpopulation characteristics (e.g. race/ethnicity, urbanicity). Wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure levels during 1997-2010 were highest in interior Alaska during July. Among subpopulations, average summer (June-August) exposure levels for urban dwellers and African-American/Blacks were highest at 9.1 mu g m(-3)and 10 mu g m(-3), respectively. Estimated wildfire-PM(2.5)varied by Native American tribe, ranging from average summer levels of 2.4 mu g m(-3)to 13 mu g m(-3)for Tlingit-Haida and Alaskan Athabascan tribes, respectively. Estimates indicate that by the mid-21st century, under climate change, almost all of Alaska could be exposed to increases of 100% or more in levels of wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels. Exposure to wildfire-PM(2.5)likely presents a substantial public health burden in the present day for Alaska communities, with different impacts by subpopulation. Under climate change, wildfire smoke could pose an even greater public health risks for most Alaskans.

AB  - Activists and scholars often describe environmental racism as an immoral and illegal dumping of toxic waste into poor, Black, and people of colour communities. Yet, the use of environmental habitats in (and with) which Black people are mutilated, concealed, and contained has gone under-conceptualised as a mode of environmental racism. I propose an expansion of familiar understandings of environmental racism to include the use of environmental habitats to commit and conceal acts of anti-Black violence. This proposition draws from an understanding that environmental racism includes the mutual devaluation of Black bodies and the spaces in which they inhabit. I ground this study in Afro-Pessimist and Black geographies thought, research on environmental racism and cultural analyses of Black literary and performance art. Finally, I draw from the spatial and racial analyses imprinted within James Baldwin's immense catalogue to put forth Blackness as an alternate human ethic imbued with political possibilities, an ontological conceptualisation which may push activists and scholars to seek redress beyond the policy rationales and recommendations commonplace among today's struggles for environmental justice.

AB  - Although urban green space (UGS) is an important factor in improving the well-being of residents, the problem of green injustice has been proven to be prevalent. Balancing the quantity distribution of UGS is an important way to solve the problem, but the effect is declining owing to many reasons. The general lack of evaluation of UGS quality in accessibility model leads to the insufficient understanding of real inequality and the inability to excavate strategies from the level of quality. Accordingly, this article first established an evaluation system for the serviceability of UGS (including size, outerconnectivity, inner-connectivity, diversity, eco-serviceability, and compactness). Based on the comprehensive floating catchment area method, the spatial distribution patterns and inequality differences of UGS quantity and quality accessibility under three traffic modes are compared. The results show that evaluating the quantity inequality of UGS may lead to overestimation of real inequality, and other functional advantages can offset the quantitative disadvantages. The government-led quality improvement intervention and the policy of enhancing residents' transportation capacity can alleviate green inequality. The finding confirms the significance of serviceability in improving green equity and provides guidance for government leaders and researchers on the development of UGS in the future.

AB  - Access to water is often inequitable, and perceived as unjust by stakeholders. Based on qualitative analysis of 135 ethnographic interviews in Bolivia, Fiji, Arizona, and New Zealand, we conduct a cross-cultural analysis to test for shared notions of justice in water institutions (i.e., rules, norms). A key finding is that institutional rules are a common concern in evaluations of justice, but institutional norms were prominent in justice evaluations only in the Bolivia site (where water access problems are most acute). Similarly, while concerns related to distributive and procedural justice were widely shared across community sites, interactional justice was only a salient concern in Bolivia. We propose that the study of water and other natural resource institutions will benefit from an expanded concept of environmental justice that includes interactional injustices and also a more explicit analytic focus on institutional norms, particularly for communities that face resource scarcity and less-developed economic conditions.

AB  - Accessibility is a crucial element reflecting the potential availability of parks. By conducing a cross-sectional study of 700 older adults sampled from 30 communities in Wuhan, China, we examine the association between the accessibility of parks and the health status of older adults. A varying two-step floating catchment area model was developed to measure the accessibility of parks for older adults that simultaneously considered the physical environment and sociopersonal context. Based on the results of a logistic regression analysis, older adults with the greatest access to parks experience significantly lower odds of cardio-cerebral vascular diseases, joint diseases and endocrine diseases than their counterparts with the least access to parks. The effects of the physical environment and sociopersonal context on the accessibility of parks and health status are also discussed. In general, these two factors jointly influence the potential alternatives to parks and participation in park-based activities among older adults and in turn affect the health benefits for older adults. This study provides empirical support for the role of parks in supporting healthy aging. It also emphasizes the need for more comprehensive economic planning strategies to improve park accessibility and promote healthy aging in transitional cities.

AB  - Access to urban green space (UGS) is associated with the enhancement of health and disparities in access generate issues of spatial equity and socioenvironmental justice. The aim of this study is to measure spatial accessibility and investigate access disparities to UGSs in urban areas of Harbin, China. A Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area method and spatial autocorrelation analysis were used to measure the accessibility and evaluate its distribution patterns in residential tracts. Bivariate correlation was employed to examine the statistical relations between demographic characteristics of residential tracts and green space access. The results show that most residential tracts have minimal green space access within walking distance, while a few have limited access within cycling distance. Additionally, spatial disparities were found with low-accessibility tracts clustering in the center of the city, while high-accessibility tracts were located in northern and southern suburbs. Demographic disparities were also identified in the study: females have less access to UGS than males, areas with a high birth rate generally have more access, and population density is negatively associated with UGS access. The findings not only indicate that Harbin has an uneven distribution and disproportionate provision of UGS for urban residents but also identify which areas and population groups within the city are disadvantaged in access to UGS and thus provide suggestions for future construction and provision of UGS.

AB  - Air pollution imposes significant environmental and health risks worldwide and is expected to deteriorate in the coming decade as cities expand. Measuring population exposure to air pollution is crucial to quantifying risks to public health. In this work, we introduce a big data analytics framework to model residents' stay and commuters' travel exposure to outdoor PM(2.5 )and evaluate their environmental justice, with Beijing as an example. Using mobile phone and census data, we first infer travel demand of the population to derive residents' stay activities in each analysis zone, and then focus on commuters and estimate their travel routes with a traffic assignment model. Based on air quality observations from monitoring stations and a spatial interpolation model, we estimate the outdoor PM2.5 concentrations at a 500-m grid level and map them to road networks. We then estimate the travel exposure for each road segment by multiplying the PM2.5 concentration and travel time spent on the road. By combining the estimated PM(2.5 )exposure and housing price harnessed from online housing transaction platforms, we discover that in the winter, Beijing commuters with low wealth level are exposed to 13% more PM2.5 per hour than those with high wealth level when staying at home, but exposed to less PM2.5 by 5% when commuting the same distance (due to lighter traffic congestion in suburban areas). We also find that the residents from the southern suburbs of Beijing have both lower level of wealth and higher stay- and travel- exposure to PM2.5 , especially in the winter. These findings inform more equitable environmental mitigation policies for future sustainable development in Beijing. Finally, or the first time in the literature, we compare the results of exposure estimated from passive data with subjective measures of perceived air quality (PAQ) from a survey. The PAQ data was collected via a mobile-app. The comparison confirms consistencies in results and the advantages of the big data for air pollution exposure assessments.

AB  - Although developing world cities are increasingly the focus of urban political ecology perspectives, waste remains an underexplored aspect. This paper helps to fill this thematic gap by using urban political ecology as a lens for analyzing flows of food waste in the Brazilian city of Diadema. The marginal urban poor in Diadema, as in most other cities in Brazil, lack access to affordable fresh fruit and vegetables yet must cope with a disproportionate accumulation of uncollected waste. Integrated organic waste management, consisting of decentralized household-waste collection by organized recycling groups, waste processing, and the utilization of food waste for composting and urban food production, is presented as way of reclaiming and recirculating urban natures for potentially positive socioecological change. However, it is a process characterized by conflict and potential exploitation, while broader structural conditions constrain the ability of the system to offer an alternative to existing waste-management models. The paper concludes with a call for further action-oriented research within urban political ecology to reveal opportunities for new socioecological futures which should occur at multiple scales and emerge from the lived realities of marginalized actors such as catadores (recyclers) and urban gardeners.

AB  - As the effects of climate change begin to materialise across Pacific Island nations, many exposed communities are considering migrating away from their homelands. Migrants' resettlement experiences can depend upon their reception in the host nation. However, it is unclear whether justice-based obligations will influence host attitudes toward climate migrants. Using an online survey of 238 Aotearoa New Zealanders, we explore how beliefs about anthropogenic climate change, climate justice and global responsibility contribute to public attitudes towards climate migrants. Overall, people thought more positively of immigrants in general than of climate migrants. Through moderated mediation analyses, we observed that people with stronger belief in anthropogenic climate change were more positive towards climate migrants. This pattern was related to people's beliefs about climate justice and justice-based migration approaches. Findings suggest that host perceptions of climate migrants are connected to being aware of the ties between greenhouse gas emissions and migration. We outline anticipated challenges and potential opportunities for both migrant communities and the nations in which they seek refuge.

AB  - A major concern of social equity and environmental justice is whether urban green resources are equitably distributed across the compact megacities of China. Many previous studies have evaluated the disparities in park access among various social groups, but few researchers have considered the heterogeneity of the built environment in residential communities. This study revisits an increasingly popular Gaussian-two-step floating catchment area (G2SFCA) model and mainly improves its two core parameters, the comprehensive supply indicator and variable catchment, in order to realistically evaluate park accessibility under different travel modes. We choose Nanjing city, China, as the study case in which to evaluate differences in public park access with respect to gated and open communities using our improved model. Moreover, gated communities have been further divided into three categories, which represent differences in a community's ability to provide daily physical activities, to more deeply explore disparities in public park services. The results show that (1) the spatial accessibility of parks in Nanjing city is not evenly distributed, with communities located north of the Yangtze River having inferior park accessibility; (2) residents who live in open communities are more restricted with regard to access to parks than those in gated communities, although they experience relatively small differences under the walking mode; (3) gated communities with no internal park ("club park") enjoy better public park services; and (4) residents living in 105 open communities and 167 gated communities without a club park can be regarded as the most vulnerable groups based on the lack of park services. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for policy makers to target specific communities of vulnerable groups for further urban park development.

AB  - Access to peri-urban parks (PUPs) has recently gained considerable attention because of the limited green space in urban areas that cannot meet residents' increasing demands for engaging with nature. Here, we aim to assess the accessibility to PUPs and monitor the underserved areas in the context of urban agglomeration, and to examine the inequities across districts with heterogeneous social groups. A Huff-2SFCA (Huff-two step floating catchment area) model was developed to evaluate the PUP accessibility. In addition, we adopted 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min as the threshold of travel time to identify the areas that are underserved by PUPs. Welch's ANOVA test (one-way ANOVA with unequal variances) was used to monitor the disparities in PUP accessibility among different cities, and a bivariate correlation was used to explore the associations between PUP accessibility and socioeconomic variables. Factor analysis (using varimax rotation) was then applied to cluster socioeconomic indicators into three factors, which were further divided into four quartiles. Lastly, the average value of PUP accessibility in each quartile group was calculated and compared to measure inequities. The Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), China's largest urban agglomeration, was selected as the case study. The results suggested the following: 1) PUP accessibility increases while the number of underserved subdistricts decreases as the threshold value of travel time increases from 30 to 150 min, and 90 min is a 'turning point', after which an increasingly small difference is suggested both in PUP accessibility and underserved subdistricts; 2) there are statistically significant disparities in PUP accessibility across different cities in YRDUA; and 3) the socioeconomically disadvantaged districts have fewer opportunities to enjoy PUP services, while districts with lower social status groups or higher ethnic minority populations were not treated unequally. Our findings contribute to the environmental justice paradigm by assessing the inequities in access to PUPs over an extensive geographical scope, which could help decision-makers formulate effective policies and strategies for improving nature exposure from a regional planning perspective.

AB  - A disparity in the distribution and quality of urban parks has been widely recognized as an important environmental justice issue. There is currently inconsistent evidence focusing on park distribution in high-density cities that can shed light on socioeconomic inequalities in park quality. To address this issue from an environmental justice perspective, the current study aimed to examine the associations between the quantity and quality of urban parks and neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation and ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, as an example of a high-density city. A total of 102 urban parks from 209 Tertiary Planning Units (TPUs) were included in this study. Quantity and quality of the 102 urban parks were objectively measured using Geographic Information Systems and the Community Park Audit Tool from April to June 2018. Findings of the current study demonstrated that the quantity of parks, quality of amenities, park safety, and park aesthetics were not associated with socioeconomic deprivation or ethnic minorities. However, compared to the TPUs with low deprivation values, a greater quantity and diversity of active facilities were observed in the moderate and high deprived TPUs. Moreover, the TPUs with a higher percentage of ethnic minorities were associated with parks with fewer active facilities, as well as less diversity of active facilities and supporting amenities. The current study provides key evidence of distributional injustice for urban parks in high-density cities and contributes to the development of urban planning strategies to address these issues.

AB  - As the intensity and frequency of storm events are projected to increase due to climate change, local agencies urgently need a timely and reliable framework for flood forecasting, downscale from watershed to street level in urban areas. Integrated with property data with various hydrometeorological data, the flood prediction model can also provide further insight into environmental justice, which will aid households and government agencies' decision-making. This study uses deep learning (DL) methods and radar-based rainfall data to predict the inundated areas and analyze the property quickly and demographic data concerning stream proximity to provide a way to quantify socioeconomic impacts. We expect that our DL-based models will improve the accuracy of forecasting floods and provide a better picture of which communities bear the worst burdens of flooding, and encourage city officials to address the underlying causes of flood risk.

AB  - Background: Parks provide ideal open spaces for leisure-time physical activity and important venues to promote physical activity. The spatial configuration of parks, the number of parks and their spatial distribution across neighborhood areas or local regions, represents the basic park access potential for their residential populations. A new measure of spatial access to parks, population-weighted distance (PWD) to parks, combines the advantages of current park access approaches and incorporates the information processing theory and probability access surface model to more accurately quantify residential population's potential spatial access to parks. Results: The PWD was constructed at the basic level of US census geography - blocks - using US park and population data. This new measure of population park accessibility was aggregated to census tract, county, state and national levels. On average, US residential populations are expected to travel 6.7 miles to access their local neighborhood parks. There are significant differences in the PWD to local parks among states. The District of Columbia and Connecticut have the best access to local neighborhood parks with PWD of 0.6 miles and 1.8 miles, respectively. Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming have the largest PWDs of 62.0, 37.4, and 32.8 miles, respectively. Rural states in the western and Midwestern US have lower neighborhood park access, while urban states have relatively higher park access. Conclusions: The PWD to parks provides a consistent platform for evaluating spatial equity of park access and linking with population health outcomes. It could be an informative evaluation tool for health professionals and policy makers. This new method could be applied to quantify geographic accessibility of other types of services or destinations, such as food, alcohol, and tobacco outlets.

AB  - Background Neighborhood characteristics have been linked to community incidence of COVID-19, but the modifying effect of age has not been examined. Objective We adapted a neighborhood-wide analysis study (NWAS) design to systematically examine associations between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 incidence among different age groups. Methods The number of daily cumulative cases of COVID-19 by zip code area in Illinois has been made publicly available by the Illinois Department of Public Health. The number of COVID-19 cases was reported for eight age groups (under 20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+). We reviewed this data published from May 23 through June 17, 2020 with complete data for all eight age groups and linked the data to neighborhood characteristics measured by the American Community Survey (ACS). Geographic age-specific cumulative incidence (cases per 1000 people) of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the number of daily cumulative cases by the population of the same age group at each zip code area. The association between individual characteristics and COVID-19 incidence was examined using Poisson regression models. Results At the zip code level, neighborhood socioeconomic status was a more important risk factor of COVID-19 incidence in children and working-age adults than in seniors. Social demographics and housing conditions were important risk factors of COVID-19 incidence in older age groups. We additionally observed significant associations between transportation-related variables and COVID-19 incidences in multiple age groups. Significance We concluded that age modified the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 incidence.

AB  - Although the environmental justice literature has extensively examined a number of notable demographic backgrounds (e.g. race/ethnicity, class, gender, age), it is relatively limited in exploring the environmental inequity confronted by groups with different social identities and the associated institutional causes that vary tremendously across national and political-economic contexts. This study argues that the household registration system in China, which creates pronounced institutional discrimination against and unfavorable social characterization of migrant workers, is a critical while often overlooked contributor to environmental injustice in contemporary urban China. We examine the connection between the share of urban population without official permanent registration and local governments' provision of public environmental amenities and infrastructure. Analyzing panel data on China's 290 cities from 2008 to 2014, we find that cities with a higher percent of temporary population tend to have a significantly lower level of wastewater and solid waste treatment facilities. However, the level of temporary population is not associated with public green space.

AB  - Academic literature has so far explored food democracy and citizen participation in agri-food system governance mainly in relation to the 'food' end of agri-food systems, and primarily in urban contexts. We argue that this focus can be usefully extended to agricultural production and to wider territorial processes occurring in rural areas. In this study, we examine the development of a grassroots movement demanding stricter municipal regulation of agricultural pesticide use and support for a more sustainable and localised agri-food system. The study site, located in the north-eastern Italian Alps, has in recent years been characterized by the spread of intensive agriculture, particularly due to the expansion of vineyards. Our conceptual framework brings together the literature on food democracy and just sustainability transitions, seen from a territorial perspective. We use this framework to examine the role played by civil society organisations and alternative food networks in municipal and territorial agri-food system governance. The results show how the grassroots anti-pesticide mobilisation played a key role in reforming municipal pesticide regulations and in slowing down the spread of intensive agriculture in the province. We also draw attention to the framings used by activists to gain the support of public opinion and local administrators. Finally, we discuss the role played by different forms of food democracy processes in facilitating the emergence of a territorial vision of just sustainability transitions.

AB  - Hundreds of human rights and environmental cases against corporations have been launched in countries around the world in the past two decades. This body of counter corporate litigation-legal actions that involve attempts to enforce legal or normative standards against business entities-forms a significant part of the legal struggles shaping the transition to a sustainable economy. However, the question remains-how does litigation against companies fit with the larger patterns of reform? In this paper, I draw on a taxonomy of sustainability litigation to describe three functions of counter corporate litigation: remedy, the search for justice through legal action; regulation, the enforcement of legal standards through the courts; and repression, the proscription of predatory business models. I argue that research into counter corporate litigation helps to illuminate the priorities for legal reform, including the integration of human rights and the environment into legal instruments governing corporate activities, transnational approaches to corporate accountability, and a willingness to challenge unsustainable business models.

AB  - How can politics be articulated or at least imagined by ill, impoverished and abandoned communities? This article documents how care is invoked by activist groups and local citizens in their search for ethical recognition and environmental justice in Puchuncavi, Chile. The authors argue that in a context of prolonged and systematic harm, care emerges as a way to render their suffering understandable, knowable and actionable, and thus as a mode of intervention that instantiates politics in different spaces and at several scales. At the interfaces of feminist science studies, environmental sociology and political theory, this article examines how care acts as a grammar to enunciate problems and make connections deemed irrelevant by expert apparatuses. Specifically, the authors ethnographically track the capacity of care practices to create therapeutic spaces of affective endurance and healing, and to produce new forms of sensual and ecological knowledge about beings, things and relations. These different modes of caring and being cared for, it is suggested, underline the capacity of care for the politicization of harm and suffering: to re-arrange what is visibilized, valued and problematized in the face of intractable environmental crises - a crucial objective for collectives removed from every form of politics. Care, as it is articulated here, is not a coherent and predefined programme, but a fluid and adaptable ethico-political set of practices and potentialities always concerning specific individuals facing specific problems in specific circumstances. If care is to be mobilized to craft more response-able policy, researchers should think more thoroughly about these multiple configurations of care, and the disparate ways in which they can contribute (or not) to invoke new styles and formats, new sensitivities and possibilities for policy-making.

AB  - Here we propose a framework for considering the justice issues of industrial cluster decarbonisation, a pressing challenge confronting many industrialised economies. Industrial clusters are large, multi-point source emitters, users of energy and employers of regional and national significance. In the UK, establishing low carbon industrial clusters is one of several grand challenges of industrial strategy. Theorising the just transition of industrial clusters requires concepts from multiple literatures. We abstract relevant themes from the intersections of the literatures of just transitions, innovation studies and sociotechnical transitions, and public participation in spatial planning, and illustrate their empirical relevance. The broad themes of our framework are (i) politics, space and institutions, with sub-themes of justice, democracy, financialization; (ii) new processes and procedures, with sub -themes of legal recognition of public concerns, community-based planning, community capacity enhancement and life cycle impact assessment; and (iii) correlates of acceptance and resistance, with sub-themes of envi-ronmental values, perceived loss of amenity, pre-existing politics, perceptions of just process and trust in the developer. The framework is intended to both guide the design of just transition processes ex-ante and evaluate these post-hoc.

AB  - Healthcare organizations are increasingly examining the impacts of their facilities and operations on the natural environment, their workers, and the broader community, but the ecological impacts of specific healthcare services provided within these institutions have not been assessed. This paper provides a qualitative assessment of healthcare practices that takes into account the life-cycle impacts of a variety of materials used in typical medical care. We conducted an ethnographic study of three medical inpatient units: a conventional cancer ward, palliative care unit, and a hospice center. Participant observations (73 participants) of healthcare and support staff including physicians, nurses, housekeepers, and administrators were made to inventory materials and document practices used in patient care. Semi-structured interviews provided insight into common practices. We identified three major domains that highlight the cumulative environmental, occupational health, and public health impacts of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used at our research sites: (1) medical supply procurement; (2) generation, handling, and disposal of medical waste; and (3) pharmaceutical handling and disposal. Impacts discovered through ethnographic inquiry included occupational exposures to chemotherapy and infectious waste, and public health exposures to pharmaceutical waste. This study provides new insight into the environmental, occupational, and public health impacts resulting from medical practices. In many cases, the lack of clear guidance and regulations regarding environmental impacts contributed to elevated harms to the natural environment, workers, and the broader community.

AB  - How do peasants assert food justice and sovereignty in Eastern Europe? How do their food practices connect with broader political conflicts and movements? Most scholarship on food and agriculture in this region describes small-scale farming as a 'quiet' -apolitical and unpurposeful -contribution to sustainability. This paper aims to expand the 'quiet sustainability' thesis by theoretically building on food justice and sovereignty theories. Since sustainability cannot be achieved without confronting the structures that reproduce oppression, food sovereignty - as the right of people to define their own agro-food systems - should be seen as a precondition for both greater justice and sustainability. Drawing on the case of a peasant association from Romania, Eco Ruralis, member of the European Coordination Via Campesina, we argue that peasants are not just 'quietly' contributing to sustainability but rather have been historically and systemically silenced and marginalized by various regimes of power. As testimonies show, such alternative practices are continuously devalued, threatened and marginalized but peasants also seek to re-politicize food. We posit that a movement for food justice and sovereignty is emerging in former socialist Eastern Europe, characterized by embeddedness within transnational movements against extractivism and efforts to reclaim the dignity of being a peasant.

AB  - Human health is known to be affected by the physical environment. Various environmental influences have been identified to benefit or challenge people's physical condition. Their heterogeneous distribution in space results in unequal burdens depending on the place of living. In addition, since societal groups tend to also show patterns of segregation, this leads to unequal exposures depending on social status. In this context, environmental justice research examines how certain social groups are more affected by such exposures. Yet, analyses of this per se spatial phenomenon are oftentimes criticized for using "essentially aspatial" data or methods which neglect local spatial patterns by aggregating environmental conditions over large areas. Recent technological and methodological developments in satellite remote sensing have proven to provide highly detailed information on environmental conditions. This narrative review therefore discusses known influences of the urban environment on human health and presents spatial data and applications for analyzing these influences. Furthermore, it is discussed how geographic data are used in general and in the interdisciplinary research field of environmental justice in particular. These considerations include the modifiable areal unit problem and ecological fallacy. In this review we argue that modern earth observation data can represent an important data source for research on environmental justice and health. Especially due to their high level of spatial detail and the provided large-area coverage, they allow for spatially continuous description of environmental characteristics. As a future perspective, ongoing earth observation missions, as well as processing architectures, ensure data availability and applicability of 'big earth data' for future environmental justice analyses.

AB  - How green spaces in cities benefit urban residents depends critically on the interaction between biophysical and socio-economic factors. Urban ecosystem services are affected by both ecosystem characteristics and the social and economic attributes of city dwellers. Yet, there remains little synthesis of the interactions between ecosystem services, urban green spaces, and socio-economic factors. Articulating these linkages is key to their incorporation into ecosystem service planning and management in cities and to ensuring equitable outcomes for city inhabitants. We present a conceptual model of these linkages, describe three major interaction pathways, and explore how to operationalize the model. First, socio-economic factors shape the quantity and quality of green spaces and their ability to supply services by influencing management and planning decisions. Second, variation in socio-economic factors across a city alters people's desires and needs and thus demands for different ecosystem services. Third, socio-economic factors alter the type and amount of benefit for human wellbeing that a service provides. Integrating these concepts into green space policy, planning, and management would be a considerable improvement on 'standards-based' urban green space planning. We highlight the implications of this for facilitating tailored planning solutions to improve ecosystem service benefits across the socio-economic spectrum in cities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Healthcare workers face difficult working conditions, particularly where HIV and tuberculosis add to under-staffing. Questionnaires, workplace assessments, and discussion groups were conducted at a regional hospital in South Africa to obtain baseline data and input from the workforce in designing interventions. Findings highlighted weaknesses in knowledge, for example regarding the use of N95 respirators and safe handling of sharps, and suggested the need for improved training. Access to supplies and personal protective equipment was the major reported reason for failure to follow proper procedures; this was confirmed by workplace assessments. Discussion groups highlighted the important role for worker Health and Safety Committees (HSC), including in combating stigma and encouraging reporting. Interest in data to support decision-snaking resulted in development of the Occupational Health and Safety Information System (OHASIS); further training of HSCs is still needed. Multi-stakeholder international collaboration aimed at building HSC capacity is well-received.

AB  - Human well-being is often an overarching goal in environmental decision-making, yet assessments are often limited to economic, health, or ecological endpoints that are more tangible to measure. Composite indices provide a comprehensive approach to measuring well-being in terms of multi-dimensional components, such as living standards, health, education, safety, and culture. For example, the Human Well-Being Index (HWBI) framework, initially developed for the U.S. fifty states, was recently applied to quantify human well-being for Puerto Rico. However, the paucity of data at spatial scales finer than state or county levels, particularly for social metrics, poses a major limitation to quantifying well-being at neighborhood-scales relevant to decision-making. Here we demonstrate a spatial interpolation method to fill in missing fine-scale data where coarser-scale data is available. Downscaling from municipio (i.e., county-equivalent) to census-tract revealed a greater range of variability in well-being scores across Puerto Rico, in particular, a larger proportion of low well-being scores. Furthermore, while some components of wellbeing (e.g., Education, Health, Leisure Time, Safety and Security, Social Cohesion) showed consistent improvement over time from 2000 to 2017 across Puerto Rico, others (e.g., Connection to Nature, Cultural Fulfillment, Living Standards) were variable among census tracts, increasing for some but declining for others. We use a case study in the San Juan Bay estuary watershed to illustrate how approaches to quantify baseline levels of well-being can be used to explore potential impacts of management actions on communities, including to identify environmental justice inequalities among neighborhoods. Spatial clustering analysis was used to identify statistically significant cold or hot spots in well-being. This study demonstrates how indicators of well-being, coupled with interpolation methods to overcome limitations of data availability, can help to monitor long-term changes over time and to better communicate the potential value of ecosystem restoration or resource management.

AB  - Human-induced climate change is bringing warmer conditions to the Southwestern United States. More extreme urban heat island (UHI) effects are not distributed equally, and often impact socioeconomically vulnerable populations the most. This study aims to quantify how land surface temperature (LST) changes with increasing green vegetation landscapes, identify disparities in urban warming exposure, and provide a method for developing evidence-based mitigation options. ECOSTRESS LST products, detailed land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and socioeconomic variables were used to facilitate the analysis. We examined the relationship between LST and the fractions of LULC and socioeconomic factors in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. A machine learning approach (Random Forest) was used to model LST changes by taking the LULC fractions (scenario-based approaches) as the explanatory variables. We found that vegetation features-trees, grass, and shrubs-were the most important factors mitigating UHI effects during the summer daytime. Trees tended to lower surface temperature more effectively, whereas we observed elevated daytime LST most often near roads. Meanwhile, higher summer daytime temperatures were observed on land with unmanaged soil compared to the built environment. We found that affluent neighborhoods experienced lower temperatures, while low-income communities experienced higher temperatures. Scenario analyses suggest that replacing 50% of unmanaged soil with trees could reduce average summer daytime temperatures by 1.97 degrees C if the intervention was implemented across all of Phoenix and by 1.43 degrees C if implemented within the urban core only. We suggest that native trees requiring little to no additional water other than rainfall should be considered. We quantify mitigation options for urban warming effect under vegetation management interventions, and our results provide some vital insight into existing disparities in UHI impacts. Future UHI mitigation strategies seriously need to consider low-income communities to improve environmental justice. These can be used to guide the development of sustainable and equitable policies for vegetation management to mitigate heat exposure impacts on communities.

AB  - In August 2018, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg started to strike from school on Fridays to protest against a lack of action on the climate crisis. Her actions sparked a historically large youth movement, leading to a series of school strikes across the world. Over the course of one week in September 2019, striking school children, students and other grassroots movements, such as Extinction Rebellion, called for everyone to participate in a global Climate Strike. This paper is based on comparative research with climate protesters in six cities: Brighton and London (United Kingdom), Montreal (Canada), New Haven and New York (USA), and Stavanger (Norway). Based on original interviews with 64 protesters, the study examines their knowledge, emotions, motivations, and actions in relation to climate change, including any lifestyle changes they have undertaken before or after their protests. Our findings show that protesters have varying degrees of knowledge about climate change, and have taken a range of actions in their own lives to address climate change. They also manifest a wide spectrum of emotions about climate change, and different motivations for taking part in climate strikes. These features are under-studied and dynamically evolving at the present conjuncture. On this basis, we call for expanded academic attention to human, emotional, epistemic, and seemingly mundane aspects of climate protests, their structural tendencies and relational expressions, and the implications for our ability to address underlying drivers.

AB  - Notions of cosmopolitan and environmental citizenship have emerged in response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But even if there are obligation of egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or obligations of environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as obligations of global or environmental citizenship. through identifying a core concept of citizenship, 1 suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that obligations of justice, even then they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as obligations of citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the obligations of environmental justice which it identifies as obligations of ecological citizenship, and the other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objection.

AB  - Japan's civic environmentalism combines a tradition of local protest and activism with a national environmental movement that is limited in size and policy influence. A strong legislative and administrative response to the country's severe pollution crisis of the 1960s and 1970s helped tamp down that era's wave of protests and keep the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in power. While the state has generally supported local organizations engaged in environmental improvement activities, it has erected barriers that limit the scope of non-governmental organization (NGO) activities and inhibit the development of an influential national environmental movement. The 1990s reforms, inspired in part by the citizen response to the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, made it easier for NGOs to attain legal status and raise funds. Yet Japan's civic environmentalism - by most measures - still lags well behind that of peer industrialized countries. The 2011 tsunami and nuclear crisis brought another opportunity for major reforms to the nation's civic environmental culture - but the evidence to date indicates that the much anticipated transformation is turning out to be of a lesser magnitude than many had initially expected.

AB  - PM2.5 is an air pollutant that is widely associated with adverse health effects, and which tends to be disproportionately located near low-income communities and communities of color. We applied a community-engaged research approach to assess the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in the context of community concerns and urban features within and around the city of Santa Ana, CA. Approximately 183 h of one-minute average PM2.5 measurements, along with high-resolution geographic coordinate measurements, were collected by volunteer community participants using roughly two dozen low-cost AtmoTube Pro air pollution sensors paired with real-time GPS tracking devices. PM2.5 varied by region, time of day, and month. In general, concentrations were higher near the city's industrial corridor, which is an area of concern to local community members. While the freeway systems were shown to correlate with some degree of elevated air pollution, two of four sampling days demonstrated little to no visible association with freeway traffic. Concentrations tended to be higher within socioeconomically disadvantaged communities compared to other areas. This pilot study demonstrates the utility of using low-cost air pollution sensors for the application of community-engaged study designs that leverage community knowledge, enable high-density air monitoring, and facilitate greater health-related awareness, education, and empowerment among communities. The mobile air-monitoring approach used in this study, and its application to characterize the ambient air quality within a defined geographic region, is in contrast to other community-engaged studies, which employ fixed-site monitoring and/or focus on personal exposure. The findings from this study underscore the existence of environmental health inequities that persist in urban areas today, which can help to inform policy decisions related to health equity, future urban planning, and community access to resources.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is an environmental neurotoxicant that has been associated with a wide range of adverse health conditions, and which originates from both anthropogenic and natural sources. In California, the city of Santa Ana represents an urban environment where elevated soil lead levels have been recently reported across many disadvantaged communities. In this study, we pursued a community-engaged research approach through which trained "citizen scientists" from the surrounding Santa Ana community volunteered to collect soil samples for heavy metal testing, a subset of which (n = 129) were subjected to Pb isotopic analysis in order to help determine whether contamination could be traced to specific and/or anthropogenic sources. Results showed the average Pb-206/Pb-204 ratio in shallow soil samples to be lower on average than deep samples, consistent with shallow samples being more likely to have experienced historical anthropogenic contamination. An analysis of soil Pb enrichment factors (EFs) demonstrated a strong positive correlation with lead concentrations, reinforcing the likelihood of elevated lead levels being due to anthropogenic activity, while EF values plotted against Pb-206/Pb-204 pointed to traffic-related emissions as a likely source. Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios for samples collected near historical urban areas were lower than the averages for samples collected elsewhere, and plots of Pb-206/Pb-204 against Pb-206/(207) showed historical areas to exhibit very similar patterns to those of shallow samples, again suggesting lead contamination to be anthropogenic in origin, and likely from vehicle emissions. This study lends added weight to the need for health officials and elected representatives to respond to community concerns and the need for soil remediation to equitably protect the public.

AB  - PM2.5 is an air contaminant that has been widely associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health, leading to increased hospital admissions and mortality. Following concerns reported by workers at an industrial facility located in Santa Ana, California, workers and community leaders collaborated with experts in the development of an air monitoring pilot study to measure PM2.5 concentrations to which employees and local residents are exposed during factory operating hours. To detect PM2.5, participants wore government-validated AtmoTube Pro personal air monitoring devices during three separate workdays (5 AM-1:30 PM) in August 2021. Results demonstrated a mean PM2.5 level inside the facility of 112.3 mu g/m(3), nearly seven-times greater than outdoors (17.3 mu g/m(3)). Of the eight workers who wore personal indoor sampling devices, five showed measurements over 100 mu g/m(3). Welding-related activity inside the facility resulted in the greatest PM2.5 concentrations. This study demonstrates the utility of using low-cost air quality sensors combined with employee knowledge and participation for the investigation of workplace air pollution exposure as well as facilitation of greater health-related awareness, education, and empowerment among workers and community members. Results also underscore the need for basic measures of indoor air pollution control paired with ongoing air monitoring within the Santa Ana facility, and the importance of future air monitoring studies aimed at industrial facilities.

AB  - Officials replaced safe water sources with contaminated water sources for tens of thousands of people living in Flint, Michigan, from April 2014 to October 2015. Overwhelming evidence indicates that the officials knew the water was potentially harmful to residents' health and property. This unfathomable disregard for the residents of Flint sparked national outrage and prompted criminal charges as well as multiple civil suits. Residents' civil claims included two strands of substantive due process: that the actions infringed residents' fundamental liberty rights to bodily integrity and to state protection from harmful acts by third parties, and that the government actions "shocked the conscience." The litigants also raised equal protection arguments that government targeted the community based on race and poverty. This Article makes three claims. First, it asserts that fundamental rights and equal protection arguments that challenge the denial of uncontaminated water face the serious, perhaps insurmountable obstacles that plague any call for new or expanded constitutional rights. Constitutional law is clunky and often formalistic. Doctrine and principles of judicial restraint here militate against categorically elevated judicial scrutiny-which we call thick rights strategies-of these and similar public officials' actions. Moreover, the thick rights strategies may entail liability questions that are not-as yet-judicially manageable. Second, it asserts that "shocks the conscience" arguments offer a viable alternative to a thick rights strategy. Properly understood, this test enforces a liberty baseline, even absent a fundamental right or suspect classification. This thin rights test is properly reserved for worst-case scenarios, not for garden-variety government blunders. Flint qualified. Third, it argues that this constitutional baseline liberty may apply to all environmental cases in which shocking government conduct elides established fundamental rights or suspect classification categories. Invoking it would not open judicial floodgates or risk undue judicial intrusion into regulatory matters better left to other government branches. It would maintain a difficult-to-flunk but critical liberty limit on extreme official disregard for human wellbeing and environmental justice. It also would provide space for the development of a potential fundamental right to uncontaminated water while allowing public airing of the serious harms to life, the failure of government processes, the citizen powerlessness, and the grave environmental harms that threaten multiple communities but impose their most horrific costs on the most vulnerable people. The Flint tragedy offers a constitutional cautionary tale that should be noted and heeded. "The Flint water crisis is a story of government failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction, and environmental injustice."(1)

AB  - Marginalized communities lack full participation in social, economic, and political life, and they disproportionately bear the burden of environmental and health risks. This special issue of Environmental Engineering Science, the official journal of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP), reports research on the unique environmental challenges faced by historically marginalized communities around the world. The results of community-based participatory research with an Afro-descendant community in Columbia, Native American communities in Alaska, United States, villagers in the Philippines, disadvantaged communities in California, United States, rural communities in Mexico and Costa Rica, homeless encampments in the San Diego River (United States) watershed entrepreneurs in Durban, South Africa, and remote communities in the island nation of Fiji are presented. The research reported in this special issue is transdisciplinary, bringing engineers together with anthropologists, sociologists, economists, and public health experts. In the 13 articles in this special issue, some of the topics covered include inexpensive technologies for water treatment, novel agricultural strategies for reversing biodiversity losses, and strategies for climate change adaptation. In addition, one article covered educational strategies for teaching ethics to prepare students for humanitarian engineering, including topics of poverty, sustainability, social justice, and engineering decisions under uncertainty. Finally, an article presented ways that environmental engineering professors can engage and promote the success of underrepresented minority students and enable faculty engaged in community-based participatory research.

AB  - Outdoor leisure experiences may represent an understudied yet effective pathway to promote connectedness to nature for urban park visitors. In contrast to outdoor recreation, this critical essay argues outdoor leisure more heavily emphasizes eudaimonic sentiments and intrinsic motivation in comparison with the goal-oriented and hedonic nature of outdoor recreation. It is further argued that two specific social psychological constructs, awe and solitude, may be especially useful in promoting leisure experiences in urban outdoor spaces. Relevant philosophical and social psychological literature is reviewed and synthesized to outline how land managers and environmental educators may facilitate experiences of awe and solitude to better promote contexts for experiencing outdoor leisure in urban parks. Specifically, reviewed literature suggests that utilizing the recreation opportunity spectrum framework and co-creative processes may be an effective path forward in better supporting urban park environments that are conducive to awe, solitude, and leisure. The review and synthesis of this research may ultimately guide environmental educators, land managers, and researchers in ways to more effectively support connectedness to nature via outdoor leisure experiences as an outcome for visitors to outdoor urban spaces.

AB  - In this commentary we trace an important change in the use of social licence for resource-intensive development projects. Social licence is shifting from an approach used by companies to improve relations with affected communities to a concept now used by environmental justice groups, non-governmental organisations and local communities to contest unpopular resource-intensive development projects. The term "going rogue" is a productive metaphor to explore this important change in the role of social licence. We focus on the different logics behind how social licence is being used by progressive groups to protest resource-intensive development, weak state policies and broader economic processes. We end by exploring what the shifting terrain for social licence means for the politics of resource extraction.

AB  - In contrast to well established techniques such as Environmental Impact Assessment and Whole Life Costing which have limited focus, Sustainability Assessment has multiple dimensions and often requires the incorporation of several intangible concerns, for example environmental justice and social capital. The complex social and political dimensions of decision-making for sustainability imply that traditional methods of participation and expert-dominated decision-making may not be the most appropriate approach. It has become imperative, therefore, to shift from this mechanistic viewpoint towards more deliberative democratic and perhaps iterative processes. This paper argues that Sustainability Assessment may be considered as an opportunity to put discursive mechanisms into action, thus empowering the civil society and enhancing local decision-making. Sustainability Assessment would thus be seen less as an analytical technique and more as a forum for dialogue with the potential for serving as a basis for avoiding or handling potential conflicts. One measure of its effectiveness could be its successes in consensus building. Such interactive processes provide opportunities for the participants to share each other's values. Through their involvement in this interchange of ideas and negotiations, the participants will become aware of each other's values, which may not be so obvious at the beginning of the process, thus making it easier to align goals and objectives. This extends the purpose of the democratic process from reaching a consensus to mutual social learning. The paper argues that the innovative and context-specific solutions required for realising sustainable development can emerge from democratic deliberative processes that form part of Sustainability Assessment. These deliberative processes will evolve as the participants learn from new and innovative approaches to sustainability development and assessment.

AB  - Manoomin, the Ojibwe word for wild rice, grows in shallow lakes and streams and provides physical, spiritual, and cultural sustenance as a sacred food and relative for Indigenous peoples across the Great Lakes region of North America. Unfortunately, Manoomin has been declining due to multiple environmental stressors. In 2018, an interdisciplinary group from the University of Minnesota came together with natural resource managers from tribes and inter-tribal organizations to understand Manoomin within its socio-environmental context. This partnership grew despite a history fraught with settler colonial structures of knowledge production and commodification. Based on lessons learned from building this transformational partnership, this paper describes ten tenets for responsible research: 1) Honor Indigenous sovereignty and rights; 2) Address past and present harms; 3) Be on the path together with researchers and Indigenous partners; 4) Recognize, respect, and value Indigenous participation and intellectual labor; 5) Encourage the robust exchange of ideas; 6) Recognize that documents formalizing a relationship are not the whole relationship; 7) Make a plan for identifying and protecting sensitive Indigenous data; 8) Be prepared to navigate institutional obstacles; 9) Seek, support, and collaborate with diverse students; and 10) Actively listen and be open to different ways of engaging with the world. These lessons can serve as tools to form accountable partnerships that enable robust, nuanced, and effective environmental science, policy, and stewardship.

AB  - Landfilling should be the last option in an integrated Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management approach. In the European Union (EU), the policy framework to protect the environment and the public health against the impact of health hazards related to urban solid waste management has been consistently implemented in recent decades. A growing interest in the negative impact of fires in waste landfills on the environment and people's health was reported in some European countries. In Italy, an increasing occurrence of arsons in MSW and landfills has been reported in recent years. During the summer of 2012, a multi-site arson occurred in the Palermo Municipal solid waste landfill of Bellolampo (western Sicily), giving rise to an environmental emergency of public health concern. Local health authorities reacted by creating an inter-institutional multidisciplinary task force with the aim to implement measures to prevent and control the risk of exposure by delimiting a protection area to be taken under strict monitoring. Environmental and epidemiological investigations were put in place by air, soil, and farm product sampling. A syndromic surveillance of the exposed population was conducted as well. The air monitoring stations system in place detected an increase in the concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like substances with the PM10 highest emission pick documented within the first 24 h and estimated at about 60 mu g/m(3). Levels of heavy metals above the limits permitted by law were detected in the top- and sub-soil samples collected within the two landfill sampling sites and also in other nearby sites. Non-conforming concentration values of dioxins and dioxin-like substances were detected in samples taken from farms, milk, and water. The health syndromic surveillance did not document any daily increase in the notification of emergency admissions related to acute respiratory diseases or any other health effect potentially related to the waste arson, but these findings were limited by the non-systematic collection of data. The experience reported in the present case report, as declined within the European Union policy framework and in the view of environmental justice, documented the need to structure a permanent collaboration between the different institutional actors involved in environmental and public health protection activities in order to develop specific protocols to manage events related to the occurrence of waste-related environmental emergencies or disasters.

AB  - New supranational environmental institutions, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the 'green' World Bank, reflect attempts to regulate international flows of 'natural capital' by means of an approach I call 'green developmentalism: These institutions are sources of eco-development dollars and of a new 'global' discourse, a postneoliberal environmental-economic paradigm. By the logic of this paradigm, nature is constructed as a world currency and ecosystems are recoded as warehouses of genetic resources for biotechnology industries. Nature would earn its own right to survive through international trade in ecosystem services and permits to pollute, access to tourism and research sites, and exports of timber, minerals, and intellectual property rights to traditional crop varieties and shamans' recipes. I contend that green developmentalism, with its promise of market solutions to environmental problems, is blunting the North-South disputes that have embroiled international environmental institutions. But by valuing local nature in relation to international markets-denominating diversity in dollars, euros, or yen-green developmentalism abstracts nature from its spatial and social contexts and reinforces the claims of global elites to the greatest share of the earth's biomass and all it contains. Meanwhile, the CBD has become a gathering ground for transnational coalitions of indigenous, peasant, and NGO opponents of 'biopiracy' and the patenting of living things, and advocates of international environmental justice. They have begun to put forward counterdiscourses and alternative practices to those of green developmentalism.

AB  - In this paper, we argue that a crossover class of climate change solutions (which we term "technological solutions") may disproportionately and adversely impact some populations over others. We begin by situating our discussion in the wider climate discourse, particularly with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Basel Convention. We then suggest that many of the most attractive technological solutions to climate change, such as solar energy and electric car batteries, will likely add to the rapidly growing stream of electronic waste ("e-waste"). This e-waste may have negative downstream effects on otherwise disenfranchised populations. We argue that e-waste burdens women unfairly and disproportionately, affecting their mortality/morbidity and fertility, as well as the development of their children. Building on this, we claim that these injustices are more accurately captured as problems of recognition rather than distribution, since women are often institutionally under-acknowledged both in the workplace and in the home. Without institutional support and representation, women and children are deprived of adequate safety equipment, health precautions, and health insurance. Finally, we return to the question of climate justice in the context of the human right to health and argue for greater inclusion and recognition of women waste workers and other disenfranchised groups in forging future climate agreements.

AB  - Just transition is a new framework of analysis that brings together climate, energy and environmental justice scholarships. It was originally coined as a term that was designed to link the promotion of clean technology with the assurance of green jobs. The Paris climate change agreement marks a global acceptance that a more rapid transition is needed to avert disastrous consequences. In response, climate, energy and environmental justice scholarships must unite in assessing where injustices will emerge and how they should be tackled. Just transition offers a new space for developing an interdisciplinary transition sensitive approach to exploring and promoting (1) distributional, (2) procedural and (3) restorative justice, termed here as a new triumvirate of tenets.

AB  - Objectives. To assess the extent to which drinking water violations in the United States differed on the basis of county race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status using the primary county served by the community water system (CWS) as the unit of analysis and to determine whether counties with higher proportions of underrepresented groups were disproportionately burdened with repeat violations. Methods. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate odds ratios of contextual environmental justice covariates associated with initial and repeat drinking water violations. We obtained violations from the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System. Results were nonstratified and stratified on the basis of population size served by the CWS. Results. Stratified multivariable logistic regression results revealed previously unobservable patterns in nonstratified findings. Minorities face significant challenges, including exposure to poor water quality. The most notable differences in both initial and repeat violations that we observed were among CWSs that serve large populations. Our most consistent finding was the positive association of initial and repeat violations with the proportion of those who were uninsured, irrespective of stratification. Conclusions. Greater efforts are needed to ensure that counties with higher proportions of minorities, uninsured households, and low-income households have access to safe drinking water, irrespective of the size of population served by the CWS.

AB  - In the context of a resurgence of civic activism to address climate change, we present findings from an exploratory research project on climate justice education (CJE). We conducted deliberative focus groups and interviews with activists, advocacy workers and educators in order to address three broad aims: to consider the ways in which different stakeholders conceptualise climate justice; to examine how teachers and activists perceive challenges to, and opportunities for, developing climate justice education; to explore the potential for recognising activism and civic engagement as an educational process, considering both activists' views on education and educators' views on activism in this context. Activists recognised the potential for CJE which is connected to social movements (especially youth-led movements), local communities, and addresses the affective dimensions of the climate crisis. Although our teacher participants shared some of the analyses of the activists, they were less well informed about climate justice as a concept and were more ambivalent about the prospect of learning through and from activism.

AB  - Internationally, globalization has been paradoxically translated into colonization. economic rationalist development, nationalism, and closure born of a fear of the implications of globalization and global markets for the least powerful countries, regions, and interest groups. Social problems in terms of the economic rationalist approach are increasingly individualized and citizenship models emphasize the responsibility of individuals and families. Many current human service and social policy models in Australia (as elsewhere) are nonsystemic (psychological, medical, education, crime prevention. and economic). The paper reflects on an experience of undertaking a study of the life chances of citizens in a remote region of Australia. This is a paper about doing systemic thinking and practice in Alice Springs (Mpwartwe, or caterpillar dreaming) as a social policy researcher attempting to use and advocating a participatory action research approach to social policy development based on a multisite, multimethod research design of perceived, expressed, and normative needs.

AB  - In many cities of the global North, city leaders are using greening as a way to compete in the globalized economy. Critiques of this development strategy typically focus on downtown areas, and many have noted that such processes often displace poor and working class people. Less studied are those areas that have not been fully incorporated into the postindustrial economy and where the struggles around social justice, economic development, and ecological restoration are still being played out. It is this insufficiently informed area of knowledge which this paper seeks to address and as to which we ask: What has been the impact of the green economy discourse in relatively more marginalized urban areas? Using industrial areas of Southeast Chicago and South Seattle as case studies, this paper draws on previously unreported qualitative data to argue that community efforts to promote environmental justice in these areas have the potential to redefine practices of green economic growth to incorporate social equity and community coherence. However, their ability to do so is constrained by the difficulty in challenging neoliberal discourses of the primacy of growth and the need of greening to benefit the consumer class. The paper contemplates the implications of the lessons learnt for greening cities in both developed and developing countries.

AB  - Monte Carlo methods are commonly used to assess the statistical significance of disease clusters. This usually involves permuting the observed outcome measure, such as the rate of disease, across the geographic units within the study area. When the variance of the disease rates is heterogeneous, however, randomizing the disease rate across the geographic units results in over-estimating the p-values in areas of low variance and under-estimating the p-values in areas of high variance. This bias results in under-ascertainment of clusters in urban areas and over-ascertainment of clusters in rural areas. As an alternative, randomizing the number of cases of disease or deaths proportional to the population at risk preserves the variance structure of the study area, therefore resulting in unbiased statistical inference. We compare results from randomizing rates with those from randomizing case counts, using county-level prostate cancer mortality data for the United States and ZIP-Code level prostate cancer incidence data for New York State, using the local Moran's I statistic.

AB  - Municipal airport owners and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regularly evaluate capacity and demand to decide if and when airports need more infrastructure. New infrastructure can alter the profile of noise, emissions, and land use, which may affect the quality of life for airport-adjacent communities. When the FAA and airport owners initiate infrastructure expansion, they must conduct environmental justice analysis to measure the distribution of negative externalities on nearby communities. This research investigates the environmental justice methodologies and narratives reported in planning documents for nineteen airport capacity expansions planned or deployed from 2000 to 2010 in the United States. The mixed-methods approach analyzes airport operations data, spatial demographic data, and planning artifacts to determine whether the environmental justice analyses were robust. This research proposes alternative metrics, the 'Risk of disproportionate impact' and 'Capacity strain', to further contextualize the presence of protected population groups alongside capacity needs. The main finding of the study is that the planning documents did not consistently detect environmental justice impacts, nor did they consistently confer importance to those impacts when high proportions of protected populations were detected. As a result, the social costs of collective airport expansion are unclear and likely underestimated. This study identifies two limitations that undermined the environmental justice analysis throughout the airport sample: (1) inconsistent methodological choices impeded the detection of impacts and, (2) narrative interpretations tended to 'null' the finding even when impacts were detected.

AB  - Much of the academic literature and policy discussions about sustainable development and climate change adaptation focus on poor and developing nations, yet many tribal communities inside the United States include marginalized peoples and developing nations who face structural barriers to effectively adapt to climate change. There is a need to critically examine diverse climate change risks for indigenous peoples in the United States and the many structural barriers that limit their ability to adapt to climate change. This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes' barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the Big Horn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture, which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater. Future climate projections suggest increasing temperatures, and changes in the amount and timing of snowpack, along with receding glaciers, all of which impact water availability downstream. Therefore, building capacity to take control of land and water resources and preparing for climate change and drought at Wind River Reservation is of critical importance.

AB  - In academic and policy discourse, the concept of urban resilience is proliferating. Social theorists, especially human geographers, have rightfully criticized that the underlying politics of resilience have been ignored and stress the importance of asking "resilience of what, to what, and for whom?" This paper calls for careful consideration of not just resilience for whom and what, but also where, when, and why. A three-phase process is introduced to enable these "five Ws" to be negotiated collectively and to engender critical reflection on the politics of urban resilience as plans, initiatives, and projects are conceived, discussed, and implemented. Deployed through the hypothetical case of green infrastructure in Los Angeles, the paper concludes by illustrating how resilience planning trade-offs and decisions affect outcomes over space and time, often with significant implications for equity.

AB  - In this article, we analyze the role of measurements practices in a public dispute about the impacts oft mining in the Netherlands. Drawing on studies of material participation and agential realism, we analyze how measurement practices shape he boundaries of subsurface objects . We detail how these boundaries become relevant for assessing mining impacts and show how this enables and constrains material participation. Simply put, if a process or thing is not measured into being, it cannot participate in negotiations about causality and impact. Our analysis shows that scientific conventions narrowly determined what measurements are credible and, consequently, limited the participation of other objects and processes in negotiations about damage and compensation. This underscores how ontological disagreements about the existence and measurability of subsurface processes affect what claims can be made . We conclude by discussing conditions for pluralist and equitable processes of material participation in measurement practices.

AB  - In landscape studies, at the turn of the twenty-first century, the concept of representation has been high on the agenda. Representation has often been understood as the expression of particular cultural politics of landscape, accentuating the socially biased and incomplete nature of textual and visual mediations of the world. In more recent work, it is possible to discern a shift from this emphasis on cultural representation to a fuller engagement with political representation. The concern here, crucially, is to understand representation as a core concept of justice, entwined with the social and material struggle over the right to landscape. In effect, to understand how landscapes materialise struggles over justice, an engagement with political representation is indispensable. As this paper elucidates, one potential consequence of the rediscovery of the political logic of representation is a rapprochement of landscape studies with environmental justice.

AB  - Objective. Methodological issues associated with the conventional statistical approach to environmental justice research, such as scale of analysis, continue to make assessments of environmental injustice problematic. Geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to facilitate multiscale analysis through the generation of statistical surface representations of both socioeconomic character and environmental risk. Methods. As a case study, U.S. Bureau of the Census and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data sets were used to generate statistical surfaces of socioeconomic character and environmental risk for the southeast Pennsylvania region. Results. Analysis of these statistical surfaces reveals that socioeconomic status decreases with proximity to, and density of, hazardous facilities. Conclusions. Further research calls for incorporating other relevant information, such as amount and toxicity of toxic release, into GIS-based statistical surface representations of risk.

AB  - In Buenos Aires, at the areas more affected by water pollution, we observe a process of construction of claims in which different groups question the environmental inequality. In this article we focus on a case study that examines the characteristics of these mobilizations, their public presentation and the construction of collective action frames in terms of environmental justice.

AB  - Numerous studies have revealed that accessible parks are associated with better health outcomes. This interdisciplinary study focuses the spatial equality of local parks in Shenzhen, China, and aims to investigate its correlation with the summation of mortalities for the top four causes of non-accidental death. The paper consists of two parts: firstly, the spatial equality of parks was assessed by several criteria including the Gini index and accessibility calculated by the Gaussian-based two-step-floating catchment area (G2SFCA) method, and then multilevel regression analysis was novelly used to explore the correlation between the equality of park and mortality integrated with geodemographic and economic factors. The results show that the residents living in city centre experience higher accessibility and more equality of parks. There is greater equality regarding neighbourhood parks provision than urban parks provision. Parks that are walking accessible have stronger correlations with mortality compared to all types of green spaces. Most importantly, the greater park accessibility is associated with a lower mortality whereas this relation no longer exists when the accessibility exceeds 47.72m2/ person, which is concluded that building parks moderately is suggested to balance the health benefits and land scarcity for the sustainable development of cities.

AB  - NIMBY phenomenon is a resistance to the polluting factories, public infrastructure and service facilities by the local residents. With the rapid development of China's industrialization and urbanization, NIMBY phenomenon will no longer be the case, while the research about the NIMBY phenomenon by domestic scholars has just started, especially on the various types of empirical research. Therefore, based on the reviews of literature, the author proposed classification of NIMBY and different hedging strategies for different NIMBY phenomena.

AB  - Nationalization was once anathema to neoliberals and the hydrocarbon-based corporations long closely integrated with the neoliberal project. Indeed, the origins of neoliberal advocacy for global economic liberalisation can be traced, at least in part, to the resistance of oil multinationals to nationalist governments attempting to assert ownership and control over natural resources. It is therefore striking that calls are now mounting from this quarter for the nationalization of fossil fuel infrastructures, to keep them operating as climate policy, loss of public legitimacy and changing market conditions increasingly make investments in them unprofitable, uninsurable, or uncompetitive. The Canadian government's purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline exemplifies what we term a 'neoliberal nationalization'. Neoliberal pundits and oil industry figures created the perception of both an immediate economic crisis and a longer-term crisis of investor confidence in Canada; these 'crises' were used to justify the nationalization. Critically, the government acquisition of the pipeline was framed as a temporary measure of last resort. The intention of a neoliberal nationalization is to protect corporate actors from the effects of their own irresponsible business practises, maintaining 'business as usual' by pre-emptively socializing the foreseeable risks of rapid capital asset devaluation. In the case of hydrocarbon infrastructures like Trans Mountain, state authority is called upon to ensure the continued profitability of private fossil energy extraction, even as global financial markets accelerate disinvestment from the sector in response to evidence that most fossil fuels must remain in the ground to prevent catastrophic climate change.

AB  - It is often argued that concerns about the equity of a global climate agreement might appropriately be addressed in the language of human rights. The human rights approach has been promoted by a number of international political actors, including the UN Human Rights Council. As such, human rights are instrumentally applied as a solution to what could be called the "justice problem" in climate negotiations. In order to assess the degree to which human rights could be a useful approach to the justice problem with regard to to climate change, four major issues need to be examined. First, there is the distinction between human rights as protection against climate change versus the right to emit greenhouse gases. Both understandings are found in the debate on climate justice, but they are often not made explicit. Second, the "human rights as protection" approach with a focus on (a) right holders, both presently and in the future, needs to be elucidated, as well as (b) the human rights principles that are at stake, and (c) the duties and duty holders involved. Third, the human right to emit greenhouse gases needs to be clarified in the context of subsistence rights and equal per capita emission rights. Finally, there is the question of whether the cosmopolitan conception of human rights is at odds with the goal of ensuring that individuals assume responsibility for their own carbon-dependent lifestyle.

AB  - In NYC there is a growing labor demand within the energy efficiency sector. Given the historical ethnic and racial disparities in employment affecting Puerto Ricans and other minorities, are there any governmental workforce intermediaries and training programs in place that address these disparities within the green jobs sector? This article attempts to answer this question, arguing that the involvement of community-based workforce intermediaries is necessary for New York City's Puerto Rican communities to benefit from this increased labor demand. Given the fact that Puerto Rican CBOs have been at the forefront of the environmental justice movement in NYC, these CBOs position Puerto Rican communities particularly well to overcome the green jobs gap. Two local initiatives that point to possible career ladders for Puerto Rican low-wage workers in the energy efficiency and retrofits industry are briefly explored.

AB  - Planners often use the phrase 'hard-to-reach' to describe youth, people of color, and people with low incomes, people from whom they need information but are unsuccessful in reaching. Consideration of cultural premises for communicating can help explain why some people are 'under-heard' rather than 'hard-to-reach.' This study uses cultural discourse analysis to study under-represented community group deliberations about transportation, convened through a model of public engagement for environmental justice. Data include transcripts of 29 group deliberations and fieldnotes. Analysis and interpretation of cultural discourses about public participation processes focuses on three radiants of meaning: (1) respect for users and sociability, (2) being involved and efficacy, and (3) having a voice and feeling worthwhile. The model of engagement in deliberative processes allows for a reconfiguration of notions of being, acting, relating, and feeling in which participants give themselves amplified voice and agency. It contributes to literature on public engagement and how culture is conceived.

AB  - Nature-based solutions have recently been embraced as one route towards simultaneously addressing urban environmental and social problems, but an emerging agenda has sought to ask whether and how the 'greening' of cities may actually reinforce inequalities or lead to new forms of social exclusion. Using comparative case-study analysis, this paper examines the extent to which nature-driven stewardship initiatives recognize and redress inequalities. We compare two urban contexts that have undergone significant societal transformations over the last two to three decades: Sofia and Cape Town. The comparison shows how nature-driven stewardship initiatives differentially address deeper roots of environmental, social and racial privilege shaped significantly by post-socialist and post-apartheid transition contexts. Instead of assuming a homogenous ideal of urban nature and focusing on questions of the distribution of urban nature and its access, this paper finds it is important to consider the kinds of social relations that are required to both shape decision-making processes and generate meaningful and diverse values and ways of relating to nature in the city. Furthermore, it finds that inclusive nature-based solution governance recognizes and redresses both inequalities in access and inequalities that perpetuate dominant views about what nature is and for whom nature is produced and maintained.

AB  - In the context of contemporary global climate and environmental change, both natural and social scientists have stressed the role green areas play in global warming adaptation strategies and in improving the healthiness of the urban environment. Indeed, in recent years these spaces have become central to institutional political debates and various policies have been designed for their valorization. However, little attention has been paid to rewilded urban spaces, recently defined as novel urban ecosystems, and to their socio-ecological complexity. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach that links natural and social science perspectives, this article aims to highlight the role of novel urban ecosystems in the reconfiguration of urban policies. Indeed, this contribution analyzes ecosystem services coupled with the hybrid, contested socio-ecological nature of four case studies in Italy characterized by grassroots socio-environmental mobilization. Data were collected through comparative quantitative and qualitative methods. The evidence shows that the specific ecological features of novel urban ecosystems are strategic in terms of actual and potential ecosystem service provision for cities and suggests that citizens play a fundamental role in recognizing and valorizing them. In parallel, these spaces, reconceptualized as contested novel ecosystems, emerge as controversial hybrid urban socio-natures that enable community empowerment and produce a heterogeneous, grassroots political space oriented towards urban commons and environmental-climate justice.

AB  - In this paper, the case of the Coastal Strip in Gdansk is presented. Gdansk has natural and cultural heritage of great value and is included on Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage List as "Gdansk-Town of Memory and Freedom". The Coastal Strip is a rare example of landscape with natural dunes located within walking distance from densely populated residential districts. Therefore, the economic pressure for urban development is extremely strong. At the same time, the rise of social awareness about potential consequences of urbanization brought numerous efforts by local activists and researchers to prevent further development of the Coastal Strip. This study consisted of assessment of therapeutic qualities of The Coastal Strip using a conceptual framework-a universal standard for health promoting places. The results demonstrated that The Coastal Strip is a health-promoting place, thus adding new research-based evidence against plans for urban development of that area.

AB  - Local tariffs in the form of household contributions are the primary financial mechanism to fund the maintenance of rural water supplies in Malawi. An investigation was conducted into the tariffs set by rural service providers to sustain drilled boreholes equipped with Afridev handpumps. A binary logistic regression analysis identified significant explanatory variables for the most common identified considerations when setting tariffs, 'affordability' and 'operations and maintenance (O&M) costs'. The results demonstrate tariffs collected less frequently and usage above the design limit of the Afridev (300 users) had lower odds of considering affordability and higher odds of considering O&M costs, than those collected per month and within the design limit. The results further suggest a recognition by service providers of an increased maintenance challenge. High usage, acquiring spare parts, and the collection of tariffs when repairs are required indicate an increased likelihood of considering O&M costs, conversely to considering affordability. The balance of affordability and sustainable maintenance is a perpetual challenge under decentralised service delivery. Investment into ongoing support and supply chains is required for the financial and operational requirements of water supply, to ensure payments for services does not prevent access to clean water at the local level and to achieve the 2030 agenda.

AB  - It is well documented that the colonizers of Canada have long coveted the ancestral homelands of the Canadian Indigenous peoples for settlement and development. With this end goal in mind, it is not surprising that there exists an extensive history of assimilative efforts by the colonizers with respect to the Indigenous peoples of Canada-for example, legal assimilation through enfranchisement (voluntary and involuntary) and blood quantum requirements, and cultural assimilation through residential schools and the "sixties scoop". Another form of assimilation is environmental assimilation, that is, colonial development on Indigenous homelands to the extent whereby Indigenous cultural activities can no longer be supported in the development-transformed environment. Herein, I examine Bill C-69, a Government of Canada omnibus bill, through an environmental justice lens in the context of development across Canada on Indigenous homelands and impacts on Indigenous cultural sustainability. Specifically, Part 1 (i.e., the Impact Assessment Act, 2019) and Part 3 (i.e., the Canadian Navigable Waters Act, 2019) of Bill C-69 pose significant threats to Indigenous cultural sustainability. Through an environmental justice lens, procedural aspects include the use of the project list and scheduled waterways, the discretionary decision-making powers of the Government of Canada representatives, and the lack of acknowledgement of procedural elements of the environmental assessment processes that are constitutionally protected in comprehensive land claims. While, distributive justice aspects consist of unsustainable development from an Indigenous perspective, whereby environmental costs and benefits have been (and will be) distributed inequitably. Bill C-69 is a flawed statute that reinforces the colonial policy of assimilation.

AB  - Parks provide critical ecosystem services to urban residents. Park access critically determines how parks are used by residents. Many existing studies, which mostly have been conducted in developed countries, reported that park access disproportionately benefits the socioeconomically advantaged groups. To test if this observation also holds true in developing countries, we examined the park access and its relationship with socioeconomic conditions in Beijing, China. We used a buffering method and a road network-based analysis to calculate the park access of 130 neighborhoods, and applied the Pearson correlation to examine how neighborhood park access is related to socioeconomic conditions. Our results showed that (1) the park access decreased from 76% in the downtown areas to 24% in the suburbs; (2) the correlation coefficients (r) between socioeconomic conditions and park access were all smaller than 0.3 (p < 0.05)-that is, explaining less than 8% of the variability. Our study indicated that neighborhood socioeconomic conditions were only weakly associated with park access in Beijing and did not support the common phenomenon in western countries. Such a contradiction might be explained by the fact that park planning in Beijing is funded and administered by the city government and influenced by the central government's policy, whereas in most developed countries market sectors play a critical role in park planning. Our research suggested that urban planning funded by governments, when aimed at improving the wellbeing of all urban residents, may effectively reduce potential environmental inequalities.

AB  - Morbidity and mortality impacts of extreme heat amplified by climate change will be unequally distributed among communities given pre-existing differences in socioeconomic, health, and environmental conditions. Many governments are interested in adaptation policies that target those especially vulnerable to the risks, but there are important questions about how to effectively identify and support communities most in need of heat adaptations. Here, we use an equity-oriented adaptation program from the state of California as a case study to evaluate the implications of the currently used environmental justice index (CalEnviroScreen 3.0) for the identification of socially vulnerable communities with climate change adaptation needs. As CalEnviroScreen is geared towards air and water pollution, we assess how community heat risks and adaptation needs would be evaluated differently under two more adaptation-relevant vulnerability indices: the Social Vulnerability Index and the Heat-Health Action Index. Our analysis considers communities at the census tract scale, as well as the patterns emerging at the regional scale. Using the current index, the state designates 25% of its census tracts as "disadvantaged" communities eligible for special adaptation funds. However, an additional 12.6% of the state's communities could be considered vulnerable if the two other indices were considered instead. Only 13.4% of communities are vulnerable across all three vulnerability indices studied. Choice of vulnerability index shapes statewide trends in extreme heat risk and is linked to a community's likelihood of receiving heat-related California Climate Investments (CCI) projects. Tracts that are vulnerable under the current pollution-focused index, but not under the heat-health specific index, received four times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under the reverse scenario. This study demonstrates important nuances relevant to implementing equity-oriented adaptation and explores the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities in quantifying vulnerability.

AB  - Inhalation during showering activities is a major pathway for exposure to volatile disinfection-by-products (DBPs). Disinfection-by-products such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) have been shown to significantly increase cancer risks and can also pose other health hazards. In multi-family residences and common-shower facilities located in dormitories and gymnasiums, the time-lag between showers is likely to be short and the exposure to vapor-phase DBPs may be significantly increased due to residual concentrations from earlier showering activities. Current models do not consider the impacts of the initial vapor-phase concentration on health risks to be significant. The hypothesis that non-zero initial DBP vapor-phase concentrations lead to higher exposure and health risks was evaluated here using data from the City of Corpus Christi, TX at two levels of input parameter uncertainty. The inhalation risks and hazards were found to be over 1.5 times greater for subsequent showers compared to the initial shower of the day. For non-zero initial air concentrations and triangular distribution of input parameters, the model was found to be most sensitive to the initial air concentrations, highlighting the impact of initial conditions on cumulative daily intake (CDI) and subsequently on cancer risks and hazard indices. Increasing the time-gap between showers and improving ventilation are viable solutions to contend with the increased risk. It is recommended that the effects of initial air concentrations be incorporated in future risk assessments focusing on multi-family residences in older and poor neighborhoods where single shower dwellings are more common.

AB  - This article sheds light on a challenge to the emancipatory potential of social media for social movements that has so far largely been overlooked: corporations' monitoring of individuals. In this way, it goes beyond the ways in which corporations draw on big data' from online sources and instead explores how they (1) monitor and (2) discuss strategies for responding to the activities of individual activists, specifically in social media. Theoretically, it draws on Thompson's concept of mediated visibility, Mouffe's concept of the (post)political and Carpentier's notion of the fantasy of the post-political. Empirically, it focuses on the oil industry and the climate justice movement in the United Kingdom. Here, it draws on files from British Petroleum (BP) and Shell on specific individuals obtained through Subject Access Requests under the Data Protection Act as well as press responses from the two oil companies.

AB  - In La Guajira, Colombia, in the 21st century, coal mining has increased, and wind parks and wind turbines are being planned, which will affect the Wayuu people territorially, environmentally, and culturally. The demands of NGOs, grassroots organizations, and Wayuu leaders seek to position alternatives to extractivism, articulated with energy transition and postextractives transitions' proposals. Faced with the demands of local processes, companies and institutions also pose energy transitions, which respond to other perspectives and interests, since they continue to be anchored to socio-environmental and structural inequalities and a socioecological fix that reproduce the same effects of extractivism. From the critical debates on green extractivism and the proposals for radical socioenvironmental transformation, I analyze the energy transition proposals around an institutionalized governance and infrastructures of inequality. At the same time, I arise from the demands of the Wayuu people to propose that a rethinking of socio-environmental relationships to radical socioenvironmental transformations. This transformation will be based on demands of relational environmental justice that take up Wayuu ways of life and reposition human-non-human relationships under other ontologies, and proposals. The work was carried out collaboratively, based on an ethnographic work and interviews with various actors.

AB  - In recent years, several actors at the sub-national level (e.g. California, British Columbia, New York City) have taken unilateral steps to mitigate climate change by reducing their emissions. These developments have commanded considerable attention in the empirical literature. In this piece, we consider the philosophical dimensions of climate action at the sub-national level. Specifically, we argue that climate action at the sub-national level is an instance of a more general class of cases in which the failure of some collective agent to discharge some duty to which it is subject entails duties for the sub-collectives of which it is comprised to partially discharge that duty. We begin, then, with a discussion of such cases, and a defence of the devolution principle, which sets out conditions under which such duties arise. We then set out the argument with respect to sub-national political communities' duties to take action on climate change, specifically. The article concludes by considering complications arising out of the inevitable fact of partial compliance, drawing upon recent work in the literature on slack-taking duties.

AB  - National experience has shown that perceived inequity to disadvantaged communities can derail the consideration of proposed toll and pricing projects. Even in areas with existing toll facilities, new proposals are not immune from fairness criticisms. Left unanswered, fairness issues may overwhelm public opinion and potentially elicit legal concerns. Five general types of equity apply to toll and priced facilities: geographic, income, participation, opportunity, and modal equity. The first two issues are generally more important in the planning process. Issues with geographic equity are largely reflected in public opinion, which in turn reflects participation and modal equity. Income equity also incorporates elements of opportunity equity and modal equity. Through the careful and deliberate planning process, issues pertaining to income equity can more easily be mitigated or alleviated than geographic equity, fulfilling the requirements of environmental justice. As toll and pricing policies are developed, planners and policy makers should address key questions designed to identify (a) potential income equity concerns and (b) ways to mitigate those concerns that may occur. Although no assessment can completely address an potential issues of equity and fairness, the principle of environmental justice requires transportation professionals to evaluate proposed projects with an open eye and an open mind. Ultimately, no project needs to be delayed or tabled because of issues of equity. Rather, correctly identifying concerns and addressing them through deliberate and transparent policy and action can help further the case for tolls in a broad transportation financing and planning context.

AB  - Mining activities often cause displacement and disruption of Indigenous socio-cultural relations to land, water, biodiversity, and sacred entities. Due to the high disturbance and degradation that occurs as a result of mining on Indigenous lands, mine restoration and closure (MR&C) must mobilize the political agency of Indigenous Australians and provide enduring benefits beyond the life-of-mine. Here, we demonstrate that Indigenous engagements with mining restoration supply chains in Australia can only succeed if institutionalized socio-environmental inequalities are recognized and dismantled. Through environmental justice lenses, we examine critical mine restoration injustices and how Indigenous Australian participation can energize environmental self-determination. We analyze emerging restoration supply chains through the native seed collection and production activities as opportunities for nurturing transformative local collaborations, Indigenous entrepreneurship, and political participation. Our analysis shows the potential for community practices to coproduce MR&C through enduring partnerships, Indigenous-led organizations, and plural knowledge systems. Indigenous Australian leadership in coordinating investments, collaborations, techniques, and business operations is critical to transforming MR&C into democratic and equitable plans and actions on Indigenous lands where mining operates. When aligned with progressive institutional changes, restoration interventions can potentially strengthen environmental self-determination for Indigenous Australian political control over the customary use and stewardship of their lands.

AB  - In recent years, overtourism and tourism gentrification have been a central feature of public debate in the Balearic Islands, one of the most touristified regions on the planet. In this context, the discourse of tourism degrowth has thrived, being discussed across the political spectrum and even serving to legitimize a sustainable tourism plan and a new Tourism Act. This article provides a brief analysis of the debate around tourism degrowth in the 2014-2019 period and differentiates between two approaches. On the one hand, tourism degrowth has been used by socio-environmental platforms as a byword for detourisfication and the politicization of the hegemonic consensus on tourism. On the other, degrowth has been adopted as a green washing rhetoric in order to justify public policies aimed at tourist decongestion through deseasonalizing, while promoting tourism expansion. This work brings into focus the social construction of the tourism degrowth narrative by applying critical discourse analysis. We conclude that the debate over tourism degrowth is not just a discrepancy between different approaches to deal with overtourism, tourism pressure and gentrification. It is also a social struggle where the discourse over tourism degrowth has helped new democratic political subjects to coalesce and organize in civil society.

AB  - Naming the "Anthropocene" as the spatiotemporality in which we live is a theoretical action that resonates with two separate traditions that can, for a limited purpose, be brought into relation with one another. The first is that identified with Foucault's work, which is anti-humanist in a post-structuralist manner. The second is a set of ideas and resources for thought and action developed by indigenous peoples, namely "indigenous legal traditions", which are anti-humanist in a different way. I argue here that since both of these intellectual traditions begin by de-centering the classic liberal subject, and even de-centering "man", they have some affinities. In both perspectives, action is seen as a feature of webs of relationships, rather than as the willed acts of the classic European "person". Thus, borrowing from both of these could help to elaborate a framework for thinking about responsibility, action, and governance that does not reproduce the very anthropocentrism that underpinned the destructive exploitation of the environment.

AB  - Leading evaluation practitioners were asked about lessons from the recent 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) for evaluation practice. Contributors emphasize the importance of evaluating equity between rich and poor countries and other forms of climate injustice. The role of the evaluation is questioned: what can evaluation be expected to do on its own and what requires collaboration across disciplines, professions and civil society - and across generations? Contributors discuss the implications of the post-Glasgow climate 'pact' for the continued relevance of evaluation. Should evaluators advocate for the marginalized and become activists on behalf of sustainability and climate justice - as well as advocates of evidence? Accountability-driven and evidence-based evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of investments in adaptation and mitigation. Causal pathways in different settings and 'theories of no-change' are needed to understand gaps between stakeholder promises and delivery. Evaluators should measure unintended consequences and what is often left unmeasured, and be sensitive to failure and unanticipated effects of funded actions. Evaluation timescales and units of analysis beyond particular programmes are needed to evaluate the complexities of climate change, sustainability and to take account of natural systems. The implications for evaluation commissioning and funding are discussed as well as the role of evaluation in programme-design and implementation.

AB  - On the 30th anniversary of the Principles of Environmental Justice established at the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 (Principles of Environmental Justice), we continue to call for these principles to be more widely adopted. We propose an environmental justice framework for exposure science to be implemented by all researchers. This framework should be the standard and not an afterthought or trend dismissed by those who believe that science should not be politicized. Most notably, this framework should be centered on the community it seeks to serve. Researchers should meet with community members and stakeholders to learn more about the community, involve them in the research process, collectively determine the environmental exposure issues of highest concern for the community, and develop sustainable interventions and implementation strategies to address them. Incorporating community "funds of knowledge" will also inform the study design by incorporating the knowledge about the issue that community members have based on their lived experiences. Institutional and funding agency funds should also be directed to supporting community needs both during the "active" research phase and at the conclusion of the research, such as mechanisms for dissemination, capacity building, and engagement with policymakers. This multidirectional framework for exposure science will increase the sustainability of the research and its impact for long-term success.

AB  - In the United States (U.S.), up to 14% of the population depend on private wells as their primary drinking water source. The U.S. government does not regulate contaminants in private wells. The goals of this study were to investigate the quality of drinking water from unregulated private wells within one mile (1.6 kilometers) of an effluent-dominated river in the arid Southwest, determine differences in contaminant levels between wet and dry seasons, and identify contributions from human sources by specifically measuring man-made organic contaminants (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), and sucralose). Samples were collected during two dry seasons and two wet seasons over the course of two years and analyzed for microbial (Escherichia coli), inorganic (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nitrate), and synthetic organic (PFOA, PFOS, and sucralose) contaminants. Arsenic, nitrate, and Escherichia coli concentrations exceeded their respective regulatory levels of 0.01 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 1 colony forming unit (CFU)/100 mL, respectively. The measured concentrations of PFOA and PFOS exceeded the respective Public Health Advisory level. Arsenic, PFOA, PFOS, and sucralose were significantly higher during the dry seasons, whereas E. coli was higher during the wet seasons. While some contaminants were correlated (e.g., As and Hg rho = 0.87; PFOA and PFOS rho = 0.45), the lack of correlation between different contaminant types indicates that they may arise from different sources. Multi-faceted interventions are needed to reduce exposure to drinking water above health-based guidelines.

AB  - In this study, we explored how science teacher candidates construct ideas about science teaching and learning in the context of partnerships with urban community-based organizations. We used a case study design focusing on a group of 10 preservice teachers' participation in educational programming that focused on environmental racism and connected science to larger social issues in an economically dispossessed Mexican community in Chicago. Using theoretical lenses of humanistic science education, justice-centered science pedagogy, and structure-agency dialectic, we studied how preservice high school science teachers made sense of equity and social justice issues facing marginalized communities and how they thought about the goals and nature of science education, along with their role as science teachers, as they participated in a Toxic Tour provided by the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. By emphasizing both environmental challenges and the community assets in Little Village, the Toxic Tour provided an opportunity for science teacher candidates to develop a complex understanding of this particular community and critically reflect on their own communities. The teacher candidates identified both structures that are enabling or disabling for community members and people's individual and collective agency acting upon these structures. They also recognized communities as places of authentic science learning.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the racialized burden of toxicity in the US as a case study of what we call "domestic geopolitics." Drawing on the case studies of Badin, North Carolina, and Flint, Michigan, we argue that maintaining life in conditions of racialized toxicity is not only a matter of survival, but also a geopolitical praxis. We propose the term domestic geopolitics to describe a reconceived feminist geopolitics integrating an analysis of Black geographies as a domestic form of colonialism, with an expanded understanding of domesticity as political work. We develop the domestic geopolitics framework based on the dual meaning of domestic: the inward facing geopolitics of racialization and the resistance embodied in domestic labors of maintaining life, home, and community. Drawing on Black feminist scholars, we describe three categories of social reproductive labor in conditions of racialized toxicity: the labor of keeping wake, the labor of tactical expertise, and the labor of revolutionary mothering. We argue that Black survival struggles exemplify a domestic geopolitics of everyday warfare against racial capitalism's onslaught.

AB  - Parks are key community assets for physical activity, but some evidence suggests these resources are not equitably distributed. This study examined disparities by income and race/ethnicity in the availability, features, and quality of parks across Kansas City, Missouri. All parks and census tracts (CTs) were mapped using geographical information systems, and park features and quality were determined via audits. Multivariate analyses of covariance analyzed differences in park availability, features, and quality across low-, medium-, and high-income and race/ethnicity CT tertiles. Low-income CTs contained significantly more parks, but also had fewer parks with playgrounds and more quality concerns per park. High minority CTs had more parks with basketball courts, but fewer parks with trails. Medium-income CTs contained more aesthetic features per park. Future research should examine policies that contribute to and that might rectify disparities in park features and quality, especially in low-income and high minority areas.

AB  - In questioning the multiple positions of the stakeholders involved in the mining debate in Ecuador, this paper offers an analytical framework to uncover the 'politics of scale' of mining discourses. This is done by understanding how discourses are simultaneously structured, disassembled and restructured according to power relations among stakeholders involved in the mining debate. Q methodology is used as a tool to assess the subjective perceptions of key stakeholders regarding mining projects in the country. Results highlight four distinct discourses: (1) responsible extractivism; (2) local self-determination; (3) national economic development; and (4) local economic development. Discursive analyses suggest that mining positions are constructed to contest power in: decision-making, the enactment of values and rights, and the uneven distribution of economic benefits and socio-environmental burdens associated with mining. The analysis also offers insights for enhancing conflict-resolution and depicting the political complexity associated with structural power inequalities among actors implicated in mining conflicts in the country.

AB  - In this paper we outline the limitations of Environmental Justice theory when it comes to explaining and theorising the politics of contemporary environmental movements. Justice, we argue, needs to be understood not as a formalised and preconceived 'thing' to be delivered or applied but as an-open egalitarian ideal that movements across the world continuously redefine in embodied and performed ways which are historically and geographically distinct. Drawing upon the fifteen year long anti-mining struggles of Rosia Montana, Romania, we explore the tension between seeking 'traditional' forms of justice (i.e. dia-logic consensual politics) and putting forward more radical demands for socio-ecological change, in which representation and recognition are seen as insufficient practices for distributing justice. Visibility (rather than recognition) and egalitarian politics (rather than distribution) become the quilting points of struggles of many contemporary environmental movements, equality can only be enacted (or staged) through praxis that disrupts the distribution of the sensible experience and exposes the arbitrariness and incompleteness of power. We argue that in order to analyse and theorise the praxis of contemporary environmental movements, it is imperative for geographical literature to engage with post-foundational theory, and 'un-do' pre-conceived ideas and theorisations of (environmental) justice.

AB  - Over the last two decades, the global production of farm-raised shrimps has increased at a faster rate than any other aquacultural product, leading to massive socio-ecological damages in the mangrove areas where shrimp farming often takes place. Consequently, an increasing number of conflicts pitting coastal populations against shrimp farmers has been reported although very few conflicts have been studied in detail. This article contributes to fill this research gap by analyzing the causes, development and consequences of one such conflict in the Ecuadorian canton of Muisne (province of Esmeraldas). This conflict is one of the world's earliest and most important protest movements for the defence of mangroves and against the shrimp industry. Within a political ecology perspective, we connect three key dimensions of the conflict: (1) the socioeconomic metabolism of shrimp farming locally and internationally, (2) the institutions - formal and informal - that regulate the access to mangroves, and (3) the development of the mobilization itself, with special reference to the role of local women. The study is based on six-month fieldwork and combines data from 52 in-depth interviews of a wide range of actors, various documentation, and direct and participant observation. We find that the development of shrimp farming can be understood as a modern case of enclosure movement whereby customary community mangroves are privatized for the building of shrimp ponds. As a result, local mangrove-dependant populations - especially women - mobilized with the support of a grassroots Environmental Justice Organization. The protest was targeted at a form of ecologically unequal exchange where sectors of the global North shift socio-ecological costs onto poor sectors of the producing regions of the global South. In agreement with feminist political ecology, local women were particularly resistant to this process of 'accumulation by dispossession'. While only some mangroves could be saved or reforested as a result of the movement, women's mobilization has had the unexpected effect of challenging gender relations in their communities. This research articulates dimensions of a given conflict that are too often considered separately, namely social-metabolic issues, institutional change, and gender issues. This allows a more comprehensive view of a complex power struggle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monetary valuation methods are commonly used to analyze recreation values of water ecosystems. However, most studies on water-related recreation values have not analyzed direct links between ecological elements providing recreation opportunities and user demands. Therefore, we implemented an ecosystem service approach to study human-nature interaction during the actual recreation visit to an urban freshwater site. We developed a conceptual model of local cultural ecosystem services (CES) to study interactions between recreation supply and demand. We were interested in seasonality of water-related recreation supply, and the different demands of summer and off-summer visitors. We chose urban Lake Kuusijarvi in the city of Vantaa, Finland, as our case study area, because it is a popular outdoor recreation area around the year. We identified 14 key elements of the supply of local CES and 22 socio-cultural values for the demand for local CES. We found little seasonal change in recreation supply, but the socio-demographic characteristics and demands of summer and off-summer visitors varied significantly. Demand was higher and more diverse during the summer season, while off-summer visitors were more specific in their demands. Moreover, some visitors feared that some socio-cultural values can be lost if the recreational use of the lake area increases. We discuss our findings in a theoretical context focusing especially on interactions between supply and demand of local CES at Lake Kuusijarvi.

AB  - Many resource-rich countries face the paradoxical situation that their wealth in natural resources coincides with low economic and human development rates. To address this so-called resource curse, academics and practitioners turn their hopes to institutional quality. Yet whether, how and with what consequences institutional quality is transformed in resource curse contexts remains poorly understood, especially so at subnational levels. The most widely implemented initiative that seeks to address the resource curse through enhanced institutional quality is the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). This article analyses to what extent and how the EITI transforms institutional quality at national and subnational levels in Myanmar, focusing on transparency, civil society participation and accountability. We show that many transformations go beyond the official EITI process and report. While the EITI report itself is not heavily used by civil society organisations (CSOs), the EITI process motivated CSOs to gather data and organise themselves both around and beyond EITI-related issues at subnational levels. Such participatory processes of constituting transparency improved relations between the (regional) government, CSOs and private companies, but also created new forms of in- and exclusion among civil society. While avenues opened up for CSOs to demand accountability regarding the impacts of resource extraction, the extent to which they are able to trigger action of extractive industry actors in their region remains limited. In conclusion, we argue that transformations in institutional quality are not characterised by a linear trajectory from transparency in the form of the EITI report to accountability, facilitated by civil society participation in EITI multi-stakeholder groups, as the EITI standard posits. Rather, transformations in institutional quality are characterised by spin-offs, dynamic interlinkages, trade-offs, limitations and a reinforcing cycle between participation and transparency within and beyond the EITI.

AB  - Over the past few years, studies in political ecology and environmental justice have been increasingly connecting the commons and social movements empirically, giving shape to a new, distinctive body of research on commons movements. In our review, we first organize and synthesize empirical lessons from this body of literature. We then highlight recent theoretical efforts made by scholars to both bridge and transcend the gap between the theory of the commons and social movement theory. As we illustrate, movements can help create and strengthen commons institutions and discourses, as well as rescale them horizontally and vertically. This is particularly evident in the context of rural community-rights movements in the global South, as well as in new water and food commons movements and community energy movements in both the global South and North. Commons institutions, in turn, can serve as the basis of social mobilization and become a key frame for social movements, as shown in the context of local environmental justice and livelihoods conflicts and anti-privatization struggles. Tensions and contradictions of commons-movement dynamics also exist and reflect trade-offs between diversity versus uniformization and organizational closure versus expansion of discourses and practices. Theoretically, there is an opportunity to cross boundaries from the theory of the commons to social movement theory and vice versa, e.g., by highlighting the role of political opportunities and framing, and biophysical factors and polycentricity, respectively. More importantly, a new commons movements theory is emerging focusing on cross-scalar organizations, the virtuous cycles between commons projects and mobilization, and the processes of commons-making.

AB  - In southwest Alaska, dominant narratives of subsistence and conservation are concerned predominantly with material relations with fish, with the number of fish that are killed. In Akiak, an Alaska Native (Yupiaq) village located along the Kuskokwim River, people's relations with Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) extend beyond the material, encompassing also the temporal. In this article, I contend that state and federal fishing regulations enact and extend settler colonial representations of Indigenous disappearance. Framing Yupiaq people's appeals for "a taste of fish" as a temporal matter, I examine how state and federal fishing regulations rupture the temporality in which Yupiaq people's relations with Chinook salmon unfold and threaten people's well-being. By examining the vitality of human-salmon relations through an optic of care, I describe how Yupiaq peoples in Akiak experience the adverse effects of interrupted and postponed relations with Chinook salmon in "confusion" among youth. In turn, I illustrate how people get on with living despite the limits that the present politics of fisheries management place on their ability to take care of each other on their own terms, and in their own time.

AB  - Place-based resettlement capacity assessments to identify potential resettlement places for climate migrants are needed to guide resettlement programs related to climate change. This article proposes and validates a conceptual climate change resettlement capacity (CCRC) framework that can be used to identify potential resettlement places for climate migrants. The CCRC framework focuses on livelihood reconstruction, as this is the primary aim of most resettlement programs and a key for successful resettlement and mitigation of impoverishment of resettled people and communities. The framework has two main dimensions - assets and conditions - as its foundation, with a set of subdimensions and generic indicators identified for both of them. Expert evaluation was used to validate the framework. The operationalization of the framework is illustrated through a case study of two regions of Ethiopia vulnerable to climate change. The framework is designed to assist international organizations, governments, planners, and policymakers in identifying both the most suitable and least suitable places to resettle communities in the face of actual or anticipated displacements due to climate change. In addition, the framework can be used by researchers to undertake theoretical and empirical studies on resettlement induced by climate change. With minor modifications, the framework can also be applied to resettlement capacity assessments for non-climate resettlement programs and research. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many environmental justice communities face elevated exposures to multiple stressors, given biases in urban and environmental policy and planning. This paper aims to evaluate sound level exposure in a densely populated environmental justice city in close proximity to major roadways, a nearby airport and high levels of industrial activity. In this study we collected various sound level metrics to evaluate the loudness and frequency composition of the acoustical environment in Chelsea, Massachusetts, USA. A total of 29 week-long sites were collected from October 2019 to June 2020, a time period that also included the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically altered activity patterns and corresponding sound level exposures. We found that Chelsea is exposed to high levels of sound, both day and night (65 dB (A), and 80 dB and 90 dB for low frequency, and infrasound sound levels). A spectral analysis shows that 63 Hz was the dominant frequency. Distance to major roads and flight activity (both arrivals and departures) were most strongly correlated with all metrics, most notably with metrics describing contributing from lower frequencies. Overall, we found similar patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic but at levels up to 10 dB lower. Our results demonstrate the importance of noise exposure assessments in environmental justice communities and the importance of using additional metrics to describe communities inundated with significant air, road, and industrial sound levels. It also provides a snapshot of how much quieter communities can be with careful and intentional urban and environmental policy and planning.

AB  - Over the last decade the scope of the socio-environmental concerns included within an environmental justice framing has broadened and theoretical understandings of what defines and constitutes environmental injustice have diversified. This paper argues that this substantive and theoretical pluralism has implications for geographical inquiry and analysis, meaning that multiple forms of spatiality are entering our understanding of what it is that substantiates claims of environmental injustice in different contexts. In this light the simple geographies and spatial forms evident in much "first-generation" environmental justice research are proving insufficient. Instead a richer, multidimensional understanding of the different ways in which environmental justice and space are co-constituted is needed. This argument is developed by analysing a diversity of examples of socio-environmental concerns within a framework of three different notions of justice-as distribution, recognition and procedure. Implications for the strategies of environmental justice activism for the globalisation of the environmental justice frame and for future geographical research are considered.

AB  - Inspired by Lefebvre's meditation on the rhythms seen from his apartment in Paris, we develop a novel rhythmanalytic account of urban air pollution, its breathing-in and impact in vulnerable bodies. We conceptualise urban air pollution as entwined in its making and consequence with the diverse rhythms of technologies, social practices and socio-temporal structures, environmental and atmospheric processes, bodily movements in space and time, and rhythmically constituted corporeality. Through this interdisciplinary account we position urban air pollution as integral to the 'beat' of the city, both a product of and constituent part of its evolving spatiotemporal form. We build on this foundation to develop a polyrhythmic conceptualisation of how certain places and lives are more dominated by pollution than others. Unequal patternings are made through the structuring effects of rhythmic repetition and by fatal intersections between the rhythms of polluted air and unequal capacities to avoid harmful breathing in and to resist the arrhythmic corporeal consequences that can follow. Understanding inequalities as manifest not within a static landscape of spatial relations, but in sets of unequally unfolding and structured polyrhythmic relations has implications for revealing patterns of inequality and for extending evidence-making more deeply into how rhythms intersect. Which and whose rhythms are to be intervened in are also considered as key ethical and political questions. We draw out implications for activism and community action, and identify the potential for bringing rhythmanalysis into productive engagement with broader environmental justice concerns, including in relation to recent COVID-19 experiences.

AB  - Increasingly, studies are focusing on the role the local food environment plays in residents' ability to purchase affordable, healthy and nutritious foods. In a food desert, an area devoid of a supermarket, access to healthy food is limited. We conducted a systematic review of studies that focused on food access and food desert research in the United States. The 31 studies identified utilized 9 measures to assess food access. Results from these studies can be summarized primarily into four major statements. Findings from other countries offer insight into ways, in which future research, policy development and program implementation in the US may continue to be explored. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Maps of regional morbidity and mortality rates are useful tools in determining spatial patterns of disease. Combined with sociodemographic census information, they also permit assessment of environmental justice; that is, whether certain subgroups suffer disproportionately from certain diseases or other adverse effects of harmful environmental exposures. Bayes and empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in smoothing crude maps of disease risk, eliminating the instability of estimates in low-population areas while maintaining geographic resolution. In this article we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions. Fitting the resulting highly parameterized models requires careful implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as well as novel techniques for model evaluation and selection. We illustrate our approach using a dataset of county-specific lung cancer rates in the state of Ohio during the period 1968-1988.

AB  - Park green space (PGS) is an important part of urban ecosystem and green infrastructure, and the ease of access to PGS is closely related to the health of residents. A growing number of studies have attempted to identify accessibility disparities, but results have varied because of the travel mode choice and the measurement method. This study proposes a dynamic Huff two-step floating catchment area (H2SFCA) method based on map service API (Application Programming Interface) to assess the accessibility of PGS, with the Gini coefficient and bivariate local Moran's I used to analyze accessibility equity. Results show that: (1) driving and biking modes have more significant spatiotemporal compression effects than dynamic modes, public transit, and walking mode. (2) The accessibility values and spatial patterns vary significantly by travel mode. The PGS availability pattern at the local level is more uneven than the distribution of accessibility at the regional level. In comparison with dynamic travel modes, the accessibility values for the single travel mode are more likely to be overestimated or underestimated. (3) The PGS accessibility by the dynamic modes generally has better spatial equity and residents can select suitable travel tools to acquire more equitable park services. In addition, there is a significant accessibility difference between dynamic driving-based mode and dynamic transit-based mode in four subdistricts, which are mainly located in the south of Tianhe District. The public transport facilities linking parks in these areas need to be optimized. This study further improves the accessibility evaluation method, with the findings conducive to the implementation of refined PGS planning and management.

AB  - This article situates pesticides as technologies marked by both continuities and discontinuities from previous modes of agrarian racism in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, a plantation region of the United States South. Attention to the historical-geographical specificity of pesticide intensification, I argue, provides the means to understand pesticide intensification as a mode of what I term agro-environmental racism. Anti-Black racism shaped the politics of pesticides, underpinning policies and material practices that were destructive of both the environment and human welfare in the Delta and beyond. The structures and ideologies of plantation racism helped position the Delta as one of the most pesticide-intensive sectors of U.S. agriculture during the mid-20th century-a particularly consequential period for both the intensification of pesticides and the formation of contemporary environmentalism. Pesticides were defended by agro-industrial interests as technologies supporting agricultural production-and particularly that of cotton, the most pesticide-intensive commodity crop. Simultaneously, they were figured as technologies crucial to a normative way of life. Although pesticides were articulated without explicit mention of race by the 1960s, I argue that the freedom struggle activism of the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union and Fannie Lou Hamer provide context necessary to explain the pesticide politics of the Delta's plantation bloc. These mobilizations to enact more just, sustainable, and livable geographies were an indictment of a plantation politics which put the health of cotton and profitability of plantations above all else.

We examined these perceptions to determine the extent to which Caucasians and Mexican Americans living in the Tucson, Arizona, metropolitan area differ in their perceptions of water quality-related risk, inequity, trust, and participation in civic activities. Ethnic variations in perceptions toward inequity, trust, and public participation were observed even when socioeconomic variation between Caucasians and Mexican Americans was controlled. However, significant ethnic variations in perceptions of water quality-related risks were observed only when socioeconomic variation was not controlled. Implications of these findings to environmental justice efforts in Mexican American communities are discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the context within which struggles for environmental justice are taking place in India. We explore the ways in which postcolonial patterns of government and governance in India affect the ends, the means and the representation of these struggles, focusing on three particular areas: state reform, the judiciary and public interest litigation, and environmental social movements. We argue that India differs from west in the ambitious yet incomplete and contradictory nature of government-sponsored intervention in the environment, and in the particular nature of its public sphere, both of which have been important in shaping struggles for environmental justice. Our wider intention is not merely to catalogue these differences, but to use the Indian material to raise questions about the emphases and implicit assumptions of western environmental justice literature, and reflect on how these may be need reconsideration when working in postcolonial contexts.

AB  - Landscape anthropology has explored relationships between peoples and places as well as culturally specific ways of experiencing and imagining the world that infuse these relationships. Departing from Kakipitatapitmok, the site of a direct-action blockade maintained at Grassy Narrows First Nation since 2002, I employ analytical frameworks inspired by the landscape genre to consider the physical and conceptual "place" of Anishinaabe anticlearcutting activism. I draw on the Grassy Narrows case to suggest that when considered from an emic perspective, the landscapes we encounter are very often politically constituted. As a distinctive new way of being and relating within their boreal forest homeland, anticlearcutting activism has transformed Kakipitatapitmok into a politically charged vantage point from which Grassy Narrows activists comprehend, configure, and communicate their place in the world. I advocate for an anthropological conception of landscape that can account for activists' experiences of environmental injustice and their ongoing efforts to overcome it.

AB  - Particulate Matter (PM) air pollution has been associated with a variety of adverse health effects. However, the influence of exposure to particulate pollution on non-notifiable health outcomes such as individual-level restricted activity is less well understood. Days absent from work or school were collected for 2257 students and teachers at eight secondary schools in Christchurch, New Zealand. Mean levels of PM10 (PM less than 10 micrometers in diameter) for the study period were 42.7 mu g m(-3) at schools and 48.9 mu g m(-3) at a centrally located monitoring site. A significant (p < 0.05) association between PM10 and restricted activity days was found at schools for same-day and 1-day lags. The results presented in this paper suggest that there is a positive association between restricted activity and particulate matter air pollution even though the associations were not consistently statistically significant.

AB  - Populations of color and low-income communities are often disproportionately burdened by exposures to various environmental contaminants, including air pollution. Some air pollutants have carcinogenic properties that are particularly problematic in South Carolina (SC), a state that consistently has high rates of cancer mortality for all sites. The purpose of this study was to assess cancer risk disparities in SC by linking risk estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2005 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) with sociodemographic data from the 2000 US Census Bureau. Specifically, NATA risk data for varying risk categories were linked by tract ID and analyzed with sociodemographic variables from the 2000 census using R. The average change in cancer risk from all sources by sociodemographic variable was quantified using multiple linear regression models. Spatial methods were further employed using ArcGIS 10 to assess the distribution of all source risk and percent non-white at each census tract level. The relative risk (RR) estimates of the proportion of high cancer risk tracts (defined as the top 10% of cancer risk in SC) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated between the first and latter three quartiles defined by sociodemographic factors, while the variance in the percentage of high cancer risk between quartile groups was tested using Pearson's chi-square. The average total cancer risk for SC was 26.8 people/million (ppl/million). The risk from on-road sources was approximately 5.8 ppl/million, higher than the risk from major, area, and non-road sources (1.8, 2.6, and 1.3 ppl/million), respectively. Based on our findings, addressing on-road sources may decrease the disproportionate cancer risk burden among low-income populations and communities of color in SC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives. We assessed spatial disparities in the distribution of Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facilities in Charleston, SC. Methods. We used spatial methods and regression to assess burden disparities in the study area at the block and census-tract levels by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Results. Results revealed an inverse relationship between distance to TRI facilities and race/ethnicity and SES at the block and census-tract levels. Results of regression analyses showed a positive association between presence of TRI facilities and high percentage non-White and a negative association between number of TRI facilities and high SES. Conclusions. There are burden disparities in the distribution of TRI facilities in Charleston at the block and census-tract level by race/ethnicity and SES. Additional research is needed to understand cumulative risk in the region. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:1974-1980. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2012.300700)

AB  - Looking back from 2050, this article is written in the form of a fictional speech reflecting on the impressive progress made by 2050 towards achieving the global goal of zero net emissions. The speaker also highlights the severe and ongoing ecological damage and human suffering caused by the failure to reduce emissions with sufficient urgency in the first quarter of the 21st Century - and the ongoing challenge of implementing the actions required to bring global temperatures back below 1.5 degrees. The speech identifies the following key drivers of the 'great 21st century energy transition'. i) Sustained leadership from national and sub-national governments, business, civil society and the military in ratcheting up and accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement. ii) The escalating frequency and severity of catastrophic climatic events. iii) Disruptive, game changing technological innovation including in energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy storage and distribution, transport, construction and agriculture. iv) Disruptive, game changing innovation in social, economic and political institutions and relationships including: increasing recognition of the importance of reducing the global consumption of goods and services; an ongoing shift towards more distributed and collaborative economic paradigms and systems; growing popular and political support for the global climate justice movement; radical improvements in the transparency and accountability of democratic and governance processes; and the mobilization of millions of citizens driving transformational change in investment flows, electoral outcomes and political choices.

AB  - In Mediterranean-climate regions of California and southern Oregon, juvenile salmon depend on groundwater aquifers to sustain their tributary habitats through the dry summers. Along California's North Coast streams, private property regimes on land have created commons tragedies in groundwater and salmon fisheries, both classic examples of commons that are often governed collectively and sustainably by their users. Understanding the linkages between salmon and groundwater is one major focus of salmon recovery and climate change adaptation planning in central California and increasingly throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this paper, I use extended field interviews and participant-observation in field ecology campaigns and regulatory forums to explore how, in one water-scarce, salmon-bearing watershed on California's central coast, collaborators are synthesizing agency and landowner data on groundwater and salmon management. I focus on three projects undertaken by citizen scientists in collaboration with me and Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District staff: salmonid censuses, mapping of wet and dry stream reaches and well monitoring. I find that collaborative research initiated by local residents and agency personnel has, in some cases, created a new sense of ecological possibility in the region. I also consider some limitations of this collaborations, namely the lack of engagement with indigenous Pomo and Miwok tribal members, with the Confederated Tribes of Graton Rancheria and with farmworkers and other marginalized residents, and suggest strategies for deepening environmental justice commitments in future collaborative work.

AB  - In Brazil, one of the most pressing issues for environmental justice scholars (and movements) is unequal access to land. Over the past 20 years, people have mobilized collectively to demand both access to resources (distributional equity) and the right to participate in decisions over their distribution (procedural equity). In this article, I analyze the recent development of large-scale soybean production in the Brazilian cerrado. I argue that distributional inequities in the cerrado have been produced through a state-led process of development that favored large farms and modern, agro-industrial development. Popular discourse, however, fetishizes the efficiencies that accrue to large-scale agriculture, naturalizing the comparative advantage of wealthy farmers and erasing the importance of the state and geopolitical context for development in the region.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in large-scale land deals, often from public lands to the hands of foreign or domestic investors. Popularly referred to as a global land grab', new land acquisitions are drawing upon, restructuring and challenging the nature of both governance and government. In the Introduction to this special issue, we argue for an analysis of land deals that draws upon the insights of political ecology, cultural politics and agrarian studies to illuminate the micro-processes of transaction and expropriation as well as the broader structural forces at play. We argue that the state' is often invoked as a key player in land grabbing but states never operate with one voice; rather we need to unbundle the state, to see government and governance as processes, people and relationships. To develop this approach, we focus on territory, sovereignty, authority and subjects not as static objects but as relationships produced in and through place, property, power and production. Understanding the dynamic nature of these relationships is critical to understanding the highly variable form and content of large-scale land deals in different settings around the world. The papers in this special issue help to develop this perspective and this Introduction highlights important areas of convergence among them.

AB  - In environmental planning, decision making on land use for infrastructure increasingly causes conflicts, particularly with regard to contested waste facilities. Risk management and perceptions have become crucial. Empirical investigations of these conflicts brought clear advancement in the fields of environmental psychology, geography and risk research. However, in planning and policy design the dominant one-dimensional approach among planners remains, and the approach to address resistance to facility siting is not firmly founded in empirical evidence. Instead, it uses simplified assumptions about the motives of opponents, seeing residents as merely protecting their 'turf' and exclusively focusing on their own 'backyard'. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study on risk perceptions, based on a large-scale survey in six decision-making processes for different types of waste facilities. A scale is developed to measure the planners' perspective of the motives for opposition. The analysis shows that the crucial factors in perceived risk perceptions are not personality traits (e.g. selfishness, economic rationality) but perceived environmental injustice, fairness of the process, and personal commitment to others. Continual thinking in terms of 'backyard' motives disregards the socially motivated norms for equity, fairness, and commitment to others and may easily undermine co-operative behaviour.

AB  - Many environmental justice studies argue that firms choose to locate waste sites or polluting plants disproportionately in minority or poor communities. However, it is not uncommon for these studies to match site or plant location to contemporaneous socioeconomic characteristics instead of to characteristics at the time of siting. While this may provide important information on disproportionate impacts currently faced by these communities, it does not describe the relationship at the time of siting. Also, variables that are important to a plant's location decision - i.e., production and transportation costs - are often not included. Without controlling for such variables, it is difficult to evaluate the relative importance of socioeconomic characteristics in a firm's initial location decision. This paper examines the role of community socioeconomic characteristics at the time of siting in the location decisions of manufacturing plants while controlling for other location-relevant factors such as input costs. When plant location is matched to current socioeconomic characteristics, results are consistent with what the environmental justice literature predicts: race is significant and positively related to plant location, while income is significant and negatively related to plant location. When plant location is matched to socioeconomic characteristics at the time of siting, empirical results suggest that race is no longer significant, though income is still significant and negatively related to plant location. Poverty rates are sometimes significant but act as a deterrent to plant location. Variables traditionally considered in the firm location literature - such as land and labor costs, the quality of labor, and distance to rail - are significant. The presence of pre-existing TRI plants in a neighborhood and average plant size are also significant.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in high-level, decision-making arenas as a response to global policy challenges. Claiming to be transformative and pluralistic, NbS aim to resolve societal problems through a focus on nature, which is understood to be a benign ally. This uncritical framing of nature may have unintended and inequitable consequences that undermine the emancipatory potential of NbS. In this paper, we highlight the need to pay attention to epistemic and power dimensions that tend to be hidden in NbS. We assume that nature is neither passive nor external to human society, but is instead expressed in frames (reifying modes of expression) that reflect both knowledge and power in social encounters where NbS are used. Drawing upon five cases, we analyse how particular ways of framing nature express and reinforce the power relations that structure people's interactions. Each of the five cases relies on a nature-based frame to produce knowledge on climate adaptation, peacebuilding and justice. The analysis reveals how frames of nature are enacted in particular contexts, and how this conditions the potential for societal transformation towards sustainability and pluralistic knowledge. We demonstrate how frames of nature can constrain or enable opportunities for various groups to respond to environmental change. We discuss how the NbS paradigm might better incorporate diverse, situated knowledge and subjectivities, and conclude that this will require a more critical evaluation of NbS practice and research.

AB  - Our understanding of asthma epidemiology is growing increasingly complex. Asthma outcomes are clearly socially patterned, with asthma ranking as a leading cause of health disparities among minority and low socioeconomic groups. Yet, the increasing prevalence and marked disparities in asthma remain largely. unexplained by known risk factors. In the United States, asthma disproportionately affects nonwhite children living in urban areas and children living in poverty. Low socioeconomic status (SES), ethnic minority group status, and residence in an inner-city environment are closely intertwined in the United States, making it a challenge to fully disentangle the independent effects of each of these characteristics on asthma morbidity. In addition, studies show geographic variation in asthma outcomes across large cities and neighborhoods within cities that cannot be explained by economic factors alone. Although more limited data are available, studies in rural areas also suggest the stratification of risk based on SES and the proportion of minorities. Among low-SES areas, those with predominantly minority, segregated populations seem especially burdened. Marginalized populations of lower socioeconomic position are disproportionately exposed to irritants (eg, tobacco smoke), pollutants (eg, diesel-related particles), and indoor allergens (eg, cockroach and mouse allergen). Moreover, these marginalized individuals may also live in communities that are increasingly socially toxic, which, in turn, may be related to the increased experience of psychosocial stress that may influence asthma morbidity. Epidemiologic trends suggest that asthma may provide an excellent paradigm for understanding the role of community-level contextual factors in disease. Specifically, a multilevel approach that includes an ecological perspective may help to explain heterogeneities in asthma expression across socioeconomic and geographic boundaries that, to date, remain largely unexplained. Traditionally, asthma epidemiology has focused on individual-level risk factors and family factors. Far less attention has been given to the broader social context in which individuals live. A multilevel approach that explicitly recognizes the embedding of asthma within its biological, psycho-socioeconomic, environmental, and community contexts, is likely to provide a better understanding of asthma disparities at different stages in the life course. Is it simply asthma disparities or is it social disparities in asthma?

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the supply quality of parks and green spaces within the Third Ring Road area in Shenyang city by combining a landscape pattern index analysis with a principal component analysis. Moreover, a network analysis based on the ArcGIS platform was used to measure the accessibility of parks and green spaces. The research results showed that the overall supply quality of parks and green spaces (-9.55) must be improved. The supply quality levels of the four analyzed park types could be ranked as follows: garden parks (118.00) > community parks (73.67) > comprehensive parks (-16.64) > specific parks (-32.17). Among the analyzed recreation parks, the accessibility of daily recreation parks was poor, while the overall service efficiency of weekly recreation parks was better, except in a few regions. These research results can provide suggestions for future green space planning in Shenyang city. In addition, from the perspective of landscape patterns, studying the service quality of parks and green spaces can provide new ideas for further research on accessibility.

AB  - Limited accessibility measurements of park green spaces (PGSs) have given an account of multiple transportations when people enjoy the services. Considering the varying types and functions of PGSs, this study proposed a multi-mode method that is based on the traditional two-step floating catchment area method and relied on PGS classification to estimate spatial disparity between the supply of PGSs services and residents' demands in accessibility. Choosing the urban center of Wuhan as the study area, comparative analysis of space and statistics were conducted in accessibility between the traditional single-mode and the multi-mode methods. After a sensitive analysis of accessibility with varying travel time thresholds, underserved areas in the urban center were identified on a community level based on the PGS groups. Results indicated that the estimated accessibility average and standard deviation values by single-mode method were slimly higher than that of the multi-mode method. The average and standard deviation values of the accessibility among five time thresholds exhibited slight difference and an increasing trend. The further examination analysis of spatial accessibility in 25-min threshold demonstrated that accessibility presented spatial polarization and that most underserved areas distributed in the eastern and southwestern of the urban center in Wuhan. The findings may provide a more realistic estimation and further the knowledge of access to green spaces to help decision makers developing equal and effective planning policies and strategies.

AB  - Outdoor air pollution is a major killer worldwide and the fourth largest contributor to the burden of disease in China. China is the most populous country in the world and also has the largest number of air pollution deaths per year, yet the spatial resolution of existing national air pollution estimates for China is generally relatively low. We address this knowledge gap by developing and evaluating national empirical models for China incorporating land-use regression (LUR), satellite measurements, and universal kriging (UK). Land use, traffic and meteorological variables were included for model building. We tested the resulting models in several ways, including (1) comparing models developed using forward variable selection vs. partial least squares (PLS) variable reduction, (2) comparing models developed with and without satellite measurements, and with and without UK, and (3) 10-fold cross-validation (CV), Leave-One-Province-Out CV (LOPO-CV), and Leave-One-City-Out CV (LOCO-CV). Satellite data and kriging are complementary in making predictions more accurate: kriging improved the models in well-sampled areas; satellite data substantially improved performance at locations far away from monitors. Variable-selection models performed similarly to PLS models in 10-fold CV, but better in LOPO-CV. Our best models employed forward variable selection and UK, with 10-fold CV R-2 of 0.89 (for both 2014 and 2015) for PM2.5 and of 0.73 (year-2014) and 0.78 (year-2015) for NO2. Population-weighted concentrations during 2014-2015 decreased for PM2.5 (58.7 mu g/m(3) to 52.3 mu g/m(3)) and NO2 (29.6 mu g/m(3) to 26.8 mu g/m(3)). We produced the first high resolution national LUR models for annual-average concentrations in China. Models were applied on 1 km grid to support future research. In 2015, >80% of the Chinese population lived in areas that exceeded the Chinese national PM2.5 standard, 35 mu g/m(3). Results here will be publicly available and may be useful for epidemiology, risk assessment, and environmental justice research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is critical to understand how matters relating to water are reported, or ignored, among linguistically diverse media and to understand the possible influence this may have on the conception of water issues among ethnically diverse groups. This research analysed five daily newspapers published in Sydney between 2011 and 2012 in three languages (English, Chinese and Korean) and found that water issues were presented differently by newspapers across language divides in Sydney. These differences may contribute to diverse conceptual constructions of water problems and water management among ethnically diverse communities. After allowing for the influence of other variables, this research highlights the necessity to investigate media construction of water issues in various Non-English language publications as an important approach to improving situated and place-based water awareness in an ethnically diverse city.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study is to examine the claims that poor and nonwhite communities host a disproportionately large number of waste disposal facilities because these communities received less protection against waste disposal facilities than wealthier and predominantly white communities. Methods. This is a statistical study of the demographic characteristics of communities surrounding hazardous waste sites in metropolitan Texas. It compares ethnic and economic characteristics of these communities both at ''time of siting'' and during the 1990 Census. These results are statistically tested using chi-square and Cramer's V. Results. At ''time of siting'' there were statistically significant positive relationships between siting, poverty, and a predominantly white host population. For 1990 data poverty remained significant, but race did not, indicating a shifting ethnic composition. Low population density is proposed as an alternative explanation. Conclusions. These results emphasize the need for research on the historical characteristics of the communities surrounding locally unwanted land uses (LULUs) and the changes that occur in host communities after siting. By gaining an understanding of these broader issues, we will be better able to address the social, economic, and environmental issues associated with environmental justice.

AB  - Local communities and their opinion on shale gas exploitation (SGE) play an essential role in the implementation of energy policies, while little is known about the reasoning process underpinning the acceptance of SGE. The present study develops a conceptual framework to examine the psychological process of residents' acceptance of local SGE, in which the impacts of trust, knowledge, and fairness are mediated by risk and benefit perceptions. Structural equation modeling has been applied to analyze the hypothesized relationships based on a dataset of 825 households in China's largest shale gas field. Our results indicate that residents' perceived fairness and trust positively affect their benefit perceptions and negatively affect their risk perceptions, which results in positive influences on acceptance, and knowledge of SGE's environmental impacts positively affects perceived risks, which results in a negative influence on acceptance. Moreover, residents' acceptance is primarily determined by their benefit perception, followed by perceived fairness, and knowledge is the least important determinant. Thus, our study contributes to the literature by exploring the structural relationships between various psychological predictors and the acceptance toward SGE, and the results from our empirical survey provide insight into designing appropriate strategies in the process of generating and communicating shale policies.

AB  - North Carolina ranks as the 2nd largest hog producer in the United States. Currently, the state houses over 10 million hogs. It is estimated that about 19 million tons of hog waste was produced in 2004 by the 10 million hogs in the state (scorecard.com). Despite the increase in waste output due to increased production, concerns are that majority of these producers have not improved their waste management practices. Most importantly, all the big factories are located in counties in the Black Belt region of the state. These are counties where the percent Black population is greater than the state and national averages of 25.4% and 12% respectively. The existence of pollution, poverty, and minority populations in a given area, more often than not, raise questions about environmental justice. Statistical and geographical information systems (GIS) analyses are performed at the zip code level to whether relatively poor, nonwhite populations are disproportionately exposed to hog waste directly or indirectly. The results indicate that these populations are not directly targeted but their association with poverty and also being rural dwellers help explain their disproportionate exposure.

AB  - This article considers recent work promoting environmental human rights and asks whether such an approach is sound and strategically advisable. Taking as its starting point two recent books advocating different interpretations of environmental human rights, this article asks what can be gained from such a strategy, but also addresses the much-neglected question of what problems the human rights paradigm brings with it. Given that most of those who have advocated environmental human rights have done so while excluding from discussion the philosophical problems underlying universal human rights and strains in the consensus on human rights, this inquiry is a timely intervention in an important and growing literature. The conclusion reached here is that while the idea of environmental human rights has much to offer, there are problems with human rights that undermine the benefits that might be gained by presenting claims for environmental justice in the language of human rights.

AB  - This article aims to develop community-contextualised pedagogical innovations to embed disaster components into core social work curriculum through a research methods course. Professional social work education continues to lack a community-contextualised curriculum and professional training that reflects the complexities of extreme events associated with community and human service. This absence jeopardises the advancement of social work engagement in better providing humanitarian support for individuals, families and communities affected by extreme events. Through an undergraduate social work research methods course, this case study qualitatively analysed the instructor's teaching experience, self-reflection and in-class observation. The study presents three major community-contextualised pedagogical innovations of integrating disaster components into the research methods course: public media critique, amidst-disaster community-based participation and observation and practice situation discussion. These pedagogical efforts support the students' exploration and development of various research paradigms and strengthen their ability to connect research with practice, thus addressing the community-driven, short-term necessities and long-term development requirements. This contextualising process, which forms a community-based living laboratory, inspires instructors to integrate community-driven characteristics into their pedagogical instruments. The process illustrates a potential pedagogical framework for research methods courses, in particular, and for social work curriculum, in general.

AB  - The study analyzes the distributional equity of urban green space (UGS) among different social groups across all urban areas in China. Urban green space is measured in two ways: Park area per capita and vegetation coverage ratio within 1.6 km and 3.2 km featuring different ecosystem services they provide. Multiple regression analyses are conducted to assess relationships between different groups (children, the elderly, and migrant populations) and distributed UGS. Largely consistent to other national level studies, the nationwide analytical results indicate emerging social inequality of UGS during the urbanization of China, with a few nuances. A bi-fold pattern is observed in our case: Whilst areas with higher portions of children and senior people have less parks and high vegetation coverage, a marginalized group-internal migrant people, have more parks and low vegetation coverage in their vicinities. The results of regression analyses in different regions further shed light on revealing disparities of UGS in areas with varying socioeconomic development levels, geographical features, and urbanization paces. The implication of the study informs the decision makers to incorporate spatial patterns of social groups into green space guidance and evaluation for the purpose of promoting more equal development of UGS.

AB  - Relying on a nationwide social survey, this study examined the availability of green spaces to different socioeconomic groups living in urban areas in China. Through the survey, data was collected from 3759 individual urban residents. The socioeconomic statuses of the respondents were measured comprehensively using indicators such as household income, level of education, housing conditions, employment status, and internal migration status. Geocoded addresses of respondents were extracted to calculate three different indicators of green space availability: the coverage ratio of the overall areas of vegetation, the coverage ratio of park areas, and the closest distance to a park. The results show that the provision of green space does not strongly discriminate against people's socioeconomic levels in China. Instead, certain disadvantaged groups were, at times, provided with more green spaces than comparison groups. Hinterland migrants (i.e., non-local Hukou) tend to live closer to parks than local people. Residents in affordable housing estates and urban villages (who are marginalized groups within cities) have a higher rate of vegetation coverage than other groups. However, higher-income people tend to live closer to parks than lower-income groups, although the differences in vegetation and park coverage for the two groups are insignificant. This study expands the current inquiry on the distributional justices of green space by adding a nationwide exploration in a developing country. The results evaluated green space availability in urban areas across the country, which also can inform decision-makers and planners about which disadvantaged groups should be the focus of efforts to promote equity in green space distribution

AB  - The spatial implications of urban parks on people's residential satisfaction are fueled by the desire to mitigate the rise of environmental injustice concerns in the developing world. While previous studies have examined the socio-spatial differentiation of park access and residential satisfaction, direct evidence on the role of park usage to play has been limited. This study shifts the focus from access to usage and quantitatively assess their associations with residential satisfaction. Our results quantify the evidence on the significant effects of park usage on residential satisfaction. Importantly, the association between park usage and residential satisfaction tends to be varied with local contextual amenities.

AB  - Quantifying the public health impacts of transportation plans provides stakeholders with information that can aid in evaluating alternative transportation scenarios. Active transportation can improve public health through increased physical activity. At the same time, increasing walking and cycling can affect the risk of traffic injury or increase exposure to air pollution. The Integrated Transport and Health Impacts Model (ITHIM) has been applied around the world to understand changes in public health that will result from increases in active travel. However, the model does not provide disaggregate information required to evaluate the social equity implications of such changes. Health benefits are typically reported as a single value (e.g., total reductions in deaths) at the county or regional level. In this work, we draw from several data sources to report demographically explicit (i.e., race/ethnicity and income) results from an ITHIM implementation developed for the Sacramento region in California. This disaggregation is helpful because travel behavior and health outcomes are affected by race/ethnicity and its correlates (e.g., residential location) and planning agencies are required to ensure that their policies and projects are not discriminatory. The results show people of color are generally expected to experience greater overall health benefits than non-Hispanic whites. In addition, the disaggregated results indicate that there is a substantial variation between counties and demographic groups, providing decision makers with the information needed to target interventions to achieve desired outcomes for disadvantaged populations. They also pave the way for further spatial disaggregation.

AB  - This article explores the changing relationship between the academy and new public formations of scientific research, which we term "civic technoscience." Civic technoscience leverages tactics seen in critical making communities to question and transform how and who can make credible and actionable knowledge. A comparison of two case studies is used. The first is a grassroots mapping process that allows communities to generate high-quality aerial imagery. The second is an academic-led project using environmental sensors to engage disparate audiences in scientific practice. These two projects were found to differ in their ability to form strategic spaces for community-based science, and suggest pathways to foster more robust relationships across the public-academic divide. By altering power dynamics in material, literary, and social technologies used for scientific research, we argue thatcivic technoscience enables citizens to question expert knowledge production through critical making tactics, and creates opportunities to generate credible public science.

AB  - The mapping of geographical variation in disease occurrence plays an important role in assessing environmental justice (i.e. the equitable sharing of adverse effects of pollution across socio-demographic subpopulations). Bayes and empirical Bayes methods can be used to obtain stable small-area estimates while retaining geographic and demographic resolution. In this study, we focus on modelling spatial patterns of disease rates, incorporating demographic variables of interest such as gender and race. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach, which uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo computational method to obtain the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters. We use this approach to construct smoothed maps of lung cancer mortality in Ohio counties in 1988. Our approach also facilitates a cross-validatory comparison between the normal and Poisson likelihoods often fit uncritically to data of this type. Finally, we uncover evidence of changing spatial structure in the rates over the 21-year period 1968-1988, suggesting a spatio-temporal hierarchical model as a new possibility.

AB  - The willingness to pay can be considered as the fiscal dimension of equity in a planning context. The common solution in most western countries for such fiscal inequity is to apply taxation to rebalance; however, there is no equivalent tax category in China, where residential segregation has already occurred and intensified. This paper re-examines the traditional economic aspects of urban green space in relation to size, type and proximity level, and questions whether green fiscal equity appeared in China by exploring how homebuyers in different price ranges value green space services. Specifically, this paper uses the empirical case of Shanghai, China, to test the hypothesis via the quantile hedonic approach. The results show that people at the lowest percentile level paid a higher value for accessing urban public goods than people at the higher income percentiles, and that wealthy people prefer to purchase green space services privately. These results indicate that the traditional social equity problem may not appear in the Chines context, instead urban China's problem with social quity may be more related to the privatisation of green space provision, which is only accessible to homeowners and the resulting decline of public green space developments, which primarily affects low-income renters.

AB  - The benefits that urban green resources bring to humanity have received increasing attention, with the evidence from recent studies into public service provision specifically regarding access to green space being rather mixed. Despite a growing literature base, there is no consensus among scholars on how to measure green space access properly. The traditional GIS-based approach is criticized for inappropriately specifying geographic units and threshold distances, and for ignoring people's self-movement. This research proposes a novel approach, emphasizing the actual park users' activities, both spatially and temporally. We took advantage of the large dataset available from mobile phones to analyze billions of anonymized data samples in order to characterize the behavioral patterns of millions of people who accessed green space in an experimental procedure. We chose Shanghai as the case study because residential segregation had occurred expected to be accompanied by issues of environmental justice. The results found that social equity could be achieved, even where territorial inequity was manifest in a high-population-density context that is undergoing rapid urban growth and transition. Shanghai's vulnerable groups are not found to be unequally treated at present, but there are warning signs that market mechanisms may worsen the uneven development. Therefore, the local municipalities are required to rethink how to provide green infrastructure to different social groups, responding to the inequality and uneven development that capital can bring.

AB  - The question whether urban green resources are equitably distributed across different social groups is a major concern of social equity and environmental justice for both governments and scholars. This topic is particularly relevant for rapidly developing countries such as China where inequality is growing. This paper examines whether and to what extent the distribution of urban park services is equitable for marginalised population in China. We choose Shanghai as the case study and took into account three dimensions of group delineation, namely demographic characteristics, social economic status and social spatial structure. We employ the spatial clustering method to assess the similarities and differences of the association between the spatial patterns of accessibility to urban parks among different social groups. Interestingly, we found that vulnerable groups are favoured over more affluent citizens. Local municipal endeavours have ensured that the access to Shanghai's parks remains socially equitable. Additionally, we attributed it to the path dependence of China's socialism legacy before the market-oriented reforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent environmental justice studies have focused on measuring access to parks for young people due to the decreasing contact with nature for outdoor activities in most developed countries. Results of these analyses reflect the disparities in accessibility better but with digress among different access models. The present study aims to explore an appropriate accessibility measurement for youth and proposes a supply-demand improved two step floating catchment area (2FSCA) method to estimate environmental justice in access to parks in developing countries. Results indicated that the proposed method could identify more underserved communities and youth population with lower mean values of accessibility compared with the traditional 2SFCA method. Spatial accessibility exhibited clustering characteristics in three scenarios wherein high-accessibility areas were clustered nearby the center along the Yangtze River with larger parks, whereas those with low-accessibility were distributed in the eastern and southern regions. Among three age groups, the 0-6 years age group had slightly higher disparity of accessibility than the 7-12 years age group and the majority of teenagers could enjoy equitable park service. Spatial correlation analysis suggested that policy strategies and housing price were the main factors influencing accessibility and several non-dominating influencing factors were also identified from surrounding land use patterns. These findings may provide a comprehensive and realistic perspective on acquainting with accessibility and availability of green space for youth and help urban planners formulate effective policies and strategies to ease spatial imbalance.

AB  - The refuge function of urban parks is regarded as a place of refuge for urban residents after natural or man-made disasters and refers to survival justice. Limited research has given an account of the definition and measurement of the refuge function of urban parks. This study will propose a novel evaluation framework that will comprehensively measure the potential and invisible inequality through the access to parks for residents' refuge and will make a comparative analysis in multiscenarios, respectively from the wall effects, multiscales, different traffic modes, and supply and demand aspects. The results provide several insights that might be of great significance to the adequacy and spatial equality evaluation of urban parks for refuges in cities. The least-cost distance (LCD) model was employed to measure the minimum time cost (MTC) as accessibility for potential and invisible equality analysis. The spatial and statistics comparative analysis in multiscales suggested a considerable inequality in accessibility by different traffic modes to parks for refuging in Wuhan urban center area, China. By assessing whether the MTC for residents that reached the nearest park increased, the results confirmed that wall effect increased the invisible inequality. In particular, the invisible equality caused by wall effect of refuging was relatively greater at a finer scale and more apparent by walking. In addition, the wall effect was related to the socioeconomics of the MTC for residents that reached the nearest refuge park, which was relatively short in medium economic level areas. The findings might remind urban planners to plan and construct urban parks that consider refuge capacity and contribute to reducing the vulnerability of cities, and then help urban residents deal with natural or man-made disasters in future.

AB  - The sustainable development goals (SDGs) reflect the pursuit of achieving spatial justice. Both SDG 1.4 and SDG 11.1 reflect a concern for urban services. Life service resources, which are the new concept proposed by the Chinese government, also call for sustainable development path. However, few studies have focused on the realization of spatial justice in life service resources. This paper proposes a two-level, four-step analysis framework composed of quantity, structure, pattern, and coupling coordination to perceive the spatial justice of life service resources. Based on remote sensing technology and geographic information science, this paper acquires and analyses multi-source data including population density, building outlines, point of interests, subway lines, etc. Furthermore, the case study in downtown Beijing found the following: (1) The total life service resources are extensive and varying in type; (2) regional differences are evident and low-level equilibrium and high-level priority development coexist; (3) life service resources are concentrated in contiguous and multi-centre clusters with a greater north-south than east-west difference; (4) the overall level of life service resources is low, specifically for "high in the centre and low in the periphery" and "high in the east and low in the west". Future management should consider narrowing the development gap and formulating industry development plans to improve spatial justice. Finally, the comparison between Beijing and London and more cities in the future needs to consider the urban development stage, population density, and other aspects.

AB  - The extreme weather events that the world is experiencing are consistent with the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The western North Pacific is the area of the world with the most intense tropical cyclones. Increased sea surface temperatures directly contribute to the wind speed of storms. The 2013 Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan was the strongest tropical cyclone in recorded history to make landfall-causing more than 6000 deaths in the Philippines, mostly from storm surge. This event represents a climate injustice. On one hand, disaster prevention and preparedness were inadequate for impoverished populations in the Philippines who lived in poorly constructed housing. While the international community assisted with the response, recovery was hampered by inadequate and inequitable investment. On the other hand, climate change has been driven by the carbon emissions of industrialized states. Those who call for climate justice argue for more robust measures to control carbon emissions responsible for climate change and worsening global health security. As global citizens and as health professionals, we examine the implications for all of us as moral actors.

AB  - This article offers a novel understanding of China's changing engagement in global climate governance over the past decade. This article argues that China has embedded the construction of its international identity, which has been transforming towards what this article conceptualizes to be a 'Yinling leading power', in promoting and leading global climate governance. China's transforming identity construction has contributed to changing its construction of climate justice and led China to proactively undertake more responsibilities, provide international public goods and promote international climate cooperation. Global climate governance has become one of China's prototypical discursive frames in constructing its new international identity, an important platform where China seeks to share leadership with other major powers and the climate leadership in turn constitutes China's new identity. However, China's inadequate response to international expectations and lack of self-reflection in its climate policy have influenced international recognition on its climate leadership and new identity. In general, China's transforming identity construction and its reconstruction of climate justice have far-reaching implications for China and Europe to cooperate and coordinate in strengthening global climate justice and promoting global climate governance.

AB  - Solar PV is being rolled out on a large scale in India and other emerging economies, but in the enthusiasm for solar's promise of plentiful, low carbon energy, the social and environmental justice concerns accompanying such infrastructure development are in danger of being overlooked. In this context, this paper, using the case study of 'Charanaka Solar Park' in Gujarat state, qualitatively analyses the degree of provision for procedural justice in solar energy implementation in India using a framework drawn from social environmental and energy justice literatures. The case study illustrates how the failure of various aspects of procedural justice can result in unnecessarily large impacts on the livelihoods of rural communities and the further marginalisation of those of lowest status. We conclude with discussion of the aspects of procedural justice that need attention in low carbon energy developments in developing countries alongside some policy and governance suggestions for the achievement of this in India and elsewhere.

AB  - There is no safe detectable level of lead (Pb) in the blood of young children. In the United States, predominantly African-American Black children are exposed to more Pb and present with the highest mean blood lead levels (BLLs). However, racial disparity has not been fully examined within risk factors for early childhood Pb exposure. Therefore, we conducted secondary analysis of blood Pb determinations for 2841 US children at ages 1-5 years with citizenship examined by the cross-sectional 1999 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The primary measures were racial disparities for continuous BLLs or an elevated BLL (EBLL) >= 5 mu g/dL in selected risk factors between non-Hispanic Black children (n = 608) and both non-Hispanic White (n = 1208) or Hispanic (n = 1025) children. Selected risk factors included indoor household smoking, low income or poverty, older housing built before 1978 or 1950, low primary guardian education <12th grade/general education diploma (GED), or younger age between 1 and 3 years. Data were analyzed using a regression model corrected for risk factors and other confounding variables. Overall, Black children had an adjusted +0.83 mu g/dL blood Pb (95% CI 0.65 to 1.00, p < 0.001) and a 2.8 times higher odds of having an EBLL >= 5 mu g/dL (95% CI 1.9 to 3.9, p < 0.001). When stratified by risk factor group, Black children had an adjusted 0.73 to 1.41 mu g/dL more blood Pb (p < 0.001 respectively) and a 1.8 to 5.6 times higher odds of having an EBLL >= 5 mu g/dL (p <= 0.05 respectively) for every selected risk factor that was tested. For Black children nationwide, one in four residing in pre-1950 housing and one in six living in poverty presented with an EBLL >= 5 mu g/dL. In conclusion, significant nationwide racial disparity in blood Pb outcomes persist for predominantly African-American Black children even after correcting for risk factors and other variables. This racial disparity further persists within housing, socio-economic, and age-related risk factors of blood Pb outcomes that are much more severe for Black children.

AB  - Registering as one of the most costly storms in the U.S., Hurricane Harvey resulted in massive damages along the Texas coast with catastrophic winds and storm surges from record rainfall totals and flood-related deterioration in August of 2017. While several studies have contributed to shed light on factors of housing, environmental justice, and engineering processes with regard to Hurricane Harvey impacts, contributions of a holistic sustainable approach including environmental, economic, and social systems have been under-explored. Our research aims to examine these three pillars with regard to flood mitigation strategies in the case of Hurricane Harvey by examining Buffalo Bayou Park in Houston. The research findings show that the park enhances biodiversity remarkably, sequesters 9.19 tons of atmospheric carbon, and intercepts 84,000 gallons of stormwater runoff annually. It contributes to economic benefits as well as improves access to the park within a 10-minute walk to almost 40,000 residents and promotes cultural value and public health outputs as demonstrated by over 90% of survey respondents regarding the quality of life and sense of well-being.

AB  - Recently, location data regarding the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) in South Korea was released to the public. This study investigated the spatial patterns of TRIs and releases of toxic substances in all 230 local governments in South Korea to determine whether spatial clusters relevant to the siting of noxious facilities occur. In addition, we employed spatial regression modeling to determine whether the number of TRI facilities and the volume of toxic releases in a given community were correlated with the community's socioeconomic, racial, political, and land use characteristics. We found that the TRI facilities and their toxic releases were disproportionately distributed with clustered spatial patterning. Spatial regression modeling indicated that jurisdictions with smaller percentages of minorities, stronger political activity, less industrial land use, and more commercial land use had smaller numbers of toxic releases, as well as smaller numbers of TRI facilities. However, the economic status of the community did not affect the siting of hazardous facilities. These results indicate that the siting of TRI facilities in Korea is more affected by sociopolitical factors than by economic status. Racial issues are thus crucial for consideration in environmental justice as the population of Korea becomes more racially and ethnically diverse.

AB  - The various benefits of urban green space are gaining increasing attention nowadays. Hence, the distribution of green space has become a scrutinized concern for spatial equity among local governments and the planning scholars. This study is the first quantitative evaluation of urban park accessibility using house-level data in urban China, from the perspective of social equity. We chose Nanjing as the empirical case and examined 2709 real estate units and 79 parks within the city. Accessibility is measured by the 10-min walking distance from homes to the adjacent urban parks. Using the Street Network Analysis model in ArcGIS and the statistical methods in SPSS, the result shows that 60.5% of the real estates in Nanjing are located within a 10-min walk to access urban parks. However, this accessibility is positively correlated with housing prices, and negatively correlated with the age of the buildings, holding all other factors constant. While affluent homeowners capture a high-quality green amenity, newly-built low-income communities, where most residents are classified as a vulnerable population, have the lowest percentage of accessible green space. This study reveals the existing spatial disparities of urban park accessibility among different socio-economic groups in Nanjing, China. Additionally, we found that urban redevelopment projects with greening and the large-scale affordable housing construction are pricing out the urban poor and rural immigrants from the inner city to the urban peripheral areas. This will reduce the accessibility to urban parks and other public service facilities among the lower income families, and exacerbate the inequality among the rich and the poor in terms of their quality of life. Main findings of this study can inform policy decisions regarding equitable park provision in the construction of the green city and the sustainable development in urban China and other developing countries.

AB  - The significant growth in freight traffic and relevant crashes has aroused increasing concerns about road safety threats in local communities. We use data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area and examine the spatial relationship between freight-related crashes and neighborhoods with low-income and minority populations. We find that both household income and percentage of minority population are significantly correlated with the density of both freight-related crashes and freight-related crashes causing severe injuries and fatalities. The results indicate that freight-related crashes are subject to a spatial inequity problem. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating freight-related safety improvement within these low-income and minority neighborhoods.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as the "fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." The last decade has focused considerable national attention on the environmental pollution inequity that persists among the nation's poorest communities. Despite these environmental justice efforts, poor communities continue to face adverse environmental conditions. For the more than 550 Native American communities, the struggle to attain environmental justice is more than a matter of enforcing national laws equitably; it is also a matter of a federal trust duty for the protection of Indian lands and natural resources, honoring a promise that Native American homelands would forever be sustainable. Equally important is the federal promise to assist tribes in managing their reservation environments under their reserved powers of self-government, an attribute that most distinguishes tribes from other communities. The PM Northwest, Inc. (PMNW) dumpsite is located within the boundaries of the Swinomish Indian Reservation in Washington State. Between approximately 1958 and 1970, PMNW contracted with local oil refineries to dispose of hazardous wastes from their operations at the reservation dumpsite. Almost two decades would pass before the Swinomish tribe was able to persuade EPA that a cleanup action under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) was warranted. This article reviews the enduring struggle to achieve Indian environmental justice in the Swinomish homeland, a process that was dependent upon the development of the tribe's political and environmental management capacity as well as EPA's eventual acknowledgement that Indian environmental justice is integrally linked to its federal trust responsibility.

AB  - The purpose of this integrative review is to examine recent literature on the intersection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 novel coronavirus) and climate change that will lead to a greater understanding of the complexities of the urgent pandemic linked with the emerging climate crisis. A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations' views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century.

AB  - This article is based on activist research conducted alongside Extinction Rebellion Netherlands. By taking a pedagogical approach to social movements, it posits that Extinction Rebellion Netherlands is simultaneously bound up in the reproduction of and resistance to dominant ways of knowing and being. It discusses how 'pedagogies of urgency' reproduce the learning of hegemonic forms of life associated with modernity/coloniality. Treating the movement's margins as a privileged space of epistemological possibility, it examines how the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted who is 'heard, seen and rendered knowing' [Motta & Esteves. (2014). Reinventing emancipation in the 21st century: The pedagogical practices of social movements. Interface, 6(1), 1-24, p. 5)]. This has facilitated the unlearning of pedagogies of urgency, and the learning of new relationships, subjectivities and knowledges that centre justice, prefiguration, and building relations across difference. Nevertheless, the pandemic also underscores some of the impossibilities for learning and dialogue inherent in the exclusions and violence at the heart of modern/colonial power relations.

AB  - The limited effectiveness of Environmental Education (EE) in promoting conceptual and behavioral change preoccupies scholars and activists alike. A central process in this field is that of privatization, which takes place through integrating external programs in school curricula. The present article discusses the implications of this process on the effectiveness of EE in accomplishing its goals, in particular the promotion of environmental justice agenda, which is considered a major target of EE. This question is examined from the viewpoint of educational workers who are in charge of EE at elementary public schools in Israel. Taking these workers as active social agents, we proceed from the view that the way they understand their field of action and their own place in it does not only reflect the situation in this field but actually plays a role in shaping it. Research is based on in-depth interviews with three groups of educational staff: EE teachers, SPNI (The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel) external instructors, and school principals. Analysis points at impaired occupational self-images, struggles over symbolic resources and weak esprit de corps. All this reflect - and accelerate - the field's severe structural ambiguity and devaluation, to the point that it works against its own basic moral principles.

AB  - This article defends the idea of applying principles of corrective justice to the matter of climate change. In particular, it argues against the excusable ignorance objection, which holds that historical emissions produced at a time when our knowledge of climate change was insufficient ought to be removed from the equation when applying rectificatory principles to this context. In constructing my argument, I rely on a particular interpretation of rectificatory justice and outcome responsibility. I also address the individualism objection by showing why we should view states as relevant agents of climate change. This argument is built on the assumption that states are institutions set up to coordinate and regulate human interaction, so as to protect their citizens from the unwanted consequences of such interaction.

AB  - The Gran Chaco, Latin America's second largest forest after the Amazon, has one of the highest deforestation rates worldwide. In the province of Salta, Argentina, the deforestation rate is particularly high, with substantial environmental and social impacts. The province is characterized by the presence of various actors (large-scale producers, small-scale farmers, indigenous peoples, governmental actors, civil society), who are differently exposed to the impacts of deforestation. To better understand this unequal exposure, the paper looks at deforestation from a perspective of environmental justice. As justice is strongly dependent on the local context, we focus on capturing the perceptions of stakeholders on deforestation. We use Q-method, which combines qualitative and quantitative methods to study perceptions. Our results point to the existence of three significant perspectives. The first one, labelled "Development" perspective ranks distribution as the most important dimension. The second one labelled "Family agriculture" perspective stresses the significance of procedural issues. The third one labelled "Subsistence" perspective elaborates mainly on matters of recognition. We conclude that, in order to slow down deforestation, it would be essential to create conditions where marginalized actors are given priority, to facilitate their participation and grant their rights with respect to land use.

AB  - The increase in deforestation in Latin America is generating a great number of land-use conflicts. Diverse stakeholders, such as large-scale producers, indigenous people and small-scale famers, compete for land and contest its use. We applied the methodological framework of social multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) as it addresses one of the main problems confronted in land-use planning: the conflicting perceptions on what a land-use plan should achieve and how. The paper presents a SMCE of different land-use scenarios in the Argentinean Chaco, using two sets of criteria: one reflecting issues of sustainability and one tackling environmental justice. We found that the scenario envisioned by indigenous people is the most sustainable as well as environmentally just, followed by the family agriculture scenario. The findings further point to the strongly negative impact of the development scenario as well as the business as usual scenario. The results also suggest that the two sets of criteria complement each other. In the sustainability approach inequality is often only tackled through one criterion looking at distributional aspects, whereas environmental justice also accounts for issues of recognition and procedure. In a world, which is increasingly unequal, it is more important than ever to account for justice. Overall, the SMCE allows displaying the high environmental, social, cultural and economic costs of deforestation in the Argentinean Chaco, as well as the potential benefits of forest conservation in this area. Finally, our findings could assist in the creation of dialogues about alternative, more sustainable and environmentally just, futures.

AB  - The increasing environmental deterioration that cities face, such as heat island effects, noise and air pollution, can be mitigated by urban park benefits (UPBs). As a result, UPBs are closely related to the well-being of urban residents and are considered an important element of environmental equity. However, the spatial coverage of UPBs considered in previous studies is restricted to the location of urban parks, and the spatial transfer capability of some UPB types is largely ignored. This study divides UPBs into four categories, i.e., park entry benefits, small space benefits, medium space benefits, and size-determined benefits. We investigate the acquisition levels of these four UPB categories in Shanghai's central city by park accessibility indices, integrating spatial and social dimensions. The results show that sub-districts with higher socioeconomic status are more likely to have good access to the four UPB categories. Fortunately, elderly and unemployed individuals also have easier access to UPBs as do those with higher socio-economic status. Despite parents' desire to have parks nearby for their children's growth, inequities of access to UPBs are found among children. The research methods and results of this paper have implications for urban planning practices.

AB  - The decline in human mobility and socioeconomic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by reports of significant improvements in air quality. We evaluate whether there was a uniform improvement in air quality across neighborhoods, with a special attention on differences by race. We focus on the COVID-19 lockdown in New York State, an early epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. Using a triple difference-in-differences model, we find that, despite the seasonal decline in particulate matter pollution starting late March (concurrent with the lockdown period), the lockdown narrowed the disparity in air quality between census tracts with high and low shares of non-white population in rural New York, whereas the racial gap in air quality remained unchanged in urban New York.

AB  - Previous research addressing the unequal distribution of locally desirably land (LDL) has mainly ignored their associated environments (i.e., rural or urban). However, this study proposed a new framework that treats rural and urban regions separately. In rural areas, the LDLs included all public lands. In urbanized areas, the LDLs were defined as green open spaces. Potential inequities in the distribution of LDL were assessed with respect to socioeconomic characteristics of residents in the State of Georgia. Using US Census Bureau Data (2000). Census Block Groups (CBGs) adjacent to LDLs were compared to CBGs outside of LDLs on four socioeconomic variables (per capita income, occupation, education, and race) in urban, suburban and rural environments. Results showed that CBGs adjacent to LDLs were composed of statistically significant upper-class communities containing fewer blue-collar workers, more whites, and higher income and higher educated people in rural, suburban and urban areas.

AB  - Since the kickoff of reform and opening up, with the rapid social and economic development, China's environmental problems get increasingly serious. A review of the emergence and development of environmental problems will reveal that not all social strata cause the same degree of environmental damage, and people with different social backgrounds and lifestyles will have different impacts on the environment. Moreover, environmental risks are not evenly distributed among all social members. Different social strata and regions are subject to different proportion of environmental risks. This concerns environmental justice. Particularly, as the inter-regional economic disparities widen, the issue of environmental justice among all regions gets more and more obvious. This poses a threat to the distribution of limited environmental capacity among regions, and a potential hazard to coordinated and sustainable development among regions. Adherence to the scientific outlook of development to ensure environmental justice and coordinated development among regions has now become an important research subject on building a harmonious socialist society. In this paper, we will, taking Jiangsu Province as an example and based on the analysis of regional differences and development trends, build an environmental justice assessment index system to assess the environmental justice under regional differences and put forth suggestions on regional coordinated development.

AB  - The environmentally sustainable city has been increasingly attracting the attention of politicians and researchers. In this regard, this paper reviews the existing literature on the relationship between urban development, local health and Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. Some findings suggest that patterns of urban development could promote urban sustainability in terms of the reduction of GHG emissions, for example, high-density development or compact urban form, which reduces vehicle kilometres travelled and thus reduce GHG emissions. However, it has also been found that these types of urban development might also cause health problems for local residents related to factors such as overcrowding, less green space for outdoor activities, a local heat island effect, high exposure to traffic and air pollution, and psychological stress. This local health paradox related to environmentally sustainable development is also deeply connected to equity issues, including environmental justice, health equity and the related spatial inequities. For future research, the paper proposes a new conceptual framework of the 'glocal environmentally sustainable city', addressing a balance between local health and global environmental sustainability.

AB  - The environment is the common property of all human beings, and all should enjoy equal rights to use the environment. Years of growth have greatly improved China's overall economic development, but the problem of environmental inequality has become prominent. Based on data from 278 prefecture-level cities, the Williamson coefficient is used to measure the environmental inequality and environmental pollution-inequality indices of 25 regions from 2003 to 2015, and the effects of the stringency of environmental policy instruments on environ-mental inequality are discussed. The results demonstrate that the provincial environmental inequalities in China between 2003 and 2015 declined at first and then rose, thus showing a U-shaped trend, and the heterogeneity of various pollutant emissions is substantial. The extent of public participation is negatively correlated with environmental inequality, while the stringencies of command-and-control and market-based instruments are positively correlated with environmental inequality. An inequality process may be necessary during the trans-formation from a high-pollution to a low-pollution state, so governments should mix a variety of environmental policy instruments to narrow or even eliminate regional environmental inequality. The findings of this study have important implications for the government to effectively choose policy instruments, improve policymaking ability, and eliminate environmental inequality.

AB  - Research on environmental justice and social inclusion suggests that high-income wage earners may have better job access due to their greater choices in both housing and transportation markets. This study compares the jobs/housing balance and mode choice of different groups of employees of a large employer (27,113 employees) and those of the "reference groups" from comparable employees working for smaller employers in Los Angeles. Based on spatial and statistical analyses, this paper finds the following: a) Across all employee groups, a better jobs/housing balance was accompanied by higher income, as was likelihood to patronize Travel Demand Management (TDM) programs. b) Employees from the large employer had more options for carpooling and thus drove alone less, even after controlling overall housing stock, residential location, annual income, and/or commute time. c) Across all employee groups, good jobs/housing balance did not necessarily bring about green mode choice. d) Comprehensive TDM measures by the large employer significantly reduced employees' dependence on driving, even in a region where autocommuting dominates. However, these measures were costly to implement. e) Different employee groups favor different TDM programs, and the patterns are marked by income. The above findings suggest that shared or consolidated TDM and housing programs, which pool smaller employers, might better promote green mode choice. Participating employers may also negotiate better deals for program implementation when these programs involve third-party transit agencies and contractors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Clean Air Act requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency to review routinely the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5). A non-governmental Independent Particulate Matter Review Panel recently concluded that the current PM2.5 standards do not protect public health adequately and recommended revising the daily standard from 35 to 25-30 mu g/m(3) and the annual standard from 12 to 8-10 mu g/m(3). To assess the public health implications of adopting the PM2.5 standards proposed by the panel, the health benefits are quantified from their implementation based on both current (observed) and future (simulated) air quality data for California. The findings indicate that strengthening the standards would provide significant public health benefits valued at $42-$149 billion. Additionally, the stronger standards are shown to benefit environmental justice via health savings that are allocated more within environmentally and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.

AB  - The purpose of SENTIERI-ReNaM Project is to describe mesothelioma incidence in the Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs). The present report deals with 39 NPCSs (20 in Northern Italy, 8 in Central Italy and 11 in Southern Italy). Asbestos is specifically mentioned in the regulatory acts of recognition for 10 NPCSs and it is the only agent that has determined environmental contamination in 3 of them (Casale Monferrato, Broni, and Bari). The timeframe of the study is 2000-2011 for 34 out of 39 sites. The corresponding reference periods for the sites of Latium, Campania, Umbria, and Bolzano Province are, respectively, 2001-2011, 2005-2011, and 2006-2011. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) for mesothelioma, with their corresponding 90% Confidence Intervals, have been estimated for all sites. The interpretation of the study findings has been based on anamnestic information made available by the Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM), and completed thanks to knowledge derived from the international scientific literature. In men, mesothelioma incidence has shown excesses in 27/39 sites and defects in the remaining 12; in women, excesses have been reported in 20 sites, defects in 15, and no cases have been detected in the remaining 4 sites. The highest annual incidence rates have been observed in the sites characterized only by the presence of as-bestos-cement factories (Broni and Casale Monferrato): respectively, 98.0 and 68.6 per 100,000 per year in men, 72.1 and 45.8 in women. Besides these two sites, the highest rates have been observed in the sites with naval shipyards: 13.2 in men and 2.5 in women. Excesses of mesothelioma incidence have been confirmed (with respect to previous observations) in the sites of Broni, Casale Monferrato, Balangero, and in the coastal areas of Trieste, La Spezia, Venice, and Leghorn. Balangero has been the major European chrysotile quarry, while the other sites are characterized by the presence of naval shipyards with demonstrated use of asbestos before it was banned in 1992. An excess of mesothelioma incidence has also been confirmed in the site of Biancavilla, characterized by the presence of the fluoro-edenite fibrous amphibole, classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). An increased incidence of mesothelioma was also observed in the areas where no direct use of asbestos had previously been documented, like Cengio and Saliceto (chemical industry), Falconara on Sea (oil refinery), and Litorale Domizio Flegreo and Agro Aversano (a large area including multiple hazardous waste dumping sites). These findings show that a relevant proportion of Italian mesothelioma cases is concentrated in NPCSs. About 1,500 extra cases of mesothelioma have been estimated in the overall series of 39 sites (2000-2011), corresponding to 125 extra cases per year. The excess has concerned the sites with manufacture of asbestos-cement products, but also the areas with asbestos quarries, naval shipyards, illegal hazardous waste dumping sites with asbestos-containing materials, petrochemical industries, refineries and steel plants. In some sites, particularly Casale Monferrato and Broni, analytical epidemiological studies have shown the causal role of not only occupational, but also environmental exposures, with special reference to paving of gardens and courtyards with asbestos-cement industry by-products. The main novelty generated by the collaborative SENTIERI-ReNaM Project concerns the detection of significant mesothelioma excesses not only in sites where asbestos is explicitly reported as a source of contamination, but also in a number of areas defined "of national interest" for environmental cleanup due to other sources of pollution. This confirms that the range of economic activities and working and living environments affected by asbestos exposure is very wide and it is not restricted to the industrial sectors characterized by the direct use of this material.

AB  - The obstetrics-gynecology community has issued a call to action to prevent toxic environmental chemical exposures and their threats to healthy human reproduction. Recent committee opinions recognize that vulnerable and underserved women may be impacted disproportionately by environmental chemical exposures and recommend that reproductive health professionals champion policies that secure environmental justice. Beauty product use is an understudied source of environmental chemical exposures. Beauty products can include reproductive and developmental toxicants such as phthalates and heavy metals; however, disclosure requirements are limited and inconsistent. Compared with white women, women of color have higher levels of beauty producte-related environmental chemicals in their bodies, independent of socioeconomic status. Even small exposures to toxic chemicals during critical periods of development (such as pregnancy) can trigger adverse health consequences (such as impacts on fertility and pregnancy, neurodevelopment, and cancer). In this commentary, we seek to highlight the connections between environmental justice and beauty producte-related chemical exposures. We describe racial/ethnic differences in beauty product use (such as skin lighteners, hair straighteners, and feminine hygiene products) and the potential chemical exposures and health risks that are associated with these products. We also discuss how targeted advertising can take advantage of mainstream beauty norms to influence the use of these products. Reproductive health professionals can use this information to advance environmental justice by being prepared to counsel patients who have questions about toxic environmental exposures from beauty care products and other sources. Researchers and healthcare providers can also promote health-protective policies such as improved ingredient testing and disclosure for the beauty product industry. Future clinical and public health research should consider beauty product use as a factor that may shape health inequities in women's reproductive health across the life course.

AB  - Recent studies examining racial and ethnic inequities in exposure to urban air pollution have led to advances in understanding the nature and extent of overall concentration exposures by pollutant, demarcated by disadvantaged groups. However, the stability of inequities at various spatial units and the exposure by air pollution sources are often neglected. In this case study from the Dallas-Fort Worth (Texas, USA) area, we used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and an air dispersion model to estimate environmental justice impacts at different spatial scales (i.e., zip code, census tract, block group) and by source (i.e., industrial pollution sources, vehicle pollution sources, industry and vehicle pollution sources combined). Using whites as a reference, blacks and other races were more likely to be exposed to higher sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations although the Odds Ratio (OR) varied substantially by pollution source type [e.g., industrial pollution source based: (OR=1.80; 95% CI (Confidence Interval): 1.79-1.80) vs. vehicle pollution source based: (OR=2.70; 95% CI: 2.68-2.71)] and varied less between spatial scales [for vehicle pollution sources, (OR=2.70; 95% CI: 2.68-2.71) at the census tract level but was (OR=2.54; 95% CI: 2.53-2.55) at the block group scale]. Similar to the pattern of racial inequities, people with less education (i.e., less than 12 years of education) and low income (i.e., per capital income below $20 000) were more likely to be exposed to higher SO2 concentrations, and those ORs also varied greatly with the pollution sources and slightly with spatial scales. It is concluded that the type of pollution source plays an important role in SO2 pollution exposure inequity assessment, while spatial scale variations have limited influence. Future studies should incorporate source-specific exposure assessments when conducting studies on environmental justice.

AB  - The numerical model MUKLIMO_3 is used to simulate the urban climate of an imaginary city as an illustrative example to demonstrate that the residential areas with deprived socio-economic conditions can exhibit an enhanced heat load at night, and thus more disadvantageous environmental conditions, compared with the areas of higher socio-economic status. The urban climate modelling simulations differentiate between orographic, natural landscape, building and social effects, where social differences are introduced by selection of location, building type and amount of vegetation. The model results show that the increase of heat load can be found in the areas inhabited by the poor population as a combined effect of natural and anthropogenic factors. The unfavourable location in the city and the building type, consisting of high density, low housing with high fraction of pavement and small amount of vegetation contribute to the formation of excessive heat load. This abstract example shows that the enhancement of urban heat load can be linked to the concept of a socially stratified city and is independent of the historical development of any specific city.

AB  - This article provides a framework for understanding water problems as problems of justice. Drawing on wider (environmental) justice approaches, informed by interdisciplinary ontologies that define water as simultaneously natural (material) and social, and based on an explicit acceptance of water problems as always contested, the article posits that water justice is embedded and specific to historical and socio-cultural contexts. Water justice includes but transcends questions of distribution to include those of cultural recognition and political participation, and is intimately linked to the integrity of ecosystems. Justice requires the creative building of bridges and alliances across differences.

AB  - This paper investigates the importance of scale for power dynamics in the negotiation of risks connected to urban rivers in Nairobi, Kenya. In addition to unequal distribution of wealth, global inequalities in the distribution of risk become increasingly important. Scale as a significant dimension of inequality is discussed in the context of Nairobi's urban rivers, as water scarcity and flooding events are expected to increase and can both be observed within the highly heterogenic city of Nairobi. The paper attempts to answer the overarching question: how do contested definitions of scale influence the distribution of risks in the case of informal settlement along Nairobi's urban rivers? This contains a conceptual, as well as an empirical dimension. Regarding the conceptual part, riskscapes are introduced and subsequently expanded to include an explicitly scalar dimension. At that, riskscapes are understood as a contemporaneous (and often contradictory) plurality of material and ideational relations that connect risks with people and the environment. A relational focus on fluidity and movement interprets scalar levels as contingent and political and thus not inherent to entities but as the product of negotiable relations. This conceptual background interfaces with the methodology of multi-sited ethnography, which inspires the method of following the river through the fragmented city of Nairobi. Applying this conceptual framing to the case of urban slum-dwellers in Nairobi, it is argued that women are discursively and materially framed to the household level, where they face the highest flooding risk. The level of the body is identified as a susceptible but often neglected scalar framing and is therefore placed in the centre of empirical scrutiny. This informs the conclusion to regard the poor female body in the case of Nairobi's urban rivers as a sacrifice-scale where risks produced elsewhere are 'dumped', addressing the empirical dimension of the research question. This paper's main contribution is the conceptual merging of the politics of risk and scale, the substantiation of this argument by a relevant case study and subsequently the spotlighting of dynamics of margin-alisation through scalar negotiations of risk.

AB  - We examine social equity in a complex community-based controlled hunting program in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia. We use a grounded qualitative approach and apply a multi-dimensional equity framework to assess locals' perceptions of equity in the distribution of benefits and costs, the processes of engagement and participation, and the recognition of traditional land use practices and values, paying attention to the inter- and intra-community power dynamics, institutional characteristics, and broader contextual factors that shape perceptions. We conducted interviews with 15 focus groups across four communities and contrast two community-based management models: one that employs a community power sharing mechanism and one without. In each community, we stratified respondents into groups of young men, elder men, women, and community leaders to respect differences in gender, age, and role in the community. The results demonstrate the interweaving effects that broader contextual factors, individual characteristics, and institutional support have on equity perceptions. Important contextual dimensions included pre-existing and ongoing social, political, and economic processes such as population growth and land scarcity, legacy of land use interactions, lack of community infrastructure, and youthled political activism and unrest. Individual attributes that influenced perceptions included landlessness and joblessness among the youth, the extreme reliance of women on forest products for subsistence, and the traditional value systems and practices among elders. Access to information, transparency of decision making, and the presence of monitoring and accountability also influenced perceived equity. This study contributes to the literature on community-based conservation by demonstrating how and why local's concepts of fairness diverge from generic and externally defined notions of equitability. Moving forward, equity assessments need to evaluate local actor's diverse and contextualized relationships with other actors and the natural world, and give recognition to how perceptions interplay with broader social and environmental processes, prior to designing and implementing conservation programs.

AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal trajectories of Seattle's industrial land use restructuring and the shifting riskscape in Seattle, WA, a commonly recognized urban model of sustainability. Drawing on the perspective of sustainability as a conflicted process, this research explored the intersections of urban industrial and nonindustrial land use planning, gentrification, and environmental injustice. In the first part of our research, we combine geographic cluster analysis and longitudinal air toxic emission comparisons to quantitatively investigate socioeconomic changes in Seattle Census block-groups between 1990, 2000, and 2009 coupled with measures of pollution volume and its relative potential risk. Second, we qualitatively examine Seattle's historical land use policies and planning and the growing tension between industrial and nonindustrial land use. The gentrification, green cities, and growth management conflicts embedded within sustainability/livability lead to pollution exposure risk and socioeconomic vulnerability converging in the same areas and reveal one of Seattle's significant environmental challenges. Our mixed-method approach can guide future urban sustainability studies to more effectively examine the connections between land use planning, industrial displacement, and environmental injustice. Our results also help sustainable development practitioners recognize that a more just sustainability in Seattle and beyond will require more planning and policy attention to mitigate obscured industrial land use conflicts.

AB  - This paper examines the change in air pollutant concentrations between 2005 and 2010 occurring in the City of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. After analysis of stationary air pollutant concentration data, we analyze mobile air pollutant concentration data. Air pollutants included in the analysis are CO, PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, and NOX. Stationary monitoring indicates a continuous reduction in air pollutant concentrations. Stationary monitors only cover a small spatial extent of Hamilton. Mobile monitoring of air pollutant concentrations, averaged over census tract boundaries, indicates both improvement and decline in air quality. These improvements and declines in air quality are spatially clustered throughout Hamilton. Mobile data indicated significant decline in median pollutant concentration for CO, SO2, PM2.5, and NO2; but significant increase for NO and NOX. Air quality change in Hamilton is spatially heterogeneous, and is not captured based on the current stationary monitoring network. Coupling of mobile and stationary air pollutant concentration monitoring provides a more accurate spatial assessment of local air quality.

Ongoing efforts of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to reduce the buildup of forest fuels on national forests, particularly in dry mixed-conifer forests of the U.S. West, are an example. Federal land management agencies must comply with the Executive Order on Environmental Justice (EJ Order, 59 Fed. Reg 7629, 1994), but there is scant documentation of whether these agencies have substantively complied with the EJ Order in implementing land management activities. There is also little quantitative environmental justice (EJ) research on dispersed rural populations, such as those often found adjacent to national forests. Our research addresses these gaps. We apply a novel mixed-methods approach, including quantitative pattern analysis and interviews with forest managers, to examine whether the benefits of wildfire risk reduction created on twelve national forests in four western U.S. states were equitably distributed among nearby populations. We found that EJ impacts might have occurred on all twelve forests, but they tended to be localized and context specific. We also learned from interviewees that EJ was not considered in decisions about where and how to conduct wildfire hazard reduction and that EJ populations rarely engaged in collaborative project planning apart from the formal tribal consultation process. Our research expands the range of quantitative geographical analysis of EJ issues and our methods could be adopted by land management agencies to achieve more equitable distribution of costs and benefits from their management activities.

AB  - This study examines the major differences between native-born and foreign-born residents of the United States on measures of environmental risk perception and risk attitudes. Hypotheses derived from the cultural theory of risk were tested. Discriminant analysis of the General Social Survey (GSS) and International Social Survey, Program (ISSP) data was conducted using environmental and technological risk perception and attitudes modules. The results indicate that foreign-born respondents are more risk averse and skeptical about sources of information about environmental risks than their native-born counterparts. While there are some points of agreement, these groups exhibit dissimilar environmental risk perception on several measures. Native-born respondents scored significantly lower on risk perception and attitudes toward technological and environmental risks relative to their foreign-born counterparts. Methodological and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - We undertook a community-level aggregate analysis in South Carolina, USA, to examine associations between mother-child conditions from a Medicaid cohort of pregnant women and their children using spatially interpolated arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) concentrations in three geographic case areas and a control area. Weeks of gestation at birth was significantly negatively correlated with higher estimated As (r(s) = -0.28, p = 0.01) and Pb (r(s) = -0.26, p = 0.02) concentrations in one case area. Higher estimated Pb concentrations were consistently positively associated with frequency of black mothers (all p < 0.02) and negatively associated with frequency of white mothers (all p < 0.01), suggesting a racial disparity with respect to Pb.

AB  - This study characterizes ecological distribution conflicts (EDC) related to the mining industry and derives a series of political implications for Guatemala. The characterization includes a placement in the context of Central America, regional location, intensity of the EDC and the trends in social and environmental consequences, with special emphasis on the groups of social actors affected and the degree to which the institutional framework does not provide effective means of participatory environmental governance. The time period covers 2005 to 2013. In order to understand trends in actor behavior and diverse moments of high intensity we introduce the use of action and response timelines as a methodology for EDC analysis. We propose the notions of embedded conflicts to describe their relation with the structural social conditions prevailing in the country and swarms of conflicts to describe their escalation through time. We conclude that conflictivity is inherent to the unsustainable characteristics of metallic mining and is aggravated by Guatemalas history of social inequality and power concentration. The attempts to reduce "conflictivity" through CSR have been insufficient in addressing these structural conditions. EDCs may have helped create a positive environment for creative forces to seek sustainability and justice in Guatemalas development model.

AB  - Two concepts that provide new directions for public policy, environmental justice and sustainability, are both highly contested. Each has tremendous potential to effect long-lasting change. Despite the historically different origins of these two concepts and their attendant movements, there exists an area of theoretical compatibility between them. This conceptual overlap is a critical nexus for a broad social movement to create livable, sustainable communities for all people in the future. The goal of this article is to illustrate the nexus in the United States. The authors do this by presenting a range of local or regionally based practical models in five areas of common concern to both environmental justice and sustainability: land use planning, solid waste, toxic chemical use, residential energy use, and transportation. These models address both environmental justice principles while working toward greater sustainability in urbanized areas.

AB  - To advance environmental justice in communities, this paper analyzed the way the attributes of green spaces have been defined and evaluated in the literature. We identified and examined 72 peer reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2018, which explored green spaces and social groups in the U.S. To report findings systematically, we collected indicators used in the articles and assessed which attributes of green spaces the indicators represent. We found that most articles focused on access more than other attributes (such as ecological benefits, visual and esthetic values, amenities, sociability, and safety). This finding was more salient in the articles that examined green spaces together with race and ethnicity, income class, or age group. The articles that considered green space attributes with gender focused more on evaluating safety, sociability, and amenity. For inclusive planning, design, and management of green spaces and parks, urban planners and park managers must pay attention to diverse attributes to which different social groups are sensitive.

AB  - This paper explores the complex heterogeneous experiences of flood impacts based on a bio-psychosocial model of socio-economic, demographic, behavioural and environmental factors. Using ordinary least squares regression on a cross-sectional survey of 1003 individuals, flood impacts in three contiguous coastal neighbourhoods in Lagos, Nigeria, were modelled. The results show that approximately 52% of the variability in flood impact was accounted for by education, age, family structure, ethnicity, personal health concern and income. While involvement in coping was not a significant predictor of flood impacts, relocation emerged as a strong predictor. The inclusion of behavioural factors did not change the magnitude and significance of the relationship between demographic factors and flood impacts. However, the effects of age, education and personal health concern disappeared when environmental factors were controlled. The overall importance of the predictors for determining flood impact in decreasing order is as follows: income > coping strategies > ethnicity = participation in community development > family structure > personal health concerns > housing quality > reasons for living in residential locality > neighbourhood vulnerability to flood > housing vulnerability to flood.

AB  - This perspective piece makes a case for a more rigorous treatment of managed retreat as a politically, legally, and economically distinct type of relocation that is separate from climate migration. We argue that the use of both concepts interchangeably obfuscates the problems around climate-induced mobilities and contributes to the inconsistencies in policy, plans, and actions taken by governments and organizations tasked with addressing them. This call for a disentanglement is not solely an academic exercise aimed at conceptual clarity, but an effort targeted at incentivizing researchers, practitioners, journalists, and advocates working on both issues to better serve their constituencies through alliance formation, resource mobilization, and the establishment of institutional pathways to climate justice. We offer a critical understanding of the distinctions between climate migration and managed retreat grounded in six orienting propositions. They include differential: causal mechanisms, legal protections, rights regimes and funding structures, discursive effects, implications for land use, and exposure to risks. We provide empirical examples from existing literature to contextualize our propositions while calling for a transformative justice approach to addressing both issues.

AB  - This study employed stable isotopes of delta O-18 and delta H-2 in conjunction with other hydrological parameters to understand the origin, inferred residence time, and seasonal effect of groundwater in the shallow aquifers of the eastern Dahomey Basin. A total of 230 groundwater samples (97 in the wet season and 133 in the dry season) were collected from the borehole and shallow aquifer between May 2017 and April 2018. Groundwater analysis included major ions and delta O-18 and delta H-2, isotopes data in precipitation from three selected Global Network of Isotope in Precipitation (GNIP) stations across West Africa, Douala in Cameroon, Cotonou in Republic of Benin, and Kano in Nigeria were used in comparative analysis. Results of the hydrochemical model revealed Ca-HCO3 and Na-Cl as dominant water types with other mixing water types such as Ca-SO4, Ca-Cl, Na-SO4, and K-Mg-HCO3, which characterised early stage of groundwater transformation as it infiltrates through vadose zone into the aquifer. delta O-18 and delta H-2 precipitation data from the three stations plotted along with the groundwater samples indicate recent meteoric water origin, with little effect of evaporation during the dry season. The plot of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) against delta O-18 showed clustering of the water samples between the recharge and the evaporation zone with dry season samples trending towards increased TDS, which is an indication of the subtle effect of evaporation during this period. Tracing groundwater types along the flow paths within the basin is problematic and attributed to the heterogeneity of the aquifer with anthropogenic influences. Moreover, a comparison of the delta O-18 and delta H-2 isotopic compositions of groundwater and precipitation in the three selected stations, with their respective deuterium excess (D-excess) values established low evapotranspiration induced isotope enrichment, which could be due to higher precipitation and humidity in the region resulting in low isotope fractionation; hence, little effect of seasonal variations. The study, therefore, suggested groundwater recharge in the shallow aquifer in the eastern Dahomey Basin is of meteoric origin with a short residence time of water flows from soils through the vadose zone to the aquifers.

AB  - This essay reviews three recent books on the changing landscape of global energy politics in the era of climate change. Key questions that the authors investigate include: how will the renewable energy transition reshape the global balance of power? How will political-economic interdependencies and geopolitical alignments shift? Will contemporary petro-states adapt or collapse? And what new patterns of peace and conflict may emerge in a decarbonized world order? The authors provide different perspectives on the likely speed of the energy transition and its geopolitical implications. However, they occlude deeper questions about the depth of the transformations needed to prevent climate catastrophe-particularly in the nature of capitalism and military power-and the potential for more radical perspectives on energy futures. In contrast, I will argue that we should advance a critical research agenda on the global energy transition that accounts for the possibility of more far-reaching transformations in the political-economic, military, and ideological bases of world politics and highlights diverse movements fighting for their realization. These possible transformations include (1) transitions to post-growth political economies; (2) a radical shrinkage of emissions-intensive military-industrial complexes; and (3) decolonizing ideologies of "progress." If struggles for alternative energy futures beyond the hegemony of economic growth and Western-style modernization are at the forefront of radical politics today, then these struggles deserve greater attention from critical IR scholars.

AB  - This paper investigates a grassroots Chinese movement called the New Rural Reconstruction Movement (NRRM). Drawing on field visits, surveys, interviews and social media posts regarding a NRRM project and relevant literature I link the NRRM to the degrowth movement. This is likely the first research analysing a Chinese grassroots movement from a degrowth theoretical perspective. This link is designed to bring greater awareness of the NRRM to western environmentalists and greater awareness of degrowth to Chinese scholars, in the expectation that the two movements will find it beneficial to engage in collaborative research. This paper demonstrates similar progressive environmental based arguments are being debated in places with different geographical and socio-political contexts. It suggests there is the possibility that the NRRM and degrowth could work together to help achieve shared goals.

AB  - This paper builds on a recent strand of critical social theory - Sassen's [Expulsions: Brutality and complexity in the global economy. Harvard University Press; At the systemic edge. Cultural Dynamics, 27(1), 173-181] expulsions and systemic edge perspective - to argue that a sociological theory of climate change needs to start from the critical sites where change takes place. To this end, we propose the concept of climate edge as the intersection of accelerating environmental injustices and future climate change vulnerabilities. We use data from the Environmental Justice Atlas and the Climate Adapt platform to select 17 cases that approximate, to various degrees, the climate edge concept. We conclude that these sites deserve closer attention as they signal the transformative potential of long expulsion chains that may define the characteristics of future climate-related conflicts. The climate edge is simultaneously a site of social struggle.

AB  - Through exploring multiple contemporary conceptions of justice, this article illustrates that justice matters when considering outcomes in non-governmental organization (NGO) assistance. In environmental justice (EJ) scholarship, the term justice has been underproblematized, assuming a tacit understanding of the concept as fairness or equitable distribution of environmental harms. Using the rebuilding of two heavily damaged poor and minority neighborhoods in post-Katrina New Orleans as case studies, this article makes evident the different conceptualizations of justice embedded within the strategies and techniques of NGOs and community organizations. Examining both practices and outcomes, I argue that the definition of justice that NGOs implicitly or explicitly adopt in their strategies and technologies of assistance can lead to very different results in postdisaster neighborhood revitalization. For science and technology studies, conceptions of justice can help articulate a more critical social science that opens up the descriptive/normative divide. This is important in thinking about equitable social change and allied policy-as it applies not only to NGO assistance but also to other science and technology issues that intersect with marginalized communities as well.

AB  - This paper examines the accessibility of urban green spaces within the Syrian city of Aleppo before the civil war using an environmental justice approach by indicating the current state of the parameters proximity and quantity in relation to the socioeconomic status of the inhabitants. Therefore, we conducted the average nearest neighbour analysis, facilities over and under coverage analysis, network analysis and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by a post-hoc Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test. The findings clearly indicate that the spatial pattern of the distribution of public parks facilities was significantly clustered (p-value < 0.0001), with a z-score of -16.4. Several neighbourhoods within the western and central parts of the city were identified to have a higher density of facilities, while the majority of the neighbourhoods located in the marginal parts in eastern Aleppo (low income) lack access to urban green spaces. The hierarchy-wise analysis reveals a strong deficit of urban green spaces at lower hierarchies, for example pocket parks and neighbourhood parks, while access to quarter parks and district parks is high. The urban green spaces at higher hierarchies are located in high and middle socioeconomic status areas. Regarding social segregation in park distribution and their accessibility, the data showed that high income neighbourhoods enjoy a significantly higher percentage of park facilities. The approach presented in this paper offers a generic method for the future development of public green spaces for balanced and sustainable planning.

AB  - This article takes up Samir Amin's challenge to rethink the issue of global political organization by proposing the building of a diagonal political organization for the Global Left that would link local, national and world regional and global networks and prefigurational communities to coordinate contention for power in the world-system during the next few decades of the 21st century. The World Social Forum (WSF) process needs to be reinvented for the current period of rising neo-fascist and populist reactionary nationalism and to foster the emergence of a capable instrument that can confront and contend with the global power structure of world capitalism and aid local and national struggles. This will involve overcoming the fragmentation of progressive movements that have been an outcome of the rise of possessive individualism, the precariat, and social media. We propose a holistic approach to organizing a vessel for the global left based on struggles for climate justice, human rights, anti-racism, queer rights, feminism, sharing networks, peace alliances, taking back the city, progressive nationalism and confronting and defeating neo-fascism and new forms of conservative populism.

AB  - This paper provides additional empirical knowledge of injustice embedded in the urban governance of informal-sector electronic waste (e-waste) recycling in Ghana. It uses Urban Political Ecology and Environmental Justice perspectives to explain how divergent interest and power among diverse actors in the e-waste sector engender social and environmental (in)justice in Accra. Using the case study approach, this paper reveals that the persistent struggles over interest and power which characterise the governance and management of informal e-waste recycling generate inequity, false accusations, misrecognition, disrespect, devaluation, neglect, exclusion, and abuse of freedom and rights. Inclusive of the finding is the development of local resistance and social movement in defence of interests and against state aggression, oppression, domination and neglect. The study concludes to suggest that the governance of urban socio-economic and ecological space of Accra should involve coordination, participation, holistic inclusion of diverse interest, so as to minimise trade-offs and reap synergies.

AB  - Urbanization and re-urbanization continually alter spatial patterns of social disadvantage and hazard exposure, which in turn affect social vulnerability. The current study explores vulnerability to hazards in Greater Vancouver over a 15-year period (1986 to 2001). Results illustrate how social disadvantage is multi-dimensional and emerges from the social geography of a city. The study illustrates the speed with which both the structure and spatial patterns of social disadvantage can change in cities experiencing rapid growth or redevelopment. The study also suggests that Greater Vancouver does not display consistent patterns of minority- or income-based environmental inequity in hazard exposure, which raises questions about the role of various policies in ameliorating vulnerability to natural and technological hazards.

AB  - Traditionally, environmental justice studies have examined the disproportionate burden suffered by marginalized populations in regards to contamination or resource extraction. However, to date little is known about how complex underlying goals shape community organization for long-term environmental quality in different cities around the world, and how concerns for health play out in projects such as park creation, gardens, or playground construction. Through an analysis of neighborhood mobilization around environmental projects in Boston, Barcelona, and Havana, I unravel common patterns of activism aimed at rebuilding community and remaking place, thereby addressing physical and psychological dimensions of environmental health.

AB  - To date, little is known about the extent to which the creation of municipal green spaces over an entire city addresses social or racial inequalities in the distribution of environmental amenities - or whether such an agenda creates contributes to green gentrification. In this study, we evaluate the effects of creating 18 green spaces in socially vulnerable neighborhoods of Barcelona during the 1990s and early 2000s. We examined the evolution over time of six socio-demographic gentrification indicators in the areas close to green spaces in comparison with the entire districts. Our results indicate that new parks in the old town and formerly industrialized neighborhoods seem to have experienced green gentrification. In contrast, most economically depressed areas and working-class neighborhoods with less desirable housing stock and more isolated from the city center gained vulnerable residents as they became greener, indicating a possible redistribution and greater concentration of vulnerable residents through the city.

AB  - This paper contributes to advancing the research agenda on ethics in the Anthropocene (Schmidt JJ, Brown PG and Orr CJ (2016) Ethics in the Anthropocene: A research agenda. The Anthropocene Review 3(3): 188-200). Specifically, it responds to the call to explore 'the new human condition' (Palsson G, Szerszynski B, Sorlin S et al. (2013) Reconceptualizing the 'Anthropos' in the Anthropocene: Integrating the social sciences and humanities in global environmental change research. Environmental Science & Policy 28: 8) in the age of the Anthropocene by rethinking the relational ontology within the context of climate change. I propose that given the global and long-term implications of climate change, climate justice discourse should go beyond the Self-Other binary and incorporate the notion of the Unknown Other. By drawing on the moral philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas and moral sentimentalism scholarship, I theorize the ethical relationship with the Unknown Other. I propose that the encounter with the 'face' (identity, experience, voice) of the Unknown Other is conditioned by the Self's contribution to climate change. Therefore, the encounter with the Unknown Other is not physical and corporeal but ethical, and thus triggers a moral engagement that has a dual base - responsibility and emotion. The former is expressed in the form of asymmetrical responsibility and the latter in the form of empathy.

AB  - This study intervenes in the energy justice literature by bringing to the foreground the local, emplaced, and bottom-up perspective. We specifically explore the potential of place-based agency, expressed in the form of traditional rituals, to expand the repertoire of extra-institutional means of resistance against various manifestations of energy injustice. We investigate the recent developments in the hydropower sector in the Svaneti region of the Republic of Georgia. Based on a qualitative research design involving personal interviews and document analysis, we explain how and why the traditional ritual of taking the oath of unity on the icon of St. George has been used to oppose hydropower developments, and how the employment of this extra-institutional action is linked to the changed political opportunity structure. In addition to underscoring the need to recognize and respect the cultural and religious importance assigned to traditional rituals by local communities, the findings of our study imply a need to consider traditional rituals not merely as symbolic or/and performative means of resistance, but also as political tools that may have a significant impact on the development of energy projects.

AB  - We linked risk estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) to racial and socioeconomic characteristics of census tracts in Maryland (2000 Census) to evaluate disparities in estimated cancer risk from exposure to air toxics by emission source category. In Maryland, the average estimated cancer risk across census tracts was highest from on-road sources (50% of total risk from nonbackground sources), followed by nonroad (25%), area (23%), and major sources (< 1%). Census tracts in the highest quartile defined by the fraction of African-American residents were three times more likely to be high risk (> 90th percentile of risk) than those in the lowest quartile (95% confidence interval, 2.0-5.0). Conversely, risk decreased as the proportion of whites increased (p < 0.001). Census tracts in the lowest quartile of socioeconomic position, as measured by various indicators, were 10-100 times more likely to be high risk than those in the highest quartile. We observed substantial risk disparities for on-road, area, and nonroad sources by socioeconomic measure and on-road and area sources by race. There was considerably less evidence of risk disparities from major source emissions. We found a statistically significant interaction between race and income, suggesting a stronger relationship between race and risk at lower incomes. This research demonstrates the utility of NATA for assessing regional environmental justice, identifies an environmental justice concern in Maryland, and suggests that on-road sources may be appropriate targets for policies intended to reduce the disproportionate environmental health burden among economically disadvantaged and minority populations.

We discuss the process of engaging youth researchers to build youth skills, facilitate relationships with community-based organizations, and enhance study integrity. We report interview and artifact data that address: (1) how the youths' involvement in the research process affected their sense of place and self-efficacy for creating community change; (2) how the youths' interactions with adult community leaders shifted adult perceptions of youths' abilities and roles in the community; and (3) how the initiatives affected youth and adult participants' perspectives of the university.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the socio-spatial and ethical politics of redistribution, specifically the allocation of natural resources rents from political and economic cores to the economic and geographical peripheries whence the resource originated. Based on a case study of the coal seam gas sector in Queensland's Surat Basin, this paper focuses on the operation of the Queensland State Government's regional development fund for mining and energy extraction-affected regions. Employing an environmental justice framework, we critically explore the operation of these funds in ostensibly helping constituent communities in becoming resilient to the worst effects of the 'staples trap'. Drawing on secondary demographic and housing data for the region, as well as primary information collected from key respondents from mid-2018 to early 2019, we show that funds were distributed across all of the local government areas, and allocated to projects and places primarily on a perceived economic needs basis. However, concerns were raised with the probity of the funds' administration. In terms of recognition justice, the participation of smaller and more remote towns and local Indigenous communities was hampered by their structural marginalisation. Procedurally, the funds were criticised for the lack of local consultation taken in the development and approval of projects. While spatially concentrated expenditure may be the most cost-effective use of public monies, we argue that grant application processes should be open, transparent and inclusive, and the outcomes cognisant of the developmental needs of smaller communities, together with the need to foster regional solidarity and coherence.

AB  - This article uses in-depth interviews of activists in the environmental justice movement to explain the process of transformation from ordinary citizen to career activist. The process is presented as a series of distinct stages through which activists came to understand their personal troubles as social problems and, consequently, came to re-define their political roles. Using Becker's insight on the formation of deviant identities, it is suggested that the motivation for an activist career follows political practice. The paper also uses Blumer's notion of ''situated interaction'' to explain the perceptual changes of inadequate government response to their concerns thal were integral to becoming an activist.

AB  - Transformations to sustainability for addressing climate change are now more urgent than ever. This paper argues that such transformations are firstly required in modernist practices that militate against sustainability due to their constitution by the fallacy of human control. The latter points to the conceit of suppressing uncertainties in knowledge, commandeering agency from above', standardising governance, harming marginalised ecologies and disqualifying practices inferiorised as primitive', irrational' or vernacular'. Undoing the fallacy of control,by admitting uncertainties,modernist practices may become caring through transformative engagement with others. I propose four aspects of such transformative engagement: (a) egalitarian commitment to distributing epistemological privilege; (b) ontological sensitivity, by taking seriously the relational bases of others' knowing; (c) learning for divergence from others; and (d) affinity in alterity across widening divergence. These aspects are proposed not as fully formed principles, but rather as questions to be reworked in ongoing encounters and struggles for sustainability and climate justice. The aim is to nurture other-than-modern understandings of climate challenges and to help build multiple coexisting pathways of resilience, adaptation and mitigation.

AB  - This study analyses the framing processes of the Indignados movement in Barcelona, as an exemplar of the latest wave of protests, and argues that it expresses a new ecological-economic way out of the crisis. It finds that the movement was not just a reaction to the economic crisis and austerity policies, but that it put forward a metapolitical critique of the social imaginary and (neo) liberal representative democracy. The diagnostic frames of the movement denunciate the subjugation of politics and justice to economics, and reject the logic of economism. The prognostic frames of the movement advance a vision of socio-ecological sustainability and of 'real democracy', each articulated differently by a 'pragmatist' and an 'autonomist' faction within the movement. It argues that frames are overarching outer boundaries that accommodate different ideologies. Ideologies can nevertheless also be put into question by antagonizing frames. Furthermore, through the lens of the Indignados critique, the distinction between materialist and post-materialist values that characterizes the New Social Movement literature is criticized, as 'real democracy' is connected to social and environmental justice as well as to a critique of economism and the 'imperial mode of living'.

AB  - To recognize and respond to the social injustice of climate change impacts, children require curriculum/pedagogies that render settler colonialism visible while dialoguing across pluri-versal perspectives. We present a case study of a school in Northeastern United States that taught the Abenaki language and knowledge on traditional Abenaki Land to non-indigenous students in a 4-5th-grade classroom. Utilizing Mignolo's [2011. Geopolitics of sensing and knowing: On (de)coloniality, border thinking and epistemic disobedience. Postcolonial Studies, 14(3), 273-as283] concepts of 'epistemic disobedience' through 'de-linking' and 'de-centering' to challenge structural/curricular settler colonialism, we found that the school must first be open to, and appreciative of, non-dominant epistemologies to set the stage for epistemic disobedience. We identified teaching the language of the Land, on the Land as de-coloniality as praxis. However, we also identified curricular epistemic frictions with the Science teacher and their pedagogies which attempted to epistemically recentre students' thinking around the Standardized Account of science.

AB  - Wind power is expanding globally. Simultaneously, a growing number of conflicts against large-scale wind farms are emerging in multiple locations around the world. As these processes occur, new questions arise on how electricity from wind is being generated, how such energy is flowing within societies, and how these production-flows are being shaped by specific power structures. The present paper explores the expanding geography of wind energy conflicts by analyzing 20 case studies from across the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Based on the Environmental Justice Atlas database, it reflects on how land pressures and patterns of uneven development emerge as two features of the current expansion of wind farms. Following a relational analysis, these patterns are examined to interpret the plural instances of opposition emerging throughout the rural spaces of the world. The article argues that previously unexplored forms of collective action are expanding the scope and content of the "wind energy debate". In addition to the claims of "landscape" and "wildlife protection" addressed by the existing literature, this study sheds light on the rural/peripheral contexts where opposition emerges through the defense of indigenous territories, local livelihoods and communal development projects. The study contends that these "emerging storylines" embrace an environmental justice perspective when challenging the socially unequal and geographically uneven patterns reproduced by the ecological modernization paradigm. From this lens, cases of local opposition are not interpreted as selfish forces blocking a low-carbon transition, but instead, are understood as political instances that enable a wider discussion about the ways such transition should take place.

AB  - This chapter seeks to elucidate the scope and limitations of the international recognition of the human right to water, and the course that States must follow in order to fulfill the commitments they have assumed. It analyzes the links among the human right to water, water security, and environmental justice, given that the existence of a water crisis that requires a human-oriented approach and solution has been recognized. The chapter is divided into three parts: the first discusses the water crisis and its relation to water security and the human right to water, while the second focuses on the ethical and legal dimensions of the human right to water and postures that favor, or oppose, its recognition. Finally, the third part focuses on the sociopolitical dimension of the human right to water; that is, the role of the State in complying with and/or violating this right, and the defensive actions taken by civil society in Latin American countries (i.e., those in the Global South).

AB  - Waterfront redevelopment projects have often been criticized for prioritizing attractive skylines and glittering facades over the needs of local communities. Recently, however, they have increasingly seen goals of social and environmental justice integrated into their vision statements. This article focuses on the redevelopment of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. Since the early 2000s, the formerly neglected and contaminated river has been at the center of extensive regeneration efforts through the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative (AWI). We examine to what extent the AWI has helped to overcome inequities between the two disparate sides of the river. To answer this question, we build on interviews, analysis of planning documents, and site visits. Examining efforts toward both social and environmental justice, we show the convergence of the two but also the contradictions that arise between them. The findings suggest that employing a joint social and environmental justice approach to analyze waterfront redevelopments is important to reveal these tensions.

AB  - This paper examines conflicts that occur between mining companies and civil society organizations (CSOs) around the world and offers an innovative analysis of mining conflicts from a social network perspective. The analysis showed that, as the number of CSOs involved in a conflict increased, its outcome was more likely to be perceived as a success in terms of environmental justice (EJ); if a CSO was connected to other central CSOs, the average perception of EJ success was likely to increase; and as network distance between two conflicts increased (or decreased), they were more likely to lead to different (or similar) EJ outcomes. Such network effects in mining conflicts have policy implications for EJ movements. It would be a strategic move on the part of successful CSOs to become involved in other major conflicts and disseminate information about how they achieved greater EJ success.

AB  - This Innovative Practice paper describes assessment done in a senior project course at San Jose State University (SJSU). Today, environmental justice and environmental impact have been clearly elevated in its importance in engineering education by its reference in several current ABET Student Outcomes. This paper discusses the integration of an assignment in environmental impact into the mechanical engineering (ME) senior project course sequence. This study looks at student achievement data in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020. In this article, we compare the student achievement of the SLO related to environmental impact as well as analyze the essays of students from Spring 2019 and Spring 2020. As our assessment results show, most students either met or exceeded the criteria for this assignment in the ME senior project class. Over the past two years, 311 students (89%) either met or exceeded the criteria for this assignment out of the 346 students.

AB  - This paper examines the geopolitics of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation's reserve, situated in a toxic petrochemical complex known as Canada's 'Chemical Valley.' While this reserve holds the perilous title of worst air-pollution in the country, research exploring the profound impacts that this toxic environment has on Indigenous communities remains limited and tends to resort to simplistic framings. In this paper we suggest that Michel Foucault's concept of the 'heterotopia' is a helpful prism through which to view Aamjiwnaang in more complex, political terms. We also suggest, however, that this prism has a limited scope when it comes to exposing intimate experiences of global toxins. Drawing on a feminist geopolitics, we seek to stretch Foucault's heterotopic approach in order to show how the reserve is intimately colonized and contaminated by Canada's chemical production. Vitally, our approach gleans insight into the everyday ways that Aamjiwnaang is governed by and also disrupts colonial configurations. Moreover, our paper illuminates how a feminist heterotopic approach can re-orient research towards a deepened understanding of Indigenous-led modes of environmental justice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study revealed the inequitable societal impacts of E-scooters on disadvantaged populations. The study conducted a population distribution analysis to compare the use opportunities and space intrusion burdens of E-scooter sharing on four vulnerable population groups in Austin, Texas. Nearly all minority population experienced fewer E-scooter use opportunities. Ten percent of the minority population waited for a disproportionately longer time before a disturbance could be resolved. Ten percent of the low-income population were in a disadvantaged position in high opportunities and moderate burdens. Twenty percent of the physically disabled population faced more moderate-level burdens. The result did not show significant inequitable outcomes for the elderly population.

AB  - To date, there is considerable evidence that the perception of injustice influences environmental behavior in a positive way. Nevertheless, some people do not take action, even if the injustice seems obvious. Concerning this matter, approaches like the belief in a just world theory or system justification theory provide an explanation. However, so far, there is no scientific research on whether the perception of ecological justice, which is taken for granted, concerning an ecological belief in a just world (EBJW) may lead to differences in people's environmental behavior. This paper investigates a newly conceived construct of the EBJW, regarding its occurrence as well as its disposition in the context of other constructs. Therefore, a new scale has been developed for the purpose of this study by means of a questionnaire with German citizens (n = 312) examining motives for energy-relevant behavior. The scale analyses confirm the validity of the new scale. Even though the EBJW did not score high in the total sample, possibly due to significant differences between the participants (particularly socio-demographic variables and different group memberships) it can be stated that there is definitely a relationship between the EBJW and justification arguments and, ultimately, a lack of responsibility for energy saving. Regression analyses reveal that the EBJW, together with cognitive and affective appraisals of justice, can explain energy-relevant commitment, such as engagement in behavior that has negative impact on the climate. Based on these findings, it is suggested that the EBJW is measurable and that it seems to warrant further research.

AB  - This chapter is inspired by interesting experiences concerning electricity infrastructures facing local uprisings in two towns separated by a great distance: to address the hostile face building fossil-fuel power plants in mobilized citizen localities. Hostility levels are presented as different pulses, in which unexpected public demonstrations invade the public arena, possibly resulting from socio-technical closures in environmental impact evaluations. They mirror secret energy alliances, showing the influences and pressures of these transnational businesses. We also consider collective actions, incorporating interpretations and new and unexpected alliances. Our proposal draws on two qualitative, ethnographic studies about local socio-environmental conflicts contrary to the construction of fossil-fuel power plants, one of which arose in the Basque region of Spain, and the other in Coquimbo, Chile. Finally, we maintain that these geographically disperse studies, with their differing results, contribute to the discussion of locality as a framework of resistance against violent infrastructures, which goes beyond normalized processes and unfolds on other levels of action.

AB  - We examine spatial variation in childhood lead poisoning within two industrial counties in New England: Worcester County, Massachusetts, and Providence County, Rhode Island. The findings suggest that lead exposure is linked to the differential patterns of urbanization and industrial activity and that a history of abatement can reduce lead exposure. Lead exposure in census tracts with minority neighborhoods varies in complex ways between the counties. We conclude that attention to local context forms an essential component of understanding how public health interventions will continue to affect the geography of childhood lead poisoning.

AB  - This paper critically examines the relationship between air pollution and deprivation. We argue that focusing on a particular economic or social model of urban development might lead one to erroneously expect all cities to converge towards a particular universal norm. A naive market sorting model, for example, would predict that poor households will eventually be sorted into high pollution areas, leading to a positive relationship between air pollution and deprivation. If, however, one considers a wider set of theoretical perspectives, the anticipated relationship between air pollution and deprivation becomes more complex and idiosyncratic. Specifically, we argue the relationship between pollution and deprivation can only be made sense of by considering processes of risk perception, path dependency, gentrification and urbanization. Rather than expecting all areas to eventually converge to some universal norm, we should expect the differences in the relationship between air pollution and deprivation across localities to persist. Mindful of these insights, we propose an approach to modeling which does not impose a geographically fixed relationship. Results for Scotland reveal substantial variations in the observed relationships over space and time, supporting our argument.

AB  - This study explores the spatial distribution of green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) relative to sociodemographic and landscape characteristics in Portland, OR, and Baltimore, MD, USA at census block group (CBG) and census tract scales GSI density is clustered in Portland, while it is randomly distributed over space in Baltimore. Variables that exhibit relationships with GSI density are varied over space, as well as between cities. In Baltimore, GSI density is significantly associated with presence of green space (+), impervious surface coverage (+), and population density (-) at the CBG scale; though these relationships vary over space. At the census tract scale in Baltimore, a different combination of indicators explains GSI density, including elevation (+), population characteristics, and building characteristics. Spatial regression analysis in Portland indicates that GSI density at the CBG scale is associated with residents identifying as White (-) and well-draining hydrologic soil groups A and B (-). At both census tract and CBG scales, GSI density is associated with median income (-) and sewer pipe density (-). Hierarchical modelling of GSI density presents significant spatial dependence as well as group dependence implicit to Portland at the census tract scale. Significant results of this model retain income and sewer pipe density as explanatory variables, while introducing the relationship between GSI density and impervious surface coverage. Overall, this research offers decision-relevant information for urban resilience in multiple environments and could serve as a reminder for cities to consider who is inherently exposed to GSI benefits.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between light rail transit (LRT) stations and changes in neighborhood characteristics associated with gentrification using spatial regression analyses with longitudinal data across 14 US urbanized areas (UAs). Overall, we do not find evidence of prevalent gentrification in LRT station areas. An analysis of UA-specific impacts shows heterogeneous outcomes across different UAs, particularly: strong transit-oriented development (TOD) effects accompanied by gentrification in San Francisco and TOD with countergentrification in Portland. Our results highlight that different local and regional planning efforts can lead to different types of changes in transit station neighborhoods.

AB  - This paper examines the geographies of hazardous waste removal. Over the past decade, studies of disposal have demonstrated the myriad ways in which things can never disappear - they can only be transformed, transmuted, combusted, combined or any other manner of material change. This paper aims to develop understandings of the material politics of disposal by considering the matter of representation. It does this ethnographically, by following a chemical stockpile though the process of removal from its storage site in Tanzania. In examining everyday disposal practices, this paper highlights the materialities of hazardous waste in ways that have been epistemologically side-lined. Locating the analysis at the intersection of matter and representation, the paper illustrates the centrality of paper-work, diagrams, photographs and standard operating procedures in performing removal. It argues that removal is achieved through a bureaucratic spectacle; a process which obscures lingering residues and compounds their toxic effects. By attending to chemicals through the mundane work of removal, this paper opens up different lines of inquiry for studies of waste, and enriches understandings of materiality by considering how visual representations make a difference.

AB  - With this article, we develop the Drinking Water Disparities Framework to explain environmental injustice in the context of drinking water in the United States. The framework builds on the social epidemiology and environmental justice literatures, and is populated with 5 years of field data (2005-2010) from California's San Joaquin Valley. We trace the mechanisms through which natural, built, and sociopolitical factors work through state, county, community, and household actors to constrain access to safe water and to financial resources for communities. These constraints and regulatory failures produce social disparities in exposure to drinking water contaminants. Water system and household coping capacities lead, at best, to partial protection against exposure. This composite burden explains the origins and persistence of social disparities in exposure to drinking water contaminants.

AB  - Water and its management are essential to quality of life and productive capacity and evoke deeply held values and emotions. Further, as a normative concept, what is considered fair or just is contestable. This chapter draws on several of my research projects in Australia, through six case studies, which used innovative visual research methods - participatory GIS, photovoice and 3D visualisation, in addition to interviews - to dig deep into concepts of justice surrounding water management. In each of the cases, innate locational characteristics and extreme events combined to create vulnerable situations that were influenced by the institutional context and either hindered or supported through appropriate application of elements of the Social Justice Framework (SJF). Implications of SJF principles for reducing conflict and delivering community wellbeing in adapting to a water-variable future are discussed.

AB  - Whenever the government operates a facility in a way that negatively affects the property interests of nearby owners, the question of whether it has effected a taking arises. This is especially the case in instances in which the government's land use constitutes a nuisance. This Article explores the issue Of when a nuisance ripens into a taking. The Article argues that when it is alleged that the government has effected a taking through its own land use, courts should employ a form of review that is more exacting than that applicable in regulatory takings cases but that falls short of the categorical rule applicable in physical invasion cases. In doing so, the Article focuses on both the magnitude of the harm, and the degree of its distribution among property owners, which accompanies intensive governmental land uses. The Article seeks to show how takings law can promote a greater degree of fairness when the government chooses sites for facilities that create significant negative externalities. The analysis will help property owners who have borne a disproportionate share of those externalities, including owners in poor and minority communities whose unequal treatment in this regard has given rise to the environmental justice movement.

AB  - With the resurgence of water-isotope tracing applications for Integrated Water Resource Management in developing countries, establishing a stable isotopic baseline is necessary. Developing countries, including Malawi, continue to struggle with the generation of consistent and long-term isotopic datasets due to non-existent or inadequate in-country water-isotope capacity. Malawi has made significant advances in its quest to establish a stable isotopic baseline through the establishment of the Malawi Network of Isotope in Precipitation. This study provides the first results for the isotopic characterization of precipitation in Malawi with a view to reinforcing understanding of the country's hydrological cycle. Error-in-variables regression defined a Local Meteoric Water Line as delta H-2 = 8.0 (+/- 0.3) delta O-18 + 13.0 (+/- 2.0) using stable isotopic records of 37 monthly samples from 5 stations between 2014 and 2019. Local precipitation (isotopic composition) is consistent with global precipitation expectations, its condensation-forming process occurring under equilibrium conditions and a higher intercept (d-excess) above the 10 parts per thousand for Global Meteoric Water Line, implying that air moisture recycling significantly influences local precipitation. Wider variations observed in local precipitation isotopic signatures are largely attributed to different moisture-bearing systems and diverse geographic factors across the country. Additional stations are recommended to improve spatial coverage that, together with longer temporal records, may help understanding and resolving uncertainties such as the altitude effect. This pioneering study is expected to facilitate Malawi's ambition to achieve integrated use and improved protection of its surface water and groundwater resources in response to mounting climate change, growing population and land-development concerns.

A ray of light in this bleak context is the emergence of the social good movement that coalesces grassroots organizations, NGOs, governmental agencies, businesses, and philanthropists who are motivated to improve the lives of others. Social good refers to ?individual, community and societal well-being in the domains of environmental justice, inclusion, and peace, achieved by engaging unconventional systems and utilizing innovative technologies, aiming to promote social justice?. This paper: (a) examines contextual social forces challenging HSOs; (b) defines social good and its theoretical underpinnings; (c) presents an original model of social good and its relevance to HSOs; (d) introduces a framework for guiding future research in HSOs; and, (e) examines implications for practices, policies, and future research.

AB  - This paper argues that Environmental Labour Studies may benefit from incorporating the perspective of environmental justice. We offer a theorization of working-class ecology as the place where working-class communities live and work, being typically affected by environmental injustice, and of working-class environmentalism as those forms of activism that link labour and environmental struggles around the primacy of reproduction. The paper's theoretical section draws on a social ethnography of working-class ecology in the case of Taranto, a mono-industrial town in southern Italy, which is experiencing a severe environmental and public-health crisis. We show how environmental justice activism since the early 2000s has allowed the re-framing of union politics along new ways of politicizing the local economy. We conclude by offering a conceptual topology of working-class ecology, which situates different labour organizations (confederal, social/community, and rank-and-file unions) according to their positioning in respect to environmental justice.

AB  - This paper explores the energy justice nexus, drawing on Sen and Nussbaum's concept of capabilities. Our contribution operationalises most of the ten capabilities defined by Nussbaum, and examines them for all households of a single country (Belgium) in relation to household access to energy and especially to affordable warmth. We argue that the three dimensions highlighted by environmental-justice theories - income distribution, procedures producing unequal distributional outcomes, and cultural and political recognition of vulnerable and marginalised social groups - are more evident when posed contra the range of differences between energy-poor households and other types of households of a country. Thus, we propose a five-group typology of households that also takes into account the social aid granted in the country. Using Belgium as an example, this typology is used to compare across these five groups with respect to the extent to which energy poverty is associated with other difficulties of daily life beyond just housing and health. A new simple statistical index is developed to summarise these comparisons. The approach of the energy justice nexus is thus systemic rather than causal between access to energy and potential capabilities' deprivation. The data used is a large-scale quantitative survey that is part of the Generation and Gender Programme (GGP), and it enables to proxy most of Nussbaum's capabilities with several questions asked in this GGP survey. As these GGP surveys are standardised and realised in 16 countries, our approach is transferable to other nations/regions as well. Results show that energy poverty in Belgium is associated with deprivation of several capabilities, in more areas than expected: not only regarding housing, health, and mobility, but also regarding access to culture and recreational activities, as well as the feeling of fulfilment and ontological security. Furthermore, the comparison between energy-poor people and other energy-access groups makes the issue of social stigma clearer, and thus so the dimension of political recognition. In terms of policy, these results suggest to fighting energy poverty as a transversal issue.

AB  - This paper explores how arborists negotiate their work environment, including the pressures of policies, the labour market, technologies, government regulations and lack thereof, and the non-human agencies with which they are confronted. The political climate surrounding urban forestry in Southern Ontario influences and governs operations and physical labour. There are many (f)actors and conditions (both external and internal) surrounding fieldwork in urban forestry and that these affect work and personal lives. The questions guiding this paper include: (a) How do various political and labour conditions impact arborists' sense of pride, independence and skill?; (b) What are the social and labour divisions within the culture of arboriculture?; and (c) What is the lived experience of urban forest workers, their employment, and what is it like to be a frontline worker? This paper provides a closer look at licensing, work conditions, subcultures and social dynamics in urban arboriculture. Using accounts from semi-structured interviews with arborists across Southern Ontario and by examining field arborists' activities, relationships with co-workers and working conditions through participant observation and ethnographic field notes, I explore and reveal how arborists feel about their working environment and the labour processes and people who oversee and surround them. Findings reveal that despite dehumanizing (f)actors within the field, there are elements of resistance and negotiation; and potential for an alternative future. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

For this reason, the discipline of geography can be useful for social justice activists making justice claims. On the other hand, the public and private institutions to which justice claims are addressed often treat justice as a stable "thing" that can be achieved through protocols and procedures. Moreover, these institutionalized approaches to justice often limit justice claims, at times even enabling the unjust actions that initiated struggles for justice in the first place. Inasmuch as geographic knowledge is incorporated into this disciplining of justice, it, too, potentially limits social struggles. By considering this tension, we highlight the tremendous need for justice and the poverty of our institutionalized responses to that need.

AB  - This paper examines the possibility of understanding and measuring well-being as a result of "progress" on the basis of today's dominant epistemological framework. Market criteria distort social values by allowing purchasing power to define priorities, likening luxury goods to basic needs; in the process they reinforce patterns of discrimination against disadvantaged social groups and women, introducing fatal distortions into the analysis. Similarly, because there are no appropriate mechanisms to price natural resources adequately, the market overlooks the consequences of the abuse of natural resources, degrading the quality of life, individually and collectively, or-in the framework of Latin American indigenous groups-foreclosing the possibility of "living well". We critique the common vision of the official development discourse that places its faith on technological innovations to resolve these problems. The analysis points to the need for new models of social and environmental governance to promote progress, approaches like those suggested in the paper that are inconsistent with public policies currently in place. At present, the social groups forging institutions to assure their own well-being and ecological balance are involved in local processes, often in opposition to the proposals of the political leaders in their countries.

AB  - This essay introduces the special issue of Australian Feminist Studies on 'Climate Change, Gender, and Authoritarianism: Entanglements of Anti-Feminism and Anti-Environmentalism in the Far-Right'. Starting from the hypothesis that anti-feminism functions as a metalanguage in the far-right's fight against liberal democracy as well as social and environmental justice, this special issue explores how anti-feminism and anti-environmentalism merge and inform one another in contemporary far-right discourses and politics on climate change. Focusing on the connections that form the tissue of far-right imaginaries of sex, gender, race, and the nation in the context of the simultaneous dismissal and mobilisation of ecological issues, a broad picture of the state of research on the entanglement of anti-feminism and anti-environmentalism in the far-right will be laid out. In doing so, this special issue aims at providing us with a much-needed insight into the gendered and racialised political ecology of the contemporary far-right.

AB  - This paper presents unique spatial analyses identifying substantial discrepancies in traffic-related emissions generation and exposure by socioeconomic and demographic groups. It demonstrates a compelling environmental and social injustice narrative with strong policy implications for the UK and beyond. In the first instance, this research presents a decadal update for England and Wales to Mitchell and Dorling's 2003 analysis of environmental justice in the UK. Using 2011 UK Government pollution and emissions data with 2011 UK Census socioeconomic and demographic data based on small area census geographies, this paper demonstrates a stronger relationship between age, poverty, road NOx emissions and exposure to NO2 concentrations. Areas with the highest proportions of under-fives and young adults, and poorer households, have the highest concentrations of traffic-related pollution. In addition, exclusive access to UK annual vehicle safety inspection records ('MOT' tests) allowed annual private vehicle NOx emissions to be spatially attributed to registered keepers. Areal analysis against Census-based socioeconomic characteristics identified that households in the poorest areas emit the least NOx and PM, whilst the least poor areas emitted the highest, per km, vehicle emissions per household through having higher vehicle ownership, owning more diesel vehicles and driving further. In conclusion, the analysis indicates that, despite more than a decade of air quality policy, environmental injustice of air pollution exposure has worsened. New evidence regarding the responsibility for generation of road traffic emissions provides a clear focus for policy development and targeted implementation.

AB  - This essay conceptualizes "toxic portraits," close-up, in situ photographs of people in toxically assaulted places. Toxic portraits articulate the multiple invisibilities attending environmental injustice through a series of visible indexical signs. As a result, toxic portraits enable spectators to see the precariousness of life as dramatized in human relationships to the environments in which we live. Drawing on the "subjunctive voice of the visual" as a rhetorical heuristic, I conceptualize the productive space created by toxic portraits and ultimately argue that these images invite an ethically inflected response to the dangers of living in a polluted world.

AB  - This article suggests that a multiscalar and interdisciplinary construct is required to analyse climate justice as an appraisal of the distribution of climate finance for adaptation. The analysis of climate justice necessitates a determination of whether the inter- and intrastate distribution and ultimate effectiveness of climate finance for adaptation is realized across and between scales. This article finds current approaches to climate justice lacking in empirical research that can incorporate multiple scales. Using climate finance for adaptation projects as a proxy, the article applies theoretical frameworks from Geography and Political Science to realize climate justice as an accumulative top-down process.

AB  - While rising air and water pollution have become issues of widespread public concern in India, the relationship between spatial distribution of environmental pollution and social disadvantage has received less attention. This lack of attention becomes particularly relevant in the context of industrial pollution, as India continues to pursue industrial development policies without sufficient regard to its adverse social impacts. This letter examines industrial pollution in India from an environmental justice (EJ) perspective by presenting a national scale study of social inequities in the distribution of industrial hazardous waste generation. Our analysis connects district-level data from the 2009 National Inventory of Hazardous Waste Generating Industries with variables representing urbanization, social disadvantage, and socioeconomic status from the 2011 Census of India. Our results indicate that more urbanized and densely populated districts with a higher proportion of socially and economically disadvantaged residents are significantly more likely to generate hazardous waste. The quantity of hazardous waste generated is significantly higher in more urbanized but sparsely populated districts with a higher proportion of economically disadvantaged households, after accounting for other relevant explanatory factors such as literacy and social disadvantage. These findings underscore the growing need to incorporate EJ considerations in future industrial development and waste management in India.

AB  - Vehicles are major sources of air pollutant emissions, and individuals living near large roads endure high exposures and health risks associated with traffic-related air pollutants. Air pollution epidemiology, health risk, environmental justice, and transportation planning studies would all benefit from an improved understanding of the key information and metrics needed to assess exposures, as well as the strengths and limitations of alternate exposure metrics. This study develops and evaluates several metrics for characterizing exposure to traffic-related air pollutants for the 218 residential locations of participants in the NEXUS epidemiology study conducted in Detroit (MI, USA). Exposure metrics included proximity to major roads, traffic volume, vehicle mix, traffic density, vehicle exhaust emissions density, and pollutant concentrations predicted by dispersion models. Results presented for each metric include comparisons of exposure distributions, spatial variability, intraclass correlation, concordance and discordance rates, and overall strengths and limitations. While showing some agreement, the simple categorical and proximity classifications (e. g., high diesel/low diesel traffic roads and distance from major roads) do not reflect the range and overlap of exposures seen in the other metrics. Information provided by the traffic density metric, defined as the number of kilometers traveled (VKT) per day within a 300 m buffer around each home, was reasonably consistent with the more sophisticated metrics. Dispersion modeling provided spatially- and temporally-resolved concentrations, along with apportionments that separated concentrations due to traffic emissions and other sources. While several of the exposure metrics showed broad agreement, including traffic density, emissions density and modeled concentrations, these alternatives still produced exposure classifications that differed for a substantial fraction of study participants, e. g., from 20% to 50% of homes, depending on the metric, would be incorrectly classified into "low", "medium" or "high" traffic exposure classes. These and other results suggest the potential for exposure misclassification and the need for refined and validated exposure metrics. While data and computational demands for dispersion modeling of traffic emissions are non-trivial concerns, once established, dispersion modeling systems can provide exposure information for both on- and near-road environments that would benefit future traffic-related assessments.

AB  - This study, a randomized controlled trial, evaluated the effectiveness of free-standing air filters and window air conditioners (ACs) in 126 low-income households of children with asthma. Households were randomized into a control group, a group receiving a free-standing HEPA filter placed in the childs sleeping area, and a group receiving the filter and a window-mounted AC. Indoor air quality (IAQ) was monitored for week-long periods over three to four seasons. High concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide were frequently seen. When IAQ was monitored, filters reduced PM levels in the childs bedroom by an average of 50%. Filter use varied greatly among households and declined over time, for example, during weeks when pollutants were monitored, filter use was initially high, averaging 84 +/- 27%, but dropped to 63 +/- 33% in subsequent seasons. In months when households were not visited, use averaged only 34 +/- 30%. Filter effectiveness did not vary in homes with central or room ACs. The study shows that measurements over multiple seasons are needed to characterize air quality and filter performance. The effectiveness of interventions using free-standing air filters depends on occupant behavior, and strategies to ensure filter use should be an integral part of interventions. Practical Implications Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increased particulate matter (PM) levels by about 14 mu g/m3 and was often detected using ETS-specific tracers despite restrictions on smoking in the house as reported on questionnaires administered to caregivers. PM concentrations depended on season, filter usage, relative humidity, air exchange ratios, number of children, outdoor PM levels, sweeping/dusting, and presence of a central air conditioner (AC). Free-standing air filters can be an effective intervention that provides substantial reductions in PM concentrations if the filters are used. However, filter use was variable across the study population and declined over the study duration, and thus strategies are needed to encourage and maintain use of filters. The variability in filter use suggests that exposure misclassification is a potential problem in intervention studies using filters. The installation of a room AC in the bedroom, intended to limit air exchange ratios, along with an air filter, did not lower PM levels more than the filter alone.

AB  - This study characterizes the use of HEPA air filters provided to 89 households participating in an intervention study investigating the respiratory health of children with asthma. Free-standing filters were placed in the child's bedroom and monitored continuously for nearly a year in each household. Filter use was significantly affected by study phase, season, and monitoring week. During the "intensive" weeks when a community education worker and a field technician visited the household, the use rate averaged 70 +/- 33 %. During season-long "non-intensive" periods between seasonal visits, use dropped to 34 +/- 30 %. Filter use rapidly decreased during the 3 to 4 weeks following each intensive, and was slightly higher in spring, summer, and in the evening and at night when the child was likely to be home, although households did not follow consistent diurnal patterns. While participants expressed an understanding of the benefits of filter use and reported good experiences with them, use rates were low, particularly during unobserved non-intensive periods. The provision of free-standing air filters to individuals or households must be considered an active intervention that requires monitoring and evaluation; otherwise, unknown and unexpected patterns of filter use may alter and possibly bias results due to exposure misclassification.

AB  - Vehicle traffic is one of the most significant emission sources of air pollutants in urban areas. While the influence of mobile source emissions is felt throughout an urban area, concentrations from mobile emissions can be highest near major roadways. At present, information regarding the spatial and temporal patterns and the share of pollution attributable to traffic-related air pollutants is limited, in part due to concentrations that fall sharply with distance from roadways, as well as the few monitoring sites available in cities. This study uses a newly developed dispersion model (RLINE) and a spatially and temporally resolved emissions inventory to predict hourly PM2.5 and NOx concentrations across Detroit (MI, USA) at very high spatial resolution. Results for annual averages and high pollution days show contrasting patterns, the need for spatially resolved analyses, and the limitations of surrogate metrics like proximity or distance to roads. Data requirements, computational and modeling issues are discussed. High resolution pollutant data enable the identification of pollutant "hotspots", "project-level" analyses of transportation options, development of exposure measures for epidemiology studies, delineation of vulnerable and susceptible populations, policy analyses examining risks and benefits of mitigation options, and the development of sustainability indicators integrating environmental, social, economic and health information.

AB  - Vehicular traffic is a major source of ambient air pollution in urban areas. Traffic-related air pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter, and diesel exhaust emissions, have been associated with adverse human health effects, especially in areas near major roads. In addition to emissions from vehicles, ambient concentrations of air pollutants include contributions from stationary sources and background (or regional) sources. Although dispersion models have been widely used to evaluate air quality strategies and policies and can represent the spatial and temporal variation in environments near roads, the use of these models in health studies to estimate air pollutant exposures has been relatively limited. This paper summarizes the modeling system used to estimate exposures in the Near-Roadway Exposure and Urban Air Pollutant Study, an epidemiological study that examined 139 children with asthma or symptoms consistent with asthma, most of whom lived near major roads in Detroit, Michigan. Air pollutant concentrations were estimated with a hybrid modeling framework that included detailed inventories of mobile and stationary sources on local and regional scales; the RLINE, AERMOD, and CMAQ dispersion models; and monitored observations of pollutant concentrations. The temporal and spatial variability in emissions and exposures over the 2.5-year study period and at more than 300 home and school locations was characterized. The paper highlights issues with the development and understanding of the significance of traffic-related exposures through the use of dispersion models in urban-scale exposure assessments and epidemiology studies.

AB  - This concluding chapter focuses on the political aspects of critical adaptation research by discussing the key arguments of the various case studies presented in this book. In particular, the chapter asks why we need critical adaptation research, since is not adaption always an act of criticism on the unsustainable use of nature? The chapter argues that adaptation is not a neutral driver of action but an outcome of a contested political process. Yet, adaptation is mostly told as a single story, disregarding multifaceted knowledge systems and global environmental justice. To make adaptation research truly critical, it must be more socially and politically reflective.

AB  - This paper reviews key challenges and opportunities addressed by the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance's (NYC-EJA) Waterfront Justice Project, a citywide campaign to promote climate resilience and sustainability in urban industrial waterfront communities of New York City. NYC-EJA is a non-profit membership-driven network linking grassroots organisations from low-income neighbourhoods and communities of colour in their struggle for environmental justice. The Waterfront Justice Project is documenting community vulnerability in the context of climate change impacts, sources of industrial pollution, and demographic and socio-economic trends. This campaign is enabling community-based organisations, environmental justice communities, city planners, local and state government agencies, local business-owners, and other stakeholders to work in partnership to achieve community resilience while advocating for local jobs and promoting best practices in pollution prevention. New York City's waterfront policies ease the siting and clustering of public infrastructure, water pollution control plants, waste transfer stations, energy facilities, and heavy manufacturing uses in six areas designated as Significant Maritime and Industrial Areas (SMIAs). The SMIAs are located in environmental justice communities, largely low-income communities and communities of colour, in the South Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. New York City's local waterfront land use and zoning policies create cumulative risk exposure not only to residents and workers in the host waterfront communities, but also, in the event of storm surge or sea-level rise, to neighbouring, upland communities.

It explains two initiatives: the passage of a United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution highlighting the security implications of climate change, and the attempt to obtain an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the responsibility of states for climate change. The two avenues are located 'inside the system' in that they target well-established organs of the UN system. However, they are 'outside the box' because they seek to bypass and ultimately jump-start the international negotiation process that has unfolded under the auspices of the UNFCCC.

AB  - To date, research on mine remediation in North America has focused primarily on technical management; relatively less is known about the historical, political and social dimensions of remediation. Remediation, as a continuation of the mining process, alters local landscapes and economies and can be both dangerous and beneficial for surrounding communities. Because remediation projects tend to focus on the technical aspects of clean-up, such projects risk overlooking the environmental injustices associated with past development and obscuring blame or responsibility from industry and government for environmental degradation. Insofar as it is understood as cleaning up or repairing environmental damage, remediation is generally seen as doing the good and is less amenable to political or ethical challenges based on community concerns or values. This paper argues that greater attention needs to be paid to public participation and justice concerns associated with cleaning up mine sites. Drawing from the literatures on ecological restoration, environmental justice, reconciliation, discard studies, and matters of care, we highlight critical, yet overlooked issues in the remediation of post-mining landscapes. We argue that remediation projects present a unique opportunity for the negotiation and articulation of morals, values, histories, and physical experiences associated with mine sites and we seek to re-frame remediation as an ongoing, creative process of community healing.

AB  - While a growing body of research is uncovering the aetiology and effective treatments for allergy, research that assess the broader ethical implications of this disease is lacking significantly. This article will demonstrate both the paucity of academic research concerning ethical implications in allergy and explain why ethical analysis is integral to formulating effective health strategies for allergic disease. An exhaustive literature search of publications in French and English identified less than 35 academic articles focussed on the topic of ethics and allergy; this is a miniscule number when compared to the amount of articles published on ethical issues related to other chronic illnesses, such as obesity. It is important to demonstrate to allergy specialists the need for, and utility of, further incorporating ethical analyses in allergology; the current success of Ethical, Legal, Social Implications (ELSI) research programmes in human genetics and nanotechnology will serve as notable examples. Indeed, future research and innovation in allergy will undoubtedly encounter ethical dilemmas and the allergology community should play a significant role in helping to address these issues. However, incorporating ethical analyses in allergology does not imply that the allergology community must acquire extensive knowledge in bioethics; instead, interdisciplinary research that incorporates expertise from allergology and bioethics would enable allergy specialists to advance critical knowledge development in this largely overlooked domain of study.

AB  - Within the BlueHealth project, funded under the Horizon 2020 European Union research framework, a number of targeted experimental design interventions were used to test the effect and impact of planning and design on encouraging people to use various blue spaces. Complex interventions were implemented and evaluations before and after each were made using a set of tools which triangulate with each other-a site assessment tool, a behaviour observation tool, a questionnaire survey (including an economic evaluation) and qualitative interviews. The theoretical basis for the research is that of affordances, and the projects each involved modest changes to the landscape using the approach of "urban acupuncture" where a small intervention can potentially have an effect out of all proportion to the investment. This paper is a protocol paper and describes the research strategy and methodology in detail for one of the intervention sites, located in Plymouth in the UK. The aim is to present the methodology as a whole so as to act as (a) a reference framework for the results of all the projects which will be reported separately in a series of research articles once all the results are in and analysed and (b) a useful reference for other researchers wishing to carry out such complex projects and where a comprehensive presentation of the strategy and methodology is unavailable. We offer this protocol for reference, for critique and for inspiration to those following us.

AB  - Women generally initiate, lead, and constitute the rank and file of environmental justice activism. However, there is little research on why there are comparatively so few men involved in these movements. Using the environmental justice movement in the Central Appalachian coalfields as a case study, we examine the ways that environmental justice activism is gendered, with a focus on how women's and men's identities both shape and constrain their involvement in gendered ways. The analysis relies on 20 interviews with women and men grassroots activists working for environmental justice in the coalfields of Appalachia. We find that women draw on their identities as "mothers" and "Appalachians" to justify their activism, while the hegemonic masculinity of the region, which is tied to the coal industry, has the opposite effect on men, deterring their movement involvement. We explore the implications of these findings for understanding the relationship of gender to environmental justice activism.

AB  - This paper is a broad review of green infrastructure theory and practice relative to urban sustainability and the space for geographers in these discussions. We use examples from various urban sustainability plans to highlight ways in which green infrastructure is being conceptualized and implemented. We explore how geography contributes research on green infrastructure as well as the emerging practices as seen within sustainability plans. We identify four areas in which geographers can influence both green infrastructure theory and practice: 1) scale; 2) mapping distribution; 3) sensitivity to place and locale; and 4) equity and access. We conclude that in these areas geographers have tremendous opportunity contribute more deliberately to sustainable urbanism.

AB  - Urban climatology and environmental justice frequently share the same research site: the city. However, they study urban areas in distinct ways. Urban climatology has contributed to a better understanding of the urban boundary and canopy layer climates by embracing a broader and deeper investigation of the atmospheric and climatic specificities of the cities. Environmental justice has contributed a better understanding of how the poor and people of color are disproportionally affected by environmental problems. I argue here that we need both fields to fully understand urban climates because they are shaped both by legacies of colonialism, and race, gender, and class, and by the particularities of urban energy budgets and the variation in intra-urban air quality and thermal-hygrometric characteristics they drive. Critical physical geography can provide important analytical, theoretical, and methodological tools to help urban climatologists and environmental justice scholars work together toward the goal of social and environmental transformation.

AB  - This paper explores inequity in neighborhood walkability at the micro-scale level by qualitatively examining six streetscapes in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A photographic survey is used to highlight differences in the quality and design of the built environment among pairs of streetscapes with high or low social vulnerability but approximately equal quantitative Walk Scores (R). The survey revealed discernable differences in the quality and maintenance of the built environment among those in more and less disadvantaged neighborhoods. This was true of several characteristics expected to affect walkability, including enclosure, transparency, complexity, and tidiness. Streetscapes in neighborhoods with high social vulnerability exhibited less contiguous street walls, fewer windows and less transparent storefronts, less well maintained infrastructure, fewer street cafes, and overall less complexity than those in neighborhoods with low social vulnerability. Implications for planning and policy are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the spatial and statistical relationships between social vulnerability (SV) and neighbourhood walkability across three large U.S. cities with different urban typologies and development patterns: Charlotte, NC (a low-density, fast-growing "Sunbelt" city); Pittsburgh, PA (a moderate density, shrinking "Rust Belt" city); and Portland, OR (a progressive West Coast city known for its sprawl-containment policies). Binary logistic regression, independent-samples t-tests, and mapping techniques are employed to determine whether neighbourhoods with high SV (i.e. older populations, higher poverty rates, more service occupations, lower educational attainment, and a higher proportion of minorities) are as likely as those with low SV to exhibit a high degree of walkability. The publically available Walk Score (R) metric, based on proximity to amenities, street network connectivity, and density, was used as a proxy for neighbourhood walkability. The results indicate significant variability among cities, with Charlotte exhibiting the greatest potential for inequitable access to walkable urban environments and the most prominent concentration of "walk-vulnerable" block groups (BGs) with high SV and low walkability. Both Portland and Pittsburgh exhibited more equitable access when comparing BGs with high and low SV; however, they each presented unique spatial patterns, visualised using a series of maps.

AB  - Urban vegetation can generate social and ecological benefits, so vegetation abundance is commonly treated as a proxy for greater benefits. A repeated finding in environmental justice research related to urban vegetation is that commonly marginalized populations live in neighborhoods with less vegetation. However, urban vegetation can function as amenity or disamenity depending on the context and the characteristics of the vegetation. In areas of disinvestment, overgrown vegetation may indicate neglect and lead to negative social outcomes. For example, previous research in the shrinking city of Toledo, Ohio, showed that areas with concentrated residential vacancy and high representation of traditionally marginalized populations also had relatively high vegetation abundance. This can be largely attributed to spontaneous, weedy vegetation in areas of concentrated vacancy. Equal vegetation cover therefore should not necessarily be equated with environmentally just outcomes. Here, we used several high-resolution data sets to study the relationships among vegetation abundance, vegetation quality, and property parcel occupancy on residential land in Toledo. Our results demonstrate that vacant residential land had more abundant vegetation than comparable occupied parcels according to two common metrics (tree canopy cover and the normalized difference vegetation index). Compared to occupied parcels, vacant parcels also had higher rates of blight associated with overgrown vegetation, as recorded during a citywide ground-based survey of property conditions. There were more vacant parcels overall in areas of disinvestment, and on a per-parcel basis, vacant parcels in these high-vacancy areas were also greener relative to nearby occupied parcels than vacant parcels in low-vacancy areas. This indicates that vacant parcels play a disproportionately large role in greening on residential land in areas of disinvestment. These results reinforce the idea that simply quantifying vegetation abundance may be insufficient for understanding urban social-ecological outcomes. Incorporating parcel occupancy data along with multiple strands of information about vegetation type and condition provides context to understand where abundant vegetation functions as amenity vs. disamenity. These perspectives are especially relevant in shrinking cities like Toledo where legacies of urban socioeconomic change have produced widespread areas of disinvestment and land abandonment.

AB  - This chapter explores the concept of "just sustainability". The notions of "sustainability" and "social justice" share the common agenda of conservation of nature. As per the Brundtland report, sustainability is conceived as a test of humanity's ability to meet "the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". However, there are different paradigms of sustainability in the literature, namely the "green" or environmental agenda and the "social justice" focused "brown" or poverty reduction agenda. While the more immediate focus of social justice and/or environmental justice (both social justice and environmental justice focus on distributive conceptions of justice: human security issues related to justice, equity, human rights, and poverty reduction, and so on) is intragenerational, the more pressing focus of sustainability is intergenerational. The agendas of "social justice" and "sustainability" thus seem to be conflicting. In this chapter, I focus on the interdependency of social justice/ environmental justice and "sustainability" even when sustainability is framed as green environment and social justice focuses on the brown social agenda of poverty reduction. The paper builds on the argument that unless global social justice (intragenerational access) is ensured under a fair social and institutional arrangement, the relationship of economic growth with sustainable development will always remain contentious and sustainable development will remain a mere ideal. I conclude that organisations and institutions must explore the common ground between justice and sustainability.

AB  - This paper traces changes in the political ecology of insects and chemicals in US public housing since Congress founded public housing in 1937. Drawing upon the literature of critical geographies of home, urban political ecology, and medical history, it argues that the constitution of "public" and "private" space within public housing was deeply entangled with pest control practices there. Prior to 1945, reformers treated the housing as a commons. in part compelled by the mobility of bedbugs and the pesticide used to combat them, both of which were seen as serious health threats. Managers were also motivated by social welfare ideologies, while residents eagerly assisted with communal control policies in order to achieve freedom from the health insults of bedbugs. Following 1945, however, new synthetic pesticides like DDT seemed to stay safely within one apartment unit, encouraging housing managers to abandon community-oriented pest control practices. Meanwhile, curtailed budgets, particularly after the Housing Act of 1949, left the infrastructure of public housing to decay, rendering units more physically permeable even as managers neglected the communities there. The new pesticides nearly eradicated bedbugs, but tenacious populations of German cockroaches blossomed thanks to the permeable buildings and synthetic pesticides. Residents grew increasingly resistant to pesticide use as they observed that cockroach populations went unabated. The paper serves as a case for applying political ecology frameworks to domestic spaces, and also argues that housing quality and domestic pesticide use are not merely private responsibilities but should be regarded as environmental justice issues.

AB  - To balance interests among local communities and increase awareness of the need to protect the environment, landscape and spatial order, there is a need for active participation, cooperation and mutual learning of participants in the planning process, including urban planners, specialists from other disciplines (among others, ecologists, landscape architects and surveyors), local authorities and residents. This article presents the problems associated with housing development in suburban areas within the context of rules for sustainable development, and spatial and social justice. It presents an assessment of the spatial configuration of plots and the possibilities for development and management of these in the selected communes located in suburban area of Warsaw, the capital city of Poland. A methodology was developed for the preparation of planning documents in the commune, allowing the minimization of the problem of spatial injustice resulting from the flawed structure of registered plots.

AB  - With this paper, we enrich the environmental justice debate by investigating differences in the provision of parks in Lodz, Poland, at three levels: availability, accessibility, and attractiveness. A park is 'available' when it exists within a suitable distance from where we live; it is 'accessible' when we feel that we are welcome there, and we can freely reach and safely use this park; it is 'attractive' when we willingly want to use it and spend time there. Our research hypothesis is that the most vulnerable groups of inhabitants concentrate around parks whose provision is affected by the largest number of barriers at each of the three levels, while the least vulnerable benefit from the vicinity of parks that are the least affected. Apart from the statistical analysis - the correlation between the indicators that represent the three levels of park provision and those that represent the most and least economically vulnerable using Pearson's coefficient - we scrutinize three case study parks. The results confirm that there are inequalities at the level of attractiveness for the most vulnerable groups; meanwhile, no statistically significant results were recorded for the least vulnerable groups. The differences would probably be more explicit had socioeconomic segregation been higher in Lodz. The results may also be influenced by the unique postsocialist and postindustrial legacy of our city. The ongoing revitalization of the city center and the increased activity of developers may exclude the most vulnerable inhabitants and deepen segregation.

AB  - We conducted an environmental justice study of the spatial distribution of sport facilities, a major resource for physical activity, in the Paris Region in France. Comprehensive data of the French Census of Sport Facilities allowed us to investigate disparities not only in the spatial accessibility to facilities, but also in the characteristics of these facilities. We found that the associations between area income and the presence of facilities or favorable characteristics of these facilities varied from positive to negative depending on the facilities and on the characteristics examined. Sensitivity analyses defining area income in circular areas of different radii permitted a refined identification of areas underserved in sport facilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This CAPE Inaugural Lecture poses the question "should some political ecology (PE) be useful?" and reviews the challenges and opportunities facing academic researchers wishing to engage with policy makers, politicians, activists, the media and social movements in both the global North or South. Environmental justice provides an ethical justification for political engagement, but an essentially critical and challenging PE can put off research funders and international and national actors in policy making spheres. PE, especially post-structuralist PE, is often ill-understood and distrusted by many both inside and outside the academy, and a critical realist approach is better recognised by many intended audiences. There are many reasons given to resist an engaged PE, especially as PE has been and continues to be associated with "development". A practical and dynamic approach to engaged PE research is suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores some major issues of justice in environmental conservation policy and practice in two projects situated in the eastern Himalayas and eastern India. The first is in the state of Meghalaya, India and the second across the frontier in China in Yunnan Province. Both projects were designed and financed by international donors, negotiated with the national governments and implemented in cooperation with local institutions. They deal with four related environmental conservation issues in similar ways forest management, the cultivation of sloping lands, watershed management and shifting cultivation. However, the outcomes of these two projects in terms of environmental justice were profoundly different. The politics of translation between external donor framings of justice and national governments (and their lower level administrations) are key to explaining why. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examine sensitivity of estimates of recreation demand using the Travel Cost Method (TCM) to four factors. Three of the four have been routinely and widely discussed in the TCM literature: a) Poisson verses negative binomial regression; b) application of Englin correction to account for endogenous stratification; c) truncation of the data set to eliminate outliers. A fourth issue we address has not been widely modeled: the potential effect on recreation demand of the interaction between income and travel cost. We provide a straightforward comparison of all four factors, analyzing the impact of each on regression parameters and consumer surplus estimates. Truncation has a modest effect on estimates obtained from the Poisson models but a radical effect on the estimates obtained by way of the negative binomial. Inclusion of an income-travel cost interaction term generally produces a more conservative but not a statistically significantly different estimate of consumer surplus in both Poisson and negative binomial models. It also generates broader confidence intervals. Application of truncation, the Englin correction and the income-travel cost interaction produced the most conservative estimates of consumer surplus and eliminated the statistical difference between the Poisson and the negative binomial. Use of the income-travel cost interaction term reveals that for visitors who face relatively low travel costs, the relationship between Income and travel demand is negative, while it is positive for those who face high travel costs. This provides an explanation of the ambiguities on the findings regarding the role of income widely observed in the TCM literature. Our results suggest that policies that reduce access to publicly owned resources inordinately impact local low income recreationists and are contrary to environmental justice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban Public Green Spaces (UPGS) available at walking distance are a vital component of urban quality of life, of citizens' health, and ultimately of the right to the city. Their demand has suddenly become even more ostensive due to the measures of "social distancing" and the restrictions of movement imposed in many countries during the COVID-19 outbreak, showing the importance of the public urban parks and green open spaces located near homes and accessible by foot. Hence, the idea of "green self-sufficiency" at the local, neighbourhood and sub-neighbourhood level has emerged as a relevant objective to pursue. For this purpose, we have constructed a high-fidelity evaluation model to assess the walking accessibility of UPGS at the highly granular spatial scale of street network nodes. The evaluation procedure is based on a novel index constructed around the concept of distance-cumulative deficit, scoring nodes with respect to all the available UPGS within their catchment area of slope-corrected walking distance of 2 km. To showcase the possible outputs of the evaluation procedure and their exploratory analyses, we present an application on the city of Cagliari, Italy. In doing that, we argue that the proposed evaluation approach is an advancement over the traditional (density-based) approaches of assessment of green area availability, and that it provides an intuitive, flexible and extendable tool useful to better evaluate and understand the current and the potential accessibility of urban green space, and to support urban planning, policy making and design.

AB  - With over a century of active nickel mining, Sudbury had, by the 1970s, suffered from extensive environmental degradation. At this time the community implemented a series of environmental initiatives thattransformed the formerly denuded landscape. First world political ecology, with an emphasis on environmental justice, and the key actors involved in remediation guided research. Using mixed-methods, this study investigates the factors that made the program successful. Data collection drew from reports, direct observation, semi-structured interviews, and remote sensing (RS) imagery. Qualitative analysis used coding informed by political ecology. The quantitative analysis of the RS data consisted of normalized difference vegetation indices. Findings demonstrate Sudbury's transformation was motivated by four intersecting factors: aesthetics, economic development, scientific-technical innovation, and the broader environmental movement. RS analysis found regreening along prominent sightlines and vegetation loss on company land. Critically, local leadership led to the creation of a multistakeholder committee, which moved academic research into reality and shifted the power dynamics away from government-and corporate dominance. Findings highlight the importance of micropolitical research through the lens of political ecology to understand environmental transformation in the first world. The research underscores the position that government and corporate regreening initiatives alone are not sufficient for engendering change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We performed a survey on socioeconomic factors in 27 studies of children's environmental health funded by EU FP4 and FP5. Parental education was the most common measure (74%). Socioeconomic factors were predominantly considered as confounder (74%) and less often as effect modifier (33%) or independent variable (37%). The awareness of the need to study the impact of socioeconomic factors further seems to have increased in recent years.

AB  - We argue that the multiple contemporary converging crises have significantly altered the context for and object of political contestations around agrarian, climate, environmental and food justice issues. These shifts affect alliances, collaboration and conflict among and between state and social forces, as well as within and between movements and societies. The actual implications and mechanisms by which these changes are happening are empirical questions that need careful investigation. The bulk of our discussion is dedicated to the issue of responses to the crises both by capitalist forces and those adversely affected by the crises, and the implications of these for academic research and political activist work. More specifically, we explore four thematic clusters, namely (1) class and intersectionality; (2) sectoral and multisectoral issues and concerns; (3) importance of immediate, tactical and concrete issues of working people; and (4) links between national and global institutional spaces and political processes. We know only a little about the questions we framed here, but it is just enough to give us the confidence to argue that these questions are areas of inquiry that deserve closer attention in terms of both academic research and political debates and actions.

AB  - This paper explores the idea of mobility for recent refugees who have resettled in a non-traditional immigrant destination in the northeastern U.S. It is based on a multi-year qualitative study of travel behavior, preferences, and needs amongst these new arrivals in a small city in the state of Vermont. As a result of their experiences of both forced displacement from their home as well as stasis within camp settings and the refugee determination process, refugees are an example of what some have called "a dialectic of movement/moorings" (Urry, 2003: 125), both on the move and trapped in place. Their resettlement in the U.S., as this paper illustrates, may represent a further extension of this dialectic placed by government agents in new immigrant reception areas not of their own choosing, forced to commute long distances and into unfamiliar environments for work and limited in their abilities to access healthcare, education and employment (amongst other services) due to a range of transportation barriers. I argue in this paper that refugee mobilities in a new settlement site are about more than inconvenience: barriers to movement may constitute obstacles to acculturation, integration, self-empowerment, and community building.

AB  - Waterlogging caused by heavy rains, a recurring problem in cities located within floodplains having poor runoff, often results in unequal degrees of impact on the population, which can be assessed from an environmental justice perspective. This paper aims to assess the inequitable exposure of various vulnerable and deprived social groups to two events of pluvial flooding in the city of Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz (Argentina), as well as uncover possible inequities. Methodologically, a specific urban populated area is adopted as relevant zone, and a set of sociodemographic indicators by small spatial units, denoting human vulnerability and deprivation, is selected. The analysis has intensely relied on GIS and a new Local Inequity Quotient to measure which sociodemographic groups, and what parts of the city have got relative under or over-exposure to hazard. The comparison to other authors' works enables to reveal and confirm a well-known spatial pattern of negative discrimination, to assert the spatial accuracy of our results in the case studied, and to claim for the adequacy and usefulness of the method for urban management and planning, taking into account these largely disregarded environmental inequities in Latin America.

AB  - This paper describes the development and application of two cumulative impact scores - a neighbourhood deficit and an asset score - in Phoenix, Arizona. The deficit score was designed and used as a tool for identifying environmental, energy, and health vulnerabilities while the asset score was used to identify possible relief from these neighbourhood deficits. The design and use of these scores were the result of a collaboration between a community group, Chispa Arizona, and re-Engineered, a research laboratory at Arizona State University. The neighbourhood deficit score (NDS) aggregates a number of phenomena inclusive of: environmental burdens (such as criteria air pollutants and incidence of asthma), socio-economic variables (that may exacerbate the impacts of environmental burdens), and energy poverty. In contrast, the neighbourhood asset score (NAS) assembles a range of community assets (like churches, schools, parks, and grocery stores) which residents might leverage to ameliorate intersectional deficits. We geospatially and statistically examine the NDS, NAS, and demographic data at the census tract level. We find that census tracts with higher proportions of poverty and minority populations are significantly correlated with a higher NDS, and that higher NAS values are more centrally located and offset from the high NDS areas. We believe the NDS and NAS provide a heuristic and useful tool for identifying community vulnerabilities and issues of environmental justice.

AB  - Water is a vital and multifunctional resource for our society, economy and ecosystems; thus, how water is managed now and into the future has wide-reaching consequences. Sustainable water management and environmental justice therefore become key topics; a discussion of these terms is explored in the context of the UK water industry, which provides the focus for this study. This systematic review explores how considerations of the future have been applied in water research. The literature is reviewed with respect to (1) defining the end goal, (2) the use of futures analysis and (3) possible evaluation methods, including a discussion on the boundaries applied to each of the studies. A growing body of research associated with decision-making applying future scenarios was identified. However, the methods of application varied substantially, with holistic analyses largely lacking. The formulation of methods appears to be specific to the goal that is sought as well as the cultural influence of the region in which the analysis was developed and deployed. This paper presents a case for the visualisation of catchment characteristics and interdependencies to enable transparency in decision-making. This should reflect not only the current system but also a range of potential futures to enable appraisal of impacts.

AB  - This study presents alternative measures of environmental inequality in the 50 U.S. states for exposure to industrial air pollution. We examine three methodological issues. First, to what extent are environmental inequality measures sensitive to spatial scale and population weighting? Second, how do sensitivities to different segments of the overall distribution affect rankings by these measures? Third, how do vertical and horizontal (inter-group) inequality measures relate to each other? We find substantive differences in rankings by different measures and conclude that no single indicator is sufficient for addressing the entire range of equity concerns that are relevant to environmental policy; instead multiple measures are needed.

AB  - Within the field of green criminology, scant attention has been paid to prison ecology, or the unique characteristics of the common environments of correctional facilities. As investigative reports by human rights and prison abolition organizations have highlighted, there is growing evidence to suggest a systemic pattern of prisoners being exposed to environmental injustices resulting from their proximity to federal Superfund and other contaminated sites. One of the most expensive Superfund sites in the Midwest, the former Velsicol Chemical Corporation plant site in St. Louis, Michigan has been contaminated with DDT, PBB and pCBSA. Located one and a half miles from the site is one of the State's largest correctional compounds- the Central Michigan and St. Louis Correctional facilities- which house more than 3500 prisoners who are disproportionately men of color. Despite multiple civil rights lawsuits filed by prisoners at the facility, little has been done to address the problems of water contamination at the prison. Furthermore, the failure of the Environmental Protection Agency to consider prisoners within federal environmental justice guidelines facilitates continued harm for this vulnerable population. Given the increasing revelations of toxic prisons across the U.S., it is necessary for environmentalists and green criminologists to work together with prison abolition organizations to fight the epidemic of toxic prisons.

AB  - Twenty-seven state constitutions contain a clause prohibiting the "damaging" or "injuring" of property for public use without just compensation. Yet when compared to its relative, the Takings Clause of the Federal Constitution-which says that private property cannot be "taken" for public use without just compensation-the ways in which state courts interpret and apply their "damagings clauses" have remained opaque and virtually unstudied. This Article recovers the hidden history of the state damagings clauses. It traces the clauses to the threats to private property posed at the turn of the twentieth century as a result of rapid infrastructural improvement. These state constitutional provisions were meant to fix perceived inequities resulting from strict application of takings law: many jurisdictions would not recognize a right to compensation when public works affected use rights and drastically devalued property but did not physically invade or appropriate it. Drafters envisioned the damagings clauses as a powerful bulwark for property owners whose livelihoods and homes were affected yet not touched by public works. However, as state courts were tasked with the brunt of the interpretive work, their rulings coalesced around a variety of doctrinal limitations that severely undercut the clauses' potency. As a result, modern interpretations of the clauses mainly provide coverage in a variety of contexts where the offending activity would already qualify as a physical-invasion taking under most federal precedents. This Article argues that the damagings clauses deserve broader applications in condemnation law. Damagings comprise a more limited and historically supported category than regulatory takings, for which courts have long awarded compensation. Moreover, courts already try to mandate compensation for some of these types of injuries by manipulating ordinary takings law, leading to unnecessary doctrinal confusion. As a new wave of infrastructural growth looms, it is time for professors and practitioners to return their attention to these forgotten provisions of the state constitutions.

I argue that research on livelihood change in Andean mining communities would be enriched by 1) a deeper attendance to the gendered, raced, and classed nature of these changes and 2) the disaggregation of different mining management regimes (e.g. state-run, privately-run, cooperative-run) to allow for comparisons of the livelihood impacts between them.

AB  - This study addresses issues of social or environmental justice in local urban environmental services, through the particular lens of street cleaning services. While UK policy gives some legitimacy to the idea that services should be enhanced in disadavantaged areas, it is unclear how much service and resource discrimination are necessary or appropriate. In practice, this equity perspective may not have much impact at local level. An empirical analysis is presented by drawing on a number of large-scale secondary data sources for England, combining individual and area-based data and subjective and objective inspection-based data. These enable us to draw fairly clear conclusions about the pattern of risk and need based on outcomes and their associations with key socioeconomic, demographic, locational, and urban form characteristics of places. It appears that injustice persists in the quality of local environments across urban England. Some evidence on the impact of local spending levels on environmental outcomes is adduced, but the available data limit this within national studies. While popular debate on street cleanliness highlights the roles of behaviour and values, only limited and indirect inferences may be drawn from large-scale surveys.

AB  - We analyzed differentials in exposure to SO2, PM10, and NO2 among Czech urban populations categorized according to education level, unemployment rate, population size and average annual salary. Altogether 39 cities were included in the analysis. The principal component analysis revealed two factors explaining 72.8% of the data variability. The first factor explaining 44.7% of the data variability included SO2, PM10, low education level and high unemployment, documenting that inhabitants with unfavorable socioeconomic status mainly reside in smaller cities with higher concentration levels of combustion-related air pollutants. The second factor explaining 28.1% of the data variability included NO2, high salary, high education level and large population, suggesting that large cities with residents with higher socioeconomic status are exposed to higher levels of traffic-related air pollution. We conclude that, after more than a decade of free-market economy, the Czech Republic, a former Soviet satellite with a centrally planned economy, displays signs of a certain kind of environmental inequality, since environmental hazards are unevenly distributed among the Czech urban populations.

AB  - Wildlife conservation often leads to various conflicts with other human activities, resulting in concerns about the justice of conservation. Although species' protection - notably of large carnivores - can have negative consequences for economic interests and human well-being, environmental justice issues related to species conservation are rarely explored. In Brazil, jaguars (Panthera onca) have become flagships for a series of conservation initiatives. Whereas jaguars' direct impact on cattle farming has been studied, their influence on other rural stakeholders is poorly understood. Here we study local people's views on jaguars and jaguar conservation across the Cerrado savannah and the Amazon rainforest biomes. Using Q-methodology, we identified five distinct narratives regarding jaguar conservation in relation to environmental justice issues. These were shared among fishermen, tourist guides, cattle breeders, crop farmers and jaguar hunters. Interestingly, we did not find any systematic differences in subjective views, across regions, or professions/livelihood forms. However, our results showed a strong desire among the stakeholders for more local empowerment to influence the management of both jaguars and nature where they live. Moreover, we detected a widespread discontent with the lack of consistent implementation and predictable enforcement of environmental laws. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This perpetuates the harms of ableism, and it is, furthermore, unnecessary in order to advance environmental justice. It is possible (a) to demand an investigation into the state of an environment, (b) to object to toxic environmental conditions and (c) to hold polluting parties accountable without assuming any overall difference in value or desirability between disabled and non-disabled lives.

AB  - Woodsmoke pollution is an environmental justice issue for youth living in certain Pacific Northwest cities. Participatory methods such as Citizen Science and Photovoice are effective ways to involve youth in environmental justice research. Little is understood about how youth may be empowered to address woodsmoke issues in their communities. We examined youth empowerment in a citizen science study on woodsmoke, using Photovoice methodology. Ten diverse youth collected and analyzed indoor air samples and photos, then presented their findings to the community and policy makers. Entrance and exit surveys revealed an increased sense of empowerment to take action on woodsmoke pollution. Youth also expressed increased optimism and a resolve to become scientists to combat environmental injustices.

AB  - This review critically surveys an extensive literature on mining, development, and environment. It identifies a significant broadening over time in the scope of the environment question as it relates to mining, from concerns about landscape aesthetics and pollution to ecosystem health, sustainable development, and indigenous rights. A typology compares and contrasts four distinctive approaches to this question: (a) technology and management-centered accounts, defining the issue in terms of environmental performance; (b) public policy studies on the design of effective institutions for capturing benefits and allocating costs of resource development; (c) structural political economy, highlighting themes of external control, resource rights, and environmental justice; and (d) cultural studies, which illustrate how mining exemplifies many of society's anxieties about the social and environmental effects of industrialization and globalization. Each approach is examined in detail.

AB  - This chapter analyses the politics of bird hunting in relation to the empowerment of environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) in the European Union (EU), with specific reference to Malta's first years of EU accession. In particular, the analysis focuses on the activism of Maltese and International ENGOs - with special focus on Birdlife Malta and Birdlife International - on this issue, which is characterized by extensive EU legislation and by constant lobbying. This chapter argues that ENGOs, both Maltese and European, were influential on State power in Malta, especially by resorting to the EU, and also being given prominence by the media. Yet the hunting lobby was influential too, and its influence on Malta's main political parties is an overdetermining factor, which remained in place even after EU accession. This chapter concludes that despite Malta's EU accession, national political factors remain highly influential in the Maltese hunting issue, and that one can expect more antagonism in the years to come.

AB  - To evaluate how disparities in the distribution of environmental air pollution impact birth outcomes in Allegheny County, PA, we utilized the National Air Toxics Assessment modeled air pollution at the census tract level to evaluate pollution levels and census estimated median income for all census tracts throughout the county. The distribution of air pollution and its contribution to adverse birth outcomes were assessed with concentration curves and multivariable logistic regression models. We determined that benzene, diesel particulate matter, and trichloroethylene levels are significantly higher in census tracts with the lowest median income levels (p<0.01). In addition, for every 1 mu g/m(3) increase in diesel particulate matter, the odds of a low birth weight outcome increase 14 % (p=0.024) and the odds of a preterm birth increase 16 % (p=0.004). There may be ongoing environmental justice issues wherein poor pregnancy outcomes among the less affluent and minority residents of Allegheny County, PA, may be partially attributed to higher pollution levels in those neighborhoods.

AB  - This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni Eight, executed by the Nigerian state after a trial overseen by judges loyal to the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha. Here, we reproduce a selection of Saro-Wiwa's poems and an extract from his final speech to the tribunal that sentenced him to death. The author goes on to consider the legacy of Saro-Wiwa's struggle against the ecological destruction of his homelands wrought by Big Oil's Shell. Despite the results of a landmark legal action against Shell, resolved in favour of the plaintiffs, those living in the Niger Delta continue to pay a heavy toll for decades of oil extraction, for which Shell still evades responsibility. While Shell has yet to implement a programme of environmental recovery, and corruption in Nigeria remains endemic, the author argues that impunity is rendered unsustainable by Saro-Wiwa's enduring impact on the political consciousness of the Ogoni people and others, and the growing connectedness of environmental justice struggles the world over.

AB  - This paper investigates how three aspects of governance systems, namely the policy context, the influence of key agents and their discursive practices, are affecting national-level processes of policy design aimed at REDD +, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries. We conducted analysis in six REDD + countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam). The paper combines three methods: policy analysis, media-based discourse analysis and policy network analysis. The paper shows that policies both within and outside the forestry sector that support deforestation and forest degradation create path dependencies and entrenched interests that hamper policy change. In addition, most dominant policy coalitions do not challenge business-as-usual trajectories, reinforcing existing policy and political structures. No minority policy coalitions are directly tackling the root causes of deforestation and forest degradation, that is, the politico-economic conditions driving them. Instead they focus on environmental justice issues, such as calls for increased participation of indigenous people in decision-making. Only in two of the six countries are these transformational change coalitions vocal enough to be heard, yet to exercise their agency effectively and to support more substantial reforms, these coalitions would need the participation of more influential policy actors, particularly state agencies that have the authority to make binding decisions about policy. Furthermore, discourses supporting transformational change would need to be reflected in institutional practices and policy decisions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper examines campaigns in two US social movements, an African American unionization struggle in the 1960s and 1970s, and a recent environmental justice campaign in a Latina/o community. These and the larger movements of which they are a part have been movements of the most economically precarious sectors of the population and have also been historically reliable sources of hope and inclusive regimes of economic and civic value. These regimes manifest in everyday ways that participants in these campaigns construct economic value and in how they link that economic value to their claims for full civic membership. I develop the concept of economic citizenship-namely, that clashes over economic values and social worth are double stranded and mutually constituting. That is, economic regimes of value (capitalist and otherwise) are key to constituting social worth and civic belonging, and notions of civic worthiness in turn constitute economic value.

AB  - This paper advances the debate on energy justice by opening up a dialogue with postcolonial critiques of development. There is an imperative to develop energy justice theory fit to address the complex demands of a global energy transitions in poorer countries of the Global South. Delivering transformative change in contexts where energy systems are underdeveloped requires assessing energy justice principles from multiple situated perspectives, adjusted to the conditions that shape the possibilities for action. However, current theorizations of energy justice tend to build upon universalist notions of justice within a western tradition of thought which may not be entirely appropriate to deliver policy in postcolonial contexts. This paper offers a situated, particularistic analysis of energy transitions in Mozambique - a country which faces massive energy access challenges - to open a dialogue between theories of energy justice and postcolonial critiques. The paper focuses on three aspects of the energy transition occurring in Mozambique: the logics and impacts of off-grid innovation, the situated transformations occurring in the electricity network, and how transitions in energy fuels shape household experiences of energy access. The conclusion proposes two recommendations as key agendas for future research. The first is a methodological need for research methods to examine energy justice challenges from within specific, situated understandings of energy delivery. The second entails a call for emancipatory notions of energy justice that integrate concepts such as energy sovereignty at their core to emphasise the dimension of self-determination as a complementary aspect of energy justice.

AB  - This paper analyzes and systematizes the race and class differentials in exposure to toxic hazards and actual health outcomes. Research is categorized into the following: Proximity to known hazards includes (1) presence of hazardous waste sites and facilities (landfills, incinerators, Superfund sites), (2) exposure to air pollution, (3) exposure to various environmental hazards, e.g., toxic releases and hazards in pesticides and foods; Regulation, amelioration and cleanup includes (4) record of decisions (RODs) and cleanups at NPL sites, (5) regulatory action, as measured by assessed fines for environmental pollution; Health effects includes (6) specific: health outcomes which are related to environmental burden (e.g., blood lead levels). Proximity to prospective hazards includes (7) siting decisions for incinerators, hazardous waste sites, and nuclear storage sites. The overwhelming bulk of evidence supports the ''environmental justice'' belief that environmental hazards are inequitably distributed by class, and especially race. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - While public health, medical, government, and community actors agree that there is a serious asthma epidemic, there is significant disagreement over the role of outdoor environmental factors in causing or triggering asthma. The outcome of these disputes is important because it substantially influences the focus of public health prevention and government regulation. Minority communities in the United States have higher morbidity rates than white communities and, as a result, are more readily affected by debates over environmental factors and subsequent public health and government efforts. Therefore, asthma has figured prominently in community activists' agendas concerning health inequalities. We compare and contrast the efforts of two community environmental justice organizations that include asthma as part of their overall community organizing efforts. We explore obstacles and strategies common to both groups as well as key differences in their orientation vis-A-vis science. To do so, we first discuss the discovery, current research, community action, and resultant changes in the understanding of the disease, specifically within poor and minority communities. Then, to offer a context to examine our two examples of asthma activism, we explore the social discovery of asthma and its environmental correlates, along with the political and economic conflicts surrounding asthma research and regulation. Using examples from the two activist groups, we discuss common approaches to address asthma in poor and minority communities such as challenging "transit racism", employing an environmental justice perspective, and using education to empower community members. Finally, we explore how the issues raised in terms of asthma and the environment lead to a collective form of illness experience, in which people with asthma make direct links to the social determinants of their health.

AB  - This study examines the growing debate around environmental causes of asthma in the context of federal regulatory disputes, scientific controversy, and environmental justice activism. A multifaceted form of social discovery of the effect of air pollution on asthma has resulted from multipartner and multi organizational approaches and from intersectoral policy that deals with social inequality and environmental justice. Scientists, activists, health voluntary organizations, and some government agencies and officials have identified various elements of the asthma and air pollution connection. To tackle these issues, they have worked through a variety of collaborations and across different sectors of environmental regulation, public health, health services, housing, transportation, and community development. The authors examine the role of activist groups in discovering the increased rates of asthma and framing it as a social and environmental issue;, give an over-view of the current knowledge base on air pollution and asthma, and the controversies within science; and situate that science in the regulatory debate, discussing the many challenges to the air quality researchers. They then examine the implications of the scientific and regulatory controversies over linking air pollution to increases in asthma. The article concludes with a discussion of how alliances between activists and scientists lead to new research strategies and innovations.

AB  - This paper examines how the state responds to persistent claims of environmental injustice in overburdened communities. Our analysis focuses on activities, objectives, and processes of state intervention to understand how state actors attempt to rescript the meaning of environmental justice. We develop our analysis through a case study of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Environmental Justice Showcase Communities (EJSC) Programme, and its project in Port Arthur, Texas, to understand how the state responds to communities of colour facing toxic pollution. We discover a misalignment between the aims of local activists and policy interventions. If interventions do not align with the goals of activists, then what political work is done through the programme? We identify two elements of this USEPA programme: (1) how the EJSC programme targets individuals living in environmental justice communities for remediation rather than facilitating environmental remediation; and (2) how state interventions align in multiple ways with interests of the private sector, effectively redefining environmental justice from a utilitarian view of compensation. Moreover, we describe how the EJSC programme also forges new pathways for private companies to participate in environmental compensation programmes while ignoring requests to enhance monitoring and regulatory compliance in industry. Thus, rather than responding and advancing activist environmental justice objectives, programme discourses and interventions sideline collective community claims and redirect state-level EJ interventions that embrace market-centric measures. Such market-based interventions on behalf and in the name of environmental justice signal a further entrenchment of what we refer to as the marketisation of environmental justice.

AB  - We present data on a rapid assessment of fish Hg concentrations from 40 different waterbodies in 26 countries that includes data on 451 fish of 92 species. Significant differences in fish Hg concentrations were observed across fish foraging guilds and in general, higher trophic level fish (i.e., piscivores and carnivores) showed the highest mean total Hg (THg) concentrations. However, elevated THg concentrations observed in a lower trophic level, detrivorous species highlights the importance of understanding Hg concentrations across a wide range of trophic levels, and also characterizing site-specific processes that influence methylmercury (MeHg) bioavailability. A linear mixed effects model was used to evaluate the effects of length, trophic level, sampling location, and taxonomy on THg concentrations. A positive, significant relationship between THg in fish and fish size, trophic level, and latitude of the sampling site was observed. A comparison of Hg concentrations across all sites identifies biological mercury hotspots, as well as sites with reduced Hg concentrations relative to our overall sampling population mean Hg concentration. Results from this study highlight the value of rapid assessments on the availability of methylmercury in the environment using fish as bioindicators and the need for expanded biomonitoring efforts in understudied regions of the world. This study also provides insights for the future design and implementation of large-scale Hg biomonitoring efforts intended to evaluate the effectiveness of future Hg reduction strategies instituted by the Minamata Convention on Mercury.

AB  - This work is intended to assess the relationship between the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social) and residential segregation broadly across US urban areas. Multivariate indices of segregation and sustainability are created using data aggregated to 933 US Census Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The relationship between segregation and sustainability (and dimensions, independently) is analyzed across the CBSAs using correlation and spatial analyses. Results show an inverse relationship between segregation and sustainability, where increasing urban segregation corresponds to decreases in sustainability. Social and economic dimensions of sustainability are negatively correlated with segregation while the environmental dimension is positively correlated. Spatial analysis reveals regional associations between the measures with most of the lower sustainability scores and higher segregation scores occuring mainly in the South. The findings demonstrate an inverse relationship between segregation and sustainability as well as between the environmental and social dimensions. These correlations indicate a need to consider inequalities, and the social dimension of sustainability more broadly, when planning urban revitalization efforts. Spatial scale is also imperative to understanding and improving the social outcomes for all members of the community.

AB  - This paper considers the influence of ecofeminism on policy concerning gender (in)equality and the environment during the past 20 years. It reviews the broad contours of the ecofeminist debate before focusing on the social construction interpretation of women's relationship with the environment. It will argue that there have been substantial policy shifts in Europe and the UK in both the environmental and equalities fields, and that this is in part a result of lobbying at a range of scales by groups informed by ecofeminist debates. Nevertheless, the paper cautions that these shifts are largely incremental and operate within existing structures, which inevitably limit their capacity to create change. As policy addresses some of the concerns highlighted by ecofeminism, academic discourse and grass roots activity have been moving on to address other issues, and the paper concludes with a brief consideration of contemporary trajectories of ecofeminism and campaigning on issues that link women's, feminist and environment concerns.

AB  - This work developed the Flint, Michigan water crisis as a modular case study for teaching traditional analytical chemistry concepts through the medium of environmental justice, power, and equity. An interdisciplinary framework was used to design, implement, and assess the case study in an effort to understand how the deliberate presence of emotional and human-centered content can impact student perceptions of learning analytical chemistry concepts. The six complementary modules of the case study included (1) a guided discussion of water, power, and privilege in Flint, (2) an in-class guided inquiry exercise introducing chemical concepts key to the water crisis, (3) a hypothesis-driven laboratory analysis of real Flint waters, (4) a statistical data validation exercise, (5) an introduction to software-based chemical equilibrium modeling, and (6) multiple modes of scientific translation to nonscientists. Specific analytical chemistry concepts covered in the case study included systematic treatment of multiple equilibria, activity, solubility, and Pourbaix diagrams. Students were also exposed to a variety of wet-chemical and instrumental analysis techniques. Student-collected data were vetted and validated through guided statistical and error analysis, and later constructed into a software-based chemical equilibrium model. Finally, students synthesized and translated these multiple knowledge forms into a communication medium accessible by both the Flint community and the Karegnondi Water Authority. By framing the chemistry in a real-world setting, the case study exemplified both the challenge and importance of chemical measurement and error analysis in scientific translation and communication to real people. Student survey data indicated that the interdisciplinary nature of the case helped students emotionalize and humanize the abstract chemical content. Overall, the case elicited strong positive feedback from student participants in three pilot versions of the case study to date.

AB  - This paper examines how the politics of climate change have taken shape within Australia through the construction and contestation of concepts of obligation and responsibility. Beck's risk society thesis, offers a conceptual starting point from which to address questions concerning the nature of contemporary risk politics, and the paper examines its relevance and applicability in this case. While Beck's theory provides insight into the nature of risk and directs attention to the ways in which notions of obligation and responsibility structure risk politics, it fails to engage with why, and how, particular definitions of risk and responsibility come to dominate the political arena. It is argued that in Australia the novel challenges climate change poses to the institutions of modernity have been negated through ensuing policy responses which have reinforced links between industry and government, and have defined climate responsibilities within existing relations of production and the spatio-temporal frameworks of modernity.

AB  - This chapter chronicles some of the early years of the author growing up in the racially segregated South Alabama and its influence on his thinking about race, environment, social equity, and government responsibility and his journey to becoming an environmental sociologist, scholar, and activist. Using an environmental justice paradigm, he uncovers the underlying assumptions that contribute to and produce unequal protection. The environmental justice paradigm provides a useful framework for examining and explaining the spatial relation between the health of marginalized populations and their built and natural environment, and government response to natural and man-made disasters in African American communities. Clearly, people of color communities have borne a disproportionate burden and have received differential treatment from government in its response to health threats such as childhood lead poisoning, toxic waste and contamination, industrial accidents, hurricanes, floods and related weather-related disasters, and a host of other man-made disasters. The chapter brings to the surface the ethical and political questions of "who gets what, why, and how much'' and why some communities get left behind before and after disasters strike.

AB  - This paper investigates the extent to which cleanup durations at Superfund sites reflect demographic biases incongruent with the principles of Environmental Justice. We argue that the duration of cleanup, conditional on a large number of site characteristics, should be independent of the race and income profile of the neighborhood in which the site is located. Since the demographic composition of a neighborhood changes during the cleanup process, we explore whether cleanup durations are related to neighborhood demographics recorded at the time when the cleanup is initiated. We estimate a semiparametric Bayesian Proportional Hazard model, which also allows for unobserved site specific heterogeneity, and find that sites located in black, urban and lower educated neighborhoods were discriminated against at the beginning of the program but that the degree of bias diminished over time. Executive Order 12898 of 1994 appears to have re-prioritized resources for the faster cleanup of sites located in less wealthy neighborhoods. We do not find that the litigation process is an impediment in the cleanup process, and support the notion that community involvement plays an important role. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We examined traditional environmental justice populations and other groups whose exposure to contaminants is often disproportionately high. Risk assessment methods may not identify these populations, particularly if they are spatially dispersed. We suggest using a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey approach to oversample minority communities and develop methods for assessing exposure at different distances from pollution sources; publishing arithmetic and geometric means and full distributions for minority populations; and paying particular attention to high-end exposures. Means may sufficiently characterize populations as a whole but are inadequate in identifying vulnerable groups and subgroups. The number of individuals above the 95th percentile of any distribution may be small and unrepresentative, but these outliers are the ones who need to be protected.

AB  - This survey investigation assessed an economically challenged and largely minority population regarding concerns, evacuation status, medical needs and access to care during, and after, Hurricane Sandy by ethnicity status for patients using New Jersey's Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC). Data obtained contribute to understanding risk from disasters, and improving environmental justice for vulnerable populations following disasters. FQHCs provide medical and dental services for 5% of New Jersey 's population; 95% of those served are uninsured, underinsured, or live below the poverty level. Economically vulnerable individuals are more at risk and were disproportionately harmed by Sandy. There were ethnic differences in days evacuated, days without power and heat, self-rating of personal/family impact, center use, need and access, and interruptions of care and medications. Hispanics and Blacks reported needing centers significantly more than White population. Primary medical conditions were diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and arrhythmia and heart disease, which did not vary ethnically. Understanding medical needs and concerns of vulnerable populations may help policymakers and practitioners prepare and respond promptly to disasters, reducing risk, and building resiliency for the medical care system.

AB  - This study examines the influence of the environment (defined as 'walkability', food availability and deprivation), alongside individual factors, on Body Mass Index (BMI) and fruit and vegetable consumption. The aim of this unique study was to objectively scrutinise the concept of the obesogenic environment in the North East of England. A set of theoretical obesogenic indices based on the availability of food to consume within and outside of the home, residential density, street connectivity and land use mix were created for North East England. A pooled sample of 893 individuals (aged 16+) over 3 years (2003, 2004, 2005) from the Health Survey for England (HSE) was isolated for further analysis and correlation with the obesogenic indices. Results suggest that few elements of both walkability and food availability are significantly associated with BMI and fruit and vegetable intake. Some methodological concerns are highlighted, such as the appropriateness of walkability calculations for rural areas. The study concludes by strongly recommending a multi-faceted approach be taken when trying to tackle current levels of obesity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes how Changing Practice courses, developed by environmental activists in South Africa and based on social learning practice, have seeded cognitive justice action. For the educator-activists who facilitated these courses, it became apparent that we needed a bold emancipatory pedagogy which included cognitive justice issues. This enabled us and the activist-researcher participants to understand the extent to which local, indigenous, and spiritual knowledge had been excluded from water governance. The paper investigates how participants in the 'Water and Tradition' change project, established by the Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance (VEJA, engaged with cognitive justice, to demonstrate how African spiritual practice offers a re-visioning of the natural world. Finally, using the tools of critical realist theory, the paper reviews how VEJA bring about transformative social action through their participation in the Changing Practice course.

AB  - While structural factors may drive health inequities, certain health-promoting attributes of one's place known as salutogens may further moderate the cumulative impacts of exposures to socio-environmental stressors that behave as pathogens. Understanding the synergistic relationship between socio-environmental stressors and resilience factors is a critical component in reducing health inequities; however, the catalyst for this concept relies on community-engaged research approaches to ultimately strengthen resiliency and promote health. Furthermore, this concept has not been fully integrated into environmental justice and cumulative risk assessment screening tools designed to identify geospatial variability in environmental factors that may be associated with health inequities. As a result, we propose a hybrid resiliency-stressor conceptual framework to inform the development of environmental justice and cumulative risk assessment screening tools that can detect environmental inequities and opportunities for resilience in vulnerable populations. We explore the relationship between actual exposures to socio-environmental stressors, perceptions of stressors, and one's physiological and psychological stress response to environmental stimuli, which collectively may perpetuate health inequities by increasing allostatic load and initiating disease onset. This comprehensive framework expands the scope of existing screening tools to inform action-based solutions that rely on community-engaged research efforts to increase resiliency and promote positive health outcomes.

AB  - This paper presents a critical short review of an ongoing conflict between science and law in recent Italian litigation with the aim of illustrating how the so-called "flawed science" can negatively impact litigation. An effective story is used to introduce the primary elements that can characterize "flawed science" (i.e. insufficient sample size, the presence of confounding factors, the lack of predefined models, and an insufficient consideration of the so-called "regression toward the mean" phenomenon). An in-depth analysis of the most relevant Italian case law will then show how "flawed science" has been applied in a justice dimension. In particular, analyzing the "L'Aquila case" will demonstrate how "flawed science" can bring about questionable outcomes as regards the establishment of the causal link between negligent conduct and the damage occurred. The paper will then move on to analyze the conflict between technology and progress in an environmental justice context. In order to illustrate this point, the "ILVA case" will serve as a rather effective example of how the so-called "supreme rights" can be avoided through the establishment and application of legitimate legislative tools.

Some have been praised, others denounced, but the levels of greenhouse gas emissions have risen regardless year-on-year. This essay and eyewitness account argues that the Paris COP 21 talks like its predecessors failed to deliver a meaningful result, judged from either a scientific or social justice point-of-view. However it did reveal the presence of a growing and increasingly sophisticated and powerful climate justice movement that heralds the most hope for a just response to the global climate crisis

What can world leaders do to prepare for the population shifts likely to come from sea level rise already under way from the current high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? Building upon existing international law, such as the 1954 Refugee Convention, the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Articles 3.1 and 4.8 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the authors look into the social effects of sea level rise caused by global warming on human populations and underscore the need to have a protocol that provides rights to climate exiles.

AB  - Urban national parks were designed in the 1970s to bring nature and recreational opportunities to socio-economically disadvantaged communities in the USA. Using the theoretical frame of environmental justice, this paper discusses findings of a recent survey of visitors to Los Angeles' Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area - the United States' largest urban national park. Findings show park visitors were predominantly white, affluent, and lived nearby. People of colour travelled further, were significantly less likely to be return visitors, and were less inclined to use the park for active recreation. Seemingly, this park fails to meet the needs of the disadvantaged urban communities for whom it was created, a problem that may also affect other parks in the United States and potentially parks in other countries. Park planners and managers can take practical steps to increase accessibility to this park for people of colour and low-income earners, and should monitor other parks for patterns of ethno-racially differentiated access and utilisation.

AB  - This paper explores the extent to which participatory budgeting (PB) contributes to climate change adaptation and mitigation, based on an analysis of initiatives from 15 cities and regions in the global South and North. PB contributions are far from marginal, with significant investments decided by local people. The paper highlights some of the numerous innovations introduced to integrate PB into climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Through a scrutiny of 4,400 PB projects, the research identified six categories of climate-related projects encompassing hardware as well as software approaches, such as awareness-raising activities, community-based early warning projects and research. The paper advocates for solidarity PBs for climate justice, and raises awareness of the huge (and as yet largely untapped) potential for this to help address the dramatic impacts that climate change has on millions of people's lives. It also points to questions for future research.

AB  - We analyze the structural determinants of social construction processes in the environmental justice movement. We argue that initial structural conditions legitimated environmental grievances that were transformed in the 1980s into a sense of environmental injustice. Environmental injustice was produced through perceptions of the Love Canal and Three Mile Island disasters; the Reagan administration's environmental deregulation; and continuing discoveries of contaminated communities. In the extrapolation oi meaning, the grievance of environmental injustice evolved into the goal of environmental justice through interaction between grassroots environmental activists and national civil rights leaders.

Facing an unpredictable climatic future, the disadvantaged populations, such as women from the informal settlements, are considered to be exposed to higher risks, whereas their resilience-building efforts are usually overlooked in academia and policymaking. This work highlights the gendered climate resilience in Dala Township, a peri-urban community of Yangon, through participant observations and semi-structured interviews. This research reveals the gendered vulnerability, virtue, and everyday resistance towards resilience, emphasizing the local lens of affected disadvantaged women who are often not heard. Notably, it demonstrates alternative realities, knowledge-making, and practices of climate resilience, giving voices to the voiceless. Situated in Myanmar, findings call for a more gender-sensitive approach to build a just and resilient climatic future for all, with tremendous potential for broader application in the disadvantaged communities worldwide tackling intersectional injustice.

AB  - This paper examines the heightened demands of social reproduction amidst the slow violence of environmental harm. In doing so, it contributes to feminist scholarship bridging environmental and reproductive justice. Through a case study of water provisioning in Camden, New Jersey, the analysis reveals the added burden of gendered care-work under racialized conditions of environmental insecurity, where many suspect threats to community health but are denied legitimacy for their claims. I show how residents contest official declarations of water quality through narratives of water insecurity, linking everyday injustices to histories of slow violence. Such insecurity intensifies the gendered and racialized labor required to care for children. As mothers mitigate risk through daily provisioning, many resort to buying bottled water in an effort to gain control over their reproductive labor. While it may seem that mothers are opting for privatized solutions, they frame this strategy as a necessary response to the state's failure to secure the conditions of social reproduction. Situating mothers' everyday care-work alongside activists' critiques of privatization, the paper advances a multi-scalar analysis of environmental justice that connects the intimate, embodied sphere of reproduction to the institutional terrain of neoliberal restructuring. Key to this struggle is combatting neoliberal logics of mother-blame that locate risk within the labor of caregiving. Ultimately, I argue, struggles to sustain reproductive labor against the threat of slow violence illuminate the need for collective infrastructures of care that prioritize life-making over profit-making.

AB  - This paper contributes to scholarship exploring the affective politics of environmental education. Building on Nixon's (2011) conception of slow violence, I argue that the slow violence of ecological destruction presents not only a representational challenge but also a pedagogical one: how to confront violent systems that degrade and harm particular people and places without reinscribing this damage? Drawing on qualitative research with youth-focused environmental organizations in Camden, New Jersey, I explore two very different responses to this challenge. In an effort to shield youth from the affective injuries of confronting slow violence, pedagogies of immediacy mobilize feelings of personal accomplishment through immediate action in the local environment. By contrast, pedagogies of excavation interrogate the historical and structural underpinnings of environmental injustices and channel associated affects into collective visions for more just futures. My analysis interrogates the racial, scalar, and affective politics at work in these pedagogies and considers the implications for feeling environmental (in)justice. While pedagogies of immediacy are framed as well-intentioned efforts to counter territorial stigma and generate good feelings through individual impact, I argue that such efforts ultimately reinscribe the very deficit perspectives they seek to challenge. These pedagogical differences have material implications in an inequitable and racialized funding landscape, where environmental organizations must compete for resources and may find themselves beholden to the very corporations that perpetuate ecological injuries.

AB  - This essay presents an overview of foundational considerations and perceptions which collectively form a framework for thinking about Indigenous community building in relationship to the tasks of addressing the real challenges, social issues, and consequences of climate change. The ideas shared are based on a keynote address given by the author at the International Conference on Climate Change, Indigenous Resilience and Local Knowledge Systems: Cross-time and Cross-boundary Perspectives held at the National Taiwan University on 13-14 December 2019. The primary audience for this essay is Indigenous Peoples and allies of Indigenous Peoples who are actively involved in climate change studies, sustainable community building, and education. As such, it presents the author's personal view of key orientations for shifting current paradigms by introducing an Indigenized conceptual framework of community building which can move Indigenous communities toward revitalization and renewal through strategically implementing culturally responsive Indigenous science education, engaging sustainable economics and sustainability studies. As an Indigenous scholar who has maintained an insider perspective and has worked extensively with community members around issues of culturally responsive science education, the author challenges all concerned to take Indigenous science seriously as an ancient body of applied knowledge for sustaining communities and ensuring survival over time and through generations. The author also challenges readers to initiate new thinking about how to use Indigenous science, community building, and education as a tool and a body of knowledge which may be integrated with appropriate forms of Western science in new and creative ways that serve to sustain and ensure survival rather than perpetuate unexamined Western business paradigms of community development.

AB  - This paper contributes to the environmental justice literature by addressing several outstanding issues in a single study. Using a cross-time data set that allows us to control for the prevalent "chicken-and-egg" or "which-came-first" problem, we analyze the relative importance of poverty and race/ethnicity in an analysis that includes economic costs, potential legal costs, and potential collective action. Because the most appropriate functional form is not obvious, we use several methods, including Tobit, Poisson, and ordinary least squares, on different forms of the dependent variable. In every case, controlling for the population present at the time of disamenity location and controlling the other factors mentioned, we find evidence of disproportionate collocation based on race/ethnicity, but not on poverty alone. We also find that the potential for collective action decreases the likelihood of receipt of the studied disamenities.

AB  - Under favour of advancing pumping technologies, groundwater is utilized all around the world for many purposes such as agriculture, potable water supply, industry etc. Due to the benighted use of groundwater, irreparable damages are occurred in phreatic surfaces. To recover the decreased groundwater level water retaining structures are widely used for aquifer recharge. In this study, feasibility stage design of groundwater recharge Wadi Keed dam (Bahla, Sultanate of Oman) was assessed considering hydrogeological conditions and geotechnical parameters of dam location and proximity. Within this context, field, office, and laboratory works had been conducted. Field works consist of a drilling program, excavation of trial pits and in-situ tests such as falling head permeability tests and Lugeon tests. The laboratory works had been performed on the core samples handled from the drill-holes and the soil samples obtained from trial pits. In context of office studies, the results obtained from field and laboratory works had been evaluated and the recharge dam was designed based on the geotechnical properties and hydrogeological conditions of dam location. In this regard, Wadi Keed dam is optimized for a groundwater recharge purpose based on the geotechnical and hydrogeological data. It is predicted to percolate 400 000 m(3) water per year for recharging the Bahla aquifer and this percolation will uplift 8 m the phreatic surface around Bahla City.

Through qualitative discourse analysis of 268 newspaper articles, this study analyzes the competing rhetoric surrounding the indigenous whaling issue and exposes fundamental differences in how the opposing campaigns frame their arguments. This study contributes to the literature on social movements and environmental justice in two primary ways. First, this article exposes the social power dynamics and experientially based assumptions inherent in the "framing contests" of competing social movements that comprised those from diverse racial, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Second, this article expands existing work in the field of environmental justice to include American Indian issues and concerns.

AB  - Urban parks have an important impact on the health of urban residents. Normally, the first step is to identify whether the accessibility of urban parks is equitable; however, multiple models that were applied in previous studies have shown different accuracies. In this study, the area within the fifth ring road of Beijing municipality is selected as the location to conduct the accessibility-based equity assessment of urban parks. The urban park accessibility (UPA) of each residential community will be calculated using the Gaussian two-step floating catchment area (G2SFCA) method. Then, random forest regression and partial dependence plots will be carried out to analyze the relationship between UPA and socioeconomic indicators. To identify where the UPA is inequitable, spatial distribution characteristics between the UPA and socioeconomic indicators will be analyzed based on the bivariate treatment of local indicators of spatial association (LISA). The results indicate the close relationships between UPA and four indicators (towns or subdistricts location = LT, bachelor's degree (or above) = BD, mean house price = HP, and population density = PD). Beijing urban park unfairness exists in low BD with low UPA or low HP with low UPA streets in the southwestern and east areas of Beijing. In addition, unfairness exists in high PD with low UPA streets in the north second to third ring road areas. Therefore, these areas should be prioritized for urban park development. The methods used in this study could be extended to study the relationship between various service facilities accessibility and influencing factors, and the results could guide intervention programs to help reduce urban park inequity.

AB  - This paper makes the case that justice scholarship cannot adequately account for the rural grievances that helped launch Trump to the presidency. This relative blind spot in the literature offers an opportunity for rural sociologists and rural studies scholars more generally to elevate their relevance in the academy and beyond. From late-2012 to late-2017, I traversed the state of Colorado interviewing and participating alongside non metro residents from its 24 "rural" and 23 "frontier" counties-the latter designation refers to those counties with a population density of six or fewer persons per square mile (the state has 64 counties in total). The argument is informed by 129 face-to-face interviews with residents from across these 47 counties. An additional 144 participant observation-related conversations help further inform the argument. After explaining why rural grievances driving much of today's populism remains a problem for justice scholarship, I document injustices experienced among those interviewed, categorizing them along the three axes of distribution, recognition, and representation. I then offer tentative suggestions for building recognition and empathy between metro and non metro Coloradans. The paper concludes discussing its limitations and the next steps for future scholarship.

AB  - What are we doing to our climate? Emissions from fossil fuel burning have raised carbon dioxide concentrations 35 percent higher than in the past millions of years. This increase is warming our planet via the greenhouse effect. What is climate change doing to and for us? Dry regions are drier and wet ones wetter. Wildfires have increased threefold, hurricanes more violent, floods setting record heights, glaciers melting, and seas rising. Parts of Earth are increasingly uninhabitable. Climate change requires us to act as a global community. Climate justice enjoins emitters to pay the social-environmental costs of fossil fuel burning. This would expedite green solar, wind, and next-generation nuclear energy sources. Individuals should conserve resources, waste less food, and eat a plant-rich diet.

AB  - While the story of the Flint water crisis has been shared widely, the popular narrative-described in multiple documentaries and as evidenced by accolades heaped upon a limited few number of actors involved with Flint-largely leaves out the broad experiences and actions of Flint residents in responding to the crisis, raising awareness, and advocating for change. Academic literature has contributed to reinforcing an abbreviated and disempowered version of the narrative where Flint residents needed rescue. In this article, we present an extended description of the Flint water crisis leading up to the water switch in April 2014, including descriptions of community mobilization efforts to call government actions into account and produce investigations that validated the concerns of the residents. We offer a review of prominent academic literature demonstrating patterns of erasure that suggest Flint residents were disempowered. In response, we offer three examples which demonstrate how Flint resident mobilizations have broad historical context, national reach, and individual actions that contradict the narrative that Flint residents lack agency and power. In our analysis, rather than viewing Flint residents as in need of rescue by science, we argue that the community mobilization in Flint is indicative of a highly successful implementation of popular epidemiology with profound effects on national conversations about lead in water, drinking water infrastructure management, and environmental justice.

AB  - Urban living environments are known to influence human well-being and health. The literature on environmental equity focuses especially on the distribution of nuisances and resources, which, because of the unequal spatial distribution of different social groups, leads to an increased exposure to risks or to less access to beneficial elements for certain populations. Little work has been done on the multidimensionality of different environmental burdens and the lack of resources in some urban environments. This article has two main objectives. The first objective is to construct an environmental equity index that takes into consideration seven components of the urban environment (traffic-related pollutants, proximity to major roads and highways, vegetation, access to parks, access to supermarkets, and the urban heat island effect). The second objective is to determine whether groups vulnerable to different nuisances-namely, individuals under fifteen years old and the elderly-and those who tend to be located in the most problematic areas according to the environmental justice literature (i.e., visible minorities and low-income populations) are affected by environmental inequities associated with the application of the composite index at the city block level. The results obtained by using four statistical techniques show that, on the Island of Montreal, low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities are more frequently located in city blocks close to major roads and with higher concentrations of NO2 and less vegetation. Finally, the environmental equity index is significantly lower in areas with high concentrations of low-income populations in comparison with the wealthiest areas.

AB  - This paper is part of an emerging effort to explore environmental justice in the forms in which it is appearing in Latin America, both as a discourse of popular mobilisation and as a set of principles for analysis and interpretation. It explores the promise and limits of environmental justice on the US - Mexico border, drawing its lessons from a study of trans-border energy politics. In the wake of the California energy regulatory crisis, energy companies set their sights on northern Baja California as an ideal production platform to meet US energy demand through the construction of new power plants and receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas. This paper explores the emergence of environmental justice as a banner of community resistance to Baja's energy boom, as well as its utility as an analytical framework that highlights underlying issues of distributional inequity and procedural injustice.

AB  - This paper presents the results of ethnographic research conducted with several environmental justice (EJ) organisations in Latino communities of Los Angeles, California. Traditional EJ politics revolves around research and advocacy to reduce discriminatory environmental exposures, risks, and impacts. However, I argue that in recent years there has been a qualitative change in EJ politics, characterised by four main elements: (1) a move away from the reaction to urban environmental "bads" (e.g. polluting industries) in the city towards a focus on the production of nature in the city; (2) strategies that are less dependent on the legal, bureaucratic, and technical "regulatory route"; (3) the formation of a distinctive "Latino environmental ethic" that offers a more complex consideration of the place of race in EJ organising; and (4) a spatial organisation of EJ politics that moves away from hyperlocal, vertical organisation towards diversified city-wide networks that include EJ organisations, mainstream environmental groups, nonprofits, foundations, and entrepreneurs. This shift in EJ movement politics is shaped by broader political-economic changes, including the shift from post-Fordist to neoliberal and now green economy models of urban development; the influence of neoliberal multiculturalism in urban politics; and the increasingly prominent role of Latinos in city, state, and national politics. New spaces of Latino EJ also reflect the ambitions of Los Angeles as a global city, with urban growth increasingly framed in an international discourse of sustainability that combines quality of life, environmental, and economic development rationales.

AB  - Various social movement debates on organizational design have hinged on the possibility and political usefulness of devising post-representational, a-representational or anti-representational spaces. We analyse organizational options and obstacles that the WSF faces. A denial of representational dynamics may leave internal power and structural imbalances unattended. We raise the question whether the WSF process can intersect the current instances of activism across the planet including the climate justice movement. We explore its changing attitudes toward representational decision-making. Finally, we suggest that the relationship between traditional organization-building and internet-mediated decision-making practices developing at the intersection between the local, the global and the virtual could be debated on the road to the next global WSF, likely to take place in Mexico.

AB  - This essay seeks to open a conversation about multispecies justice in environmental politics. It sets out some of the theoretical approaches, key areas of exploration, and obvious challenges that come with rethinking a core plank of liberal theory and politics. First, we discuss some of the diverse scholarly fields that have influenced the emergence of multispecies justice. We then discuss core concerns at the centre of this reconfiguration of justice - including broadening conceptions of the subject of justice and the means and processes of recognition (and misrecognition). The importance of deconstructing and decolonising the hegemony of liberal political discourse is crucial, and is part of a larger project for multispecies justice to rework a politics of knowledge and practice of political communication. Finally, we begin to explore what a commitment to multispecies justice might demand of politics and policy.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of the global urban gardening movement to mitigate spatial and environmental injustice conditions in the urban space. After a background discussion of the spatial and environmental injustice theory and an assessment of methodologies that have been adopted in relevant studies, we will highlight existing links with urban gardening initiatives in a specific case study, i.e. the city of Rome, Italy. The case study is introduced to investigate the spatial coincidence of urban gardening initiatives in this specific city (assumed as the dependent variable) and spatial and environmental injustice (S&EI) indicators. Several S&EI-related phenomena whose relevance has been demonstrated are mapped, and their goodness of fit in serving as explanatory variables for the spatial distribution of urban gardening agency is investigated. The analysis builds upon a quantitative approach and features a linear spatial regression model. Surprisingly, findings suggest that social-economic variables generally have greater influence on spatial injustice than environmental variables. In fact, from a theoretical perspective, our results challenge the current interpretation of urban gardening as a mere means to address environmental, food or nature-related issues in cities. Instead, they support the increasingly popular interpretation of urban gardening as a political gesture. Our results provide policy-makers with useful observations about key variables related to spatial injustice in the city and contrasting initiatives, notably urban gardening projects. The paper concludes with a critical assessment of the results and the limiting and supporting factors of the featured theoretical and methodological framework.

AB  - When President Biden took office in January 2021, it was widely expected that he would reverse Trump-era policies and take steps to address climate change, racial justice, and rising inequality. Then-candidate Biden made strong commitments to addressing the climate crisis, including stating that "the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face." But with the parties evenly split in the Senate, this meant legislating ambitious climate policy would be difficult. This article analyzes the Biden Administration's climate and environmental justice initiatives in its first year. The Biden administration successfully advanced some environmental policy through legislation but relied primarily on ambitious executive orders and with a particular focus on integrating equity and justice considerations into climate and environmental policy, while encountering challenges from Republican state officials.

AB  - This paper argues that labour and community-led advocacy efforts towards a just transition are fundamental to delivering the promises of a Green New Deal (GND) and a just post-carbon world. To this end, an ambitious, far-reaching project was launched by the Labor Network for Sustainability, a non-governmental organization dedicated to bridging the labor and climate movements, in Spring 2020 called the "Just Transition Listening Project'' (JTLP). Over the course of several months, the JTLP interviewed over 100 individuals, including rank-and-file union members, union officials, environmental and climate justice advocates, and Indigenous and community advocates to understand what makes transition "just," what opportunities exist for a broad coalition to advance a GND-style proposal, and to document the struggles facing working people and communities across the U.S. In doing so, we utilize the tools of political geography to examine the politics of spatiality, networks, and scale as well as the geographical and spatial dimensions of policy and political-economic institutions. We are particularly mindful of two spatial dynamics. First, that transition policies, particularly in a hegemonic country like the USA, have global implications. The industrial transition that took place from the 1970s to the 1990s, for example, bred nativism because it cast other countries as the cause of the problem. Second, critical geographers have pointed out that environmental justice (EJ) has been neoliberalized in the U.S. as a result of its operationalization, spatialization, and administration, starting with the Clinton Administration. Because JT is rising on the national and global agendas, we pay close attention to whether these dynamics that affected EJ are also operating with respect to JT, as well as how they can be contained. This research is particularly timely given the ongoing federal governmental efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and provide basic economic and social supports. The process of the JTLP parallels the goals of the GND-intersectional efforts rooted in community knowledge for the development of a people-led GND. This paper details the process of the JTLP and the prospects for intersectional, broad-based movements that are the only way a GND can be realized.

AB  - This paper considers the environmental justice implications of transportation plans and policies in the US. Despite several administrative orders and federal mandates, few specific guidelines exist for assessing the disproportionate effects of transportation projects and implementing environmental justice principles in the transportation planning process. The paper develops a set of indices to measure the environmental justice impacts of transportation projects; and applies these to evaluate proposed capacity improvement projects in Volusia County, Florida. The indices developed serve as preliminary indicators that address the key research dimensions of environmental justice, meet the requirements of federal mandates that enforce principles of environmental justice, and are formulated on the basis of census data and tools available in geographic information systems software.

AB  - While air pollution levels in India are amongst the highest in the world, the link between exposure to air pollution and social disadvantages has not been systematically examined. Using a distributive environmental justice framework, this study connects fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data derived from satellite observations, a global chemical transport model, and ground-based measurements to district level socio-demographic information from the 2011 Census of India. The research objectives are to determine if annual average PM2.5 concentrations (2010) and recent increases in average PM2.5 concentrations (2010-2016) are unequally distributed with respect to socially disadvantaged population and household groups, after controlling for relevant contextual factors and spatial clustering. Overall, more than 85% of people and households in India reside in districts where international air quality standards for PM2.5 are exceeded. Although PM2.5 concentration levels are significantly higher in more urbanized districts located predominantly in northern India, recent increases have occurred in less urbanized areas located mainly in southern and central India. Multivariable statistical analysis indicated: (1) higher PM2.5 concentration in districts with higher percentages of Scheduled Castes (SCs), young children, and households in poor condition residence and without toilets; and (2) higher PM2.5 increases in less urbanized districts with higher percentages of SCs, females, children, people with disabilities, and households with no toilets. These findings thus highlight the need to consider the role of air pollution in exacerbating the consequences of social disadvantages in India.

AB  - While environmental justice (EJ) research in the United States has focused primarily on the social distribution of chronic pollution risks, previous empirical studies have not analyzed disparities in exposure to both chronic (long-term) and acute (short-term) pollution in the same study area. Our article addresses this limitation though a case study that compares social inequities in exposure to chronic and acute pollution risks in the Greater Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area, Texas. The study integrates estimates of chronic cancer risk associated with ambient exposure to hazardous air pollutants from the Environmental Protection Agency's National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (2005), hazardous chemical accidents from the National Response Center's Emergency Response Notification System (2007-2011), and sociodemographic characteristics from the American Community Survey (2007-2011). Statistical analyses are based on descriptive comparisons, bivariate correlations, and locally derived spatial regression models that account for spatial dependence in the data. Results indicate that neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Hispanic residents, lower percentage of homeowners, and higher income inequality are facing significantly greater exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks. The non-Hispanic black percentage is significantly higher in neighborhoods with greater chronic cancer risk, but lower in areas exposed to acute pollution events. Households isolated by languagethose highly likely to face evacuation problems during an actual chemical disastertend to reside in areas facing significantly greater exposure to high-impact acute events. Our findings emphasize the growing need to examine social inequities in exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks in future EJ research and policy.

AB  - This study presents the first national level quantitative environmental justice assessment of industrial air pollution in Australia. Specifically, our analysis links the spatial distribution of sites and emissions associated with industrial pollution sources derived from the National Pollution Inventory, to Indigenous status and social disadvantage characteristics of communities derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics indicators. Our results reveal a clear national pattern of environmental injustice based on the locations of industrial pollution sources, as well as volume, and toxicity of air pollution released at these locations. Communities with the highest number of polluting sites, emission volume, and toxicity-weighted air emissions indicate significantly greater proportions of Indigenous population and higher levels of socio-economic disadvantage. The quantities and toxicities of industrial air pollution are particularly higher in communities with the lowest levels of educational attainment and occupational status. These findings emphasize the need for more detailed analysis in specific regions and communities where socially disadvantaged groups are disproportionately impacted by industrial air pollution. Our empirical findings also underscore the growing necessity to incorporate environmental justice considerations in environmental planning and policy-making in Australia.

AB  - While numerous environmental justice (EJ) studies have found socially disadvantaged groups such as racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals to be disproportionately affected by environmental hazards, previous EJ research has not examined whether disabled individuals are disproportionately exposed to natural hazards. Our article addresses this gap by conducting the first distributive EJ study of the relationship between flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey and locations of people with disabilities in Harris County, the most populous county in Texas that was severely impacted by this disaster. Our objective is to determine whether the areal extent of flooding at the neighborhood (census tract) level is disproportionately distributed with respect to people with any disability and with specific types of disabilities, after controlling for relevant socio-demographic factors. Our study integrates cartographic information from Harvey's Inundation Footprint developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency with data on disability and socio-demographic characteristics from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multi-variate generalized estimating equations, a modeling technique appropriate for clustered data. Results indicate that the areal extent of Harvey-Induced flooding is significantly greater in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of disabled residents, after controlling for race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, and clustering. Disabled individuals with cognitive and ambulatory difficulties are more likely to reside in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of flooded area, compared to those facing other types of difficulties. These results represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation on the disproportionate impacts associated with Hurricane Harvey for people with disabilities. Our findings also highlight the growing need to consider individuals with physical and mental disabilities in future EJ research, as well as planning and management of natural disasters.

AB  - This chapter provides a historical overview and constructive critique of analytical approaches and methods that have been used to measure proximity to environmental health hazards and potential exposure to their adverse effects in the environmental justice (EJ) research literature. After providing an introduction to environmental health justice research and key findings, we examine how quantitative EJ analysis has emerged from comparing the prevalence of minority or low-income populations in spatial units hosting environmental hazards and circular buffer zones to more advanced techniques that utilize GIS, pollution plume models, and estimates of health risk from ambient exposure to multiple pollutants and emission sources. We also review spatial analytical approaches used in previous studies to determine the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of people residing in areas potentially exposed to environmental hazards, as well as newly emerging geostatistical techniques that are more appropriate for spatial analysis of EJ than conventional statistical methods used in prior research. The concluding section focuses on highlighting the key limitations and identifying future research needs associated with assessment of environmental health justice.

AB  - We sought to provide a historical overview of methods, models, and data used in the environmental justice (EJ) research literature to measure proximity to environmental hazards and potential exposure to their adverse health effects. We explored how the assessment of disproportionate proximity and exposure has evolved from comparing the prevalence of minority or low-income residents in geographic entities hosting pollution sources and discrete buffer zones to more refined techniques that use continuous distances, pollutant fate-and-transport models, and estimates of health risk from toxic exposure. We also reviewed analytical techniques used to determine the characteristics of people residing in areas potentially exposed to environmental hazards and emerging geostatistical techniques that are more appropriate for EJ analysis than conventional statistical methods. We concluded by providing several recommendations regarding future research and data needs for EJ assessment that would lead to more reliable results and policy solutions.

AB  - This study explores flood-related environmental injustices by deconstructing racial, ethnic, and socio-demographic disparities and spatial heterogeneity in the areal extent of fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flooding across Canada. The study integrates JBA Risk Management's 100-year Canada Flood Map with the 2016 national census-based socioeconomic data to investigate whether traditionally recognized vulnerable groups and com-munities are exposed inequitably to inland (e.g., fluvial and pluvial) and coastal flood hazards. Social vulnera-bility was represented by neighbourhood-level socioeconomic deprivation, including economic insecurity and instability indices. Statistical analyses include bivariate correlation and a series of non-spatial and spatial regression techniques, including ordinary least squares, binary logistic regression, and simultaneous autore-gressive models. The study emphasizes the quest for the most appropriate methodological framework to analyze flood-related socioeconomic inequities in Canada. Strong evidence of spatial effects has motivated the study to test for the spatial heterogeneity of covariates by employing geographically weighted regression (GWR) on continuous outcome variables (e.g., percent of residential properties in a census tract exposed to flood hazards) and geographically weighted logistic regression on dichotomous outcome variables (e.g., a census tract in or out of flood hazard zone). GWR results show that the direction and statistical significance of relationships between inland flood exposure and all explanatory variables under consideration are spatially non-stationary. We find certain vulnerable groups, such as females, lone-parent households, Indigenous peoples, South Asians, the elderly, other visible minorities, and economically insecure residents, are at a higher risk of flooding in Canadian neighbourhoods. Spatial and social disparities in flood exposure have critical policy implications for effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction. The study findings are a foundation for a more detailed investigation of the disproportionate impacts of flood risk in Canada.

AB  - This paper proposes a national-level socioeconomic status (SES) index to measure place-based relative social vulnerability and socioeconomic inequalities across Canada. The aim is to investigate how disparities in overall socioeconomic status influence environmental justice outcomes for Canadian flood risk management planning and funding structures. A micro-dataset of the 2016 Canadian census of population was used to derive a comprehensive SES index over 5739 census tracts. The index comprises 49 theoretically-important and environmental policy-relevant indicators of vulnerability that represent diverse aspects of socioeconomic, demographic, and ethnicity status of Canadians. Bartlett's test of sphericity, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, Cronbach's alpha scale reliability, and goodness-of-fit for factor's solution were employed to assess validity, reliability, and consistency in the dataset before applying principal components analysis. Our data revealed 11 statistically-significant multidimensional factors, which together explained 80.86% of the total variation. Levene's homogeneity of variance test disclosed a considerable socioeconomic disparity across census tracts, census metropolitan areas (CMAs), and provinces/territories in Canada. Social vulnerability tends to be geographically stratified across Canada. For example, Drummondville, Saguenay, and Granby CMAs (all in Quebec) had the lowest SES scores, whereas Vancouver and Toronto CMAs had the highest SES scores. Prevalence of spatial variations in the SES scores has significant implications for appraising overall social well-being and understanding the relative social vulnerability of population subgroups. The new place-based SES index has potential for assessing environmental justice outcomes in flood risk management at the census tract level.

AB  - This study presents the first nationwide spatial assessment of flood risk to identify social vulnerability and flood exposure hotspots that support policies aimed at protecting high-risk populations and geographical regions of Canada. The study used a national-scale flood hazard dataset (pluvial, fluvial, and coastal) to estimate a 1-in-100-year flood exposure of all residential properties across 5721 census tracts. Residential flood exposure data were spatially integrated with a census-based multidimensional social vulnerability index (SoVI) that included demographic, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic indicators influencing vulnerability. Using Bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (BiLISA) cluster maps, the study identified geographic concentration of flood risk hotspots where high vulnerability coincided with high flood exposure. The results revealed considerable spatial variations in tract-level social vulnerability and flood exposure. Flood risk hotspots belonged to 410 census tracts, 21 census metropolitan areas, and eight provinces comprising about 1.7 million of the total population and 51% of half-a-million residential properties in Canada. Results identify populations and the geographic regions near the core and dense urban areas predominantly occupying those hotspots. Recognizing priority locations is critically important for government interventions and risk mitigation initiatives considering socio-physical aspects of vulnerability to flooding. Findings reinforce a better understanding of geographic flood-disadvantaged neighborhoods across Canada, where interventions are required to target preparedness, response, and recovery resources that foster socially just flood management strategies.

AB  - Under the threat of climate change, the issue of climate justice has gradually received international attention in recent years. Climate justice focuses on the unfair phenomena in various regions caused by climate change. At present, some countries are facing "double inequality," that is, the reverse and separate distribution of "natural hazard" and "social resilience" and that of "risk" and "responsible input." Therefore, this study constructed a research framework for evaluating climate justice. The framework reconstructed the indicator system and conducted verification analysis on the research issues of climate justice, including the spatial correlation between "natural hazard" and "social resilience" and that between "risk" and "responsible input," and uses the "bivariate local indicators of spatial association" method to detect the regional current situation and test the justice after government's resource investment. In this way, four-quadrant spatial characteristics were obtained (high-high, low-low, high-low, and low-high districts) to identify the areas with the characteristics of climate justice. This study used Taiwan as the research area. The results show that Taiwan currently has only 7 regions with "double inequality." Therefore, only a small part of the region has "double inequality." The results can be used as the basis for future government's resource input and the allocation of climate responsibility.

AB  - This paper aims to further a geographical agenda through the concept of postcapitalism. We outline its contours across three terrains of transformation between capitalism and postcapitalism: creating commons against enclosure, socially useful production that counters commodification, and joyful doing that negates alienated work. Secondly, we explore how postcapitalism is mobilised with different inflections through three contemporary debates: community economies, post-work and autonomous perspectives. We then illuminate how one area of social practice (platform cooperatives) resonates with postcapitalist terrains and debates. We conclude by exploring the, as yet unclear and partially formed, social and spatial landscape of postcapitalism.

AB  - This article uses ethnographic fieldwork to illustrate how a multi-ethnic group of activists in Brooklyn, New York, formed a coalition for environmental justice in their neighborhood. Until the late 1980s local activists had organized in separate and antagonistic movements, competing over access to housing, schools, and police protection. However, as they increasingly realized that the environment was an urban concern, and was subject to discrimination, activists added it to their organizing agendas. In so doing, activists began to construct an expansive environmental narrative that cast all minorities in the neighborhood as united in the face of disproportionately high pollution rates. Activists thus found that they could enhance their environmental struggles by creating environmental identities that superseded rigidly defined identities based on ethnicity. Through organizing for environmental justice, activists redefined the meaning and significance of ethnic differences. [ethnicity, environmental justice, social movements, urban United States].

AB  - This critical reader addresses African environmental ethics in a unique way by drawing from a variety of authors with diverse perspectives on underexplored and often neglected issues in African philosophy and ethics. Central issues in contemporary African environmental ethics are addressed such as: The moral status of nature, Ubuntu and the Environment, African conceptions of animal moral status and rights, African conceptions of environmental justice, African relationalism, theocentric and teleological environmentalism. The book goes beyond the generalised focus on African metaphysics and African ethics by exploring further how these views might be understood differently in order to conceptualise plausible African environmental ethical perspectives.

AB  - While associations between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and risk of hospitalization are well documented and evidence suggests that such associations change over time, it is unclear whether these temporal changes exist in understudied less-urban areas or differ by sub-population. We analyzed daily time-series data of 968 continental U.S. counties for 2000-2016, with cause-specific hospitalization from Medicare claims and population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations originally estimated at 1km x 1 km from a hybrid model. Circulatory and respiratory hospitalizations were categorized based on primary diagnosis codes at discharge. Using modified Bayesian hierarchical modelling, we evaluated the temporal trend in association between PM2.5 and hospitalizations and whether disparities in this trend exist across individual-level characteristics (e.g., sex, age, race, and Medicaid eligibility as a proxy for socio-economic status) and urbanicity. Urbanicity was categorized into three levels by county-specific percentage of urban population based on urban rural delineation from the U.S. Census. In this cohort with understudied less-urban areas without regulatory monitors, we still found positive association between circulatory and respiratory hospitalization and short-term exposure to PM2.5, with higher effect estimates towards the end of study period. Consistent with current literature, we identified significant disparity in associations by race, socioeconomic status and urbanicity. We found that the percentage change in circulatory hospitalization rate per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was higher in the 2008-2016 time period compared to the 2000-2007 period by 0.33% (95% posterior credible interval 0.22, 0.44%), 0.52% (0.33, 0.69%), and 0.67% (0.53, 0.83%) for low, medium and high tertiles of urban areas, respectively. We also observed significant differences in temporal trends of associations across socioeconomic status, sex, and age, indicating a possible widening in disparity of PM2.5-related health burden. This study raises the importance of considering environmental justice issues in PM2.5-related health impacts with respect to how associations may change over time.

AB  - This viewpoint paper discusses the rise of blockadia as a global anti-extractivism movement over recent decades. It elucidates blockadia's distinct characters and implications for future grassroots environmentalism. Collective actions constituting the blockadia movement differ from conventional environmental campaigns in terms of its (1) embrace of confrontational tactics, (2) integration of environmental and social justice concerns, and (3) reliance of grassroots coalitions whose members often have diversified backgrounds. By elaborating these characters, I argue that the rise of blockadia reveals diminishing public trust in capitalism's capacity to avert the worst consequences of climate change. Blockadia thus presents a helpful concept to understand why climate justice activism increasingly bypasses traditional public deliberation mechanisms to intervene in energy policymaking at both state and regional levels.

AB  - With the rapid economic growth and urbanisation process, a large amount of cultivated land has been permanently transformed into urban land. The protection of cultivated land has received widespread attention, and ecological compensation has been an effective means of restraining the decrease in cultivated land. Different from previous approaches to and methods of studying cultivated land's ecological compensation, this study proposes a new behavioural perspective. Reasonably determining the priority of ecological compensation and the amount of compensation constitutes the core of building a regional ecological compensation mechanism. On the basis of the main functional area, this paper defines the area of ecological compensation and payment for cultivated land and determines the corresponding order and level by measuring the ecosystem's service value in Hubei Province. The results show that the order and quantity of ecological compensation for cultivated land are spatially heterogeneous, and that the order and quantity of compensation (payment) in different main functional areas have a certain correlation. That is, when the order of compensation (payment) is higher, the quantity is larger. The results have a certain reference value for the reform of cultivated land's ecological compensation and the innovation of financial payment mechanisms, particularly in the context of developing countries.

AB  - Urban air pollution is quite complex and exhibits significant spatial variability within communities. Traditional centralized monitoring captures temporal variability as well as the long-term trends of air pollution very well, but mapping spatial variability of air pollution in communities at high resolution would require large number of air quality monitors distributed across the community. Mobile monitoring complements stationary monitoring approaches by measuring pollution levels on accessible road networks in urban communities. This paper presents the application of an integrated mobile measurement and data analysis approach to study community-level air pollution patterns, separate the regional background and local contributions, and identify high pollution zones for black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). This study was conducted during different periods from 2017 to 2019 in three California cities (Richmond, Stockton, and Commerce) with diverse community and source characteristics. The study found that traffic was the dominant primary source of air pollution in both urban and suburban settings. Urban areas adjacent to large area sources, such as ports and railyards had increased pollutant enhancements due to either direct or indirect emissions, while suburban areas containing unpaved roads were observed to have large PM2.5 enhancement due to the resuspended dust. The analysis disaggregated the contribution of regional and local sources to local air pollution and found that regional background sources contributed up to 75% of the PM2.5 concentrations, while local sources contributed more than half of BC and UFP. The study suggests that 15-30 repeated measurements may be sufficient to map the general air pollution patterns within the community, while some extreme high pollution zones can be identified with fewer repeats (5-10). These techniques can be used for initial screening of air pollution variability within the community, and help identify priority areas for conducting follow-up long-term air quality measurements. The techniques also informs the relative importance of regional and local actions to reduce community pollutant levels.

AB  - This essay features critical reflections on a process of generative community-based participatory research (CBPR) in which communication researchers collaborated with environmental organizations, cultural advocacy groups, and community participants to identify better ways of addressing ecocultural struggles. In response to Depoe's call to promote scholar-practitioner interactions, the authors make explicit challenges and benefits implicated in employing a CBPR process to promote environmental justice. This critical reflective analysis centers on three key issues related to engaging in CBPR-oriented praxis-based research. The findings challenge the researcher's role as the initiator of a community-university collaborative project, broaden the notion of community in CBPR, and promote multiple analytical perspectives that can speak to diverse partner-stakeholders. The authors conclude with a conceptualization of how CBPR can aid in promoting environmental justice as both a goal and a process and offer practical recommendations.

AB  - While there have been many studies on public interest litigation in China, few have considered the effectiveness of public interest litigation as a matter of mitigating climate change. Recently, a well-known Chinese green non-governmental organisation - Friends of Nature - brought a claim against Gansu Subsidiary of the State Power Grid for its refusal to fully purchase clean electricity generated from renewable generators. The claim was dismissed. However, it opened up a door for climate change/energy litigation. This article explores the contributions and potential barriers confronted by environment courts in climate change litigation. Although environment courts have made laudable achievements towards climate justice, climate change litigation is handicapped by conceptual failure and exposes participants (litigants and judges) to unnecessary uncertainties that environment courts find difficult to resolve.

AB  - Urban greenspace provides essential benefits and often depends on its distribution and spatial relationship with residents. Many cities set ambitious goals to increase the coverage of greenspace. In addition, to increase the total amount of greenspace, spatial patterns of greenspace supply and demand also need to be taken into account to make sure its ecosystem services can reach the residents. While previous research has examined greenspace distribution, its association with various ecosystem services, and its spatial relationship with residents' socioeconomic characteristics, relatively few studies have considered the spatial pattern of greenspace demand to assess its supply change over time. To fill this gap, we evaluated the greenspace change of Beijing between 2005 and 2015 using 2.5 m and 0.5 m high resolution remote sensing images. We first identified all of the greenspace changes, then evaluated the improvement of greenspace that was accessible to residents, and finally, we examined whether such improvement met different levels of demand estimated by neighborhood population, age structure, and economic status. The results showed a net increase of 1472 ha (7.8%) from 2005 to 2015. On average, percent greenspace within 500 m of the neighborhood boundary increased from 21% to 24%. Areas with low greenspace supply had a significantly higher increase. The standard deviation reduced from 8% to 7%, which indicated a smaller disparity of accessible greenspace. However, results showed that greenspace increase had little variation among neighborhoods with different demand levels. Our findings indicated that the greening efforts improved spatial distribution and reduced inequality in accessibility but failed to address different demand levels among neighborhoods. Furthermore, we identified neighborhoods with low supply/high demand and that lost greenspace between 2005-2015. These neighborhoods need to be given attention in future greening projects.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) provides a wide range of ecosystem services for human beings. The fairness of UGS distribution has important implications for sustainable urban development and human well-being. However, many current studies on green space fairness are limited to within specific cities, and UGS fairness in rapidly developing metropolitan areas is still largely neglected. This study quantifies the change in green space fairness in the Wuhan metropolitan area from 2000 to 2020 based on a long time series of land cover and population spatial distribution products. We incorporated green space types and population distribution into the fairness evaluation framework, quantified the value of green space ecosystem services available to people through nested buffers, and analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of green space fairness in the study area based on the Gini coefficient of each city. The results show that the supply of green space services in most cities has shown a trend of "decreasing and then increasing" in the past 20 years. The fairness of green space in three cities has shown an improving trend, and the Gini coefficient in four cities is still above 0.50 in 2020. Based on the current green space and related indicators in each city, we propose future greening policies for each city. The methodology and conclusions of this study will help improve future green space planning recommendations in metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations, thus promoting regional public infrastructure coproduction and sharing.

AB  - This paper offers a critical analysis of the most contemporary development intervention concerned with ameliorating the problems of Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) in sub-Saharan Africa, namely the emergence of Fairtrade Gold. Through an analysis of Fairtrade Gold in Tanzania, this paper argues that despite Fairtrade's promises to ASM operators of better prices, its potential efficacy is compromised by the informality of local gold markets and a deeply-rooted mistrust of development intervention more broadly. However, its greatest contribution may lie elsewhere in the drive for a social and environmental justice framework that privileges increased recognition for small-scale gold miners in the global South.

AB  - Used to describe state-led efforts to secure greater benefits from a country's resource stocks, 'resource nationalism' is an emerging scholarly concern. Yet writing on this topic has largely centred on work from the fields of international relations, political science and business which has been quick to warn of its limitations whilst simultaneously offering endorsements of the extant neoliberal world order that continues to dominate resource extraction globally. It is shown in this paper how a more critical framework for analysing resource nationalism can be achieved by drawing upon the insights from geography. In particular, geography's treatment of political economy/ecology, environmental justice and the politics of space can offer insights into the politico-spatial ordering of resource nationalism in three ways. First, resource nationalism should not be seen as anathema to the imperatives of private-led extraction but rather as something more hybrid. Second, It shows in a world of ever-expanding resource frontiers, 'national' borders of extraction are more fluid than those currently presented by mainstream literature. Finally, it argues that the 'one nation' discourse of resource nationalism is misguided as it fails to factor in matters of justice that operate at different scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To understand anti-democratic barriers to accomplishing energy democracy, I examine how and why a centralised energy system can maintain itself based on an ethnographic analysis of the local protest of the Miryang community against the Korea Electric Power Corporation's construction of a 765,000-volt transmission line. In doing so, I incorporate the element of authoritarian communication into the framework of peripheralization - a socio-political reproduction of social, spatial, and environmental inequality caused by siting environmentally hazardous facilities in peripheral communities and reinforcing their powerlessness - to emphasize the aggressive role of government and industry actors. Composed of unidirectional projection, partial absorption, and forceful suppression, authoritarian communication makes the sacrifices of peripheral communities enduring, and consequently enables an undemocratic energy arrangement to be resilient and perpetual. To overcome this mechanism, I highlight the active roles of citizens to contest authoritarian communication and socio-environmental inequalities as a precondition to building a sustainable energy democracy.

AB  - This paper explores the recognitional dimensions of urban climate change justice in a development context. Through the lens of migrants in the Indian cities of Bengaluru and Surat, we highlight how experiences of environmental marginality can be attributed to a lack of recognition of citizenship rights and informal livelihood strategies. Specifically, the drivers of non-recognition in this situation relate to broken social networks and a lack of political voice, as well as heightened exposure to emerging climate risks and economic precariousness. We find that migrants experience extreme forms of climate injustice as they are often invisible to the official state apparatus, or worse, are actively erased from cities through force or discriminatory development policies. Current theories must therefore engage more seriously with issues of recognition to enable more radical climate justice in cities.

AB  - This paper explores how criteria for socially just climate change adaptation and resilience-building are articulated and embedded within urban planning and decision-making. We assess recent evidence from the ten largest cities in the United States through a narrative review of key planning documents. Our results show that cities are variably operationalizing equity, inclusion, and justice criteria across four key decision-making stages: designing institutional arrangements, participatory practices, policy integration, and strategic implementation processes. Although cities are beginning to address differential vulnerability and adaptive capacity, more work is required to tackle unequal socioeconomic structures and their contributions to underlying drivers of climate injustice.

AB  - We selected three case studies to illustrate environmental injustice issues in the South. These examples relate to migrant agricultural workers, the maquiladora industry and artisanal mining, while reviewing some of the major mechanisms involved, e. g. multinational corporations, the development of free trade zones, multilateral free trade agreements and the export of hazards. A series of strategies are discussed in order to address environmental injustice and health disparities that exist on a global scale. Some of the recommendations involve policy initiatives; others, such as research and mentorship, fall within the traditional domain of public health practice. In this paper, special attention is given to concerned environmental and occupational health professionals using evidence-based data for advocacy. For lasting changes to be made, however, stronger institutions and legislation are required. Those who have the 'right to know' about environmental injustice issues include communities of concern, workers' representatives and lawyers. Government officials and company officials may eventually work on the basis of conflict resolution, compensation and remediation, to quote some examples. Systematic approaches to protect both the environment and public health must be updated.

AB  - We report integration of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) United States Environmental Justice Screen (EJSCREEN) database with our Public Health Exposome dataset to interrogate 9232 census blocks to model the complexity of relationships among environmental and socio-demographic variables toward estimating adverse pregnancy outcomes [low birth weight (LBW) and pre-term birth (PTB)] in all Ohio counties. Using a hill-climbing algorithm in R software, we derived a Bayesian network that mapped all controlled associations among all variables available by applying a mapping algorithm. The results revealed 17 environmental and socio-demographic variables that were represented by nodes containing 69 links accounting for a network with 32.85% density and average degree of 9.2 showing the most connected nodes in the center of the model. The model predicts that the socio-economic variables low income, minority, and under age five populations are correlated and associated with the environmental variables; particulate matter (PM2.5) level in air, proximity to risk management facilities, and proximity to direct discharges in water are linked to PTB and LBW in 88 Ohio counties. The methodology used to derive significant associations of chemical and non-chemical stressors linked to PTB and LBW from indices of geo-coded environmental neighborhood deprivation serves as a proxy for design of an African-American women's cohort to be recruited in Ohio counties from federally qualified community health centers within the 9232 census blocks. The results have implications for the development of severity scores for endo-phenotypes of resilience based on associations and linkages for different chemical and non-chemical stressors that have been shown to moderate cardio-metabolic disease within a population health context.

AB  - We develop and apply a new theoretical framework for assessing the transformative capability of transparency in environmental governance. Our framework suggests that as norms related to transparency are recognized and translated into accountability mechanisms, and as these mechanisms are complied with, effects cascade and substantially influence the ability of transparency to transform relationships of inequality. Utilizing the case of climate finance in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we find that while a variety of norms underpinning transparency are recognized within the governance architecture, their translation into accountability mechanisms has been weak, and information disclosed by countries is often opaque. This suggests that a focus on enhanced transparency is unlikely to be sufficient for realizing a climate regime that is adequate and equitable. Moreover, transparency should be seen as a terrain of political conflict over the conditions of inequality, employed differently by various coalitions to benefit their respective interests.

AB  - What are the guiding principles of contemporary international governance of climate change and to what extent do they represent neoliberal forms? We document five main political and institutional shifts within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and outline core governance practices for each phase. In discussing the current phase since the Paris Agreement, we offer to the emerging literature on international neoliberal environmental governance an analytical framework by which the extent of international neoliberal governance can be assessed. We conceptualize international neoliberal environmentalism as characterized by four main processes: the prominence of libertarian ideals of justice, in which justice is defined as the rational pursuit of sovereign self-interest between unequal parties; marketization, in which market mechanisms, private sector engagement and purportedly 'objective' considerations are viewed as the most effective and efficient forms of governance; governance by disclosure, in which the primary obstacles to sustainability are understood as 'imperfect information' and onerous regulatory structures that inhibit innovation; and exclusivity, in which multilateral decision-making is shifted from consensus to minilateralism. Against this framework, we argue that the contemporary UNFCCC regime has institutionalized neoliberal reforms in climate governance, although not without resistance, in a configuration which is starkly different than that of earlier eras. We conclude by describing four crucial gaps left by this transition, which include the ability of the regime to drive adequate ambition, and gaps in transparency, equity and representation.

AB  - This review synthesizes diverse approaches that researchers have brought to bear on the challenge of sustainable development. We construct an integrated framework highlighting the union set of elements and relationships that those approaches have shown to be useful in explaining nature-society interactions in multiple contexts. Compelling evidence has accumulated that those interactions should be viewed as a globally interconnected, complex adaptive system in which heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and innovation play formative roles. The long-term evolution of that system cannot be predicted but can be understood and partially guided through dynamic interventions. Research has identified six capacities necessary to support such interventions in guiding development pathways toward sustainability. These are capacities to (a) measure sustainable development, (b) promote equity, (c) adapt to shocks and surprises, (d) transform the system into more sustainable development pathways, (e) link knowledge with action, and (f) devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together in exercising the other capacities.

AB  - This letter presents a distributive environmental justice analysis of unconventional gas development in the area of Pennsylvania lying over the Marcellus Shale, the largest shale gas formation in play in the United States. The extraction of shale gas using unconventional wells, which are hydraulically fractured (fracking), has increased dramatically since 2005. As the number of wells has grown, so have concerns about the potential public health effects on nearby communities. These concerns make shale gas development an environmental justice issue. This letter examines whether the hazards associated with proximity to wells and the economic benefits of shale gas production are fairly distributed. We distinguish two types of distributive environmental justice: traditional and benefit sharing. We ask the traditional question: are there a disproportionate number of minority or low-income residents in areas near to unconventional wells in Pennsylvania? However, we extend this analysis in two ways: we examine income distribution and level of education; and we compare before and after shale gas development. This contributes to discussions of benefit sharing by showing how the income distribution of the population has changed. We use a binary dasymetric technique to remap the data from the 2000 US Census and the 2009-2013 American Communities Survey and combine that data with a buffer containment analysis of unconventional wells to compare the characteristics of the population living nearer to unconventional wells with those further away before and after shale gas development. Our analysis indicates that there is no evidence of traditional distributive environmental injustice: there is not a disproportionate number of minority or low-income residents in areas near to unconventional wells. However, our analysis is consistent with the claim that there is benefit sharing distributive environmental injustice: the income distribution of the population nearer to shale gas wells has not been transformed since shale gas development.

AB  - While human activities have altered the urban nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles, the relationships between social and biophysical processes in cities are not well understood. Here we evaluated relationships between sociodemographic variables (median household income and housing age) and N and C contents and stable isotope ratios of vegetation in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area (LA), California, and the Salt Lake Valley, Utah. We hypothesized that (1) N content and stable isotope ratios would be negatively related to income via increased N deposition in lower-income areas; (2) N and C content and N stable isotope ratios would have a positive relationship with age due to soil organic matter accumulation and increased exposure to N losses over time, respectively; and (3) C-13 would increase with income as a result of increased fossil fuel-derived CO2 concentrations in lower-income areas. We found that N-15 values decreased with median household income in both cities and N content decreased with income in LA. In addition, atmospheric NO2 concentrations decreased with income in LA. Soil N and C content increased with housing age. However, N-15 had opposing relationships with age in the two cities. Finally, foliar C-13 values were more isotopically depleted with both increasing household income and increasing NO2 concentrations in LA. These results show that urban foliar and soil isotopic composition are associated with sociodemographic variables and that affluence, as well as housing age, influences urban plant and soil function.

AB  - This paper examines the proposal that the indigenous cosmovision of buen vivir (good living)-the "organizing principle" of Ecuador's 2008 and Bolivia's 2009 constitutional reforms-constitutes an appropriate basis for responding to climate change. Advocates of this approach blame climate change on a "civilizational crisis" that is fundamentally a crisis of modern Enlightenment reason. Certain Latin American feminists and indigenous women, however, question the implications, for women, of any proposed "civilizational shift" seeking to reverse the human separation from nonhuman nature wrought via Enlightenment's "disenchantment of nature." The paper argues that, in order to adequately address both the climate crisis and feminist concerns about buen vivir, a different critique of Enlightenment modernity is necessary-one drawing on Adorno's philosophy of negative dialectics and on Adorno and Horkheimer's nonidentitarian dialectical understanding of Enlightenment. Conceiving Enlightenment as composed of nonsublatable moments of domination and liberation, Adorno and Horkheimer call for a rational critique of reason and for affinity rather than identity with nonhuman nature. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how feminist critiques of buen vivir and approaches to climate justice can be furthered via an engagement with an environmental feminist philosophy informed by a negative dialectical approach to Enlightenment.

AB  - This study presents a health survey conducted by a community-based participatory research partnership between academic researchers and community organizers to consider environmental health and environmental justice issues in four neighborhoods of Richmond, California, a low-income community of color living along the fence line of a major oil refinery and near other industrial and mobile sources of pollution. The Richmond health survey aimed to assess local concerns and perceptions of neighborhood conditions, health problems, mobile and stationary hazards, access to health care, and other issues affecting residents of Richmond. Although respondents thought their neighborhoods were good places to live, they expressed concerns about neighborhood stressors and particular sources of pollution, and identified elevated asthma rates for children and long-time Richmond residents. The Richmond health survey offers a holistic, community-centered perspective to understanding local environmental health issues, and can inform future environmental health research and organizing efforts for community-university collaboratives.

AB  - Using Lorenz-type curves, means tests, ordinary least squares, and locally weighted regressions (LWR), we examine the relative burdens of whites, blacks, and Hispanics in Georgia from road and air traffic noise. We find that whites bear less noise than either blacks or Hispanics and that blacks tend to experience more traffic noise than Hispanics. While every Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) showed that blacks experienced relatively more noise than average, such a result did not hold for Hispanics in roughly half of the MSAs. We find much heterogeneity across Census tracts using LWR. For most Census tracts, higher black and Hispanic population shares are associated with increased noise. However, 5.5% of the coefficients for blacks and 18.9% for Hispanics are negative, suggesting larger population shares are associated with less noise. The noise LWR marginal effects for black populations across most tracts in the state are consistent with diminishing marginal noise from additional black population, while those in Atlanta exhibit diminishing marginal noise for Hispanics. In many regions of the state where the potential for health-damaging noise exists, we find relatively high disproportionality in noise experienced by the black and Hispanic populations compared to the rest of the overall population. Our findings underscore the importance of using nonparametric estimation approaches to unveil spatial heterogeneity in applied urban and housing economics analyses.

AB  - To explore potential links between ecosystems and human health, we set out three ways of seeing or frames: environmental hazards and burden of illness; ecosystem conditions and human well-being; and environmental justice and human core values Each frame provides a basis for making connections but also poses certain challenges: expanding research methods, linking with other conditions of human well-being and clarifying value bases. We discuss actions which build on the strengths of the different frames to deal with the challenges: linking with those seeking greater ecosystem protection focusing on clean production strategies emphasizing environmental degradation as one aspect of social justice and building on concerns such as reproduction which are closer to human core values Health promotion practitioners and policy makers can flexibly use the frames in arguing for the betterment of both ecosystems and humans.

AB  - While access and exposure to green spaces has been shown to be beneficial for the health of urban residents, interventions focused on augmenting such access may also catalyse gentrification processes, also known as green gentrification. Drawing from the fields of public health, urban planning and environmental justice, we argue that public health and epidemiology researchers should rely on a more dynamic model of community that accounts for the potential unintended social consequences of upstream health interventions. In our example of green gentrification, the health benefits of greening can only be fully understood relative to the social and political environments in which inequities persist. We point to two key questions regarding the health benefits of newly added green space: Who benefits in the short and long term from greening interventions in lower income or minority neighbourhoods undergoing processes of revitalisation? And, can green cities be both healthy and just? We propose the Green Gentrification and Health Equity model which provides a framework for understanding and testing whether gentrification associated with green space may modify the effect of exposure to green space on health.

AB  - This paper examines the role played by community characteristics in influencing local exposure to toxic releases, focusing specifically on ethnic fractionalization and polarisation. In contrast to the previous literature, this study argues that it is the fractionalization and/or polarisation of ethnic groups that is the relevant consideration, rather than the population share of ethnic minorities, since such ethnic divisions may significantly increase the difficulty of coordinating community action. Using toxic release data for the periods 1990 to 1995 and 2000 to 2005 we find that measures of ethnic divisions have a positive relationship with toxic releases. This finding persists across a range of robustness exercises. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water is a human right and it is essential to sustain life and livelihoods, as well as the health and happiness of tourists. This paper examines a destination with ample rain, but rapid and unchecked tourism development: Bali, Indonesia. The mismanagement of water resources means underground supplies are polluted and local people suffer from water scarcity. A multi-method approach with the various stakeholders was used to develop a stakeholder map that identifies duty bearers and rights holders. The government is the primary legal duty bearer to provide communities with water, but companies also have unique responsibilities. This paper examines why tourism businesses need to conduct human rights impact assessments. Taking due diligence for human rights can be seen as a business opportunity, leading to reduced operating costs and increased reputational strength. The benefits and challenges for business are explored.

AB  - We examined The University of Vermont's new sustainability requirement for undergraduates through the lens of just sustainability. We found that sustainability courses are proposed in diverse disciplines. Regardless of discipline, most proposed courses address all three pillars of sustainability (social, ecological, and economic). Discussions of environmental justice are less widespread; only 17% of proposed courses in science, technology, and math departments addressed environmental justice. Our results provide examples for others interested in integrating sustainability across diverse disciplines and in emphasizing environmental justice. We also call attention to the fact that institutions of higher education may need explicit reminders or requirements to adequately include considerations of environmental justice in sustainability studies.

AB  - This paper contributes to the environmental justice literature by analyzing contextually relevant and racial/ethnic group-specific variables in relation to air toxics cancer risks in a US-Mexico border metropolis at the census block group-level. Results indicate that Hispanics' ethnic status interacts with class, gender and age status to amplify disproportionate risk. In contrast, results indicate that non-Hispanic whiteness attenuates cancer risk disparities associated with class, gender and age status. Findings suggest that a system of white-Anglo privilege shapes the way in which race/ethnicity articulates with other dimensions of inequality to create unequal cancer risks from air toxics.

Adopting an 'alternative' view of accounting-one that sees accounting as social and transformative, that pays heed to those voices arguing for greater social and environmental justice, and that draws attention to the role of accounting researchers in the process of globalization the paper defines globalization and explores some of its material and symbolic, and consumptive and productive, practices. The paper further lays out a number of points attendant with a 'global economic redesign', again with the aim of expanding the globalization and accounting research agenda.

AB  - This paper argues that we cannot debate SEA procedures in isolation from questions of value, and that these debates should foreground qualities of outcomes rather than become preoccupied with qualities of process. Value differences should not be left as a question of mediation between conflicting positions. As a means of introducing this normative perspective on SEA, the paper explores how theories of environmental justice could provide a useful basis for establishing how to deal with questions of value in SEA, and help in understanding when SEA is successful and when it is not. From this perspective, 'good' SEA is more than good process. Good SEA must be able to take into account the distributional consequences of policies, plans, or programmes, with decisions driven by the recognition that certain groups tend to systematically lose out in the distribution of environmental goods and bads. SEA therefore has a role to play in redressing such imbalances. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Variation in cancer incidence between countries and groups of countries has been well studied. However cancer incidence is linked to risk factors that may vary within countries, and may subsist in localized geographic areas. In this study we investigated between- and within-country variation in the incidence of all cancers combined for countries belonging to the Group for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration in Latin Language Countries (GRELL). We hypothesized that investigation at the micro-level (circumscribed regions and local cancer registry areas) would reveal incidence variations not evident at the macro level and allow identification of cancer incidence hotspots for research, public health, and to fight social inequalities. Data for all cancers diagnosed in 2008-2012 were extracted from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, Vol XI. Incidence variation within a country or region was quantified as r/R, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest incidence rates for cancer registries within a country/region (r), divided by the incidence rate for the entire country/region x 100. We found that the area with the highest male incidence had an ASRw 4.3 times higher than the area with the lowest incidence. The area with the highest female incidence had an ASRw 3.3 times higher than the area with the lowest incidence. Areas with the highest male ASRws were Azores (Portugal), Florianopolis (Brazil), Metropolitan France, north Spain, Belgium, and north-west and north-east Italy. Areas with the highest female ASRws were Florianopolis (Brazil), Belgium, north-west Italy, north-east Italy, central Italy, Switzerland and Metropolitan France. Our analysis has shown that cancer incidence varies markedly across GRELL countries but also within several countries: the presence of several areas with high cancer incidence suggests the presence of area-specific risk factors that deserve further investigation.

AB  - Throughout the United States, an increasing number of states have turned to legalizing gambling and constructing casinos as a source of economic development. In 2004, casino gambling was legalized in Pennsylvania. The state plans to open 14 slot machine casinos, and 2 of them would be located in the city of Philadelphia. Much debate occurred regarding the location of these casinos in Philadelphia; currently one casino is open and construction has yet to begin on the other. However, casinos have been proven to cause many potential problems for the area where they are located, such as pollution, crime, and traffic. Because of these problems, it is believed that casinos are often located in neighborhoods dominated by people who traditionally lack political power. This project seeks to analyze the public policy actions that have resulted in the two current casino locations in Philadelphia, and examine the socioeconomic characteristics of the areas surrounding the casinos using environmental justice GIS methods.

AB  - This article, which looks at Indigenous communities in the multiethnic, multicultural region of Sabah, East Malaysia, on the island of Borneo, argues that indigeneity is not primordial, but exists in relation to dominant identities as well as other non-dominant, Indigenous groups. Moreover, Indigenous Peoples are not passive recipients of colonial or even postcolonial Othering: their identity is contextualised and contested within majority-minority relations. The article begins with a brief history of the dominant Kadazandusun nationalism in Sabah, in the context of the overarching Bumiputra policy of Malaysia, which privileges constructed Malayness, as background to the discourses and practices of smaller groups of land-based Murut and the sea-oriented 'Bajau', where identity switching is taking place in tandem with environmental justice claims. The land-based communities (Murut) have found leverage in making identity and livelihood claims attached to place (here, state-declared forest reserves that seek to exclude them) in line with the recent global environmental justice focus on participatory conservation rather than the older 'fortress conservation' model still dominant in state conservation thinking. However, the sea-oriented peoples (Bajau) require other social symbols than land for making their identity claims, in this instance, via claims to 'modern' livelihoods and as managers of marine resources with reference to the newly established Tun Mustapha Park. In Sabah, participatory conservation is being reappropriated by Indigenous Peoples to assert claims about place and /or livelihoods; if bureaucratised, however, this form of conservation might turn out to be less than participatory.

AB  - This paper makes the case for an environmental justice approach to the practice and study of participation and effectiveness in agrobiodiversity governance. It is argued that, in order to understand the conditions under which participation leads to improved outcomes, the concept has to be rethought, both from a political and a methodological perspective. This can be done by applying an ex-ante environmental justice approach to participation, including notions of distribution, recognition and representation. By exploring the approach through empirical examples of participation in biodiversity and environmental governance, a research framework is outlined, attempting to bridge normative and practical approaches to environmental justice, and tested on two cases of agrobiodiversity governance in Western Europe.

AB  - Vulnerable subpopulations may be exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution than the rest of the population. Due to the potential for this to exacerbate their existing health burden, concerns about disparities in subpopulations? air pollution exposure have motivated international public health researchers to examine this topic. In Australia, such research is lacking to date, despite heterogeneity in air pollution at multiple spatial scales across the continent. This study aimed to investigate disparities in exposure to two health-relevant outdoor air pollutants: particulate matter ?m (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). We used national land-use regression models to estimate annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2, and area-level census data on ethnicity, age and socio-economic status (SES) to calculate the bivariate associations between each census-derived variable with the concentration of air pollutants. We also used multivariable models including specific measures of SES as covariates to assess to what extent associations were explained by SES. Associations were calculated separately for rural and urban areas using generalised additive models which accounted for spatial autocorrelation. Bivariate results showed significant nonlinear associations (p < 0.001) between vulnerable subpopulations and pollutant concentration. These associations suggested that areas with greater socio-economic disadvantage, a higher proportion of ethnic minorities, and elderly people are exposed to higher concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2, although differences in the magnitude of exposure were small overall. Our multivariable models showed that the associations between ethnic minorities and pollutant concentration appear to be substantially affected by area-level SES. Our results suggested that these vulnerable subpopulations are inequitably exposed to PM2.5 and NO2. While the magnitude of differences in exposure were generally small, the predicted differences in exposure among vulnerable subpopulations could contribute to a potentially avertable health burden at a population-level.

AB  - While risk assessment continues to drive most environmental management decision-making, its methods and assumptions have been criticized for, among other things, perpetuating environmental injustice. The justice challenges to risk assessment claim that the process ignores the unique and multiple hazards facing low-income and people of color communities and simultaneously excludes the local, non-expert knowledge which could help capture these unique hazards from the assessment discourse. This paper highlights some of these challenges to conventional risk assessment and suggests that traditional models of risk characterization will continue to ignore the environmental justice challenges until cumulative hazards and local knowledge are meaningfully brought into the assessment process. We ask whether a shift from risk to exposure assessment might enable environmental managers to respond to the environmental justice critiques. We review the US EPA's first community-based Cumulative Exposure Project, piloted in Brooklyn, NY, and highlight to what extent this process addressed the risk assessment critiques raised by environmental justice advocates. We suggest that a shift from risk to exposure assessment can provide an opportunity for local knowledge to both improve the technical assessment and its democratic nature and may ultimately allow environmental managers to better address environmental justice concerns in decision-making.

AB  - Urban places and health equity are two of the most challenging concepts for 21st century environmental health. More people live in cities than at any other time in human history and health inequities are increasing. Health inequities are avoidable differences in the social, environmental and political conditions that shape morbidity and mortality, and disproportionately burden the poor, racial, ethnic and religious minorities and migrants. By linking urban place and health inequities, research and action brings into sharp relief the challenges of achieving urban environmental justice. This article briefly reviews the complex definitions of urban places and how they can shape health equity in cities. I suggest that a more relational or integrated approach to defining urban places and acting on health equity can complement other approaches and improve the ability of public health to meet 21st century challenges. I close with suggestions for research and practice that might focus environmental public health on healthy urban place making. The practices include community driven map making, Health in All Policies (HiAP), promoting urban ecosystem services for health, and participatory and integrated approaches to urban slum upgrading. I conclude that if the global community is serious about the sustainable development goals (SDGs), greater attention must be paid to understanding and acting to improve urban places, living conditions and the social and economic conditions that can promote health equity.

AB  - This paper follows the return of electronic waste back into commodity circuits through widespread processes of reuse, repair and remanufacturing across Delhi, India. Tracing the movements of waste from the scrap shop back into secondary use industries, I situate e-waste in India as operating primarily within economies of reuse and repair, rather than waste and recycling. Instead of managing waste, India's broad reuse industries are production-based, maintaining and making new things out of a diversity of new and used materials. The production of value from used things is dependent on the e-waste trader and the repair worker, who see the potential for seemingly unlimited trajectories of multitudinous conditions and configurations. This view of e-waste from the repair shop (and even the scrap shop) rather than a recycling factory offers a very different rendering of e-waste and particularly informal e-waste labor in the Global South than is presented in policy and popular media. Building on scholarship on vibrant waste economies, I demonstrate that India's electronic "waste" sector is in fact a powerful source of value (and product) creation and call into question e-waste as a definitive "waste" product and its management in a "waste" economy.

AB  - This paper discusses the challenges involved in adopting an integrated approach to urban water policies and management, a particularly problematic issue in Brazil due to the incomplete nature of urbanization, defined as the lack of adequate and/or universalized access to infrastructure and services, informal housing and conflicts between environmental protection and social housing needs. In the last two decades strong social movements have influenced urban environmental policies from national to local levels. In Belo Horizonte since 1993, decision-making processes have involved important mechanisms of democratic inclusion, which have contributed to fairer urban policies. A brief discussion of the concept of governance follows, introducing the municipal urban policy within which drainage and sanitation policies have been implemented. This paper presents the constitutional and institutional role of the five municipal committees dealing with water governance issues, as they are important arenas for civil society participation. The main constraints to achieving integrated urban water governance at the local level and the extent to which such policies are able to reduce social inequalities and promote social environmental justice in the use and appropriation of urban water, are discussed. This paper is part of the SWITCH-Sustainable Water Management Improves Tomorrow's Cities' Health-research network.

AB  - This paper contributes a micro-level analysis of voluntary welfare providers, an under explored avenue of geographical research. It analyses the localised social impacts of the macroeconomic restructuring of the Welfare State in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s on the work of voluntary service organisations (VSOs) and drop-in centres (DICs) as spaces of care in Dunedin, a small South Island city. We document differences among VSOs and DICs in terms of funding, clientele, and adjustments to service provision to satisfy increasing numbers of patrons and the changing composition of demand. Our findings suggest policy recommendations which, we believe, would do much to enhance the ability of both DICs and smaller VSOs to meet client needs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper examines the socioeconomic effects of alternative management strategies for Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands in the interior Columbia basin. From a broad-scale perspective, there is little impact or variation between alternatives in terms of changes in total economic activity or social conditions in the region. However, adopting a finer scale and examining affects on the counties that are likely to be most impacted by federal lands management reveals that many of these counties may be better off under one alternative in the short term, but better off under another alternative in the longer term. The agencies can reduce their short-term impacts on federal resource-reliant counties with low socioeconomic resiliency, by concentrating initial restoration efforts in specific areas, but the environmental justice issues associated with such a policy should also be considered.

AB  - Trees provide a broad amount of ecosystem services in urban areas. Although it is well documented that trees are essential for the well-being and livability of cities, trees are often not evenly distributed. Studies have found that urban residents with a deprived socioeconomic status are associated with a lower coverage and access to urban trees in their communities, yet a fair distribution of trees contributes to the sustainability and resilience of cities. In this context, the environmental justice movement seeks to ensure equal distribution of green infrastructure and its benefits throughout a territory. The objective of this study is threefold: (i) to determine whether urban trees in Guadalajara, Mexico, are distributed equally; (ii) to assess the association between urban trees and socioeconomic status; and (iii) to introduce compositional data analysis to the existing literature. Due to the compositional nature of the data, compositional analysis techniques are applied. We believe this novel approach will help define the proper management of data used in the literature. The outcomes provide insights for urban planners working towards the Sustainable Development Goals to help eradicate the uneven distribution of urban trees in cities.

AB  - This paper examines public participation and the role of community psychology in an emerging environmental dispute relevant to global climate change (GCC)-whether nuclear power represents a "green" solution. From a dialectical position, we explore the nuclear debate as it is linked to GCC, and more specifically, how participation in related federally-mandated processes may be shaped by power. We present qualitative data from public meetings in two nuclear communities and analyze these data through a lens of social power and environmental justice, including an examination of nukespeak and telepolitical appeals to highlight the complexity of the issues, how the appearance of successful participation may be deceptive, and how consensus may be manipulated. We argue that CP should consider GCC to be one of the most significant social problems of our time and make every effort to be involved in the search for truly "green" solutions.

AB  - This study examines environmental justice issues; the tie between infill, sprawl, and inequity; and race and class discrimination as a hindrance to urban sustainability in newly constructed "starter home" neighborhoods in Charlotte, North Carolina, commonly called "cookie-cutter" development. Major findings include a discriminatory practice of locating neighborhoods meant for lower-income and workforce families adjacent to preexisting locally unwanted land uses (LULUs), including environmental hazards and other negative elements in the built environment such as industrial uses or heavy manufacturing, thus placing the most vulnerable populations at greater risk. We find that new construction surrounding the Interstate 485 loop spurred economic development in exurban areas but syphoned it from older inner-ring areas and that the worst location for new starter home neighborhoods is within predominantly low-income urban neighborhoods already challenged on a number of fronts. Rather than acting as a catalyst for positive change, the opposite occurred, and the surrounding problems, instability, and disinvestment spread into the new areas. In such situations, starter homes embody repackaged urban renewal as a new model: islands of suburban-style infill surrounded by decline.

AB  - Vulnerability and resilience to extreme weather hazards are a function of diverse physical, social, and psychological factors. Previous research has focused on individual factors that influence public perceptions of hazards, such as politics, ideology, and cultural worldviews, as well as on socioeconomic and demographic factors that affect geographically based vulnerability, environmental justice, and community resilience. Few studies have investigated individual socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in public risk perceptions of the health hazards associated with extreme heat events, which are now increasing due to climate change. This study uses multilevel statistical modeling to investigate individual- and geographic-level (e.g., census tract level and regional) social, economic, and biophysical influences on public perceptions of the adverse health impacts associated with heat waves. Political orientation and climate change beliefs are the strongest predictors of heat wave health risk perceptions; household income also has a relatively strong and consistent effect. Contextual socioeconomic vulnerability, measured with a social vulnerability index at the census tract level, also significantly affects heat wave risk perceptions. The strong influence of political orientation and climate beliefs on perceptions of adverse health impacts from heat waves suggests that ideological predispositions can increase vulnerability to climate change.

While there is evidence to suggest that dog ownership produces considerable health benefit and provides an important form of social support that encourages dog owners to walk, there is limited evidence on the physical environmental and policy-related factors that affect dog owners walking with their dog. With the high level of dog ownership in many industrialized countries, further exploration of the relationship between dog ownership and physical activity levels may be important for preventing declining levels of physical activity and the associated detrimental health effects.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between the location of environmental risks and federally assisted public housing (Housing and Urban Development [HUD] Section 8) in a sample of eight medium-sized United States metropolitan areas. Using four U.S. Environmental Protection Agency databases, locational and potential risk exposure surfaces were constructed for each study area using a GIS-based methodology. Families living in HUD housing had a greater risk potential from hazardous facilities based on proximity and the reported releases from them. Minority populations (defined as percentage non-White) had significantly greater locational exposure than nonminority populations in all but one metropolitan area. Albuquerque. Minority populations also had higher risk burdens than nonminority residents. The historical evolution of the patterns of social and industrial change illustrates the unique localized processes of residential and industrial development. Explanations based solely on race and income show little consistency in cause and effect through time, but there is some emerging evidence that industrial host tracts are becoming poorer and home to more minority residents in at least half of our cities.

AB  - Utilizing the concept of environmental justice, this paper examines the differential burdens of toxic and hazardous waste facilities locations in low income minority communities. The association between the presence of facilities and socioeconomic characteristics of places an examined for the state of South Carolina at three different spatial scales: counties, census tracts, and census block groups. Three different types of hazardous waste/toxic facilities are also examined: Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites, Treatment, Storage, and Disposal sites (TSD), and inactive hazardous waste sites. Ar the county level, there was some association between the presence of toxic/hazardous waste facilities and race and income. In South Carolina, this translates to a disproportionate burden on White, more affluent communities in metropolitan areas, rather than low income minority communities. At both the census tract and block group levels, then is no association between race and the location of toxic/hazardous waste facilities. There an slight differences in the income levels between tracts and block groups with facilities and those without. This localized ecology of hazard sources must be expanded to include emission/discharge data in order to adequately address environmental justice issues on who bears the burdens of environmental contamination.

AB  - This paper compares the spatial distribution and character of two categories of risk-chronic toxic releases (small-scale, long-term exposures) and acute releases (large-scale, short-term events)-for the southeastern United States from 1987-1990. Our purpose is to identify whether lower-income minority counties are disproportionately at risk from these airborne releases of extremely hazardous substances. We found a fairly uniform distribution of chronic releases across the region, whereas the acute releases exhibited a more clustered pattern in the Carolinas, Florida, and Alabama. A correlation analysis failed to indicate any association between the racial composition of the county and the frequency of airborne toxic releases, yet wealth indicators were positively associated with the frequency of releases, When examining these in more detail, a principal components analysis yielded a hierarchy of toxic counties: (1) high-exposure urban counties, (2) high-exposure African American counties, (3) low-release counties, (4) high-acute-release counties. A further refinement of the analysis identified subgroupings of counties, but again we failed to find conclusive evidence of inequalities. Instead, we conclude that for the Southeast, there are a multitude of processes at work in producing the differential toxic releases reflected in the southern riskscape. More research is needed on the underlying sociospatial processes that give rise to the production of hazardousness of places and their populations.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel approach to investigate the geography of accessibility and air pollution and tests it on the case of the Brussels Capital Region. First, we find a strong positive correlation between accessibility and air pollution, highlighting a trade-off that exists between two emblematic but antithetical externalities of agglomerations. Next, we focus on the outliers that escape this trade-off and we develop a methodology to combine their respective levels of accessibility and air pollution into a 'desirability' indicator. Finally, we analyse the distribution of the most and the least desirable neighbourhoods across the city: while we observe flagrant patterns of inequality, these do not reflect the socio-economic structure of the region, in apparent contrast with the literature on transport justice and environmental justice. The results show how positive and negative socio-ecological externalities can be two sides of the same agglomeration coin. The methodology proves to be relevant to further comparative research and policy making concerned with promoting a balanced progress of social, economic and environmental priorities.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of spatial resolution on environmental justice analysis concerning stream health. The Saginaw River Basin in Michigan was selected since it is an area of concern in the Great Lakes basin. Three Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) models (ordinary regression, weighted regression and spatial) were developed for each stream health measure based on 17 socioeconomic and physiographical variables at three census levels. For all stream health measures, spatial models had better performance compared to the two non-spatial ones at the census tract and block group levels. Meanwhile no spatial dependency was found at the county level. Multilevel Bayesian CAR models were also developed to understand the spatial dependency at the three levels. Results showed that considering level interactions improved models' prediction. Residual plots also showed that models developed at the block group and census tract (in contrary to county level models) are able to capture spatial variations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While most research on climate change emphasises scientific impacts and responses, some researchers are beginning to examine critically its social dimensions, including economic and social justice. I draw from the approach of the environmental justice movement in the United States to shift the focus from the efforts by the government and international bodies to address climate change to the actions of some of the people most directly affected - poor farmers. Climate justice activists tend to look specifically at how to address the inequalities emerging from the burden of climate-related impacts. Environmental justice reminds us to consider the inequalities already in place, as well as how the various players involved understand and relate to their environments. While the issues involved range from the global to the local levels, I focus here on the local, presenting four cases of rural people in Nan Province, Northern Thailand, working to change their own and their neighbours' socio-economic situations through improving their agricultural methods. They demonstrate that those most affected by climate change are not mere victims. They are people who have agency, make choices, and often undertake innovative actions to help themselves.

AB  - Tree planting and reforestation initiatives in urban and peri-urban areas often use tree distribution or "giveaway" programs as a strategy to increase tree cover and subsequent benefits. However, the effectiveness of these programs in terms of increasing overall tree cover and providing benefits to low-income and disadvantaged communities has been little studied. We assess these programs by exploring community participation in, and barriers to, an urban tree distribution program in Fort Lauderdale, United States and the role socioeconomic background and tree functional types have on participation. We use a mixed-methods approach, panel data, choice experiments, and econometrics to quantitatively analyze respondent's ranking of program options. High income, White respondents had the highest level of awareness and participation while low income, African Americans (AA) had the lowest level. Monetary rebates were perceived as positive and significant as the compensation value increased to US$8.00 - $12.00. Fruit-bearing and native tree functional types were more preferred than flowering or shade trees. Latinos, AA, and high income respondents preferred fruit trees, while White, high income preferred native trees. Overall, low income respondents perceived the greatest barriers towards participation. 20% of Broward County residents who participated in the survey were aware of the tree giveaway programs and 13% had previously participated. Findings indicate an adaptive governance mismatch between program objectives to equitably increase city tree cover via planting shade trees versus individual's knowledge and preference for other tree types and functions. Results can be used for developing and evaluating reforestation initiatives to equitably increase tree cover and improve the governance of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Three decades of concern over consumption of potentially contaminated Great Lakes fish has led government agencies and public health proponents to implement risk assessment and management programs as a means of protecting the health of fishers and their families. While well-meaning in their intent, these programs-and much of the research conducted to support and evaluate them-were not designed to accommodate the understandings and concerns of the fish consumer. Results from a qualitative component of a multi-disciplinary, multi-year research project on frequent (average 108 meals per year) consumers of Great Lakes fish tell the fishers' side of the story. We present data from 87 tape recorded interviews conducted with Vietnamese, Chinese, and English-speaking participants that underscore the quality of freshly caught Great Lakes fish and the important social and cultural benefits of fish and fishing to the consumer. We also outline the participants' understandings of risk from eating Great Lakes fish and the way in which fishers and their families manage this risk. The paper concludes with a discussion of these benefits, risks, and risk management strategies as ways that Great Lakes fish consumers "construct" rather than "perceive" risk. We advocate for risk assessment and management protocols that involve those who will be affected the most, such as frequent consumers of Great Lakes fish, from the initial "risk characterization" stage through to any necessary risk communication.

AB  - With the inclusion of equity concerns in Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, equitable management has become an important objective for the world's protected areas. The way equity is defined and operationalized influences whether this strategic shift can help identify pathways commensurate with conservation effectiveness. We examined equity around a protected area in Laos, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the three dimensions of procedure, recognition, and distribution. Local understandings of equity depended on discrete, evolving issues, with attention to informal decision making and dynamic values required to uncover suitable solutions. We show that equity definitions focused on material distribution and assessments reliant on standardized indicators may result in inadequate responses that sustain local perceptions of inequitable management and miss opportunities for effective conservation. Equity should be considered a management goal to continually adapt toward, informed by stakeholder dialogue.

AB  - This paper explores the dissonance between conceptions of justice among forest-adjacent communities and their representation in global forest policies, a persistent barrier to delivering just sustainability. We empirically track justice claims of rural villagers upwards through specific intermediaries or justice brokers': civil society, state, or private sector actors operating at local to international levels, who navigate different institutions to advance various social and ecological interests. We draw on interviews with 16 intermediaries in each of Nepal and Uganda and find that recognition of local values and practices such as customary tenure systems are key justice concerns of forest-adjacent communities in each country. However, intermediaries perceive a low likelihood of advancing those claims through national or international climate and forest policy debates, such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), in large part because deliberations on justice are subordinated to concerns such as carbon accounting and arrangements for distributing monetary benefits. This suggests these policy processes must be modified to offer potential for transformational pathways. Intermediaries who pursued recognition justice issues developed innovative tactics in alternative forums. These norm entrepreneurs' adopted a suite of complementary strategies to attain influence, including: (1) formation of associations at the grassroots level; (2) media and advocacy campaigns through national coalitions to reach powerful international donors, and; (3) drawing on international support networks for advice, training and to influence national government. In both Uganda and Nepal these strategies were evidenced to enhance recognition for local values and practices.

AB  - Urban Green Space (UGS) is considered to be beneficial for health and wellbeing of urban residents. But there is growing evidence that benefits are not equally distributed. In this article we aim to understand the role that UGS plays in the process of social exclusion and the role urban greening strategies can play in enhancing social equity for specific groups that are excluded: elderly people with dementia, people with mental issues and people from an underprivileged neighborhood. The concepts of inclusion and exclusion and their relation to UGS are discussed. Four exclusion mechanisms are distinguished based on the role of the physical and societal environment and on the role of actors involved (public or private). Further, we identify four discourses behind possible strategies and measures to promote inclusion. These mechanisms and discourses are confronted with an analysis of three cases promoting inclusion of elderly with dementia, people with mental health issues and people from an underprivileged neighborhood. Succesful inclusion strategies in these cases are based on alignment between private actors initiatives and public actions. The cases indicate that public and private actors need to cooperate better in order to make UGS part of inclusion strategies.

AB  - While rhetorical approaches are common in communication inquiry, metaphor's role in shaping our understanding of the intersection of environmental and social justice issues has not fully been explored. This essay seeks to address this deficit by examining "Looking Both Ways: Women's Lives at the Crossroads of Reproductive Justice and Climate Justice," a publication of Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice. The text employs the metaphor of "looking both ways" to argue that climate and reproductive justice agenda setting should be aligned to simultaneously mitigate climate change and advance women's reproductive freedom. I contend "looking both ways" offers an innovative epistemological framework for articulating the intersections of climate and reproductive justice, as well as a convincing rationale for cultivating cross-movement coalitions. However, my analysis suggests that the organization's call to align climate and reproductive justice should be embraced with the acknowledgment that "looking both ways" limits a comprehensive coalitional perspective. This essay enhances current understandings of climate and reproductive justice concerns and demonstrates why diverse stakeholders committed to environmental causes must also support reproductive freedom.

AB  - This paper examines the implications of environmental justice in the regime for Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) currently developing in the European Union (EU). An 'ecosystem-based approach' to marine management is enshrined in the new Integrated Maritime Policy and Marine Strategy Framework Directive and forms the basis of MSP. This concept is intended to encompass all aspects of an ecosystem, including the human element. Yet the modes of including meaningful public participation in the decision-making process for MSP remain undetermined. At the same time, the Aarhus Convention (on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters) empowers non-governmental organisations to hold EU Member States to account. Consequently the issue of transparency will gain increased importance, as will linkages between human and environmental rights. Such public interest-based activism on the part of NGOs has the potential to enforce the developing framework for stakeholder engagement within MSP, but it also has implications worth considering regarding the appropriate role of interest-based organisations in the international political arena.

AB  - We pair an establishment-level dataset from Texas with public information available in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) to evaluate the standing of dirty industries in Texas census tracts with a focus on environmental justice concerns. The share of nonwhite residents in a tract is positively correlated with the number of TRI-reporting firms, and an inverse-U-shaped relationship characterizes the number of TRI-reporting firms and a tract's median income. Even after controlling for factor prices and other covariates that might drive firm location decisions, entrants that report to the TRI are more likely to locate in areas with a higher share of nonwhite residents. Firms that report to the TRI are also more likely to enter areas with a low share of college graduates. In contrast, the number of entrants from industries that do not have TRI reporters is negatively related to the percentage of nonwhite residents in a tract. Firms in these non-reporting industries are also more likely to enter areas with a high share of college graduates. Polluters appear to agglomerate, raising concerns about both chemical releases being concentrated in certain tracts, and also affecting nonwhite-dense areas disproportionately. The strength of these effects often depend on an urban/rural classification, with rural areas experiencing the most pronounced concerns. Moreover, TRI-reporting firms are less likely to exit the market relative to their peers that operate in the same industry but do not need to file TRI reports, suggesting that releases may affect a region in the long run.

AB  - We consider the relationship between the location choices of potentially polluting firms and local income. Unlike previous research in the area of environmental justice, we dis-tinguish between pollution potential and actual releases of toxic substances in the locality. We explore the relationship between the profit maximizing behavior of potentially pollut-ing firms in their choice of both location and expenditures to influence the likelihood of toxic releases and their expected financial costs. We proxy the expenditures on prudential behavior by observing the co-localization of waste remediation activities. Evidence sup-ports the conclusion that firms behave rationally in managing risk of toxic release, which may result in disparities in exposure to toxic releases faced by certain population groups.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to capturing and reviewing scientific literature addressing latent topics across multiple scientific fields. As latent topics like moral values are affected by word polysemy and synonymy, a traditional keyword-based approach is often ineffective and therefore inappropriate. As a result, scientific literature addressing latent topics tends to be fragmented thereby constraining efforts to address similar and complementary research challenges. A novel approach to reviewing the literature by utilizing both semantic fields and probabilistic topic models has therefore been developed. We illustrate this approach by reviewing the literature addressing the value justice in the energy sector and compare this with a regular keyword-based approach. The new approach results in a more complete overview of the relevance of energy justice as compared to the traditional keyword-based approach. This novel approach can be applied to other latent topics including other values or phenomena such as societal resistance to technologies, thereby leading to an increased understanding of existing relevant literature and the identification of new areas of research.

AB  - While a number of studies have shown that blacks, Hispanics and the poor are disproportionately exposed to pollution hazards, particularly in the United States, there are much fewer that focus on the processes contributing to environmental injustices. This paper contributes to the environmental justice literature by exploring local environmental conflict over a pollution hazard (municipal solid waste) to further decipher the process(es) that may perpetuate environmental injustices. Through a Canadian qualitative case study involving in-depth interviews with residents, we emphasize important deficits in, and experiences of, public participation throughout the environmental assessment process. We do this by recounting the experiences of black residents from a small rural community near two landfills in Eastern Canada. We find that there are subtle processes linked primarily to public participation that create and sustain environmental injustices by ultimately denying residents the opportunity to say no to unwanted developments. This case highlights both the process of injustice as well as the experience of injustice. The procedural culprits contribute to the production and reproduction of environmental injustice, demonstrating that environmental injustice is not simply a result of exposure to pollution; environmental injustice is a result of a number of long established practices, which in order to be remedied, techniques must be tailored to be inclusive of an affected population.

AB  - This exploratory analysis opens up new avenues for research in the area of media analysis and environmental justice by combining quantitative content analysis with qualitative discourse analysis of 15 Canadian mainstream newspapers to explore how Canadian print news media act not only as a filter but also as a constructor or silencer of environmental justice discourses. Disjunctures occur between what is covered by the Canadian news media and what local studies of place and injustice suggest are the on-the-ground realities. In particular, disadvantaged communities who have experienced or are experiencing significant environmental exposures are consistently underrepresented in key mainstream Canadian news media coverage. Consequences of this underrepresentation suggest indifference and may serve to perpetuate existing cases of environmental inequity. We suggest this muting happens not only through lack of reporting but also through discourse in existing reporting. This exploratory study suggests the need for ongoing research to examine: 1) how pervasive these phenomena are in various Canadian news media outlets, 2) how they manifest and with what impacts at the local scale in particular places, and 3) the overall impact of environmental justice as a discourse of resistance on the ground versus in the minds of academics.

AB  - We conducted microclimate simulations in ENVI-Met 3.1 to evaluate the impact of vegetation in lowering temperatures during an extreme heat event in an urban core neighborhood park in Phoenix, Arizona. We predicted air and surface temperatures under two different vegetation regimes: existing conditions representative of Phoenix urban core neighborhoods, and a proposed scenario informed by principles of landscape design and architecture and Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies. We found significant potential air and surface temperature reductions between representative and proposed vegetation scenarios: 1) a Park Cool Island effect that extended to non-vegetated surfaces; 2) a net cooling of air underneath or around canopied vegetation ranging from 0.9 A degrees C to 1.9 A degrees C during the warmest time of the day; and 3) potential reductions in surface temperatures from 0.8 A degrees C to 8.4 A degrees C in areas underneath or around vegetation.

AB  - This paper examines recent urban green amenities directed toward children and families and develops a novel understanding of the ways in which children's socio-natures are made/unmade through such interventions. We employ ethnographic and archival analysis in two new parks - Poble Nou and Nou Barris - in Barcelona to examine how a particular type of children's wellbeing, what we call "relational wellbeing" is shaped through the production of green-playful-child-friendly amenities. We find that planning processes and visions, urban development goals, and neighbourhood socio-material structure moderate the effect of green-playful-child-friendly amenities on relational wellbeing by directing how these spaces are used. This finding points toward the importance - for equity concerns - of accounting for the social and political processes that generate relational wellbeing. These processes are often reflective of broader economic agendas of urban transformation designed to extract value, control space, and/or legitimize speculative urban development - while sometimes eroding local socio-material conditions - to the point of producing green spaces of privilege, exclusion and control. The connection between relational wellbeing and green-playful-child-friendly interventions highlights the importance, within the urban environmental equity literature, of reconceptualising pathways of wellbeing and health beyond questions of spatial distribution of natural areas and offers a new perspective for the development of future guidelines on green-playful-child-friendly space policies.

AB  - With climate mitigation and energy transition impacts on vulnerable individuals becoming increasingly evident, justice considerations take on heightened relevance for energy governance. Yet, energy justice remains under-investigated in relation to the potential of behavioural economics. Behavioural economics provides evidence that individuals exhibit systematic and predictable patterns of decision-making that depart from the assumptions of rational choice theory, thus giving policy-makers a richer model of human behaviour. Adopting such a model will impact energy justice outcomes, hence understanding potential dynamics is timely. How can policy-makers complement traditional energy poverty alleviation measures with behaviourally informed ones to enhance vulnerable individuals' cognitive capacity? What implications does this carry for energy justice? Supportive choice architecture for individuals exposed to higher risks related to energy access and use must improve their outcomes, without shifting the responsibility for vulnerability to them, neglecting their intrinsic capabilities, or obscuring structural injustice. This article analytically illustrates whether and how behavioural economics can support individual behaviour and promote collective action, in combination with a policy shift to substantive claim-making processes, to address the unfair distribution of energy use burdens. Using nudging and boosting as tools for energy poverty alleviation, it discusses how behavioural economics can enhance energy justice.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of how to organize care in degrowth societies that call for social and ecological sustainability, as well as gender and environmental justice, without prioritizing one over the other. By building on degrowth scholarship, feminist economics, the commons, and decolonial feminisms, we rebut the strategy of shifting yet more unpaid care work to the monetized economy, thereby reinforcing the separation structure in economics. A feminist degrowth imaginary implies destabilizing prevalent dichotomies and overcoming the (inherent hierarchization in the) boundary between the monetized economy and the invisibilized economy of socio-ecological provisioning. The paper proposes an incremental, emancipatory decommodification and a commonization of care in a sphere beyond the public/private divide, namely the sphere of communitarian and transformative caring commons, as they persist at the margins of capitalism and are (re-)created by social movements around the world.

AB  - Urban areas are hubs of creativity and innovation providing fertile ground for novel responses to modern environmental challenges. Previous studies have attempted to conceptualise the ecological, social and political potential of social-ecological innovation in urban green space management. However, little work has been conducted on the social-ecological conditions influencing their occurrence and distribution. Further research is therefore necessary to demonstrate whether stakeholder stewardship of green resources contributes towards adaptive capacity in social-ecological systems. The research reported here explored the extent of organised social-ecological innovations in a continuous urban landscape comprising three adjoining metropolitan areas: Manchester, Salford and Trafford (UK). Examples of horticulture orientated organised social-ecological innovation were identified using a snowball-sampling method. Their distribution, explored with GIS and remote sensing technology, was found to be significantly associated with levels of both, social and ecological, deprivation. The study presented social-ecological innovation as an adaptive response to environmental stressors, conditioned by specific social and ecological parameters in the landscape. It therefore provides empirical support for social-ecological innovation as a valid ingredient contributing to resilience in adaptive social-ecological systems. Not only do such collective community-led elements of natural resource management warrant acknowledgement in urban green space planning, but their distribution and productivity may provide a valuable social-ecological laboratory for the study of polycentric governance and adaptive capacity in the urban environment.

AB  - Urban commons are under pressure. City development has led to the encroachment and ecological degradation of urban open space. Although there is growing insight that urban ecosystems need to be protected, there is hardly any attention for the consequences (of both pressures and protection efforts) for vulnerable human population groups. We aim to understand how urban development affects the well-being of the urban poor, through shifts in ecosystem services (ES) and people's responses to these shifts. We performed household interviews and group mapping sessions in seven urban lake communities in Bangalore, India. Changes at Bangalore's lakes can be summarized by three trends: privatization followed by conversion, pollution followed by degradation, and restoration followed by gentrification. Over time, this resulted in a shift in the types of ES supplied and demanded, the nature of use, and de facto governance: from provisioning, communal and public; to cultural, individual, and private. Lake dwellers responded by finding (other) sources of income, accepting lower quality or less accessible ES, and/or completely stopping the use of certain ES. The consequences of ecosystem change for people's well-being differ depending on a household's ability to adapt and on individual circumstances, land tenure and financial capital in particular. To guarantee a future for Bangalore's lakes, restoration seems the only viable option. Although beautiful lake parks may be a solution for the well-off and not-too-poor, leaving the very poor without options to adapt to the new circumstances puts them at risk of becoming even more marginalized. We show that ecosystem degradation and restoration alike can impact the well-being of the urban poor. People's experiences allowed us to couple ecosystem change to well-being through ES and adaptation strategies. Hence, we revealed multiple cause-effect relations. Understanding these relations contributes to sustainable urban development for people from all layers of society.

AB  - Two Maryland watershed restoration and mitigation programs were assessed to determine whether they are distributing resources fairly and equitably with respect to environmental justice. A Freedom of Information Act was submitted to obtain the location and scope of all registered wetlands impacts from Maryland's Non-tidal Wetland Mitigation program and the distribution of grant funds from the Federal Clean Water Act Section 319(h) which are used to help eliminate water quality impairments caused by nonpoint sources of pollution. Information retrieved from both programs was compiled on Excel and mapped on GIS by 8-digit watershed. Findings indicate mixed results on geographic, racial, and socioeconomic disparities in the location of programmatic wetlands projects funded by the state and of the allocation of Section 319(h) dollars. It is anticipated the research will assist the efforts of advocates for disadvantaged communities to argue for stronger environmental protections and additional federal and state resources for environmental restoration.

AB  - To date, little research has investigated how public perceptions of policies to ban or restrict fossil-fuel extraction change over time; yet this topic is of crucial importance as countries worldwide seek to transition towards 'net zero' economies. This study addresses this gap by focusing on public responses to the 2019 moratorium on shale gas extraction in England, using an analytical framework comprising awareness, interpretations and opinions, and a mixed-method approach combining national survey, social media and local case interviews. Findings show high levels of awareness and support for the moratorium, yet differences between coalitions of interest based on ideology, scale and demographics. Social media analyses reveal a peak in public response across several days during a general election campaign in which different parties took divergent positions on shale gas. Public support for the moratorium - and induced seismicity as the primary reason for its introduction - was evidenced by the national survey, yet coincided with scepticism about its timing, extent and motivation, as indicated by social media activity and local case interviews. For some publics, the moratorium was a ploy to ensure electoral support, embedded in public distrust. This study indicates the merits of a mixed-method approach to understand the psychological and institutional context of public responses to policy change as it unfolds over time, and discusses the longer term implications of politicised attitudes for energy transitions.

AB  - Uses of science by environmental justice (EJ) activists reflect struggles to challenge professional scientific expertise, achieve fair outcomes, and effectively participate in decision-making processes. This qualitative research analyses the relationship between citizen science and EJ in a new waste facility siting conflict in urban Los Angeles, namely connections between citizen science and four dimensions of EJ: fair distribution, respect and recognition, participation in decision-making, and community capabilities. Citizen science is one tactic in EJ, yet little research investigates its role in a new facility siting conflict, particularly in relation to multi-faceted EJ goals. The research reveals opportunities for individual empowerment and community capacity building using citizen science, and a small measure of improved respect and recognition for participants who brought their own knowledge, research, and voices to the table. At the same time, the work identifies limitations on citizen science to improve local participatory procedures and decision-making, which also constricted the achievement of outcomes most desired by the EJ group: to prevent approval and construction of the new waste facility. This paper argues that uses of citizen science contributed to partial achievement of EJ goals, while hindered by governance processes that call for public participation yet shield decision-makers from substantive engagement with the volume or content of that participation.

AB  - This paper analyzes the Environmental Genome Project (EGP), a new public health research initiative of the US National Institutes of Health that focuses on the role that gene-environment interactions play in disease causation. The public health goal of the EGP is to identify populations that may be genetically predisposed to contracting environmental illnesses such as cancer, asthma, and heart disease. This information about potential genetic susceptibility to disease is intended to be used to design public health policies to protect 'vulnerable' populations, i.e., low-income and poor communities of color who display disproportionately high rates of environmental illnesses. In this paper, I use a feminist-environmental justice lens to analyze the extent to which the EGP signifies the practice of biotechnology in 'the public interest' and whether it supports its stated goals of developing a progressive genetics/genomics tool to serve the aims of environmental justice. Based on interviews with scientists and activists, I discuss what many critics have identified as the genetic reductionism underlying the project. This critique by public interest scientists and women environmental justice activists argues that the EGP focuses more attention on discovering 'susceptibility genes' in 'vulnerable subpopulations' and less attention on the social, political, economic, and environmental factors that are productive of environmental health and illness.

AB  - This paper examines the intersectional, coalition politics forged by activists in US environmental justice and women's rights organisations. This coalitional politics articulates environmental and feminist concerns and rejects the limitations of a narrow-focused politics in favour of a more strategic, relational vision of social and environmental change. Framed by the Marxist-feminist concept of 'social reproduction', the analysis addresses the complex ways that globalised capitalism has transformed state and corporate responsibilities for social reproduction. The neoliberal policies of privatisation and deregulation have eroded the assurance of a liveable wage, affordable healthcare, decent education, breathable air, and clean water. Drawing on several examples from grassroots movements and community-based organisations, the essay discusses how diverse women activists conceptually link environmental justice and reproductive rights issues in their communities' struggles to sustain everyday life (or, to accomplish 'social reproduction'). The innovative coalition politics of organisations such as Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice and the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Coalition are generating dynamic 'living environmentalisms' with enough political vision and community 'groundedness' to build broadly-based social-environmental collaborations that stand a chance at compelling people to take stronger action to curb problems as big as global warming.

AB  - Tropical forests are posited to hold up to one-third of the solution to slow climate change. It is estimated that over two-hundred million "forest peoples"-including indigenous peoples and local communities-live within and depend upon tropical forests. To successfully mitigate climate change, we must find new forms of collaboration that meet the goals of forest-dependent communities for secure land rights, equitable participation in decision-making, and dignified livelihoods in conjunction with meeting commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, 34 subnational governments and 18 indigenous and local community organizations announced their endorsement of the "Guiding Principles for Collaboration between Subnational Governments, Indigenous Peoples, and Local Communities." The Guiding Principles of Collaboration (GPC) are a set of 13 universal tenets which lay out a blueprint for collaboration between subnational state actors, indigenous peoples and local communities to recognize rights, support livelihoods, strengthen participation of forest-dependent communities in decision-making, and protect indigenous and community environmental defenders within the context of joint action for climate change mitigation. Their implementation would advance the integration of climate justice in subnational efforts for forest conservation. Taking the GPC as a point of departure, we explore how jurisdictional approaches to sustainability can protect and enhance the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples (IP) and local communities (LC). We develop and apply a suite of indicators to assess existing conditions across 11 tropical forest jurisdictions toward meeting the commitments described in the GPC. Our findings suggest that while the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities are recognized within national legal frameworks, implementation and security of those rights is uneven across subnational jurisdictions. Participation of IP and LC is not yet formalized as part of jurisdictional climate change mitigation initiatives in most cases, limiting their potential to inform policy outcomes and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Monitoring the implementation of the GPC may foster greater accountability for commitments, as well as collective action and learning to support regional transformations to sustainability.

AB  - This paper advances the concept of waste formations as a way of thinking together processes of race, space, and waste in brownfield redevelopment projects. Defined as formerly industrial and contaminated properties, in the 1990s brownfields emerged as the grounds for new forms of urbanization and an emerging environmental remediation industry. Through their redevelopment, the twentieth century's urban wastelandsenvironmentally degraded, economically divested, and often racially markedhave become sites of investment, resignification, and value formation. The concept of waste formations provides a critical framework on the ways these socio-ecological transformations rework twentieth century urban inequalitiesin particular, the articulation of waste and toxic wasteand the ways they produce new geographies of environmental injustice through the displacement of toxic waste to newly waste-able spaces. This paper develops an analytic of waste formations and applies it to the process of brownfield redevelopment at the Hunters Point Shipyard in southeast San Francisco.

AB  - Understanding preferences for urban green infrastructure (UGI) and the factors responsible for these are very important for adequate provision and effective management of these vital components of the urban environment. There are however very few studies that provide insight into residents' preferences for UGI in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to examine residents' preferences for the different forms of UGI with green, tree, water and other features and the factors that influence these in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria. The data were obtained via a questionnaire survey of 1560 participants in the study area and analysed using descriptive statistics, MannWhitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests and multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that the participants generally showed more preferences for UGI with green features including green corridors, lawns, sports fields, parks and gardens than others. Variation in the participants' preferences for UGI was mainly due to differences in their local government area of residence. Nevertheless, the four top determinants of participants' preferences for the different forms of UGI were the environmental and health benefits and quality of UGI as well as the respondents' involvement in pro-green infrastructure activities in their neighbourhoods. The study conclude that urban planners should focus on strategies that maximise the environmental and health benefits and quality of green infrastructure and foster citizens' participation in the development and management of UGI in cities in Nigeria and others countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Water governance engages with complex collective action problems that typically involve a wide range of actors across multiple jurisdictions and large geographical areas. Scholars have conceptualised frameworks of collaborative and polycentric governance to reflect more democratic, devolved and diverse arrangements for governing complexity. What has often been overlooked, however, is the sociopolitical context of working with Indigenous nations and the distinct cultural and political perspectives they bring to polycentric water governance. Focusing on the Karuk Tribe in the Klamath Basin (western United States), this case study examines sovereignty and sustainability concerns that arise with collaborative, polycentric water governance initiatives that involve Indigenous nations. First, we leverage environmental justice frameworks to reveal tensions between collaborative, polycentric governance and social justice concerns. Second, using social network analysis, we examine Klamath water quality networks that involve the Karuk Tribe. Our analysis shows that the Karuk Tribe - as represented by five tribal natural resource managers - connected to 244 distinct organisations and 21 coalitions around water quality issues during the 2018/2019 study period. Social networks help us to visualise the labour required of tribal managers working on water quality issues across multiple centres of governance. Third, we develop the concept of networked sovereignty in water governance to consider both the opportunity and the burden that some Indigenous nations are taking on to advance self-determination in this moment of devolved governance - when tribal managers are building relationships with hundreds of agencies and organisations.

AB  - This paper argues that while research on deliberative democracy is burgeoning, there is relatively little attention paid to the contributions of civil society. Based on an interpretive conceptualization of deliberative democracy, this paper draws attention to the ways in which civil society organizations employ "storylines" about environmental issues and deliberative processes to shape deliberative policy making. It asks, how do civil society organizations promote storylines in the deliberative system to change policy? How do storylines constitute policy and policy-making processes in the deliberative system? I answer these questions through an empirical analysis of two environmental controversies in the USA: environmental justice in New Mexico and coalbed methane development in Wyoming. Findings indicate that civil society organizations used storylines in both cases to shift the dynamics of the deliberative system and to advance their own interpretations of environmental problems and policy-making processes. Specifically, they used storylines (1) to set the agenda on environmental hazards, (2) to construct the form of public deliberation, changing the rules of the game, (3) to construct the content of public deliberation, shaping meanings related to environmental policy, and (4) to couple/align forums, arenas and courts across the system. These findings suggest that promoting storylines through accommodation and selection processes can be an important mechanism for shaping policy meanings and for improving deliberative quality, although these effects are tempered by discursive and material forms of power, and the competition among alternative storylines.

AB  - This paper contributes to the understanding of transport disadvantage and the transport dimensions of environmental justice by investigating the travel behavior patterns of socially disadvantaged groups by using household travel survey data. The study described in this paper goes beyond determining the basic descriptive statistics that are commonly reported in this area of research and instead uses cluster analysis to identify socially disadvantaged households. The study then uses the six clusters generated by the analysis to identify the differences in the travel behaviors between these groups. The paper shows considerable differences in travel behavior between socially disadvantaged households that must be recognized if scholars and policy makers are to describe and respond adequately to the experience of transport disadvantage for these groups. The paper concludes with some comparative observations about the travel behavior of the disadvantaged population in dispersed rapidly growing regions and the wider implications for ensuring environmental justice in transport.

AB  - This study evaluated the hypothesis that urban-tree planting increases neighborhood gentrification in Portland, Oregon. We defined gentrification as an increase in the median sales price of single-family homes in a Census tract compared to other tracts in the city after accounting for differences in the housing stock such as house size and number of bathrooms. We used tree-planting data from the non-profit Friends of Trees, who have planted 57,985 yard and street trees in Portland (1990-2019). We estimated a mixed model of gentrification (30 years and 141 tracts) including random intercepts at the tract level and a first-order auto-regressive residual structure. Tract-level house prices and tree planting may be codetermined. Therefore, to address potential endogeneity of tree planting in statistical modeling, we lagged the number of trees planted by at least one year. We found that the number of trees planted in a tract was significantly associated with a higher tract-level median sales price, although it took at least six years for this relationship to emerge. Specifically, each tree was associated with a $131 (95% CI: $53-$210; p-value = 0.001) increase in tract-level median sales price six years after planting. The magnitude of the association between the number of trees planted and median sales price generally increased as the time lag lengthened. After twelve years, each tree was associated with a $265 (95% CI: $151-$379; p-value<0.001) increase in tract-level median sales price. Tree planting was not merely a proxy for existing tree cover, as the percent of a tract covered in tree canopy was independently associated with an increase in median sales price. Specifically, each 1-percentage point increase in tree-canopy cover was associated with a $882 (95% CI: $226-$1538; p-value = 0.008) increase in median sales price. In conclusion, tree planting is associated with neighborhood-level gentrification, although the magnitude of the association is modest.

AB  - We explored the possible future impacts of increased coastal flooding due to sea level rise and the potential adaptation responses of two urban, environmental justice communities in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts. East Boston is predominantly a residential area with some industrial and commercial activities, particularly along the coastal fringe. Everett, a city to the north of Boston, has a diversified industrial and commercial base. While these two communities have similar socioeconomic characteristics, they differ substantially in the extent to which residents would be impacted by increased coastal flooding. In East Boston, a large portion of residents would be flooded, while in Everett, it is the commercial/industrial districts that are primarily vulnerable. Through a series of workshops with residents in each community, we found that the target populations do not have an adaptation perspective or knowledge of any resources that could assist them in this challenge. Furthermore, they do not feel included in the planning processes within their communities. However, a common incentive for both communities was an intense commitment to their communities and an eagerness to learn more and become actively engaged in decisions regarding climate change adaptation. The lessons that can be applied to other studies include 1) images are powerful tools in communicating concepts, 2) understanding existing cultural knowledge and values in adaptation planning is essential to the planning process and 3) engaging local residents at the beginning of the process can create important educational opportunities and develop trust and consensus that is necessary for moving from concept to implementation.

AB  - Water is critical to protecting wetlands in arid regions, especially in agriculture-dominated watersheds. This comparative case study analyzes three federal wildlife refuges in the Bear River Basin of the U.S. West where refuge managers secured water supplies by adapting to their local environmental context and their refuge's relationship to agriculture in being either irrigation-dependent, reservoir-adjacent or diked-delta wetlands. We found that each refuge's position confers different opportunities for securing a water supply and entails unique management challenges linked to agricultural water uses. Acquiring contextually-appropriate water rights portfolios was important for protecting these arid region wetlands and was accomplished through various strategies. Once acquired, water is managed to buffer wetlands against fluctuations caused by a dynamic climate and agricultural demands, especially during droughts. Management plans are responsive to needs of neighboring water users and values of the public at large. Such context-specific adaptations will be critical as the West faces climate change and population growth that threaten wetlands and agricultural systems to which they are linked.

AB  - Vacant, abandoned or unproductive land parcels, sometimes called "wastelands", offer opportunities to create new green spaces in cities. Such spaces may be utilized to add to the stock of urban nature, expand recreational green space, promote real estate or commercial development, or simply remain undefined. These various trajectories have significant implications for population health, ecosystem services and real estate values. However, they may also contribute to inequitable outcomes. Are disadvantaged communities, which may be paradoxically rich in wastelands, more advantaged when green space redevelopment occurs, or are they more at risk of green gentrification and associated displacement? To address this question, we first review some of the literature relative to wastelands, especially as they relate to processes of urban change such as depopulation, land use planning, regrowth and gentrification. We utilize historical redlining maps, the Detroit Master Plan and projected land use scenarios from the Detroit Future City (DFC) Strategic Framework Plan to identify areas of vulnerability or possibility within walking distance of the proposed Joe Louis Greenway (JLG). Finally, we consider how wastelands situated along the JLG may be reframed as flexible opportunity spaces, their potential leveraged to advance environmental justice, economic opportunity, and social equity, especially as the City of Detroit takes socioeconomic and racial equity as a key orienting principle-an alternative to green gentrification that we call green reparations.

AB  - Under apartheid poor (black) people and the environment were viewed as antithetical. Poor communities were forcibly relocated to establish or expand game reserves and a range of militaristic interventions were imposed to 'protect nature', often at the expense of human rights.' The environment was overwhelmingly associated as the preserve of the (white) middle class and was preoccupied with saving plants and animals. Under the post-apartheid dispensation, broad environmental rights are constitutionally-entrenched alongside socio-economic rights. But, to what extent does this imply an amicable, or even an established relationship between environmental and socio-economic rights? This article seeks to begin to answer this question by examining first, the kinds of issues taken up and mobilisation pursued by nascent environmental justice movements such as the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance; and, second, the limits and opportunities of environmental litigation pursued by such movements to date.

AB  - We argue that a healthy urban forest contributes immensely to the sustainability of cities. The argument is based on a comprehensive array of values elicited from Canadians in several cities. To begin, we define the urban forest as inclusive of all the trees in the city and thus representing the predominant contributor to a city's green infrastructure. Then we enumerate and explain the broad diversity of ways in which urban people value trees in the city. We, thus, show the myriad pathways by which trees contribute positively to any city's social, economic, and ecological sustainability. Following a short summary of the ways in which trees may detract from people's quality of life, we present promising management directions for urban-forest improvement, as we understand the situation in Canada. We conclude that all cities can enhance their sustainability by improving the urban forest.

AB  - While it is widely recognised that the impacts of both climate change and the policy response will be distributed, there is an absence of complete information regarding the socio-economic and geographic patterning of such impacts in the intra-national context. This paper seeks to address this gap, presenting a climate justice toolkit (indicator set and guidance) that enables the consistent assessment of distributional impacts of climate policy, and thus allows cumulative impacts to be assessed across the broad suites of policies that comprise national adaptation programmes. The objective in so doing is to inform the selection of appropriate policy options and to identify situations where supplementary policy may be required to redress negative or inequitable impacts. Drawing on a pilot impact assessment of the Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme, this paper discusses the rationale behind the development of a climate justice indicator set and presents a guide to the screening of large policy suites for potential cumulative impacts across communities of living (households) and working (private and public sectors). The methodological perspectives discussed can be useful in studies of climate change and social issues elsewhere, particularly in assessing the likely 'winners' and 'losers' of policy implementations.

AB  - Youth perspectives on energy interventions are rarely sought or acted on in local and national policy, despite the stake young people have in the future created by today's energy and environmental policies. The debate on unconventional shale gas development (hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking") is one context in which decisions taken today have long-term, intergenerational consequences, with environmental justice intersecting with energy needs. This study investigated young people's perceptions and experiences of exploratory fracking and associated political processes in order to understand their experiences of environmental justice. In depth, qualitative field research was conducted with 84 young people in locations within 20 miles (32 kilometers) of operational exploratory fracking sites prior to the moratorium in England announced in November 2019. Data were analysed with attention to recognition, participation and distributional justice. Young people experienced environmental, democratic and social injustices through lack of recognition of their aims and values as both youth and members of a rural community, and exclusion from formal participation in decision-making. Young people saw economic and thus environmental power residing with industry closely tied to national government, and experienced a tension between desire to trust institutional authority and betrayal by these same institutions. We argue that this case study of young people in "the sacrifice zone" demonstrates a connection between depoliticisation and anti-politics, and that these processes undermine trust in democracy. There is a need for recognition and meaningful inclusion of young people and local communities in decision-making, particularly where the consequences of the decisions last for generations.

AB  - This research focuses on three major challenges of incorporating environmental justice into metropolitan transportation planning. The data needed are compared with the data currently available on the spatial distributions of race and income, the spatial distributions of trip ends, trip tables, network performance, and cost estimates of improvements. Several conflicting definitions of equity are offered, as are applications for each within the context of environmental justice. The importance of choosing a correct unit of analysis is discussed, with particular emphasis on how the geographic unit of analysis is a poor proxy for the group unit, which is theoretically required, as the analysis's purpose is to compare performance measures across groups. The primary goal of this paper is to explore challenging topics such as these raising questions and concerns. The answers to the questions raised will differ depending on each implementing agency's objectives and resources.

AB  - When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice. A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc. ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'. Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice. Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics. After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world. In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP. As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects. We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'. Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health. European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making. In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place. On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action. Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.

AB  - This commentary examines environmental conservation work as a site of climate (in)justice, drawing from fieldwork at a highly multilingual Cameroonian wildlife sanctuary, as well as prior work on linguistic diversity, language ideologies, and intercultural communication. Across the world, climate justice work is occurring in landscapes that are often linguistically diverse. Alongside indigenous languages, global lingua francas (predominantly (ex)-colonial languages) play a central role in facilitating communication between government officials, foreign NGO workers and volunteers, and people living in areas undergoing conservation. In these contexts, beliefs about language and communication - as well as unequal access or fluency in particular languages - can serve to magnify racialized and (neo)colonial hierarchies. While work in environmental anthropology has taken an ethnographic approach to understanding conflicts and miscommunication between the different actors involved in environmental conservation, this commentary argues that the methodologies of sociolinguistics and related fields are uniquely situated to examine in detail the interactions, language choices, and ideologies involved in designing and implementing climate justice work, and the impact these have on how this work is carried out.

AB  - Today, more regulatory provisions are in place for protecting low-income minority populations who shoulder a disproportionate amount of environmental risk. Recognized as communities of "environmental justice," industrial facilities located within these areas bear greater legal liabilities for and societal scrutiny of their environmental impacts. The authors off er compelling evidence that, in an effort to avoid regulatory and societal claims that they are disproportionately harming minority and ethnic populations, businesses operating inside environmental justice communities tend to adopt an environmental management system ( EMS). The article probes whether industries actually improve the environment as a consequence of EMS adoption or whether such systems are simply used to avoid greater governmental scrutiny without necessarily reducing overall environmental risks.

AB  - This overview adopts a critical social science perspective to examine the state of play and potential futures for coal in the context of climate change. It introduces key trends in coal consumption, production and trade, before reviewing the relevant literature. Finding surprisingly little literature directly focused on coal and climate change, it appraises existing work and highlights key areas for future research. In addition to established literatures on the situated politics of coal and the political economy of coal, new work calling for demand side policies to be supplemented with supply side policies highlights the increasing importance of normative contestations in driving debates over coal. This suggests that scholars must engage much more directly with climate change as an issue, and particularly with the place of coal in a just transition. Because of coal's mammoth contribution to climate change and the complex political economy which drives its production and consumption, it is likely that coal will remain at the center of difficult questions about the relationship between climate action and development for quite some time.

AB  - This paper describes a multi-stakeholder process designed to assess the potential health risks associated with adverse air quality in an urban industrial neighborhood. The paper briefly describes the quantitative health risk assessment conducted by scientific experts, with input by a grassroots community group concerned about the impacts of adverse air quality on their health and quality of life. In this case, rather than accept the views of the scientific experts, the community used their powers of perception to advantage by successfully advocating for a professionally conducted community health survey. This survey was designed to document, systematically and rigorously, the health risk perceptions community members associated with exposure to adverse air quality in their neighborhood. This paper describes the institutional and community contexts within which the research is situated as well as the design, administration, analysis, and results of the community health survey administered to 402 households living in an urban industrial neighborhood in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. These survey results served to legitimate the community's concerns about air quality and to help broaden operational definitions of 'health.' In addition, the results of both health risk assessment exercises served to keep issues of air quality on the local political agenda. Implications of these findings for our understanding of the environmental justice process as well as the ability of communities to influence environmental health policy are discussed.

AB  - This study tests whether the effect of a vaccine trial varies in space and why. Analytical z-score maps identify unusually high- and low-efficacy values in a trial area. Relationships between neighborhood efficacy and ecological variables are measured to explain why efficacy varies in space. Efficacy was found to vary regardless of neighborhood size and the variation is related to several ecological determinants. Local efficacy measures can help public health practitioners make better decisions about when and where to vaccinate populations. The concepts offered in this study are pertinent for any health intervention trial, not just vaccines. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While resilience has grown to become a well-established goal of policy and practice, assessing resilience remains an outstanding problem. To date, measurement has largely relied on the identification of proxy indicators, inevitably shaping what is measured in ways that reflect underlying assumptions, generalisations and approximations, and raising the question of whose values are being embedded into resilience. These concerns reflect recent interest in the role of recognition justice in resilience, and in particular how marginalisation from meaning-making processes creates the conditions for the inequitable distribution of outcomes in practice. Here, we propose a two stage, subjective approach to resilience assessment, starting with rapid household interviews that invite participants to assess the likely impact of multiple shock and stressor storylines. In a second step, participatory qualitative methods are employed to support inductive investigation of resilience focused on the factors that differentiate those reporting relatively high and low resilience. We illustrate this using fieldwork data from 569 households in Bangladesh. This subjective approach enables households to engage in the production of knowledge about their resilience, revealing two core features of situated heterogeneity: the forms of difference, and the underlying causes. Underlying causes arise from interactions and feedbacks between social, political, economic and institutional conditions that are highly context specific, while significant forms of difference include intra-community and scalar heterogeneity; vulnerability to specific or generalised shocks; and the role of undesirable practices in securing resilience. The results underline the need for resilience to be assessed in relation to local understandings of precarity, and through the expression of senses of justice that inform local conceptions of wellbeing. This means moving beyond positivist approaches and placing epistemic diversity at the centre of resilience assessment, enabling the production of a situated understanding of how and why resilience is differentiated, and offering an analytical starting point from which policy and practice can drive towards equitable resilience.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide multiple ecosystem services to city residents and are considered an important element of socio-environmental justice. For older people, urban green spaces are important for health and well-being because they provide spaces for physical activity and social interaction. They can be regarded as spaces of encounter. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of park visitation patterns, demographic characteristics and social network patterns, we explore older people's urban green space visitation patterns for the case of Berlin (Germany). We found that older people who have close social networks use urban parks more often than those who are more isolated in their daily lives. Self-estimated good health also contributes to more frequent park use. We discuss these findings along the three dimensions of socio-environmental justice: distributive, interactional and procedural. Based on our findings, we develop a framework that calls for an integrated view of these three justice dimensions, which all contribute equally and inseparably to a just provision of urban ecosystem services. Most importantly, we recommend urban planning to understand the city as an integrated socio-ecological system in which the planning and design of urban green spaces focus on providing ecosystem services together with enabling the creation of social networks in order to increase socio-environmental justice.

AB  - Transportation infrastructure tremendously affects the quality of life for urban residents, influences public and mental health, and shapes social relations. Historically, the topic is rich with social and political controversy and the resultant transit systems in the United States cause problems for minority residents and issues for the public. Environmental justice frameworks provide a means to identify and address harms that affect marginalized groups, but environmental justice has limits that cannot account for the mainstream population. To account for this condition, I employ a complex moral assessment measure that provides a way to talk about harms that affect the public.

AB  - This chapter examines aspects of public interest and social justice in the delivery of the Adelaide Desalination Plant, one of the major forms of water infrastructure built during Australia's Millennium Drought under a partnership agreement between public representatives (the state government) and the private sector. Under the current neoliberal paradigm and the associated market-based governance reforms, a new wave of discussion has emerged around the increasing role of the private sector in the provision of public infrastructure and services. The question is to what extent the benefits of such partnerships are equally distributed between various parties, which therefore result in outcomes that are perceived to be 'just'. With an intention to provide a view on this issue, this chapter operationalises the concept of 'public interest' using a conceptual framework for 'good governance' involving four important elements: accountability and transparency; public participation and inclusiveness; efficiency; and ownership of public assets and resources. The findings provide useful empirical insights into the notion of the public interest in partnerships between the public and private sectors.

AB  - This study analyzes the social and geographic distribution of ecological hazards across 368 communities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Combining census data with a variety of environmental data, we tested for and identified both income-based and racially based biases to the geographic distribution of 17 different types of environmentally hazardous sites and industrial facilities. We also developed a composite measure of cumulative exposure to compare the relative overall risks characteristic of each community. To the best of our knowledge, this point system makes this the first environmental justice study to develop a means for measuring and ranking cumulative exposure for communities. The study also controls for the intensity of hazards in each Community by accounting for the area across which hazards are distributed. The findings indicate that ecologically hazardous sites and facilities are disproportionately located and concentrated in communities of color and working-class communities. The implication of this research for policy-makers and citizen advocates is that cumulative exposure of residents to environmentally hazardous facilities and sites should receive greater consideration regarding community demographics and environmental health indicators. We conclude that the provision of additional resources for environmental monitoring and ranking, as well as yearly, progress reports, is necessary for communities and state agencies to achieve equal access to clean and healthy environments for all residents.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure provides a range of experiences for people and various health benefits that support human well-being. To increase urban resilience, exceptional situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are important to learn from. This study aims to understand how the residents in Turku, a middle-sized city in Finland, perceived their outdoor recreation changed and how nature contributed to their subjective well-being during the early phases of the COVID-19. Sites of outdoor recreation and associated ecosystem service benefits were gathered through a map-based survey. In addition, the contribution of nature on subjective well-being was measured through Likert scale statements and the perceived changes in outdoor recreation behaviour were measured through self-reported number of days and from responses to open survey questions. Data was analysed through quantitative, qualitative and spatial methods. The results show that nearly half of the respondents increased outdoor recreation and the majority of outdoor recreation sites were visited more or as often as before the pandemic. The spatial analysis revealed that the most often visited recreation sites were near forests, semi-natural areas and housing areas as well as relatively close to respondent's residence. Respondents had various reasons for changes in outdoor recreation behaviour. For some a shift to working remotely and changes in everyday routines led to spending time outdoors more often and for some spending less while others avoided recreation in crowded areas due to social distancing. The results also indicate that people's opportunities to adapt to the pandemic conditions differ greatly. The nature's contribution to subjective well-being during COVID-19 was important regardless of respondent's outdoor recreation behaviour. Our study highlights that urban planning should respond to different needs for outdoor recreation in order to widely, and in a just way, promote the well-being benefits of urban nature during a pandemic, and to increase the resilience of the city and its residents. Participatory mapping can capture the variety in resident's values and identify key recreation sites of multiple ecosystem service benefits.

AB  - Urban Environmental Quality (UEQ) can be treated as a generic indicator that objectively represents the physical and socio-economic condition of the urban and built environment. The value of UEQ illustrates a sense of satisfaction to its population through assessing different environmental, urban and socio-economic parameters. This paper elucidates the use of the Geographic Information System (GIS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Geographically-Weighted Regression (GWR) techniques to integrate various parameters and estimate the UEQ of two major cities in Ontario, Canada. Remote sensing, GIS and census data were first obtained to derive various environmental, urban and socio-economic parameters. The aforementioned techniques were used to integrate all of these environmental, urban and socio-economic parameters. Three key indicators, including family income, higher level of education and land value, were used as a reference to validate the outcomes derived from the integration techniques. The results were evaluated by assessing the relationship between the extracted UEQ results and the reference layers. Initial findings showed that the GWR with the spatial lag model represents an improved precision and accuracy by up to 20% with respect to those derived by using GIS overlay and PCA techniques for the City of Toronto and the City of Ottawa. The findings of the research can help the authorities and decision makers to understand the empirical relationships among environmental factors, urban morphology and real estate and decide for more environmental justice.

AB  - This paper examines how issues of environmental citizenship play out in the context of an industrial waste facility siting controversy in Taipei, Taiwan, and the implications of this complex predicament for justice and sustainable development generally. It shows the ways in which local activists perceive the adverse effects of a development project that generates industrial waste and incinerator ash in their hometown. Local activists feel excluded from decision-making and frustrated by the lack of recognition by authorities. They complain that their local, contextualized knowledge and experiences are ignored. Local activists are concerned about ecological devastation and feel responsible for future generations. Instead of a NIMBY protest of selfish residents, local activists imagine themselves as active citizens fighting for justice and sustainability on a scale beyond their neighborhood. The case highlights the needs for institutional transparency, the recognition of multiple ways of knowing and new conceptions of the good life, Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Using Barcelona and Shanghai as case studies, we examined the nature-based solutions (NBS) in urban settings specifically within cities experiencing post-industrialization and globalization. Our specific research questions are: (1) What are the spatiotemporal changes in urban built-up land and green space in Barcelona and Shanghai? (2) What are the relationships between economic development, exemplified by post-industrialization, globalization, and urban green space? Urban land use and green space change were evaluated using data derived from a variety of sources, including satellite images, landscape matrix indicators, and a land conversion matrix. The relationships between economic development, globalization, and environmental quality were analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling based on secondary statistical data. Both Barcelona and Shanghai have undergone rapid urbanization, with urban expansion in Barcelona beginning in the 1960s-1970s and in Shanghai in the last decade. While Barcelona's urban green space and green space per capita began declining between the 1950s and 1990s, they increased slightly over the past two decades. Shanghai, however, has consistently and significantly improved urban green space and green space per capita over the past six decades, especially since the economic reform in 1978. Economic development has a direct and significant influence on urban green space for both cities and post-industrialization had served as the main driving force for urban landscape change in Barcelona and Shanghai. Based on secondary statistical and qualitative data from on-site observations and interviews with local experts, we highlighted the institution's role in NBS planning. Furthermore, aspiration to become a global or globalizing city motivated both cities to use NBS planning as a place-making tool to attract global investment, which is reflected in various governing policies and regulations. The cities' effort to achieve a higher status in the global city hierarchy may have contributed to the increase in total green space and urban green per capita. In addition, various institutional shifts, such as land property rights in a market economy vs. a transitional economy, may also have contributed to the differences in efficiency when expanding urban green space in Barcelona and Shanghai.

AB  - We studied the accessibility of public urban green spaces in the context of rapid land transformation within the urban periphery. By using Shanghai, China as a case study, we illustrated how to evaluate the access to public green spaces of an urban periphery and how planning processes can influence the improvement of such access. We constructed a composite index named the "green accessibility index" (GAI), which measures how well residents are treated in terms of access to different types of public urban green spaces. Shanghai and its districts have improved their green accessibility index from 2000 to 2010. However, the GAI in the urban periphery fell behind the city average. Furthermore, while the inner suburbs, especially Pudong and Baoshan, had fared quite well in green accessibility improvement, outer suburbs made moderate progress in comparison to the city average. We identified hot/cold spots and spatial clustering that had a high/low green accessibility index in the urban periphery. The cold spots are in urgent need of substantial improvements to green space accessibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to characterize the spatial variations in, and examine the influence of socio-economic class on, the exposure of urban population of Hong Kong to air pollution from vehicular sources. Hong Kong provides a unique and interesting case for an in-depth study of environmental inequality because of its dense environment and housing provision mechanism through which about half of the population is accommodated in public housing estates provided by the government. To estimate the exposure of the urban population to vehicular air pollution, the IMMISnet air dispersion model developed for city-wide air quality assessment was used. The annual mean concentrations of CO, NOx. SO2 and PM10 were estimated for various assessment points of 275 public and 295 private building groups. The results show more pronounced inequality among residents living in private than in public housing estates. Elderly people and those of lower socio-economic status were found to be exposed to relatively higher levels of vehicular air pollution compared with groups of higher socio-economic status. However, when all the residents in Hong Kong were pooled together for analysis, no distinct class-biased patterns were found. This could be ascribed to the housing provision mechanism, in which less well-off people are accommodated in public housing estates where the air quality is relatively better. This study highlights the importance of government intervention in housing provision, through which the deprived groups in Hong Kong are inadvertently more protected from air pollution exposure.

AB  - To assess the geographical patterns of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence and to identify the risk factors on the regional differences, the authors conducted an ecological study on incidence of ESRD and related risk factors in the 46 counties of South Carolina (SC). Age and gender adjusted, race specific incidence rates for each county in SC were calculated for the 11,346 ESRD patients of all ages who registered in the United States Renal Data Systems Network 6 from 1990 to 1999. County level exposure measures on population physician density, hospitalization rates of diabetes and hypertension, per capita income, percent college degree, and percent below poverty were evaluated. There was a significant increase in mean incidence rates of ESRD from 1990 to 1999 in SC (p < 0.0001). The incidence rates were consistently higher in rural than in urban counties. Population physician density (relative risk (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (95% Cl, 0.41-0.58) and rural residence (adjusted RR 1.66, 95% Cl 1.59-1.74) were significantly associated with ESRD incidence. The strong relationship between ESRD and physician density suggests that access to adequate treatment of diabetes and hypertension is of paramount importance for ESRD prevention, and has important public policy implications.

AB  - This study represents an initial attempt to examine environmental justice on inequalities in access to ecological attractions that provide top cultural ecosystem services at a national scale. With big data from social media, billions of anonymized samples were analysed via an experimental procedure to capture the behavioral characteristics of visitors who accessed China's Five-A ecological attractions. The results indicate that (1) social equity can be achieved in the context of ecosystem services in China, especially at the individual level; and (2) although China's vulnerable groups do not appear to have been treated unfairly, market mechanisms may exacerbate the inequitable development of ecosystem services among different regions. To address the problem of inequality and uneven development on ecosystem services that may result from the capital, the government should take measures to reduce the accessibility threshold and consider providing appropriate green infrastructure for different social groups apart from Five-A ecological attractions.

AB  - We are all challenged today to deal with an unprecedented set of issues that are manifested in climate change, violence, poverty, rising inequality, resource depletion, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and species extinction to name just a few. The responsibility for many of these pervasive problems has been placed at the door of an economic system that does not account for the negative externalities it generates and has a penchant for uncontrolled consumption and growth. The global population that now stands at about 7.5 billion is projected to grow to approximately 9.7 billion by the year 2050 and the likelihood of our finite planet adequately providing for a population of that size seems remote. It is in this context that important questions about role of business in the context of social, environmental, and inter-generational justice need to be answered. The sustainability movement has gained tremendous momentum in the last few years, with many calling for a paradigm shift in the purpose and functioning of the business sector. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the sustainability movement in business including the formation of the United Nations Global Compact and its academic counter-part, the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education (UNPRME). In particular, while many advocates for sustainability have used the notion of the business case as their primary argument, this paper will argue that a paradigm shift calls for a reexamination of the fundamental principles and values of business focusing on responsibilities not only toward shareholders, but also toward all stakeholders including those who are often invisible and voiceless. The paper focuses on the management challenges that both businesses and business schools that will need to address to not only ensure our survival as a species, but also that all species on the planet will flourish forever.

AB  - Women in India perform a range of roles in wheat-based agricultural systems. However, data remain sparse. Cultural norms which construct men as farmers serve to conceal women's contributions from researchers and rural advisory services. We use data from communities in four Indian states, selected to exemplify high and low gender gaps, to provide insights into how women are challenging norms which privilege male decision-making in order to participate in innovation processes. We hypothesized the transitioning of women from labourers in wheat to innovators and managers of wheat is likely to be far from straightforward. We further hypothesized that women are actively managing the processes unleashed by various sources of change. We use the concept of doxa-ideas and actions in a society that are taken for granted and are beyond questioning-as an analytic lens to help us understand the ways in which women deploy their agency to secure their goals. Our analysis allows us to develop a 'A typology of women's strategies to strengthen their managerial decision-making power in wheat'.

AB  - To address community-driven concerns about lead-contaminated drinking water in residential homes in the Greater Fifth Ward neighborhood in Northeast Houston, Texas utilizing participatory-based research. The study collected survey data and performed lead analysis on drinking water from residents' homes. The Greater Fifth Ward is characterized as a majority-minority environmental justice community and is located within two confirmed cancer clusters. The residents of 172 homes completed a survey and had detectable lead levels in their water samples. Survey results indicated that more than half of the residents (58.2%) were concerned with the water quality and 42.9% rated the drinking water as poor. Water lead levels detected ranged from 0.01 to 22 mu g/L. 10.9% of homes exceeding 1 mu g/L, and one located exceeded the USEPA's action limit of 15 mu g/L. Homes built prior to 1978 without major renovation had significantly higher levels of lead in their drinking water compared to homes built after 1978 (p-value < 0.05). These findings demonstrate the need for lead testing of residential water in low socioeconomic-status communities, as well as demonstrating the benefits of community engagement and participatory research to address environmental health concerns.

AB  - This paper presents France's relation to climate change from the perspectives of the French overseas territories: the Outre-mer. Scattered across the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, these formerly colonized territories are subnational jurisdictions of France. Through examining their greenhouse gas emissions, their ecological importance, their economic conditions, as well as their policies, I argue that understanding the Outre-mer climate change perspectives demands an epistemic shift characterized by two theoretical gestures. Firstly, the Outre-mer perspectives require moving beyond the single geographical imaginary of France that only represents its European mainland. Contributing very little to France's greenhouse gas emissions, these territories are particularly exposed and particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, making the case for a subnational climate justice. Secondly, beyond their portrayal as foreign and voiceless victims, the Outre-mer perspectives also recognize the presence of postcolonial subjects as political and historical actors facing climate change, calling forcefully for postcolonial equality and social justice.

AB  - This paper and the proposed formulation contribute to an apparent gap in transit research design by integrating equity considerations into the transit frequency-setting problem. The proposed approach provides a means to design transit service such that equitable access to basic amenities (e.g., employment, supermarkets, medical services) is provided for low-income populations or disadvantaged populations. The overarching purpose is to improve access via transit to basic amenities to: (1) reduce the disproportionate burden faced by transit dependent populations; and (2) create a more feasible transportation option for low-income households as an opportunity to increase financial security by reducing dependence on personal autos. The formulation is applied to data from a mid-sized US metropolitan area. The example application illustrates the formulation successfully increases access to employment opportunities for residents in areas with high percentages of low-income persons, as well as demonstrates the importance of considering uncertainty in the locations of populations and employment.

AB  - Vegetation within cities is key for urban sustainability, as it provides several ecosystem services positively influencing the urban quality of life. However, urban vegetation is often unevenly distributed within cities, typically concentrating the large proportion of vegetated areas in more affluent neighborhoods. Thus, developing strategies for reducing urban vegetation inequalities is fundamental to fostering more sustainable cities. Since schools are widely distributed in urban areas, they could be key for decreasing vegetation inequalities, in particular, if schools' precincts in lower-income areas are managed to contain high levels of vegetation. Nevertheless, studies analyzing the potential role of schools in ameliorating vegetation inequalities in cities are largely missing in the literature. In this study we use remote sensing techniques to estimate the vegetation cover of 1579 schools and their surrounding areas in Santiago-Chile, aiming to evaluate whether vegetation within schools is helping to mitigate the high levels of vegetation inequalities characteristic of this city. We performed the analysis for public, subsidized and private schools, for the whole city and each of the 34 municipalities comprising the city. Our results show that schools are not helping to mitigate vegetation inequalities, but they tend to replicate the unequal distribution of vegetation within Santiago. This pattern holds whether the analysis is made for all schools or each of the three school types independently, and is also a prevalent pattern when the assessment is performed at the municipal level. Private schools, usually located in greener more affluent areas of the city, have significant larger proportion of vegetation, revealing that high-income students do not only live in greener neighborhoods but also have access to greener schools. These results reveal how deeply rooted in some cities are vegetation inequalities, and the urgency of modifying public policies related to how vegetation within schools is funded, planned and managed.

AB  - Whether or not alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) will finally find a place in the global mass-market or even will dominate the vehicle segment will depend on several success factors: reduction of customer anxiety, fast recharging, better charging infrastructure, environmental justice policies and some others. Current technological advances in battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuelled electric vehicles could represent a hopefully option in the near future. Nevertheless, and until electric/hydrogen technological barriers are not torn down, both power architecture do not have an opportunity to be fully introduced in the vehicle market. In this paper, the authors present a powertrain architecture concept based in current fossil fuel extender range, but changing it to a hydrogen fuel cell stack system that works as range extender. The objective is to probe how optimization techniques, by the inclusion of genetic algorithms, could be a crucial help when planning the fuel consumption/selection. The paper ambition is to highlight the possibilities of this powertrain and its appropriated management to allow hydrogen become an energy carrier feasible today in the automotive world.

AB  - zCommunity gardens vary enormously in what they offer, according to local needs and circumstance. This article reports on research and experience from the USA. The context in which these findings are discussed is the implementation of Local Agenda 21 and sustainable development policies. In particular, emphasis is given to exploring the social dimension of sustainable development policies by linking issues of health, education, community development and food security with the use of green space in towns and cities. The article concludes that the use of urban open spaces for parks and gardens is closely associated with environmental justice and equity.

AB  - This paper explores the environmental inequalities of living in the floodplains of England and Wales and the differences in flood awareness of those at risk. An area comparison is made between an etic, objective flood risk exposure, and an emic, subjective perception of that risk by social class. In all areas except the Midlands, the working classes were more likely to reside in the floodplains; the greatest exposure inequality is seen in the North East and Anglian regions. Flood awareness in the Anglian regions was much lower than average, but there were no significant class differences. In the Thames region, despite equal flood risk exposure between classes, the most deprived displayed the least awareness of flood risk. In the North East, inequalities in the distribution of flood risk exposure accompanied inequalities in perception, resulting in the least aware and most deprived experiencing the greatest flood risk.

AB  - This study investigates transportation disadvantage (TD) and its impact on social exclusion among lower-income older adults (n = 10) through the use of a custom-designed daily transportation diary app, MyAmble. The study utilized an ecological momentary assessment design using the Travel Buddy, which was the qualitative feature of MyAmble. The Travel Buddy allowed study participants to share their transportation experiences as they relate to the following domains of social exclusion: quality of life, participation, and resources. Conventional content analysis revealed five primary themes related to TD and social exclusion: constrained autononmy and flexibility, safety concerns, dimished emotional well-being, barriers to community engagement, and burdensome. The Travel Buddy produced qualitative data that contextualize lost opportunities and how characteristics of economic justice exacerbate the risk of TD, as well as how individuals manage within these intersections of disadvantage. Study findings provide insight for expanded conversations about how to transform transportation planning from mobility to equity. Finally, the use of ecological momentary assessment through digital platforms such as the Travel Buddy offer an innovative way to collect holistic data related to TD that will lead to better opportunities for transportation planners, engineers, and social service providers to work together to address the needs of environmental justice populations, including lower-income older adults.

AB  - This paper focuses on community engagement, and particularly the inclusion of women, in water management as a response to climate change. Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012).

AB  - We employ infrastructuring as a verb to highlight contested processes of infrastructure expansion to extract, store, transport, and transform natural gas (into liquefied natural gas, LNG). As faculty members and students embedded in mid-Atlantic universities in the United States (US), we conducted participatory action research to record nearby infrastructuring for Dominion Energy's Cove Point LNG Export Terminal and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We documented how frontline and impacted populations seized opportunities when infrastructuring was visible to challenge and erode the excessive economic and political power of Dominion, one of the US's largest energy providers, who sought to maintain regulatory privilege through lobbying, campaign contributions, and delegitimization of public health and environmental risks. Extending Tsing's concept of frictions (i.e., engagement in difference-based encounters), we highlight (1) coalition-building among unlikely allies (collective encounters), and (2) conflictive interactions between proand anti-gas stakeholders (oppositional encounters). Impacted populations collaborated with proximate and distant allies to publicize and legally challenge distributional, regulatory, racial and other forms of injustice from gas infrastructuring. Our critical energy justice (CEJ) framework helps to identity and defend interconnected components of justice under threat due to profit-oriented global gas infrastructuring based upon reckless disregard for climate science and public health.

AB  - This review looks at the issue of water commodification, and how such an issue is approached by philosophy and geography. I bring up recent geographical literature that examines water commodification, and then I proceed to explain water commodification through the scope of philosophy. I argue that David Schlosberg, Avery Kolers, and Iris Marion Young are a few of the philosophers that can improve the study of water commodification by way of their investigations of power and empowerment, and they can combat water commodification. I also assert that philosophy and geography are complimentary studies, and it is mutually beneficial for both studies to engage each other. Philosophy, and specifically ethics, provides normativity, while geography can provide the necessary descriptive, qualitative, and quantitative elements which can lead to change in the real world through ethical norms.

Using a spatial analysis method called Ripley's K we assess environmental justice across multiple spatial scales, and we verify and quantify the West Oakland neighborhood as an environmental justice site as designated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Further, we integrate the ISCST3 air dispersion model with Geographic Information Systems (GIs) to identify the number of people potentially affected by a particular facility, and engage the problem of non-point sources of diesel emissions with an analysis of the street network.

AB  - This paper traces the development of the slaughterhouse as a specialized institution through three major periods. The,first began with increasing concerns about animal slaughtering in the eighteenth century and resulted in "public slaughterhouse" reforms, which marked the beginning of the concentration of animal slaughter and its movement away from the gaze of the public. Second, slaughterhouses became industrialized, as exemplified by the development of the notorious Union Stockyard in Chicago during the late nineteenth century. Finally, during the latter part of the twentieth century slaughterhouses in the United States were relocated to small rural communities, which began to exhibit negative consequences. This paper represents a modest step in developing an historical understanding of the slaughterhouse as a unique institution and moving towards an understanding of the consequences of modern slaughterhouses in what Bulliet (2005) refers to as "postdomestic" societies.

AB  - This chapter examines the theory of the 'environmentalism of the poor' proposed by Catalan ecological economist Joan Martinez-Alier and Indian historian Ramachandra Guha. The authors identify two types of environmentalism: one ideological and based on values, found in countries of the global North, and the other materialistic and based on interests, found in the poor countries of the global South. The chapter also offers a critical analysis of the concept of `environmental conflict', a key element in the theory of the environmentalism of the poor, and finally an assessment of the relationship between the environmentalism of the poor, environmental conflict and the broad concept of `environmental justice'.

AB  - This chapter considers the impact of ongoing changes in the news media landscape on the ability of media to adequately report complex issues - the "big issues" of our time. Specifically, it considers both the limitations and new opportunities that the digitisation of news content presents for the quality coverage of complex social and political issues, such as environmental crises. The chapter questions what conditions now exist in the media system for environmental issues and specifically climate justice to be presented accurately to the public, and with purpose. This discussion is informed by a focused case study on the journalistic performance of an independent online media outlet, The Guardian Australia. The Guardian's "Keep it in the Ground" climate change campaign epitomises advocacy forms of journalism that are motivated by and designed to deliver social change.

AB  - Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and urban forests have recently become topics of increasing interest in the social sciences. While social and environmental justice concerns have been applied to each of these topics individually, this paper addresses VGI, urban forests, and social justice simultaneously. VGI has often been hailed as an empowering and democratic new form of citizen science that allows data collection tasks to be distributed to a large group of people; however, concerns have emerged about whose geographies will be volunteered, and for what purpose. This research addresses these concerns, with an understanding that VGI has the potential to strengthen, rather than dissolve the digital divide. This is accomplished by determining the completeness of coverage of user-generated urban forest mapping on the interactive website PhillyTreeMap (http://www.phillytreemap.org/) by comparing it with high resolution remotely sensed canopy coverage data. These coverage levels are then regressed against Census demographic data at the block group level to determine if there are inequities in the coverage of this urban forest VGI project based upon socioeconomic status. Results indicate that sociodemographic variables influence the likelihood of increased coverage of the VGI urban forest data, presenting equity concerns surrounding the coverage of this VGI urban forest data. The presence of these social and environmental justice concerns indicates the need for expanded research into this new frontier of geographic data. Geographically weighted general linear models show non-stationarity in the relationships between VGI coverage and sociodemographic predictors, demonstrating the importance of incorporating local models.

AB  - This paper examines levels and trends of urban-rural differentials in child malnutrition, and investigates whether residual differences exist between urban and rural areas, given comparable measures of socioeconomic status (SES) of households and communities. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys of 15 sub-Saharan African countries, and multilevel modelling, it shows that urban-rural differentials are considerable in all countries, that they have narrowed in most countries due primarily to an increase in urban malnutrition, and have widened in few countries as a result of sharp decline in urban malnutrition. These urban-rural gaps are abolished in almost all countries when SES is controlled. These results suggest that policies and programs contributing to the attainment of the MDGs should pay particular attention to the urban poor. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper builds on the literature on green grabbing. It makes a fresh contribution by bringing in aspects of green grabbing that are less visible and obvious. These are subtle, fluid and indirect interconnections between climate change politics and land grabs. It is difficult to see these interconnections from an 'either black or white' perspective. It is likely that the extent of this 'grey area' intersection in terms of affected social relations, nature and land use change is quite significant globally, even when such interconnections tend to operate below the radar of dominant governance institutions and database tracking. This situation calls for more nuanced understanding of governance imperatives, and for constructing the necessary body of knowledge needed for appropriate political intervention. This paper offers preliminary ways in which such interconnections can be seen and understood, and their implications for research and politics explored. It concludes by way of a preliminary discussion of the notion of 'agrarian climate justice' as a possible framework for formal governance or political activism relevant to tackling such grey area interconnections.

AB  - This paper draws on a series of applied theatre and popular education workshops in Glasgow, Scotland in 2010-11. While the workshop content involved participatory applied theatre and popular education as tools for community environmental and social justice organising, the performance-based methods of these workshops also troubled assumptions of the participating subject as singular and self-reflexive. In the paper I propose that the question of subjectivity in participatory research might be fruitfully linked to the 'content' of environmental and social justice in two ways. First, applied theatre is presented as a distinctively mediated participatory space that can rely on an unrealisable conception of subjectivity. I argue that exploring the tensions within this mediated space can illuminate such tensions in participatory research generally, and further a 'passionate modesty' - a shared reckoning of limitations that can enrich the potential for praxis of participatory research. 'Passionate modesty' is brought to bear on activist research, asking us not to bypass in our writing the complexities and costs of participating in relations of solidarity and resistance. This participatory space is further explored as one of important ecological consequence for the co-production of knowledge. Barad and Bell's work on making the 'cuts' that determine what we include (and exclude) in our attentions is used to argue that participatory research, and creative methods in particular, can orient our attention to social-nature relations in distinct and powerful ways. An ecological perspective is proposed, where acknowledging the asymmetry of encounter and the co-performance of responsibility might 'cut' such research more modestly but perhaps more generatively. In a concluding response to this invitation, I return to the content of the Glasgow workshops on environmental and social justice, and the complex relationship between the politics of grappling with injustices and a participatory politics of co-learning.

AB  - This essay examines the problem of scientist activism as a specialized form of environmental struggle. Following research on "state-society synergy,'' the author argues that this framework encourages a broader view of scientist environmental activism and its socially embedded character "in between'' states and civil society. Environmental research and advocacy networks crisscross the public - private divide, linking scientists to one another, to state actors, and to environmental justice groups. These collective structures are important sites for examining the opportunities and constraints to scientist environmental activism. The synergy perspective is also useful for identifying the various forms that scientist activism can take, and for assessing the consequences of scientists' collective responses to the degradation of ecosystems and human communities.

AB  - We study the question of environmental equity via generalized linear modeling for the metropolitan New York City region and ask whether, after accounting for socioeconomic status, particular racial/ethnic populations bear a disproportionate burden of hosting environmentally undesirable sites. Our data consist of population demographics for 2216 census tracts linked to 354 environmentally undesirable facilities, including toxic release inventory sites, hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, and other common urban problem sites such as landfills, incinerators, bus garages and sewage treatment plants. Using generalized linear and additive modeling techniques, we find that racial/ethnic demographics, in particular the Hispanic percentage of a tract's population, are significantly associated with the presence of potentially environmentally adverse sites. This leads us to the conclusion that, over the whole metropolitan New York City area, the Hispanic population is proximate to more sites than other populations. At the same time, we find that both Hispanics and African-Americans are more proximate to these sites in the Bronx and Queens. However, we also find indications that Hispanics and African-Americans are less likely to be proximate to the sites in Manhattan. We establish an empirical relationship that warrants additional study in order to establish the causes for the population distribution and whether a basis for a claim of discrimination exists.

AB  - Urbanisation and climate change affect people's health and well-being in various ways. Nature-based solutions implemented as natural, sustainable solutions in cities can attenuate negative health impacts of these processes. In this chapter, urban green spaces are considered as one type of nature-based solutions that use urban ecosystem services to provide mitigation and adaptation actions and solutions to climate change and urbanisation related challenges. An overview over the relationships to urban health is presented. The city of Berlin is used as a case, to show how an unequal distribution of urban green area may be linked to an insufficient provision of ecosystem services and the related positive health outcome effect. This is discussed through the presentation of the distribution of different vulnerable population groups such as children and elderly people throughout the city area. The link to environmental justice is made and discussed in this context.

AB  - While empirical evidence continues to show that people living in low socio-economic status neighbourhoods are less likely to engage in health-enhancing behaviour, our understanding of why this is so remains less than clear. We suggest that two changes could take place to move from description to understanding in this field; (i) a move away from the established concept of individual health behaviour to a contextualised understanding of health practices; and (ii) a switch from focusing on health inequalities in outcomes to health inequities in conditions. We apply Pierre Bourdieu's theory on capital interaction but find it insufficient with regard to the role of agency for structural change. We therefore introduce Amartya Sen's capability approach as a useful link between capital interaction theory and action to reduce social inequities in health-related practices. Sen's capability theory also elucidates the importance of discussing unequal chances in terms of inequity, rather than inequality, in order to underscore the moral nature of inequalities. We draw on the discussion in social geography on environmental injustice, which also underscores the moral nature of the spatial distribution of opportunities. The article ends by applying this approach to the 'Interdisciplinary study of inequalities in smoking' framework.

AB  - This case study addresses environmental equity, in terms of African American, Latino, White, and poor communities' proximity to both industrial facilities and parkland in Hall County, Georgia, USA. The project's two primary goals are to (a) expand environmental justice analyses to account for both environmental burdens (industrial sites) and benefits (parkland acreage), and (b) extend this broader investigation to the county's emergent Latino populations. Results show that both Blacks and Latinos are overrepresented in census block groups (CBGs) within 1 mile of industrial facilities, while Whites are underrepresented. Conversely, Latinos and those near or below poverty are, on average, underrepresented in communities within one-quarter mile of parkland, but Whites are overrepresented. This article discusses the environmental justice and planning implications of these findings in terms of converting existing land uses to urban green space and fuller participation of minorities in such decision making.

AB  - This study explores the spatial association between social vulnerability and smoke plume dispersion at the census block group level for the 13 southern states in the USDA Forest Service's Region 8. Using environmental justice as a conceptual basis, we use Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis to identify clusters or "hot spots" for the incidence of both higher than average socially marginal populations and plume dispersion. The larger health disparities and environmental justice literature suggests that lower income and minority populations in the U.S. face greater exposure than middle/upper income, non-minority populations to environmental pollutants; however, we are aware of only a few studies examining this relationship in the context of population exposure to wildfires or prescribed fires in the U.S. South, despite the high occurrence of wildfires in the region. Analyses were conducted across five ecoregions in the South and for winter and spring/summer seasons. Results by ecoregion show significant spatial clustering of high social vulnerability block groups in the vicinity of block groups with a high number of smoke plumes (i.e., "hot spots"). Overall, however, socially vulnerable communities are not exposed to more smoke than non-socially vulnerable communities. Data limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB  - Urban political ecology now finds itself at a crossroads between gradual marginalization or renewed intellectual impetus. Despite some recent critical re-evaluations of the field, there remain a series of conceptual tensions that have only been partially explored. I consider six issues in particular: the uncertain relations between urban political ecology and the biophysical sciences; the emergence of extended conceptions of agency and subjectivity; the redefinition of space, scale, and the urban realm; renewed interest in urban epidemiology; the delineation of urban ecological imaginaries; and finally, the emergence of evidentiary materialism as an alternative posthuman configuration to new materialist ontologies. I conclude that a conceptually enriched urban political ecology could play an enhanced role in critical environmental research.

AB  - Trees provide many environmental benefits, but low-income communities of color tend to have fewer of them. New York City attempted to correct this disparity by planting a million trees via public-private partnership between 2007 and 2015. This paper examines MillionTreesNYC's environmental justice goals and planting strategies via program documents and interviews with program partners, and assesses equity outcomes via regression analysis of new trees planted, existing tree canopy, park space, and sociodemographic characteristics measured at the level of the census block group. Ultimately, MillionTreesNYC did not prioritize low-income communities of color to a measurable degree, and planted more trees in areas with greater existing tree canopy. Despite public-private partnerships' reputation for prioritizing profit over equity, the problem was not a lack of commitment to environmental justice. Instead, MillionTreesNYC's focus on parks, which are themselves inequitably distributed, frustrated the city's efforts to equalize the urban forest. This paper therefore exposes the deep historical roots of environmental injustice, which are difficult to eradicate without careful attention to both past and present socio-spatial inequities.

AB  - This chapter explores issues of justice and fairness in relationships between mining companies and locally affected communities. The focus is on relational justice, defined as the way interactions between mining companies and communities are formed and managed, both in terms of how parties communicate their interests and the processes through which decisions are made. Using a case study in the Brazilian Amazon, relational justice is explored from the perspective of 'voice', 'capabilities' and 'trust' - collectively these are the elements of justice. Ethnographic methods were applied to conduct this research, and four key findings are presented. First, community-company relations are affected by insufficient understanding among local communities about mining and its social and environmental impacts. Second, elements of justice are impacted by communication processes established by the mining company to engage with local communities. Third, the participation of external actors to support communities has the potential to maximise justice by improving local community capabilities, especially in terms of improving communication and negotiation. The fourth finding was that relational justice is affected by internal organisation and community representation. We conclude by arguing that justice in the mining context can be maximised by improving access to information, and establishing participatory and inclusive process for decision making.

AB  - Toxic metal exposure via private drinking wells is an environmental health challenge in North Carolina (NC). Policies tainted by environmental racism shape who has access to public water supplies, with Black People, Indigenous People, and People of Color (BIPOC) often excluded from municipal services. Thus, toxic metal exposure via private wells is an environmental justice (EJ) issue, and it is under-studied in NC. In this study, we developed four Toxic Metal Environmental Justice Indices (TM-EJIs) for inorganic arsenic (iAs), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and manganese (Mn) to quantitatively identify areas of environmental injustice in NC. TM-EJIs were calculated at the census tract level (n = 2038) as the product of the following: (1) number of well water tests with concentrations exceeding national standards, (2) percentage of the low-income and minority population, and (3) population density. Mn had the greatest proportion (25.17%) of positive TM-EJIs, which are indicative of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups exposed to toxic metals. Positive TM-EJIs, particularly for Pb and Mn, were primarily located in eastern NC. These results highlight several new counties of concern and can be used by public health professionals and state environmental agencies to prioritize remediation efforts and efforts to reduce environmental injustices.

AB  - This research assessed the role of public interest litigation in the achievement of sustainable waste management in the Addis Ababa Administration (AAA) of Ethiopia. It employed a single country case-oriented comparative research design, and data triangulation was used to establish the validity of the findings. The research first shows Ethiopia's commitment to sustainable waste management, implementing environmental tax and the command-and-control instruments of the polluter-pays principle and public interest litigation within the context of environmental justice. Secondly, it shows that public interest litigation is one of the innovative techniques in the struggle against waste mismanagement across all legal systems. Thirdly, it demonstrates the potential role of public interest litigation in Ethiopia in encouraging the federal and regional environmental protection and management organs to implement environmental tax and command-and-control instruments. Fourthly, it uncovers that public interest litigation is not fully compatible with the Civil Procedure Code of Ethiopia. Fifthly, it shows the failure of the judiciary system of Ethiopia to accommodate environmental courts and tribunals that flexibly and innovatively adopt public interest litigation. Sixthly, it reveals that, in Ethiopia, the scope of public interest standing is highly restrictive for Civil Society Organizations (CSO). Finally, it implies that the legal viability and administrative feasibility of environmental public interest litigation in Ethiopia is in its infancy, and its crystallization is partly contingent on the cautious review of the Civil Procedure Code and CSO laws and on greening the judiciary system.

AB  - Why do racial inequalities endure despite numerous attempts to expand civil rights in certain sectors? A major reason for this endurance is due to lack of attention to structural racism. Although structural and institutional racism are often conflated, they are not the same. Herein, we provide an analogy of a "bucky ball" (Buckminster-fullerene) to distinguish the two concepts. Structural racism is a system of interconnected institutions that operates with a set of racialized rules that maintain White supremacy. These connections and rules allow racism to reinvent itself into new forms and persist, despite civil rights interventions directed at specific institutions. To illustrate these ideas, we provide examples from the fields of environmental justice, criminal justice, and medicine. Racial inequities in power and health will persist until we redirect our gaze away from specific institutions (and specific individuals), and instead focus on the resilient connections among institutions and their racialized rules.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship of air quality and population exposure within the context provided by environmental justice and social equity. It will explore the extent to which different social groups in England and Wales are exposed to adverse concentrations of air pollution as specified in the Air Quality Strategy (AQS) 2000 and subsequent regulations. In England and Wales Local Authorities (LAs) have a duty to review and assess air quality and to identify areas where objectives specified in the AQS are not met. In such areas where public exposure is present the LAs must declare Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs). The characteristics of the population in these pollution hotspots are not well defined. Furthermore the AQMAs vary in size and pollutant sources and are often, but not exclusively, found in city areas. The paper describes the characteristics of the population resident in AQMAs in terms of their social status as computed by deprivation indicators. The methodological approach employed involves an initial investigation on the availability and suitability of deprivation indicators, and followed by the use of a GIS environment to visualise the deprivation scores in AQMAs areas throughout England and Wales. The paper considers social equity issues in respect of the exposed populations and raises the issue of considering equity in the definition of an AQMA.

AB  - This paper will investigate the relationship between social deprivation and environmental quality, referred to as Environmental Justice. Specifically it examines the formulation, structure and implementation of the UK's Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) system in terms of its possible impacts on social equity. Under the LAQM system Local Authorities (LAs) are required to identify areas, known as Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs), where air quality objectives cannot be met. LAs that have declared AQMAs are also required to produce Air Quality Action Plans (AQAPs); these are reports that inform the government of, amongst other things, the mitigations strategies to be adopted by the LA. This paper will present the initial findings on the level of social deprivation within the AQMAs. The methodological complexities of computing deprivation within AQMAs are also discussed. An assessment of the inclusion of social issues within the LAQM process is undertaken by appraising AQAPs. The paper will review the method adopted by LAs in developing AQAPs and examine the extent to which social considerations are included in the plans. The overall project aim is to provide a decision support process in which social issues are considered in the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental policies.

AB  - Worldwide, millions of rural people inhabiting marginal lands have been evicted from their homes in the name of conservation. Africa is no exception, nor is South Africa, the focus of this paper. Our central concern is whether land reform in South Africa can accomplish both social and environmental justice in a context of widespread and longstanding human displacement and opportunity costs as the country's national parks and game refuges expand. The costs of ecological expropriation are illustrated, as are instances from other countries where land reform simultaneously serves social and environmental objectives. Recommendations are advanced for greening South Africa's land reform without sacrificing its social and economic missions.

This is surprising given the rising prominence of CDA and the continued development of critical environmental law scholarship. The present article seeks to correct for this oversight by highlighting the particularities of environmental law which compel the use of CDA, and outlining a method by which social science researchers can use CDA to understand the role of power in the domain of environmental law.

We conducted a review evaluating the frequency and effective use of EO 12898 since execution with particular focus following President Obama's Plan EJ 2014. We found that both EO 12898 and Plan EJ 2104 had little, if any, impact on federal regulatory decision making. To the extent federal agencies discussed EO 12898, most did so in boilerplate rhetoric that satisfied compliance but was devoid of detailed thought or analysis. In the 21st year, with the exception of the Environmental Protection Agency, very little federal regulatory activity included references to EO 12898.

AB  - We examined exposure and perceptions of rats and perceived rat eradication response among 448 low-income urban residents in Baltimore, Maryland, recruited using targeted outreach. Bivariate and multivariate regression compared those reporting high and low rat prevalence. Only 35% of respondents indicated rats were not a problem on their block. Rats were most problematic when seen approximately daily on one's block (35%) or elsewhere in the neighborhood (50%). Increased neighborhood disorder and depressive symptoms were independently associated with higher rat prevalence. Perceived neighbor and city response was associated with lower rat prevalence and stronger individual eradication. Attention is needed to appreciate and address psychosocial effect and environmental justice aspects of rat infestation in urban areas. Daily block sightings may be a useful threshold for evaluating problem rat areas based on resident perceptions and assessment indicator for rat eradication. Multilevel community-based rat eradication approaches may help reduce rat prevalence and community stress.

AB  - This paper provides an empirical analysis on the relationship between income, demographic characteristics and concentrations of air industrial pollutants within the Italian provinces. Two general conclusions can be drawn from the empirical results. First, the estimates obtained are consistent with an inverse U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve: air pollution releases increase with income up to a turning point where the relation reverts. Second, there is evidence that air releases tend to be higher in provinces with high concentration of females as households' head and with high concentration of children. Since our findings do not point to environmental discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, this suggests that environmental justice issues in Italy are not likely to manifest themselves along racial and ethnic terms but instead in terms of social categories and gender composition. We also find that the proxy variables employed to measure the efficiency or inefficiency of law enforcement are associated with higher levels of pollution. In terms of policy implications, this result suggests the need to strengthen, all through the country, the local enforcement of environmental laws in order to possibly reduce the negative effects on ambient air pollution.

AB  - Urban trees provide substantial public health and public environmental benefits. However, scholarly works suggest that urban trees may be disproportionately low in poor and minority urban communities, meaning that these communities are potentially being deprived of public environmental benefits, a form of environmental injustice. The evidence of this problem is not uniform however, and evidence of inequity varies in size and significance across studies. This variation in results suggests the need for a research synthesis and meta-analysis. We employed a systematic literature search to identify original studies which examined the relationship between urban forest cover and income (n = 61) and coded each effect size (n = 332). We used meta-analytic techniques to estimate the average (unconditional) relationship between urban forest cover and income and to estimate the impact that methodological choices, measurement, publication characteristics, and study site characteristics had on the magnitude of that relationship. We leveraged variation in study methodology to evaluate the extent to which results were sensitive to methodological choices often debated in the geographic and environmental justice literature but not yet evaluated in environmental amenities research. We found evidence of income-based inequity in urban forest cover (unconditional mean effect size = 0.098; s.e. = 0.017) that was robust across most measurement and methodological strategies in original studies. and results did not differ systematically with study site characteristics. Studies that controlled for spatial autocorrelation, a violation of independent errors, found evidence of substantially less urban forest inequity; future research in this area should test and correct for spatial autocorrelation.

AB  - We investigate the heterogeneous effects of particle pollution on Italian daily hospitalizations and their costs by exploiting public transportation strikes as plausibly-exogenous shocks in pollution exposure. We find that a one standard deviation increase in PM(10 )causes additional 0.79 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents, and the effect is stronger for the elderly, low educated individuals and migrants. Furthermore, we find that young individuals, an arguably healthy age group, exhibit economically meaningful responses to air pollution with an effect ranging between 0.45 and 1.04. Our results imply a large role of avoidance behavior driving heterogeneous marginal health effects. Total daily costs of a one standard deviation increase in PM10 represent 0.5% of the total daily health expenditure, and 85% of this additional spending comes from more patients hospitalized, while the remaining 15% can be attributable to more costly, and likely more complex, hospitalizations.

Using distance-based methods, socioeconomic characteristics of inhabitants living in 1.0 km buffer zones around the 247 polluters registered in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Registry are compared with those of inhabitants living elsewhere in Austria. While in Vienna no clear signs of environmental inequality can be found, in the rest of Austria people living in close vicinity to industrial sites are more often unemployed, have lower education levels and most notably, are twice as likely to be immigrants. Moreover, a logistic regression shows that the disparities concerning immigrants cannot solely be explained by other socioeconomic characteristics. The results of this study add to the evidentiary base concerning environmental justice disparities in Europe and suggests how application of distance-based methods can facilitate cross-national comparisons.

AB  - This paper argues that there is ethical and practical necessity for including women's needs, perspectives, and expertise in international climate change negotiations. I show that climate change contributes to women's hardships because of the conjunction of the feminization of poverty and environmental degradation caused by climate change. I then provide data I collected in Ghana to demonstrate effects of extreme weather events on women subsistence farmers and argue that women have knowledge to contribute to adaptation efforts. The final section surveys the international climate debate, assesses explanations for its gender blindness, and summarizes the progress on gender that was made at Copenhagen and Cancun in order to document and provoke movement toward climate justice for women.

AB  - Urban sustainability is most often measured using a series of social, economic, and ecological indicators. Assessment methods for urban sustainability typically factor in the ecological dimensions of greenspace, such as biodiversity maintenance, stormwater management, and/or air quality-yet indicator schemas that consider only the ecological dimensions largely overlook the social benefits of some types of urban greenspace, particularly community gardens and orchards. This article makes the case that the process of community formation and strengthening that occurs in shared growing spaces is an important element of urban sustainability in its own right. Based on 55 interviews of community garden advocates, policy-makers, and development professionals involved in urban agriculture planning, this article traces the widespread understanding among practitioners that shared growing spaces strengthen social as well as environmental sustainability, though the social benefits are often difficult to measure. The latter concern was most frequently expressed by urban agriculture advocates who, after involvement in the political process, perceived the need for such metrics in order to communicate persuasively with planners and policy makers. The social values of shared growing spaces, at once self-evident to garden advocates and difficult for them to demonstrate with quantitative data, may be theorized by drawing on insights from sociology: A truly sustainable city requires community coalescence among diverse citizens, and such community is fostered particularly well in shared growing spaces.

AB  - Whenever a solid waste landfill is constructed, there are always concerns. How is the landfill going to affect the community? How was the location selected? How will it affect property values? These questions are always raised in the areas that surround potential and existing landfills. Along with these questions, often issues arise of environmental justice. This paper explores current issues in community relations and environmental justice, and offers a communications model that can hopefully help to resolve these problems.

AB  - This conceptual paper explores theoretical linkages between community well-being and key dimensions of public spaces (i.e., physical characteristics, technical experts, and communities). It draws on environmental justice literature and the Tripartite Framework to contextualize the concept of access to public spaces. The nexus between the key dimensions of public spaces and community well-being are explored by drawing on the Network Theory of Wellbeing. The main contribution of this paper is its merging of the aforementioned seminal work (i.e., Tripartite Framework and Network Theory of Wellbeing), two important bodies of scholarship that have yet to intersect but which offer a formidable platform to advance knowledge on how technical (e.g. planners), social (i.e. communities) and physical (e.g. built spaces like parks) dimensions of public space production can contribute to communal benefits derived from a public resource and community well-being. The applicability of the conceptual synthesis is illustrated through the discussion of specific examples in Maryvale.

AB  - While equity has been an important consideration for transportation planning agencies in the U.S. following the passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI specifically) and the subsequent Department of Transportation directives, there is little guidance on how to assess the distribution of benefits generated by transport investment programs. As a result, the distribution of these benefits has received relatively little attention in transportation planning, compared to transport-related burdens. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, we present an equity assessment of the distribution of accessibility in order to define the rate of "access poverty" among the population. We then apply this analysis to regional transportation plan scenarios from the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on measures of differences between public transit and automobile access. The analysis shows that virtually all neighborhoods suffer from substantial gaps between car and public transport-based accessibility, but that the two proposed transportation investment programs reduce access poverty compared to the "no project" scenario. We also investigate how access and access poverty rates vary by demographic groups and map low-income communities within access impoverished areas, which could be the subject of further focused investments.

AB  - We conducted a multimethod case study analysis of a community-based participatory research partnership in West Oakland, California, and its efforts to study and address the neighborhood's disproportionate exposure to diesel air pollution. We employed 10 interviews with partners and policymakers, participant observation, and a review of documents. Results of the partnership's truck count and truck idling studies suggested substantial exposure to diesel pollution and were used by the partners and their allies to make the case for a truck route ordinance. Despite weak enforcement, the partnership's increased political visibility helped change the policy environment, with the community partner now heavily engaged in environmental decision-making on the local and regional levels. Finally, we discussed implications for research, policy, and practice. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:S166-S175. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2010. 196204)

AB  - This Note examines state legislative responses to Kelo v. City of New London, the recent U.S. Supreme Court case that held that the exercise of eminent domain for private development does not violate the public use requirement of the Takings Clause. In response to Kelo, many states are legislatively prohibiting the use of eminent domain for development generally, but continuing to allow its use for development in blighted areas. This Note discusses the problems with such legislation and concludes that states should avoid crafting rules that allow the use of eminent domain for development solely in blighted areas. Such rules would improperly burden poor and minority communities and imbalance the political process by which rules on eminent domain for development are established.

AB  - We develop a spatial model to examine policies aimed at reducing ambient concentrations of fine particulates (PM2.5), with emissions from many sources that affect many population centers. Two alternative specifications of the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and health impacts from Krewski et al. are analyzed: log-linear, which implies downward-sloping marginal benefits of abatement; and log-log, which implies upward-sloping marginal benefits of abatement. A standard assumption would be that the greatest benefit from cleanup would occur in the dirtiest locations. We show, however, that for the log-log (but not log-linear) relationship, the largest risk reductions are achieved from abatement of pollution in the cleanest locations. Our model demonstrates that with a log-log relationship society should prefer lower emissions and lower pollution concentrations than if the relationship is log-linear. Our model also shows that an efficient abatement policy may substantially outperform a uniform pollution standard such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

AB  - Urban political ecology scholars recognise that a historical perspective is central to elucidating processes of racialised uneven development. In this paper, I articulate a collectively produced "peoples' history" of the Portland Harbor Superfund Site, recounting how over a century of industrial pollution in Portland, Oregon has disproportionately impacted Native, Black, immigrant and refugee, and houseless residents of all backgrounds-and has spawned collective work for a more just future. I argue that it is imperative for scholars to not only articulate such racialised pasts, however, but also to recognise how those working on the front lines of change draw on their own personal and group experiences to produce shared narratives, particularly across difference and in a context of depoliticised, ahistorical sustainability discourse. The case of the Portland Harbor Community Coalition reveals how the production of a shared history can be an important part of work to redress racialised dispossession and displacement in so-called green cities.

AB  - What can community development learn from frontline community resistance to extractivism and the fossil fuel industry? In the global North, environmental governance often operates within the dominant mode of neoliberal 'environmentality' (Luke. 1999. Environmentality as green governmentality, in E. Darier ed, Discourses of the Environment, Blackwell, Oxford), conceptualizing environmental action in individualized and depoliticized ways. This is compounded by the discursive hegemony of the educated middle-classes, which frames environmental issues in ways that render invisible the concerns of marginalized communities and workers. In this paper, I present an activist ethnography and case study of Love Leitrim, a community group that played a crucial role in the successful Irish movement to resist fracking. I suggest that local environmental justice struggles point to the possibility of a 'liberation environmentality' (Fletcher. Environmentality unbound: multiple governmentalities in environmental politics, Geoforum, 2017;85, 311-315); which challenges capitalist modes of environmental governance that facilitate the exploitation of the environment for capital accumulation. The paper identifies how a combination of (i) relational local organizing; (ii) trans-local networking with other frontline communities and (iii) creative political engagement enabled campaigners to organize collectively around the environment, navigate power asymmetries and secure political change across spatial scales. I conclude by suggesting that Love Leitrim's frontline community struggle offers important insights for community development workers who wish to address the environment as a political issue and play a role in bringing about a just transition for marginalized communities and workers.

AB  - While awareness is growing that ethical and justice-based debates hold implications for the development of fair and effective climate policy, the specific ethical implications of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) deployment have received limited attention. Here, we present a preliminary assessment of ethical attitudes to CCS. The aim was to develop a methodology which can support a clear scoping out of potential issues and to lay the foundations from which to develop a fully deliberative approach. This article draws largely upon the empirical analysis and results with some reference to the method. An ethical matrix approach is used to provide a summary of a so-called ethical landscape, primarily from a European perspective, in which perspectives of CCS are mapped out as they relate to certain ethical principles. Opinions represented on the matrix begin to coalesce around compliance with the principle of providing benefits (a pre-requisite of pursuing development) while potential faultlines were observed for the following principles: environmental justice, preventing harm, scientific/technical competence, managerial/regulatory competence. Accountability (in the context of long term storage) was revealed to present a key challenge, exposing the current immaturity of legal and regulatory frameworks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Within the context of broader debates on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental justice (EJ), this paper examines three key questions: first, how the standards that corporations adopt at the global scale trickle down into local site-level practices; second, whether levels of corporate environmental performance vary from place to place; and third whether any variations in corporate environmental performance relate to the principles of EJ. To do this, the analysis draws upon recently disclosed data to evaluate variations in the environmental performance of oil refineries across the US and the EU. It finds significant variations in emissions of some key pollutants. These exist both across the range of refineries, with dirtier refineries emitting at least five times as much as cleaner refineries, and between the EU and the US, with refineries in the EU emitting more than twice as much as refineries in the US. At the local level, it finds that there are correlations between higher levels of emissions from refineries and lower levels of income, employment and population density. Although these findings provide support for some of the contentions of the EJ movement, they do not say anything about causality, and as a result we cannot say definitively that companies adopt lower standards in poorer areas.

It explains the reasoning behind choosing these methods and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using these methods to study questions of justice. In doing so, it identifies ways in which various qualitative and quantitative methods can be used separately, or in combination, to provide a more comprehensive perspective on justice considerations. The chapter also provides examples of the questions posed to participants in interviews, questionnaires, focus groups and visual studies by authors of this book, to illustrate how researchers have employed and operationalised justice concepts.

AB  - We examine the determinants of environmental regulatory activity (inspections and enforcement actions) and levels of air and water pollution for 409 US pulp and paper mills, using data for 1985-1997. We focus on the benefits to the surrounding population from pollution abatement. Plants with larger benefits emit less pollution, as do those with more kids and elders nearby. Plants in poor areas emit more pollution, though (surprisingly) we find less pollution in minority areas. Out-of-state neighbors seem to count less than in-state ones, although this effect diminishes if the bordering state's Congressional delegation is strongly pro-environment. We use 'spatially lagged' instrumental variables to control for the potential endogeneity of which individuals choose to locate near the plant. The results for regulatory activity are noticeably less significant than the emissions results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper quantitatively examines what drives brownfield redevelopment and what factors predict a completed brownfield redevelopment. This research investigated 200 brownfield properties that were listed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and redeveloped between the years 2000 and 2015. Three significant correlations were found in this study: socio-economic factor (income level), green development, and tax incentives significantly correlated with brownfield redevelopment. The combination of six predictor variables was analyzed using multiple regression. Socio-economic (income level) [beta = 0.27, t = 3.96, p < 0.001] and sustainable building practice (green development) [beta = -0.17, t = -2.56, p = 0.01] significantly predicted brownfield redevelopment. Type of contamination (beta = 0.07, t = 0.98, p > 0.05), political climate (beta = -0.04, t = -0.52, p > 0.05) and stakeholder involvement (beta = 0.04, t = 0.62, p > 0.05) did not significantly predict brownfield redevelopment. Hypothesis two and four assessed predictors of brownfield redevelopment. The findings indicated a significant relationship between brownfield redevelopment and two variables (a) socioeconomic factor (income levels) significantly predicted brownfield redevelopment, and (b) green development significantly predicted brownfield redevelopment. The higher value of socio-economic factor, the higher value of brownfield redevelopment. The projects with sustainable development had high brownfield redevelopment value than projects without green development. Recommendations for practice include (a) developers and other stakeholders incorporate sustainable building practices in brownfield redevelopments, (b) government agencies involved in the building process such as building and planning departments provide narratives of best practices in sustainable building to help guide brownfield redevelopments and implement policies to mitigate the displacement of low income residents (c) creation of a centralized database of brownfields that have been redeveloped detailing the project attributes. Recommendations for future research may include (a) quantitative study of demographic factors such as age, gender, race, and education as possible predictors of successful brownfield redevelopment and (b) a study on the types of contamination that have been successfully remediated resulting in a successful brownfield redevelopment.

AB  - We propose a framework for evaluating environmental inequity that includes desirable and undesirable characteristics. We also propose that state governments conduct the evaluations and that the local government scale (boroughs, cities, and townships) be the first scale analyzed. This framework recognizes the critical role of the state and local governments in the American federalist system. The 567 local governments of the State of New Jersey are used to illustrate the framework. Results of these analyses should be used to make initial decisions about local governments that warrant investigation at the neighborhood scale and preliminary, though not necessarily, final decisions about local governments and neighborhoods that deserve relief. We identify three important issues that each state will need to confront: selecting and weighting characteristics for analysis; choosing the most appropriate geographical units to use as a basis for decisions; and developing a process that will not be misused by groups seeking to avoid responsibility for their actions.

AB  - We designed a survey to measure public preferences for management actions at ports that would reduce negative risk perceptions, increase competence-based trust, and overall provide port managers with opportunities to build communication channels with surrounding populations. A total of 511 people who lived in a 45-square mile area of New Jersey containing over 300,000 people and a dozen large and small ports responded to solutions that offered independent science support, provided ongoing public health surveillance, and economic assistance for local communities. Environmental health concerns about air, noise, fires, port security, and protection against climate-related impacts were major correlates of these preferences. Yet many residents recognized economic benefits associated with nearby ports and many either trusted port management or were neutral and felt not well informed. Those who had a personal or family connection to the port were stronger port supporters. The most important finding and challenge for port managers is building ongoing relationships with the majority of nearby residents who are not aware of port activities, which presents an opportunity for increasing trust through proactive outreach and listening to nearby community representatives.

AB  - Urban tree canopy provides a suite of ecological, social, and economic benefits to the residents of urban areas. With an expanding recognition of these benefits among city residents, there is growing concern that access to these benefits is not distributed equally and may represent the presence of an environmental injustice. This study examines the spatial relationship between median household income and tree canopy variables, specifically realized tree canopy cover and potential tree canopy cover, for Toronto, Canada. Toronto provides a strong empirical focus as it is a densely populated urban setting reported to be exhibiting an increase in the geographic polarization of residents based upon household income. Spatial relationships between median household income and tree canopy variables are evaluated using the bivariate Moran's I statistic, a specialized local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). This method explicitly identified where statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low household income coincide with significant clusters of high and low urban tree canopy, providing the basis for an examination of the policies and management decisions that led to this temporal snapshot. The importance of these spatial clusters is examined from the perspective of understanding the impact of urban change (both socio-demographic and built form), and from the standpoint of improving equality of access to city trees and their benefits resulting from future tree planting decisions.

AB  - This essay identifies anxious assemblages as a powerful rhetorical strategy used by organizers of the 2014 Flood Wall Street protest in New York City's financial district. Anxious assemblages may disrupt the reduction of protest to acts of individual expression while promoting intra-movement solidarity. Drawing together literatures about assemblages and anxiety, I show how circulating signs and images on social media can propel protests that repeat and modulate pre-existing expressions of anxiety. I then use visual and textual methods to demonstrate how Flood Wall Street emerged from a Twitter campaign to transform protestors into a flood or bodies that predicted global climate chaos and spurred participants' ongoing agitation against the causes of climate change. This essay provides an important analytical tool for analyzing the repetitive and collective tactics now popular among climate justice organizations, explaining how they promote intragroup solidarity and elicit further agitation.

AB  - We outline the frameworks that shape and hold apart waste debates in and about the Global North and Global South and that hinder analysis of flows between them. Typically, waste is addressed as municipal waste, resulting in a focus on domestic consumption and urban governance and an emphasis on cities and the national scale. The prevailing ways of addressing the increasingly global flows of wastes between the North and South are those of global environmental justice and are underpinned by the geographical imagination encoded in the Basel Convention. New research on the trades in used goods and recycling in lower income countries challenges these accounts. It shows that arguments about dumping on the South need revision. Wastes are secondary resources for lower income countries, harvesting them is a significant economic activity, and consequent resource recovery is a key part of the global economy. Four areas for future research are identified: (a) changing patterns of global harvesting, (b) attempts to rescale resource recovery and the challenges faced, (c) the geopolitics of resource recovery, and (d) changes in resource recovery in lower income countries.

AB  - This study investigated disparities in residential exposure to carcinogenic air pollutants among Asian Americans, including Asian ancestry subgroups, in four US metro areas with high proportions of Asians, i.e., Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. Generalized estimating equations adjusting for socioeconomic status, population density, and clustering show that a greater proportion of Asian Americans in census tracts was associated with significantly greater health risk in all four metro areas. Intracategorical disparities were uncovered for Asian ancestry. A greater proportion Korean was positively associated with risk in four metro areas; greater proportion Chinese and Filipino were positively associated with risk in three of the four metro areas. While Asian Americans are infrequently examined in environmental justice research, these results demonstrate that Asian Americans experience substantial distributional environmental injustices in these four metro areas and that ancestry is an important dimension of intracategorical complexity.

AB  - While environmental justice researchers have established enduring linkages between environmental hazards and poor populations, little is known about the human-environment interactions of urbanites of varying socioenvironmental positions. To investigate how humans interact with differentially polluted urban environments, 53 interviews with parents of asthmatic children living in the central city and the suburbs were conducted. Parents used four techniques to minimize the impact of hazards on their asthmatic child: modify the child's activities; modify home environment; move to another home; and collective action. With its focus on interactions between people and their environments, this study reveals micro-scale hazards and lack of control over the ambient environment as additional dimensions of environmental injustice.

AB  - Two assumptions have underpinned environmental justice over the past several decades: (1) uneven environmental exposures yield correspondingly unequal health impacts and (2) these effects are stable across space. To test these assumptions, relationships for residential pest and PM2.5 exposures with children's wheezing severity are examined using global (ordinary least squares) and local [geographically weighted regression (GWR)] models using cross-sectional observational survey data from El Paso (Texas) children. In the global model, having pests and higher levels of PM2.5 were weakly associated with greater wheezing severity. The local model reveals two types of asthmogenic socio-environments, where environmental exposures more powerfully predict greater wheezing severity. The first is a lower-income context where children are disproportionately exposed to pests and PM2.5, and the second is a higher-income socio-environment where children are exposed to lower levels of PM2.5, yet PM2.5 is counterintuitively associated with more severe wheezing. Findings demonstrate that GWR is a powerful tool for understanding relationships between environmental conditions, social characteristics, and health inequalities.

AB  - We explore local people's perspectives of community forest (CF) on their land in Tanzania and Bolivia. Community forest management is known to improve ecological conditions of forests, but is more variable in its social outcomes. Understanding communities' experience of community forestry and the potential benefits and burdens its formation may place on a community will likely help in predicting its sustainability as a forest and land management model. Six villages, two in Tanzania and four in Bolivia, were selected based on the presence of community forestry in varying stages. We found that communities were generally supportive of existing community forests but cautious of their expansion. Deeper explorations of this response using ethnographic research methods reveal that an increase in community forest area is associated with increasing opportunity costs and constraints on agricultural land use, but not an increase in benefits. Furthermore, community forests give rise to a series of intra- and inter-community conflicts, often pertaining to the financial benefits stemming from the forests (distribution issues), perceived unfairness and weakness in decision-making processes (procedure/participation), and also tensions over cultural identity issues (recognition). Our findings suggest that communities' willingness to accept community forests requires a broader consideration of the multifunctional landscape in which it is embedded, as well as an engagement with the justice tensions such an intervention inevitably creates.

AB  - This paper explores the relation between resilience, justice and recognition through a case study of resilience planning in the Greater Miami Region. Greater Miami resilience plans, prepared through the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities program, have foregrounded equity as a cross-cutting theme - a surprising move given the region's history of anti-Black violence, segregation, and racially exclusionary governance, and the recent focus of resilience-building initiatives on sustaining property values. Bringing together literatures on resilience and justice, recognition, critical race theory, and design theory, we ask how Miami resilience initiatives extend the structures of anti-Black violence through efforts to address the region's extreme racial and economic inequalities in the name of equity and shore up the regional economy against complex socio-ecological shocks and stressors. Our analysis details how Miami's resilience-building efforts are uneasily situated across at least two distinct styles of recognition. On the one hand, contextually-specific norms of recognition shaped through the region's history of racial capitalism valorize the security of Miami's racialized real estate markets. On the other hand, design-driven resilience planning initiatives valorize diverse forms of knowledge on racially uneven development for the pragmatic utility they offer planners and professionals seeking holistic solutions to complex socio-ecological problems. While designerly approaches to resilience-building have created new possibilities for incorporating equity concerns (promoted by local social and climate justice organizations) into decision-making processes, they ultimately fail to unsettle the libidinal economy of dehumanizing anti-Black violence that continues to structure who can author(ize) what a resilient Miami might become.

AB  - This article unites recent writing in extinction studies with work in political ecology, justice theory and museum studies to explore qualitative, cultural approaches to extinction. I examine the role of storytelling and the power of narratives in addressing nonhuman extinction. Analysing the case study of a permanent gallery on extinction, evolution and biodiversity loss - the Survival Gallery of the National Museum of Scotland - I utilise a more-than-textual approach to narrative analysis. This paper explores the diverse ways in which the gallery relates stories of 'natural' extinction to the contemporary anthropogenic 'Sixth Mass Extinction'. The Survival Gallery narrates a remarkably complex compilation of extinction stories, but the gallery's narrative avoids areas of conflict or controversy, obscures justice concerns and ultimately presents a problematic depiction of a universalised humanity. Using this analysis of museum extinction storytelling, the paper contributes to emerging conceptualisations of multispecies justice frameworks. The article explores the possibilities and challenges of museum storytelling in grappling with complicated pasts and envisioning potential futures of survival, coexistence and flourishing. The paper concludes by considering how a multispecies justice approach to narrating extinction (and other entangled ecological-social phenomena) might flourish within and beyond museums.

AB  - Urban landscapes can be transformed by widespread abandonment from population and economic decline. Ecological assembly, sometimes referred to as greening, following abandonment can yield valuable ecosystem services, but also can pose a risk to public health. Abandonment can elevate zoonotic vector-borne disease risk by favoring the hyperabundance of commensal pests and pathogen vectors. Though greater biodiversity in abandoned areas can potentially dilute vector-borne pathogen transmission, greening can elevate transmission risk by increasing movement of pathogen vectors between fragmented areas and by giving rise to novel human-wildlife interfaces. Idled and derelict infrastructure can further elevate disease risk from vector-borne and water-borne pathogens, which can build up in stagnant and unprotected water that maintenance and routine use of delivery or sanitation systems would otherwise eliminate. Thus, framing greening as inherently positive could result in policies and actions that unintentionally exacerbate inequalities by elevating risks rather than delivering benefits. As counter-urbanism is neither a minor pattern of urban development, nor a short-term departure from urban growth, homeowner and municipal management of abandoned areas should account for potential hazards to reduce health risks. Further socioecological assessments of public health risks following abandonment could better ensure the resilience and well-being of communities in shrinking cities.

AB  - Urban resilience (UR), which promotes the implementation of resilient cities, has received widespread attention. The purpose of this study is to visualize the knowledge background, research status, and knowledge structure of relevant literatures by using a Citespace based scientometrics survey. The results show that UR is an increasingly popular topic, with 2629 articles published during the study period. (1) The most prolific publications and journals involved in the flourishment of UR research were identified by co-citation. The United States was the most productive contributor, with numerous publications and active institutions. Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction were the three most cited journals. (2) Co-occurrence analysis was employed to determine the highly productive keywords, and subject categories in the UR domain, including "environmental science & ecology", "environmental sciences, "science & technology", "environmental studies", "green & sustainable science & technology", and "water resources". (3) The diversity of highly cited authors in different countries and regions confirmed the evolution of UR studies. (4) Furthermore, the classification of UR knowledge was performed in the form of clusters and knowledge structure to achieve ten distinct sub-domains (e.g., Urban floods and stormwater management, Urban ecosystem services, Urban landscapes, and Trauma). This study provides an overview of UR research and research topics so that future researchers can identify their research topics and partners.

AB  - Understanding and intervening at the intersection of climate change and child health disparities require pediatric providers to broaden their competency with structural determinants of health -even in the clinic. The environmental effects of climate change at the community level intersect in complex ways with structural racism and social influences of health. Climate injustice is further evident in policies and practices that disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color through exposure to harmful pollutants from industrial plants, heavy vehicular traffic, and flooding waterways, as well as to harm from degraded civic infrastructure such as leaking water lines and unsafe bridges. To support child health, pediatric providers must recognize the environmental health harms posed to children and multiplied by climate change as well as identify opportunities to center the voices of families and communities to dismantle these inequities. In this article, three case examples demonstrate the links between structural racism, climate change and child health. We then use a healing centered engagement approach to offer specific suggestions for how pediatric providers can actively promote health and resilience, advocate for patient needs, and contribute to efforts to change structural racism in existing practices and institutions.

AB  - While incentive-based approaches like Payments for Ecosystem Services abound in current theoretical debates and environmental governance, their social impact is often unclear. It is highly relevant to ask if costs and benefits of such interventions are allocated equitably, and if the distribution of payments is dependent on a policy's socio-political context. Literature speaks of distributive and contextual equity here, but evidence on how these two dimensions are interlinked is scarce. Thus, our study investigates Vietnam's Payments for Forest Environmental Services scheme and assesses its implementation's cost benefit-allocation at the local level. Preexisting political, economic, and social conditions are examined for their impact on current payment distribution. The study takes a qualitative case study approach with semi-structured in-depth interviews with local, provincial, and national respondents focusing on the district of Nam Dong. Findings reveal that various gains were distributed unevenly among individuals. While some community members benefitted from privileged positions in local hierarchies, others were excluded from participation and from tapping into funds. Such results hint to the functional importance of equity for incentive-based resource management. They demonstrate that environmental policies can reinforce existing asymmetries in power and wealth if they do not consider the sociopolitical context they operate in.

AB  - This study investigates racial and ethnic disparities in hospital admission and emergency room visit rates resulting from exposure to ozone and fine particulate matter levels in excess of federal standards ("excess attributable risk"). We generate zip code-level ambient pollution exposures and hospital event rates using state datasets, and use pollution impact estimates in the epidemiological literature to calculate excess attributable risk for racial/ethnic groups in California over 2005-2007. We find that black residents experienced roughly 2.5 times the excess attributable risk of white residents. Hispanic residents were exposed to the highest levels of pollution, but experienced similar excess attributable risk to whites. Asian/Pacific Islander residents had substantially lower excess attributable risk compared to white. We estimate the distinct contributions of exposure and other factors to these results, and find that factors other than exposure can be critical determinants of pollution-related disparities.

AB  - This paper examines New York City's Neighborhood Slow Zones (NSZ) program in terms of environmental justice. The paper uses both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative analyses show that the areas where the zones are implemented are well represented in regarding environmental justice (low-income and minority) populations, and that risk exposure to traffic injury and traffic casualty counts are similar in NSZ and non-NSZ areas. The qualitative analysis shows that the program was structured in a way that included the participation of environmental justice communities and led to the siting of zones in such neighborhoods. These findings suggest that the NSZ program can address environmental justice's goals of distributing environmental risk more equitably and including low-income and minority communities in planning processes.

AB  - Will there be an international climate treaty to follow Kyoto when it expires in 2012, and if so what will it look like? Many climate justice and anti-capitalist spokespersons denounce the Kyoto Protocol as a "pretend solution" and reject international carbon trading altogether. This article argues that, on the contrary, an international cap and trade treaty is the only way to avert climate change fairly before it is too late, and that the Kyoto Protocol is a framework that progressives should defend and fix rather than condemn and nix. After explaining why many climate justice and anti-capitalist criticisms of carbon trading are without merit and fail to appreciate how international carbon trading can favor lesser developed countries (LDCs), five changes to make a post-Kyoto cap and trade treaty more effective and fair are proposed, and common arguments against carbon trading are rebutted.

AB  - This paper analyses a short story written in 1900 by Kalman Mikszath (1847-1910), a major Hungarian author. The plot narrates the genesis and the consequences of a strange last will, which bequeaths a substantial amount of money to two trees. The plot is partly funny, partly uncanny, and evolves rather slowly, in accordance with the long and rather inactive life cycles of trees. It is not so much the plot, however, that is interesting, but rather the ethical discourse of the personae in how to deal with the trees. Due to the exceptional legal situation, various people start regarding the trees as persons and have difficulties in making decisions about them. While it would be an overstatement to say that Mikszath wrote a prototext of environmental justice, he definitely challenged some ideas of his times and asked important questions about possible ethical approaches to nature. Legal issues are ubiquitous in world literature, but the world of law is usually limited to human affairs. As soon as trees are treated as legal subjects, they seem to become persons. Usually the development is the reverse in legal reasoning: if one is a person, one has rights. Therefore the short story is a sort of thought-experiment: what if we regard the non-human world as having rights? And the result is a paradigm shift we can nowadays make use of, accepting that justice is not or should not be limited to just the human sphere.

AB  - With growing urban populations and climate change, urban flooding is an important global issue, even in dryland regions. Flood risk assessments are usually used to identify vulnerable locations and populations, flooding experience patterns, or levels of concern about flooding, but rarely are all of these approaches combined. Furthermore, the social dynamics of flood concerns, exposure, and experience are underexplored. We combined geographic and survey data on household-level measures of flood experience, concern, and exposure in Utah's urbanizing Wasatch Front. We asked: (1) Are socially vulnerable groups more likely to be exposed to flood risk? (2) How common are flooding experiences among urban residents, and how are these experiences related to sociodemographic characteristics and exposure? and (3) How concerned are urban residents about flooding, and does concern vary by exposure, flood experience, and sociodemographic characteristics? Although floodplain residents were more likely to be White and have higher incomes, respondents who were of a racial/ethnic minority, were older, had less education, and were living in floodplains were more likely to report flood experiences and concern about flooding. Flood risk management approaches need to address social as well as physical sources of vulnerability to floods and recognize social sources of variation in flood experiences and concern.

AB  - Urban ecological restoration typically employs western science approaches to restore degraded ecosystems. As yet, few restoration groups acknowledge the history of these degraded urban sites, despite connections, past and present, that root Indigenous Peoples (and others) in these lands. Here, we promote partnership with Indigenous communities from project inception and present two successful case studies from Aotearoa New Zealand. We specifically note that partnering and building relationships with Indigenous communities in restoration efforts require recognition of power inequalities and injustices. We consider success to include both restoration of ecological function and biodiversity and reconnection of all communities to urban ecosystems.

AB  - This paper uses ethnography to explore young people's engagement with a UK based intervention designed to promote a meaningful connection to locally accessible urban nature. During the intervention seven young people (aged between 11 and 12 years old) from a socially disadvantaged area, took part in three two-hour sessions held in a patch of urban nature close to their school. During the sessions, facilitators and teachers worked collabo-ratively with the young people as they explored the space and took part in den building activities. All sessions were recorded using audio and video equipment and a case study approach was utilised to explore the experi-ences of two young people involved in the project as they worked with practitioners and each other to develop a meaningful connection to the space. Analysis highlights the importance of youth centred interventions which use practical activities to develop a sense of belonging and wellbeing. These issues are discussed in relation to traditional nature engagement interventions and recommendations for practitioners are put forward.

AB  - Triple-bottom-line outcomes from resource management and conservation, where conservation goals and equity in social outcomes are maximized while overall costs are minimized, remain a highly sought-after ideal. However, despite widespread recognition of the importance that equitable distribution of benefits or costs across society can play in conservation success, little formal theory exists for how to explicitly incorporate equity into conservation planning and prioritization. Here, we develop that theory and implement it for three very different case studies in California (United States), Raja Ampat (Indonesia), and the wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to achieve conservation objectives, such that similar conservation outcomes can be possible with greater equity, to a point. However, these case studies also produce a range of trade-off typologies between equity and conservation, depending on how one defines and measures social equity, including direct (linear) and no trade-off. Important gaps remain in our understanding, most notably how equity influences probability of conservation success, in turn affecting the actual ability to achieve conservation objectives. Results here provide an important foundation for moving the science and practice of conservation planning and broader spatial planning in general toward more consistently achieving efficient, equitable, and effective outcomes.

AB  - Urban agriculture continues to gain traction in cities across North America. Many such efforts pursue social justice objectives with mixed success. This paper examines two urban agriculture projects in Toronto, Canada, to demonstrate the challenges of pursuing social justice goals via urban agriculture. Despite a long history of municipal and civil society support for urban agriculture in Toronto, stakeholders continually face bureaucratic obstacles that make growing food on public land inaccessible for groups without significant resources. Relying on Swyngedouw's theories of the post-political condition, this paper finds that a seemingly depoliticized food governance focusing exclusively on processes of urban agriculture obscures questions about who benefits from such processes, which can pave the way for uneven development. This research contributes to literature on environmental justice and food governance by attending to municipal challenges to achieving social justice goals in urban agriculture projects.

AB  - Two schools have dominated environmental justice literature: the race school and the class school. The class school tends to explain cases of environmental injustice exclusively from the vantage point of socioeconomic differences. The race school, however, foregrounds racism as an explanatory framework, while still acknowledging the relative role of class in this regard. Both schools tend to base their analyses primarily upon research findings from empirical/geographical studies. This paper joins its voice with the recently growing body of literature that has started to call for the need to transcend this cumbersome race-class dichotomy and move beyond the mundane pattern of case studies research and statistical data gathering. Specifically, it propounds a theory of spa-cial formation that illuminates the parallel processes of spatial discrimination and racial subjugation, stresses the historical contingency of environmental racism, and highlights the role of the various cultural images, representations and meanings attached to black geographies in laying the moral and ideational foundations facilitating the process of spatial and environmental discrimination against African Americans.

Building on significant work on these themes from Indigenous, Black, and Feminist scholarship, and other varied traditions, this piece explores and elaborates the potential regarding the elicitation, sharing, and analysis of stories for nature-society studies. Specifically, the piece examines core contributions along these lines to date, as well as the methodological, analytical, political, and transformative potential of story and storytelling to enrich, broaden, and deepen work in nature-society, political ecology, and environmental justice. All told, focus on story and storytelling, offers a number of relevant and rich openings to understand and engage complex, unequal, and dynamic socio-natures. While these elements have been present in nature-society work from some traditions and lines of inquiry, the time is ripe to broaden and deepen these engagements to more fully imagine, and respond to, key nature-society challenges.

It does this from five perspectives: innovation and competitiveness; globalization and urbanization; social and environmental justice; local and regional development; and industrial policy. It argues that the future of regional studies requires approaches that, in combination, result in the pushing on (by creating), pushing off (by consolidating), pushing back (by critiquing) and pushing forward (by collectively constructing) the field.

AB  - Urban agriculture, experiencing a resurgence across the Global North, features prominently in food system sustainability and urban resilience discourse, planning, and policy. Research, however, indicates that racialized gentrification tends to accompany urban agriculture, similar to a phenomenon documented with other green space. This study used remote sensing to map home (N = 478) and community (N = 130) gardens across Detroit, an emblematic legacy city undergoing significant redevelopment. Despite being a city in which seventy-eight percent of the residents are Black, spatial regression revealed that gardens in Detroit are actually more prevalent in non-Black-neighborhoods. Community gardens predominate in neighborhoods where residents are younger, wealthier, and college-educated, while home gardens are more numerous in areas with high rates of home ownership. Modeling also indicated that gardens are in areas with limited access to fresh produce. Contrary to the literature, we did not find a correlation between the presence of gardens and potential gentrification. Gardens, however, are consistently more prevalent in neighborhoods that have stabilized after experiencing high rates of vacancy, foreclosure, and housing demolition. These results have three important implications. First, redevelopment processes in legacy cities such as Detroit, through urban agriculture and other green infrastructure, are likely to lead to garden distributions different than those found in cities with more typical development trajectories. Second, the research calls into question generalized assumptions that expanding green space inevitably leads to gentrification, necessitating deeper investigation of these dynamics in diverse urban settings. And finally, racialized narratives around gardens and redevelopment risk undermining long-standing connections between Detroit's gardens and environmental justice.

AB  - Urban heat, the combined effect of heatwaves and urban heat islands (UHIs), is a severe challenge for many cities around the world. While there have been numerous studies on urban heat, society's understanding of it is still insufficient, hindering its mitigation and adaptation. This paper aims to investigate people's vulnerability to, and perception, awareness and knowledge of, urban heat. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 562 re-spondents in the hot and humid city of Chongqing, China in the summer of 2020. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test and logistic regression. Results indicated that urban heat is generally understood as having a moderate severity, while there is limited knowledge of heat-related risks. The perceived heat-related psychological impacts are more severe than physiological impacts. There is limited awareness and knowledge of heat-impact reduction methods. Nevertheless, people's awareness, perception and knowledge of urban heat increase once they suffer heat-induced impacts, indicating exposure/ experience-driven awareness and knowledge. Moreover, climate injustice among different groups (e.g. gender, age, education, income, health) of people related to heat challenges was identified. People's perception, vulnerability, awareness and knowledge increased with age, but interestingly decreased with increasing edu-cation level and improved health conditions. Economic factor was not critical to heat-related responses. Men could be more vulnerable to physiological symptoms and daily functioning than women. The results of this study provide an understanding of urban heat perception and adaptive knowledge, enabling practitioners and policy makers to formulate effective urban heat mitigation and adaptation policies and regulations.

AB  - While electricity production has a significant impact on air quality, the opposite effect has been suspected but not empirically demonstrated. Now, using pollution and electricity consumption data, He et al. show the impact of air pollution on domestic electricity consumption. Accurate assessment of environmental externalities of particulate air pollution is crucial to the design and evaluation of environmental policies. Current evaluations mainly focus on direct damages resulting from exposure, missing indirect co-damages that occur through interactions among the externalities, human behaviours and technologies. Our study provides an empirical assessment of such co-damages using customer-level daily and hourly electricity data of a large sample of residential and commercial consumers in Arizona, United States. We use an instrumental variable panel regression approach and find that particulate matter air pollution increases electricity consumption in residential buildings as well as in retail and recreation service industries. Air pollution also reduces the actual electricity generated by distributed-solar panels. Lower-income and minority ethnic groups are disproportionally impacted by air pollution and pay higher electricity bills associated with pollution avoidance, stressing the importance of incorporating the consideration of environmental justice in energy policy-making.

AB  - With the change in China's social structure and the emergence of the middle class, severe environmental pollution is stimulating the demand for social environmental justice in China. Facing the absence of environmental justice theory and related empirical research in China, this article introduces a general equilibrium theory model of environmental justice. It proves that under Pareto efficiency, environmental justice is difficult to achieve in a competitive market, and environmental inequality is the normal state. An econometric model is established based on demographic and socioeconomic factors, comparison with the US principle of environmental justice, and characteristic perspectives in the Chinese context. The study takes 444 counties in China's four major economic zones, the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and Chengdu-Chongqing, as the units for empirical analysis of the regional distribution of environmental inequality. The results indicate that rural residents bear higher environmental risks than urban residents. There are different environmentally vulnerable groups and environmental disparities among the four economic zones; notably, minorities in the Pearl River Delta, poor residents in Chengdu-Chongqing, and rural residents in the Yangtze River Delta bear the environmental inequality caused by industrial gas pollution. However, migrants, including rural migrants, do not disproportionately suffer environmental risks caused by industrial pollution at the county level. This paper provides theoretical support and a systematic analytical framework for the study of China's environmental justice issues. We describe China's environmental inequality status and provide a reference for the design of environmental justice interventions.

AB  - Western Australia's Ord River Irrigation Scheme has been controversial since its establishment more than twenty-Jive years ago. A substantial expansion of the scheme, known as Ord Stage Two, is currently underway as a joint project of the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments. In this study I examine and compare Stages One and Two in the context of the significant social and economic changes that have occurred during this period focusing on attitudes to, and conceptualisations of, nature and the human place in it. Despite a context in which consideration of both Aboriginal and environmental issues is now integrated into the development process, three colonial themes persist in the rhetoric of Stage Two. These are the empty landscape, the invisible Aborigine, and the idealisation of agricultural land use. When expressed together these three help to naturalise the development process as both inevitable and strategically implemented. The contradictions inherent in this process enhance existing doubts about the social and ecological sustainability of continuing attempts to 'develop' Australia's north.

AB  - We introduce the new concept of embodied energy injustices in order to encourage integrative, systemic, trans-boundary assessment of the global implications and responsibility of energy-policy decisions. Embodied energy injustices reframe considerations of energy justice to explicitly consider hidden and distant injustices (upstream or downstream) arising from the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of energy resources. We assess the embodied energy injustices connected to the decision to decommission a coal-fired power plant in Salem, Massachusetts, US, and its replacement with a natural-gas-fired power station. Cerrejon open-pit coalmine in La Guajira, Colombia, powered the Salem plant for over a decade. Fracked gas from Pennsylvania now supplies fuel for the new power station. Comparing the extraction of these two very different fuels reveals multiple parallel injustices. But the regulatory environment fails to account for the different constituencies, jurisdictions and effects that fall outside the formal remit of existing impact assessments. We therefore call for mandatory transboundary impact assessments of large-scale energy-related projects, which explicitly integrate previously unrecognized social-environmental harms and injustices. Expanding energy law and policy discussions to incorporate embodied energy injustices can enhance sustainable energy governance and enable corporate accountability for the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Linking chains of energy injustice-by revealing their interconnected positions along fossil-fuel supply chains-may help generate and unite powerful trans-local solidarity movements, which politicize local struggles within wider national, regional and global energy politics.

AB  - This paper explores the force of automation and its contradictions and resistances within (and beyond) the financial sector, with a specific focus on computational practices of credit-scoring and lending. It examines the operations and promotional discourses of fintech start-ups LendUp.com and Elevate.com that offer small loans to the sub-prime consumers in exchange for access to their online social media and mobile data, and Zest AI and LenddoEFL that sell automated decision-making tools to verify identity and assess risk. Reviewing their disciplinary reputational demands and impacts on users and communities, especially women and people of colour, the paper argues that the automated reimagination of credit and creditability disavows the formative design of its AI and redefines moral imperatives about character to align with the interests of digital capitalism. The economic, social and cultural crises precipitated by the Covid-19 pandemic have only underscored the internal contradictions of these developments, and a variety of debt resistance initiatives have emerged, aligned with broader movements for social, economic, and climate justice around the globe. Cooperative lending circles such as the Mission Asset Fund, activist groups like #NotMyDebt, and Debt Collective, a radical debt abolition movement, are examples of collective attempts to rehumanize credit and debt and resist the appropriative practices of contemporary digital finance capitalism in general. Running the gamut from accommodationist to entirely radical, these experiments in mutual aid, debt refusal, and community-building provide us with roadmaps for challenging capitalism and re-thinking credit, debt, power, and personhood within and beyond the current crises.

AB  - To meet net-zero emissions and cost targets for power production, recent analysis indicates that photovoltaic (PV) capacity in the United States could exceed 1 TW by 2050 alongside comparable levels of energy storage capacity, mostly from batteries. For comparison, the total U.S. utility-scale power capacity from all energy sources in 2020 was 1.2 TW, of which solar satisfied approximately 3%. With such massive scales of deployment, questions have arisen regarding issues of material supply for manufacturing, end-of-life management of technologies, environmental impacts across the life cycle, and economic costs to both individual consumers and society at large. A set of solutions to address these issues center on the development of a circular economy - shifting from a take-make-waste linear economic model to one that retains the value of materials and products as long as possible, recovering materials at end of life to recirculate back into the economy. With limited global experience, scholars and practitioners have begun to investigate circular economy pathways, focusing on applying novel technologies and analytical methods to fast-growing sectors like renewable energy. This critical review aims to synthesize the growing literature to identify key insights, gaps, and opportunities for research and implementation of a circular economy for two of the leading technologies that enable the transition to a renewable energy economy: solar PV and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We apply state-of-the-science systematic literature review procedures to critically analyze over 3,000 publications on the circular economy of solar PV and LIBs, categorizing those that pass a series of objective screens in ways that can illuminate the current state of the art, highlight existing impediments to a circular economy, and recommend future technological and analytical research. We conclude that while neither PV nor LIB industries have reached a circular economy, they are both on a path towards increased circularity. Based on our assessment of the state of current literature and scientific understanding, we recommend research move beyond its prior emphasis on recycling technology development to more comprehensively investigate other CE strategies, more holistically consider economic, environmental and policy aspects of CE strategies, increase leveraging of digital information systems that can support acceleration towards a CE, and to continue to study CE-related aspects of LIB and PV markets.

This analysis traces emissions totaling 914 GtCO(2)e-63 % of cumulative worldwide emissions of industrial CO2 and methane between 1751 and 2010-to the 90 "carbon major" entities based on the carbon content of marketed hydrocarbon fuels (subtracting for non-energy uses), process CO2 from cement manufacture, CO2 from flaring, venting, and own fuel use, and fugitive or vented methane. Cumulatively, emissions of 315 GtCO(2)e have been traced to investor-owned entities, 288 GtCO(2)e to state-owned enterprises, and 312 GtCO(2)e to nation-states. Of these emissions, half has been emitted since 1986. The carbon major entities possess fossil fuel reserves that will, if produced and emitted, intensify anthropogenic climate change. The purpose of the analysis is to understand the historic emissions as a factual matter, and to invite consideration of their possible relevance to public policy.

AB  - This paper examines the EIA process and its effectiveness in addressing the impacts of a 190 km long national highway project along the Karnataka coast. We analyse the quality and relevance of the environmental clearance conditions established by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and discusses their potential implications. The findings underline that most of the conditions that pertained to the prevention of pollution, restoration of mangroves, and protection of biodiversity lacked a scientific basis and specific information required for effective implementation. The MoEF&CC also overlooked the social impact of the project and underplayed its own role in ensuring fair compensation to project affected communities for the loss of their land and other livelihoods. The paper concludes by promulgating a long list of irrelevant and ineffective environmental conditions that represent greenwashing because it could misguide affected communities and other stakeholders by creating the impression the state is exercising due diligence in protecting the environment.

AB  - This paper takes on the important concepts of inclusion and sustainability, in both their broad and discursive understandings, to map out the interrelations that teachers, who work within different areas of the Austrian school system, make between different, key aspects of their work and organization. The complex intersections of school organization, sustainability, and inclusion were analyzed following a situational analysis approach that made use of different types of mapping (e.g., messy, situational, positional) of data gathered from semi-structured interviews with a teacher-training student and teachers positioned across the Austrian school system, some of whom with experience in classrooms with, for example, refugee, d/Deaf, and neurodivergent students. The findings from these data display ways of being oriented towards sustainable and responsible as well as inclusive engagement, especially within educational spheres. By and large, what emerged from the data was the clear result that school organization as a whole plays one of the biggest roles in determining whether or not non-mandatory subjects such as "sustainability" are given space and time in the classroom. Therefore, if we want to promote topics on sustainability and a focus on climate justice in education, efforts need to be made to bring these topics into the official curriculum.

AB  - Why do residents of a contaminated area actively organize to formalize their land tenure and continually invest scarce resources in the fortification of their homes, despite their high-risk locations? Existing research documents the collective struggles of residents of contaminated communities to leave toxic areas or to confront polluting industries. Drawing from long-term ethnographic fieldwork in an informal settlement located next to a highly polluting petrochemical complex in Esmeraldas, Ecuador, this article presents the case of a marginalized community that is not only well-aware of its toxic exposure but also actively organizing and investing time and resources to ensure its permanence in the area. This article shows that the strenuous circumstances under which families moved into the neighborhood after multiple displacements, their continued struggle to remain there along with their longing for housing stability have contributed to their extended exposure to the poisonous toxic externalities of the neighboring petrochemical industry.

AB  - Waste is increasingly being used as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels in cement kilns worldwide. This has led to the emergence of socio-environmental conflicts in many countries in which local groups articulate a common struggle against the cement industry, a new target within the international anti-incineration movement. This case report aims at characterising this emerging movement against waste incineration in cement kilns in Spain and explores its main four discursive dimensions in relation to the concept of environmental justice. We argue that the movement against waste incineration in cement kilns is incipient and growing in Spain, and it uses a distinctive vocabulary to refer to the environmental justice dimension of the struggle.

AB  - Through an investigation of the political economy of wind park development in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, I explore the contested meaning of environmental justice. I contend that, despite their seemingly benign image, wind parks in Oaxaca operate within a spatially abstracted, colonial epistemology of capital-centred development. This involves a remaking of space and an appropriation of nature on behalf of capital. Concomitantly, it also involves a process of dispossession for Indigenous communities, foreclosing alternative pathways of development. I contrast this project of place-making with a subaltern-centred conception of environmental justice informed by Indigenous resistance.

AB  - This study draws on environmental and energy justice research to develop the analysis of energy infrastructure opposition from a justice perspective. A comprehensive data set of 70 cases of opposition to socioenvironmental effects of proposed electricity power lines in North America was developed. The analysis of strategic frames used by opposition groups provides the basis for an evaluation of theoretical categories of justice, their empirical operationalization, and their limits. Four categories of justice are associated with eight of the 12 main types of frames. In turn, frames are connected to types of opposition actors in the analysis of sequences of justice-related actions and outcomes. Subnational governments are important actors in many cases that have outcomes of remediation and/or a decision not to build the line. Coalition breadth and opposition from federal government actors, marginalized groups, and environmentalists are also associated with those outcomes.

AB  - Using wastewater accumulating around rural waterpoints to irrigate community gardens, borehole-garden permaculture (BGP) presents a method of sustainable water management. BGP also presents public health benefits through the removal of stagnant water around boreholes, key Malaria breeding grounds, and through providing year-round food to supplement diets. By analysing a dataset of over 100,000 cases, this research examines the awareness and adoption of BGP across Malawi. Generalised linear models identified significant variables influencing BGP awareness and uptake revealing that socioeconomic, biophysical and waterpoint-specific variables influenced both the awareness and adoption of BGP. BGP had low uptake in Malawi with only 2.4% of communities surveyed practising BGP while 43.0% of communities were aware of BGP. Communities in areas with unreliable rainfall and high malaria susceptibility had low BGP awareness despite BGP being particularly beneficial to these communities. This work suggests that future work in the promotion of BGP should focus their efforts within these areas. Furthermore, this work highlights the value of community networks in knowledge sharing and suggests that such social capital could be further used by NGOs and the Government of Malawi in the promotion of BGP and other sustainable practices.

AB  - Using a sample of households nested in census tracts in 24 metropolitan areas over four time points, this study provides a robust test of the determinants of neighborhood satisfaction, taking into account the census tract context. Consistent with social disorganization theory, the presence of racial/ethnic heterogeneity and single-parent households consistently reduced neighborhood satisfaction. Those perceiving more social or physical disorder were considerably less satisfied with the neighborhood, and perceiving more crime showed an accelerating negative effect on satisfaction. Furthermore, the effect of perceiving crime was exacerbated in tracts with a distressed labor market or the presence of disengaged youth. There was consistent evidence that those with more economic investment (homeowners) or social investment (married residents and parents) in the neighborhood are more satisfied. On the other hand, longer-term residents did not report more satisfaction, nor did general residential stability in the tract increase satisfaction.

AB  - This study focuses on segregation as it plays out at the micro-level of housing unit transition. Employing a unique sample that places housing units into micro-neighborhoods and census tracts, this study tests whether the characteristics of the previous residents of the unit, the local micro-neighborhood, or the broader tract best explain the race/ethnicity of the new residents in a housing unit. The results show that the racial/ethnic composition of the local micro-neighborhood has even stronger effects on the race/ethnicity of the new residents than does the racial/ethnic composition of the broader census tract. The results also reveal that even when the racial/ethnic composition of these two contexts are accounted for, the race/ethnicity of the prior residents has a very strong effect on the race/ethnicity of the new residents. I consider possible explanations for this household-level effect. One new theoretical explanation I put forward is that prospective residents use the race/ethnicity of the prior residents as a signal regarding the neighborhood's appropriateness for them; I test and find that this hypothesized signaling effect is even stronger in certain micro-neighborhood, neighborhood, and county contexts.

AB  - This study employs latent trajectory models measuring the level of toxic waste over a decade in the cities of six highly populated, ethnically diverse, counties in southern California from 1990 to 2000 in 3001 tracts. We find that tracts with 15% more Latinos are exposed to 84.3% more toxic waste than an average tract over this time period and tracts with 15% more Asians are exposed to 33.7% more toxic waste. Conversely, tracts with one standard deviation more residents with at least a bachelor's degree (15.5%) are exposed to 88.8% less toxic waste than an average tract. We also found that these effects were considerably weaker when using the raw pounds of toxic waste rather than the toxicity-weighted measure, suggesting that future research will want to account for the toxicity of the waste.

AB  - This paper explores dynamics of conflict over forests in Vietnam, as the country lays the groundwork for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Drawing on a case study in Lam Dong province and applying an environmental justice lens, we examine how various social actors assert claims over forests and how these claims invoke different notions of justice, authority and identity. Our analysis highlights that the development and implementation of the project has generated renewed competing claims and conflicts over forests among social actors. Underlying these conflicts there are incompatible notions of justice and associated rights, which lead different actors to accord legitimacy variously to the global norms brought about by REDD+, the customary resource practices of indigenous people, or to the state's laws. We show that the negotiations over forests in REDD+ reflect the influence of the specific historical and political-economic settings in which REDD+ activities take place, including pre-existing conflicts over forests and power relations underpinning forest management. From a policy perspective, our research suggests that any attempts to introduce simplified and uniform regulations for forest governance in REDD+ should be avoided, since local institutions and conceptions of justice will significantly influence what is regarded as legitimate policy and can thus be endorsed as inspiration for sustainable forest governance.Key policy insights REDD+ in Vietnam has spurred contestations over who is legitimately entitled to govern and manage forests.Claims and conflicts over forests can be explained by incompatible and distinct notions of justice, authority and identity.Contestations over justice pose radical challenges to any global and national efforts that attempt to implement simplified rules and ideas for forest based-climate change mitigation.Attention to justice, especially to compatibility and differences in ideas about justice, is crucial for sustainable forest governance.

AB  - This chapter adopts a contextual vulnerability approach to examine the urbanizing Truong Yen commune in Trang An scenic landscape complex, a natural and cultural UNESCO World Heritage site in the Red River Delta of Vietnam. Trang An exemplifies the rise of ecotourism in Vietnam as a solution to the country's need for both economic growth and environmental protection, while responding to climate change adaptation and mitigation challenges. Located in an area undergoing peri-urbanization, Trang An contributes to the fostering of a 'greener' urban development pattern while providing local communities with less climate-sensitive livelihoods. However, new vulnerabilities emerge from this transition as a result of redefined power relations and differential access to resources. Our critical approach provides a more nuanced picture of a project that is often represented as a success story. While pitfalls are inevitable in such a transformational project, the lived experience of local residents reveals the complex, elusive, and inefficient governance between the various stakeholders on the management level and begs troubling questions about environmental and social justice.

AB  - What principles should guide how society distributes environmental benefits and burdens? Like many liberal theories of justice, Martha Nussbaum's "capabilities approach" does not adequately address this question. The author argues that the capabilities approach should be extended to account for the environment's instrumental value to human capabilities. Given this instrumental value, protecting capabilities requires establishing certain environmental conditions as an independent "meta-capability." When combined with Nussbaum's nonprocedural method of political justification, this extension provides the basis for adjudicating environmental justice claims. The author applies this extended capabilities approach to assess the distribution of benefits and burdens associated with climate change.

In so doing, it seeks to deepen historical-theoretical understandings of the racialized division of nature and humanity making possible the global problem of soil erosion by the 1930s and forming the heart of the ecological rift of capitalism. The framework developed here challenges prevalent conceptions of the Dust Bowl, in which colonial and racial-domination aspects of the crisis are invisible, and affirms the necessity of deeper conceptions of environmental (in)justice.

AB  - When examining environmental justice and injustice, surprisingly few studies have examined the experiences of Native Americans. In filling this gap, we criticize and build on environmental and political sociology. We make the case and provide evidence that the US. military pursues a pattern of environmental "bads" that cannot be reduced to capitalism and that coercive state policies can mold the spatial distribution of people relative to environmental dangers. Our contribution, then, is both theoretical and substantive. First, we recast the environmental sociology literature by specifying the scope conditions under which a "treadmill of production" and a "treadmill of destruction" are applicable. Specifically, we argue that a "treadmill of destruction" is driven by a distinct logic of geopolitics that cannot be reduced to capitalism. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the "treadmill of destruction" by examining the environmental inequality endured by Native Americans at the hands of the US. military. We have collected data on a large number of military bases that have been closed but remain dangerous due to unexploded ordnance. We provide evidence that Native American lands tend to be located in the same county as such hazardous sites. In the twentieth century, the United States fought and won two global wars and prevailed in a sustained Cold War The geopolitical demands of remaining the world leading military power pushed the United States to produce, test, and deploy weapons of unprecedented toxicity. Native Americans have been left exposed to the dangers of this toxic legacy.

AB  - Where governments have failed to protect their citizens from the environmental and social impacts of industrial development, social movements have often arisen in response. However, other community members may defend sometimes violently the same corporations that are targeted by their peers. The contributions to this cluster explore some of the ways in which communities disagree about how to respond to the ecological impacts of industry, their reactions inflected by differential concerns about economics, landscapes, indigenous rights and human health. The three studies illustrate the heterogeneity that communities display in their interpretations of, and responses to, industrial development, and demonstrate how this diversity informs, in crucial ways, grassroots activism against the development, or acceptance of it. In particular, this cluster examines how community-scale actions, and the interpretations of industry's impacts upon which these actions are based, are contested through multiple discourses centred around community identities and boundaries.

AB  - This foreword explains why the success of COP21 is dependent upon its capacity to operate the paradigm shift announced in Cancun. It comes back to the recent history of the Conference of the Parties and shows the reasons for the emergence of the notion of 'equitable rights to sustainable development (EASD)' which enlarged the concept of equity beyond 'burden sharing'. It shows why this paradigm shift is a categorical imperative to break the self-defeating process of negotiations since the first COP of Berlin in 1995. It then demonstrate how the contributions to this special issue a) help understanding the deadlocks of a 'sharing the pie' logic in the climate affair and why it is inappropriate and diversionary to assess climate justice through 'fairness' of emissions allocations as the sole criteria b) show how to enforce the EADS principle in the current adverse context of a world economy weakened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

AB  - This paper discusses the productive role of storytelling in community struggles for environmental justice. The individual and collective task of environmental justice storytelling highlights where the politics of pollution intersect with geographical imaginations. Storytelling takes on a productive role in transforming localized and individual emotions and experiences of environmental injustice into public knowledge that is performed in the world. This paper draws on a case study of nuclear waste disposal at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. I focus on how storytelling enacts scenarios of environmental witnessing and transformation that hold together a plurality of presences, absences, action and imagination, past histories and hope for the future.

AB  - Urban heat stress poses a major risk to public health. Case studies of individual cities suggest that heat exposure, like other environmental stressors, may be unequally distributed across income groups. There is little evidence, however, as to whether such disparities are pervasive. We combine surface urban heat island (SUHI) data, a proxy for isolating the urban contribution to additional heat exposure in built environments, with census tract-level demographic data to answer these questions for summer days, when heat exposure is likely to be at a maximum. We find that the average person of color lives in a census tract with higher SUHI intensity than non-Hispanic whites in all but 6 of the 175 largest urbanized areas in the continental United States. A similar pattern emerges for people living in households below the poverty line relative to those at more than two times the poverty line. Individual exposure to heat is associated with adverse health and economic outcomes. Here, the authors show that people of color and people living in poverty bear a disproportionate burden of urban heat exposure in almost all major cities in the continental United States.

AB  - Transitions to non-nuclear energy systems are assumed to be positive phenomena. However, there is existing literature on how such transitions can result in new injustices. Since 2016, the government of Taiwan has promoted renewable energy and pursued the objective of establishing a nuclear-free homeland by 2025. Despite public enthusiasm for this green shift, there is a danger that concerns over accompanying environmental and energy injustices are being ignored. This paper addresses the gap between enthusiasm for environmental reforms and blindness to possible social consequences by applying procedural justice to an examination of the shift in energy policy in Taiwan. In 2018 and 2019, 45 interviews were conducted with relevant governmental entities, academics, industry, advocacy organisations (including pro- and anti-nuclear groups), and senior journalists, with the aim of shedding light on how Taiwan's energy transition and phasing out of nuclear energy by 2025 could both represent a commitment to environmental justice and yet result in the creation of new injustices. This research contributes to the wider debate on procedural injustices arising from transitions to non-nuclear energy sources. We emphasise the need to consider procedural justice in green transitions, and assert that doing so will help achieve the smoothest possible energy transition.

AB  - To understand the social distribution of environmental hazards, methods to assess cumulative effects and their health implications are needed. We developed a cumulative environmental hazard index integrating environmental data on pollution sites, air quality, and pesticide use; a social vulnerability index to measure residents' resources to prevent or mitigate health effects; and a health index. We found that communities in California's San Joaquin Valley with high social vulnerability face more environmental burdens and have worse health conditions.

AB  - Urban parks provide spaces and facilities for children's physical activity (PA) and can be a free resource in low-income communities. This study examined whether neighborhood characteristics were associated with children's park use and park-based moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in low-income diverse communities and how associations differed between ethnic groups. Data on park visits and MVPA came from 16,402 children 5-10-years old directly observed using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities in 20 parks in low-income neighborhoods with majority Latino or Asian populations in New York City. Neighborhood characteristics included land use mix (LUM), street audits, crime rates, and an area deprivation index. We employed Poisson and negative binomial models to estimate effects of neighborhood-level variables on the number of children observed in parks and engaging in MVPA, overall and by ethnicity. Results for Asian, Latino, and African American children indicated that higher levels of LUM and pedestrian-friendly streets were associated with greater numbers of children in parks and higher MVPA across all three groups. For Asian and Latino children only, quality of environment was positively associated with MVPA, whereas level of deprivation and crime rates in the surrounding neighborhood were negatively associated with children's park-based MVPA. In contrast, a park's access to public transportation was negatively associated with number of all children observed and engaging in MVPA. Study findings suggest that park-based MVPA interventions can be informed by understanding how neighborhood characteristics facilitate and constrain park use and park-based MVPA.

AB  - This Translations contribution synthesises critical environmental social science research produced in Taiwan and published largely in Chinese. Taiwan is distinctive in east Asia in that it has had, over several decades, a relatively large and prolific community of scholars engaged with environmental justice and sustainability. This research tradition is linked to the emergence of grassroots environmentalism in response to environmental issues faced during Taiwan's rapid industrialisation, and to the democratisation of Taiwanese society from the 1980s onwards. Fuller understanding of research produced and published within in Taiwan hence yields insights for the role of social science within newly industrialising and democratising nations. Although the story of Taiwanese society's relation to environmentalism is to an extent understood in English-language literature, less prevalent are the diverse ways Taiwanese social scientists have engaged with environmental issues, the empirical case studies which have shaped their thinking, and the influences of Western environmental sociology and science and technology studies (STS) within Taiwan. By synthesising Chinese-language environmental social science literature from Taiwan, we characterise three strands of scholarship: activism and social movements; environmental controversies; and environmental governance, policy and institutions. We identify (a) the ability of communities and civil societies to affect change from within extant governance processes and (b) the local-level implications of national sustainable development rhetoric as two areas where Taiwanese scholarship may make particularly valuable contributions to work at the sustainability-environmental justice interface.

AB  - User-generated content (UGC) is a relatively young field of research; however, it has been proven useful in disciplines such as hospitality and tourism, to elicit public opinions of place usage. In landscape architecture and urban planning, UGC has been used to understand people's emotions and movement in a space, while other areas and additional functions are yet to be discovered. This paper explores the capability of UGC in revealing city-scale park management problems and the applicability of social media as a future tool in bridging visitor feedback to city parks and recreation department staff. This research analyzed the spatial characteristics and patterns of Google Maps review quantity, rating score, and review comments. The results of this pilot study indicate the spatial and structural features of the Chicago parks and demonstrate distribution problems, financial investment priority concerns, park usage characteristics, and user preferences of the park attributes. Findings affirm that user-generated online reviews can be used as an alternative and self-reporting data source to effectively assess the natural performance and users' experience of city parks and can potentially serve as an evaluative tool for public park management.

AB  - This paper examines the association between the frequency of use of urban green spaces (UGS) and the subjective well-being (SWB) of Mexico City's residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey (N = 1954) regarding individuals' perceptions and use of UGS and their SWB, evaluated through the short version of the Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale. Multilevel mixed-effects regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between the frequency of UGS use and SWB, including individual and municipal level characteristics as covariates. Our results suggest that respondents who used UGS once or more per week during the pandemic reported higher SWB scores (8.7%) than those with zero visits. These findings have public policy implications that could enhance the role of UGS in urban environments during times of crisis.

AB  - While there are excellent policy and academic foundations for thinking about and making sense of urban climate action and questions of justice and climate change independently, there is less work that considers their intersection. The nature and dynamics of, and requirements for, a just urban transition (JUT)-the fusion of climate action and justice concerns at the urban scale-are not well understood. In this review article we seek to rectify this by first examining the different strains of justice scholarship (environmental, energy, climate, urban) that are informing and should inform JUT. We then turn to a discussion of just transitions in general, tracing the history of the term and current understandings in the literature. These two explorations provide a foundation for considering both scholarly and policy-relevant JUT agendas. We identify what is still needed to know in order to recognize, study, and foster JUT.

AB  - We examine spatial patterns of three types of Environmental Protection Agency violation, hazardous waste, water, and air quality, at the facility level. Since facilities operate independently, our null hypothesis is that their violations should be spatially randomly distributed. That is, we do not expect to observe spatial clusters of violations. In addition, systemic factors such as socio-demographic characteristics as well as environmental justice indices should not correlate with violations. Empirically, we find both hypotheses are refuted. Our findings confirm that environmental inequalities have been exacerbated by underlying social vulnerabilities, particularly in the case of Native Indian territories, which consistently show a disproportionately high number of environmental violations. We identify 'hot spots', spatial clusters where the number of violations is higher than expected in such a way that cannot be explained by socio-demographic or environmental factors. These hot spots call for local case studies to further investigate causes of spatial clustering of violations.

AB  - To confront the powerful forces of neoliberalism and hyper-nationalism, alliances between social and environmental activists are necessary. However, efforts to forge effective cross-movement alliances often run-up against differences in core political values. How can we make sense of the political ideologies around which socio-ecological engagements coalesce or fracture? We outline an interpretive scheme that analyzes and compares the engagements between various types of social entities, particularly those seeking to bridge social and environmental politics. We then employ two case studies - environmentalists and labor unions, and environmentalists and immigrants' rights groups in the United States - in order to illustrate the utility of the interpretive scheme. We conclude by arguing that this interpretive scheme can help identify sources of friction that arise in efforts to build socio-ecological coalitions, the grounds on which common ideological visions are negotiated, and the priorities of the resulting coalitions.

AB  - This paper examines research on adventurous physical activities in nature from the perspective of the sentient body. Drawing upon ethnographic and autoethnographic research, I examine what has been termed 'peak' happenings or 'flow' which many who practise adventurous activities claim to experience through their whole body when in the 'zone'. I consider the concept of 'edgework', voluntary risk-taking, and insightful mobile and social understanding of the relationships between body, emotions and the elements, where the adventurous activity is experienced and interpreted as oneness with nature or expressed as 'spiritual' not only in high but also low risk nature-based sport. I then consider if and in what ways these knowledges may bring about greater understanding and action in relation to social and environmental justice. I argue that adventurous activities/nature-based sport may provide processes and practices that are alternative or complementary to traditional sporting 'body techniques' or 'body pedagogics'. I suggest that modern embodied adventurous practices in nature challenge dominant narratives of body/mind separation and potentially provide a pedagogic process fostering kinetic empathy. Finally I draw attention to the paradox of (re)-presenting sensorial experiences of sport in nature and ask for consideration on how we interconnect with the environment when we participate in adventureous nature-based sports.

AB  - This paper investigates the values and priorities reflected in a Canadian pipeline review: The National Energy Board (NEB) decision on Line 9. Theories of energy justice guided analysis of evidence presented at NEB hearings, the NEB's explanation of its decision, and a Supreme Court challenge. We find that several aspects of energy justice were weak in the NEB process. First, a project-specific scope obstructed the pursuit of equity within and between generations: the pipeline's contributions to climate change, impacts of the oil sands, and cumulative encroachment on Indigenous lands were excluded from review. Second, the NEB created a hierarchy of knowledge: it considered evidence of potential spill impacts as hypothetical while accepting as fact the proponent's claim that it could prevent and manage spills. Third, recognition of diversity remained elusive: Indigenous nations' dissatisfaction with the process challenged the NEB's interpretation of meaningful consultation and procedural fairness. To address the challenges of climate change and reconciliation between Indigenous and settler nations, it is crucial to identify which kinds of evidence decision-makers recognize as valid and which they exclude. Ideas from energy justice can help support actions to improve the public acceptability of energy decisions, as well as to foster greater Indigenous autonomy.

AB  - What are the features of a good regulatory review process? In this paper we identify criteria for 'good process' drawn from a combined reading of the environmental justice and process literature. We then apply these criteria to a case study, assessing four versions of Canadian regulatory review: CEAA 1992, CEAA 2012, the 2017 Expert Panel report, and IAA 2019. We aim to make two contributions. First, we propose a set of 'good process' criteria that we hope can be widely applied, reflecting on complementarities and tensions that arise from combining two bodies of scholarship. Second, we identify areas where Canadian review processes have improved over time and those where significant work remains to be done. This work seeks to make a constructive intervention at a time when energy and industrial projects around the world face strong challenges in the legal, political and public domains.

AB  - To what extent does John Rawls' theory of international justice meet the normative challenges posed by climate change? There are two broadly compatible Rawlsian ways of addressing climate change. The first alternative is based on the two principles that Rawls applies to the domains of international and intergenerational justice (the Principle of Assistance, and the Principle of Just Savings). The second alternative starts from Rawls' general theory of international justice, in particular his idea of a Society of Peoples, which is an idealized vision of a peaceful and stable association of peoples that are internally well-ordered, and share a desire to respect and uphold international law. Given (a) the statutes peoples are willing to observe, (b) the defining characteristics of peoples, and (c) the fact that Rawls indicates that his own rendering of international law is incomplete, there may be grounds for proposing an additional statute, or an amendment, to The Law of Peoples, that pertains to climate change and that does not contradict, but rather follows from, the general framework of the theory. The latter alternative provides a more viable account of climate justice than critics has hitherto acknowledged.

AB  - Urban aquatic restoration can be difficult to accomplish because of complications like industrial pollutants, population density, infrastructure, and expense; however, unique opportunities in urban settings, including the potential to provide benefits to many diverse people, can make urban restoration especially rewarding. The success of urban restoration projects-even those focused primarily on ecological targets-depends on community involvement and managers considering community needs. However, research on the social barriers to urban restoration and strategies managers use to overcome them is relatively rare. This work attempts to fill that gap by presenting barriers for aquatic restoration projects in urban settings and strategies to overcome them. Building from interviews with restoration managers involved in urban aquatic restoration projects in Rhode Island, we contribute through an adaptive management approach: identifying and synthesizing the lessons learned from managers' work in urban settings. Ultimately, we suggest potential for double-and triple-loop learning by disentangling and critiquing the frames and policy/power structures that influence decision making in urban aquatic restoration.

AB  - This study introduces a novel, multidimensional methodology for empirically classifying urban parks according to their physical, land cover, and built features. An equity analysis compares the resulting park types to neighborhood social characteristics, statistically and spatially evaluating who has access to which kind of park. The process can be customized to the built, geographic, and social conditions and public policy goals of other cities, but is here applied to Phoenix, Arizona. The case study application provides a proof of concept, revealing the composition and distribution of various park types and demonstrating the utility and feasibility of the classification procedure and equity analysis. Results reveal five distinct park types in Phoenix - Suburban Amenity Parks, Green Mini Parks, Native Desert Preserves, Green Neighborhood Parks, and Urban Core Parks - each exhibiting a unique mix of physical, spatial, land cover, and built characteristics. The equity analysis highlights priority areas for park improvements, potential equity concerns, and phenomena for future research. A discussion section evaluates the results in light of previous research and suggests how findings can inform sustainable and just urban park policy, planning, and management. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding nature as an outcome of organising discourses generated through relative experiences of our surroundings has been the groundwork of a political ecology that deals with the distribution of environmental justice among people with different degrees of power. In this paper, we examine how the environmental legislation and the tourism industry have constructed the term Caic, ara as a way to categorise the inhabitants of the Atlantic Forest Coast of Brazil, in ways that meet their goals, but in turn occludes the discourse of the Caic, ara themselves. Ethnographic research conducted in Ponta Negra, a small coastal community located at the heart of the Juatinga Ecological Reserve (Paraty, Rio de Janeiro State), as well as a review of key legislation, management plans and tourism materials form the empirical basis of this research. First, we offer a critical examination of the historical origin of the term Caic, ara. We then compare contradictory ideas of Caic, ara produced by Brazilian environmental legislation and the tourism industry. While the environmental legislation has characterised the Caic, ara as fallen angels who are no longer conservation allies, the tourism industry has profited by selling them as ecologically noble savages who still live in harmony with the environment. Our analysis shows how Ponta Negra people have become objects of powerful discourses of nature that hinder the recognition of their collective rights and weaken their position to negotiate for their own desires and aspirations related to their identity and livelihoods.

AB  - Urban ecological politics is shaped by both moments of concerted action and more silent perceptions and responses. Instead of only being evident in situations of organised protest, the politics of urban ecology is also manifested, in material and symbolic terms, in the daily life of the residents. The fragmentation of urban political ecology turns out to be an important element in the affirmation of post-political forms of urban governance. Those issues were the object of fieldwork research carried out in Greengairs and Ravenscraig, two towns in North Lanarkshire, near Glasgow, with the goal of unravelling the understanding and the coping mechanisms of environmentally deprived residents. The towns are permeated by a widespread, often dissimulated, political ecology that is nonetheless always present. Empirical results demonstrate that a more comprehensive handling of the political ecology of the urban is crucial in order to halt the sources of marginalisation and ecological degradation.

AB  - This paper deconstructs toxicity through a juxtaposition of a conventional epidemiological approach to pollutants and the lived experience of a highly polluted residential area next to the largest steel production plant in Europe. An ethnographic analysis of toxicity in Taranto illustrates the complexity of various temporal scales through which toxic chemicals contribute to new biological, political and moral balances. Attuning to the slow experiences of pollution is fundamental to shed light on the processes moulding aspirations to environmental justice within the community. In particular, law and bureaucracy imbue pollutants with experiential legitimacy, allowing them to be seen, contested and collectivized. I focus on the residents' and workers' dissonant experiences with the bureaucratic system to illustrate how their encounter with asbestos has profoundly shaped toxic exposure to less bureaucratically visible shapeshifting pollutants, thus contributing to a diffused sense of political resignation.

AB  - This paper explores challenges and possibilities for integrating goals of long-term sustainable development into urban planning practice, with a specific focus on local institutional conditions for sustainability transitions. The analysis is based on a qualitative single case study of a large urban development process: the development of a new city district in Hyllie in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Hyllie was branded as a flagship project for sustainable urban development, with particularly high ambitions on climate neutrality and sustainable energy consumption. Several innovative elements were initiated in the development process, for instance the "climate contract" between the municipality and large energy companies. In the paper, this climate contract is discussed as an initiative with a promising potential for sustainability transitions. In practice, however, the outcome of the development in Hyllie in terms of sustainable development is ambiguous, since the district is also framed around luxury shopping, entertainment, and an ambition to attract visitors from a long distance. The Hyllie development illustrates pre-requisites for work on sustainable development in a decentralized and market-oriented planning context. Theoretically, the analysis is inspired by the multi-level perspective (MLP) and institutional theory. The results illustrate how the development process was shaped by a complex interplay between actors with differing agendas and targets at different stages in the process. These results are applied in a general discussion of challenges and possibilities for urban planning to contribute substantially to a transition to long-term sustainable development. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the importance of considering specific local institutional conditions in strategic work for long-term sustainability.

AB  - This paper examines environmental justice in the context of questions of American-Indian tribal sovereignty through an analysis of a land-use dispute over the Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians' decision to host a high-level radioactive waste facility on their reservation in Tooele County,. Utah. The case study entails a far more intricate story than that presented in the majority of existing literature, which is dominated by analytical frameworks of environmental racism and distributive environmental justice. By elucidating the historical geography of Skull Valley and politics of tribal sovereignty, I argue that a prolonged process of historical colonialism has produced a landscape of injustice in which the tribe's choices have been structurally limited. The historical colonialism, intertwining with the capitalist political economy, has geopolitically isolated the tribe to suffer procedural environmental injustice. At the same time, the tribe has struggled to pursue self-determination through the retention of sovereignty and Goshute identity in the arenas of tribal environmental management and the environmental-justice movement. Conflict over the definition and practice of tribal sovereignty at different geographical scales reveals the social, historical, and political-economic complexity of environmental justice.

AB  - This paper advances the literature on multiple knowledge systems, showing how Traditional and Local Knowledge (TLK) systems can collaborate with scientific knowledge to advance understanding of the slow-onset effects of climate change adaptation in Latin America and the Caribbean. Such an approach implies acknowledging the cultural heterogeneity of traditional (e.g. indigenous) knowledge and local knowledge, and how this can link to practical actions to adapt to climate and global change. Integration of TLK with scientific knowledge in impact and risk assessment may be necessary to develop both short and longterm planning. The authors review how and why TLK needs to be integrated into climate change adaptation in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and offer a critical perspective and a vision toward incorporation of TLK on climate risks and adaptation in LAC.

AB  - We examine the social burden associated with resilience to environmental shocks in pre-modern societies. We argue that analyses of state-level interventions to mitigate the consequences of catastrophic events tend to isolate these measures from their larger social contexts and thereby overlook the uneven distribution of their burden across different groups. We use three cases of pre-modern societies in the northeastern Mediterranean - the sixth century Roman Empire, the tenth century Byzantine Empire, and the sixteenth century Ottoman Empire. We demonstrate how the adaptive processes that reinforced resilience at the state level incurred different burdens for those at lower levels of the social hierarchy. We found that some groups sustained losses while others gained unexpected benefits in the context of temporary systemic instability. We also found that although elites enjoyed enhanced buffers against the adverse effects in comparison with non-elites, this did not consistently guarantee them a better outcome. We conclude that the differentiated burden of resilience could in some cases entrench existing political or economic configurations, and in other cases, overturn them. Our case studies indirectly address the pressing issue of environmental justice.

AB  - We are increasingly confronted with severe social and economic impacts of environmental degradation all over the world. From a valuation perspective, environmental problems and conflicts originate from trade-offs between values. The urgency and importance to integrate nature's diverse values in decisions and actions stand out more than ever. Valuation, in its broad sense of 'assigning importance', is inherently part of most decisions on natural resource and land use. Scholars from different traditions -while moving from heuristic interdisciplinary debate to applied transdisciplinary science- now acknowledge the need for combining multiple disciplines and methods to represent the diverse set of values of nature. This growing group of scientists and practitioners share the ambition to explore how combinations of ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation tools can support real-life resource and land use decision-making. The current sustainability challenges and the ineffectiveness of single-value approaches to offer relief demonstrate that continuing along a single path is no option. We advocate for the adherence of a plural valuation culture and its establishment as a common practice, by contesting and complementing ineffective and discriminatory single-value approaches. In policy and decision contexts with a willingness to improve sustainability, integrated valuation approaches can be blended in existing processes, whereas in contexts of power asymmetries or environmental conflicts, integrated valuation can promote the inclusion of diverse values through action research and support the struggle for social and environmental justice. The special issue and this editorial synthesis paper bring together lessons from pioneer case studies and research papers, synthesizing main challenges and setting out priorities for the years to come for the field of integrated valuation.

AB  - This chapter is about the mechanisms that cause organizational leaders and members (and thus, organizations) to operate toward the physical environ-ment in just ways-or, alternatively, to fail to be environmentally just. Two definitions of environmental justice found in public policy, environmental science, and philosophical documents and debates are presented. Next, a model of organizational environmental justice behavior is presented that includes the major justicc motives that psychologists, economists, and other social scientists have described; the taxonomy of major forms of identity and their relations to justice motives; values (cultural and personal); and the relationship of all of those categories of things to environmental justice. To further explicate the model, we present a case analysis of the environmental justice issues and processes surrounding coal mining at the Navajo (Dine(1)) Nation (Reservation) in New Mexico and Arizona.

AB  - This study examines race- and income-based disparities in cancer risks from air toxics in Cancer Alley, LA, USA. Risk estimates were obtained from the 2005 National Air Toxics Assessment and socioeconomic and race data from the 2005 American Community Survey, both at the census tract level. Disparities were assessed using spatially weighted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and quantile regression (QR) for five major air toxics, each with cancer risk greater than 10(-6). Spatial OLS results showed that disparities in cancer risks were significant: People in low-income tracts bore a cumulative risk 12% more than those in high-income tracts (p < 0.05), and those in black-dominant areas 16% more than in white-dominant areas (p < 0.01). Formaldehyde and benzene were the two largest contributors to the disparities. Contributions from emission sources to disparities varied by compound. Spatial QR analyses showed that magnitude of disparity became larger at the high end of exposure range, indicating worsened disparity in the poorest and most highly concentrated black areas. Cancer risk of air toxics not only disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial minority communities, but there is a gradient effect within these groups with poorer and higher minority concentrated segments being more affected than their counterparts. Risk reduction strategies should target emission sources, risk driver chemicals, and especially the disadvantaged neighborhoods.

AB  - This paper explores the articulation and mobilization of competing notions of energy (in) justice and energy future visions in the struggle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project (TMX) in British Columbia, Canada. The TMX is a controversial fossil fuel project because it leads to the appropriation of First Nations lands, gender violence, and the unequal distribution of the socio-environmental costs of tar sands operations. Despite these impacts, the Canadian state argues that the TMX contributes to economic growth, job creation, and increased tax revenues, thereby legitimizing tar sands expansion on Indigenous lands. Drawing upon literature on Indigenous climate/energy justice, we problematize conventional understandings of energy justice and energy futures by examining multiple, interconnected, and often neglected dimensions of justice in the TMX conflict. Through critical discourse analysis, this paper explores how First Nations opposing this pipeline mobilize different notions of justice to envision alternative energy futures. Our study shows how they challenge Canada's fossil fuel future vision by asserting jurisdiction over the lands crossed by the TMX and demanding the cancellation of this pipeline. Centering counter-hegemonic perspectives in discussions about tar sands development provides a starting point for imagining and building more just energy futures.

AB  - We utilized a participatory mapping approach to collect point locations, photographs, and descriptive data about select built environment stressors identified and prioritized by community residents living in the Proctor Creek Watershed, a degraded, urban watershed in Northwest Atlanta, Georgia. Residents (watershed researchers) used an indicator identification framework to select three watershed stressors that influence urban livability: standing water, illegal dumping on land and in surface water, and faulty stormwater infrastructure. Through a community university partnership and using Geographic Information Systems and digital mapping tools, watershed researchers and university students designed a mobile application (app) that enabled them to collect data associated with these stressors to create a spatial narrative, informed by local community knowledge, that offers visual documentation and representation of community conditions that negatively influence the environment, health, and quality of life in urban areas. By elevating the local knowledge and lived experience of community residents and codeveloping a relevant data collection tool, community residents generated fine-grained, street-level, actionable data. This process helped to fill gaps in publicly available datasets about environmental hazards in their watershed and helped residents initiate solution-oriented dialogue with government officials to address problem areas. We demonstrate that community-based knowledge can contribute to and extend scientific inquiry, as well as help communities to advance environmental justice and leverage opportunities for remediation and policy change.

AB  - This study investigated the differences in the quality of park play spaces between an affluent and a non-affluent community in a large US Southeastern metropolitan area. Two cities were purposefully selected to reflect differences in household income and race/ethnicity characteristics. Using the Playable Space Quality Assessment Tool (PSQAT), all parks (n = 11, with six in the affluent city, and five in the non-affluent city) in these two cities were evaluated. The data were analyzed across three aspects of environmental features of the PSQAT: Location, Play Value and Care and Maintenance between parks in the two cities. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the study hypotheses. Results indicated significant differences between parks in the two cities in all three aspects of the PSQAT with p-values <= 0.03and effect sizes of >0.65, suggesting that the affluent city had parks of a higher quality than the non-affluent city. Significant disparity in Play Value (p = 0.009) in parks between these two communities suggests that children and young people are likely to have different experiences of the play spaces in their locality and therefore may experience different physical and psychological health benefits.

AB  - We address the long-standing debate between elite theorists and pluralists about the priorities and scale of foundation funding for social movements by examining systematic data on foundation grants to environmental movement organizations (EMOs) between 1961 and 2000. By combining these data with a comprehensive inventory of EMOs that operated in this period, we show that foundation giving favored conservative mainstream environmental discourses, EMOs that avoided protest, older EMOs, and those located in the northeastern seaboard. Despite major growth in the constant dollar value of foundation giving to EMOs, this remains a highly concentrated system of philanthropy with over half of all foundation grants going to the top 20 grant recipients, a third of which have been leading recipients for over five decades. Nonetheless, there is evidence of change in that alternative discourses, especially environmental justice, received over 5% of these grants in 2000.

AB  - Understanding the cultural dimensions of climate change requires understanding its religious aspects. Insofar as climate change is entangled with humans, it is also entangled with all the ways in which religion attends human ways of being. Scholarship on the connections between religion and climate change includes social science research into how religious identity figures in attitudes toward climate change, confessional and constructive engagements of religious thought with climate change from various communities and traditions, historical and anthropological analyses of how climate affects religion and religion interprets climate, and theories by which climate change may itself be interpreted as a religious event. Responses to climate change by indigenous peoples challenge the categories of religion and of climate change in ways that illuminate reflexive stresses between the two cultural concepts.

Green spaces include vegetated land cover (e.g., urban forests, trees, riparian zones, parks) which play a distinctive role in urban ecology. This article reviews emergent literature on the linkages between urban green spaces, social justice, and human health. We explore this subject in the context of landscape structure, ecosystem services, and distributional equity as it relates to various health outcomes. Finally, we conclude by identifying gaps in the scholarship and potential areas of future research.

AB  - This study examines urban quality of life by assessing the relationship between observed socioeconomic conditions and urban forest amenities in Terre Haute, Indiana, USA. Using remote-sensing methods and techniques, and ordinary least squares regression, the paper determines the relationship between urban leaf area and a population density parameter with median income and median housing value. Results demonstrate positive correlations between urban leaf area, population density, and their interaction with median income and median housing value. Furthermore, leaf area, density, and their interaction statistically account for observed variance in median income and median housing value, indicating that these variables may be used to study observed quality-of-life metrics. The methods used in this study may be useful to city managers, planners, and foresters who are concerned with urban quality-of-life issues, and who are interested in developing and implementing alternative policy assessment regimes.

This chapter examines urban temperature in Terre Haute, Indiana using detailed land cover data and socioeconomic data. First, four urban thermal neighborhoods were generated using land cover percentages and k-means clustering. Then, urban temperature was examined in the context of these four neighborhoods, and it was found that urban temperature was significantly different in the four neighborhoods. Finally, socioeconomic variables were examined. It was determined that income was significantly higher in neighborhoods with low temperatures and percentage minority population values were significantly higher in the neighborhoods with the higher temperature values. Future research could further investigate the relationship between urban heat and socioeconomic characteristics.

AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSF) in Indonesia have long faced competition between industrial demand for timber, the subsistence requirements of local communities and, more recently, global concern about the need to conserve tropical peat carbon stores, ecosystem services and biodiversity. This paper uses concepts of ecological distribution and environmental justice to investigate how tensions between conservation and livelihood goals have played out on the ground and examine who has gained and lost out from recent TPSF exploitation, conservation and rehabilitation initiatives. A central focus is how peat-based communities in Central Kalimantan have adapted their livelihoods to changing peatland conditions and management policies with particular emphasis on the livelihood impacts of conservation-with-development initiatives in the area. It is argued that despite recent emphasis on 'win-win' initiatives, the costs of environmental conservation are rarely distributed in proportion to their benefit.

AB  - This paper explores the history of wind power technologies and the integration of wind energy in the Danish energy system. It does so focusing particularly on historical events, socio-cultural and socio-political changes and priorities that were important on this technological journey. From the first primitive wind turbines in the late 1800s, to the world wars, through the energy- crisis in the 70s, and into the decades of growing environmental awareness and concern, this historical account describes how policy priorities in Denmark gradually translated from the focus on energy diversification, energy efficiency and energy independence to the focus on sustainability and renewable energy resources, with wind energy and wind power technologies at the top of the priority list. Historically, wind power has been - and it still is - popular in Denmark. However, as the modern wind power turbines gradually grew to industrial scale heights, unchallenged support for specific local wind farms could no longer be taken for granted. This paper also touches upon the frequently tacit dilemmas of renewable energy technology planning and deployment, for example issues of environmental justice, wind farm ownership structures, and the role of social psychology for low-carbon energy transition processes. Notably, attention is drawn to the representation biases that may result in the emphasis of wind farm opposition / grievances in the wider wind farm related debates, where resistance to local wind farm projects might derive from minority opposition groups. Insights and lessons learnt from this Danish history of wind power may prove valuable and inspirational for other countries engaging in low-carbon energy transitions.

AB  - This issue of Human Ecology focuses on the interrelated-nature of crisis in human and environmental systems and argues that the right to a healthy environment is a fundamental human right. In this article I present a conceptual framework for the ''human rights and environment'' special issue, followed by a brief review of significant insights offered by each contributor. Collectively the cases presented in this issue explore connections between international and national policy, government action or sanctioned action, and human environmental crises. Cultural notions are seen to play a key role in influencing social relations, legitimizing power relations, and justifying the production and reproduction of human environmental crises. And finally, these cases explore the ways in which political, economic, and cultural forces influence and at times inhibit efforts to respond to human environmental crises.

AB  - Unconventional extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing or "fracking" have led to a boom in oil and gas production in the Eagle Ford shale play, Texas, one of the most productive regions in the United States. Nearly 400000 people live within 5 km of an unconventional oil or gas well in this largely rural area. Flaring is associated primarily with unconventional oil wells and is an increasingly common practice in the Eagle Ford to dispose of excess gas through combustion. Flares can operate continuously for months and release hazardous air pollutants such as particulate matter and volatile organic compounds in addition to causing light and noise pollution and noxious odors. We estimated ethnic disparities in exposure to flaring using satellite observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer between March 2012-December 2016. Census blocks with majority Hispanic (>60%) populations were exposed to twice as many nightly flare events within 5 km as those with <20% Hispanics. We found that Hispanics were exposed to more flares despite being less likely than non-Hispanic White residents to live near unconventional oil and gas wells. Our findings suggest Hispanics are disproportionately exposed to flares in the Eagle Ford shale, a pattern known as environmental injustice, which could contribute to disparities in air pollution and other nuisance exposures.

AB  - To address increasing opposition to wind projects in Denmark three compensation schemes were introduced in the 2008 Renewable Energy Act. The aim was to address issues of distributive fairness and thereby to increase local acceptance. This paper analyses the role of two individual compensation schemes - the property value-loss scheme and the co-ownership scheme - on local citizens' perceptions of fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of wind energy projects. The qualitative case study of three Danish wind energy projects discloses that distributive unfairness was a prevalent concern among local citizens, and that this concern was inseparable from perceptions of procedural fairness and recognition. The key conclusion is that the two compensation schemes are not successfully offsetting perceptions of unfair distribution. The schemes are challenged by a multitude of intertwined concerns. The compensation schemes are not equipped to address the plethora of non-monetary values affected by the wind projects. Specifically the compensation schemes are criticised for not offering adequate local benefits or distribution thereof, equal access, fair procedures and transparency. In fact the schemes were by some considered unfair and created perceptions of lack of recognition and bribery which undermined their role in promoting distributive fairness and local acceptance.

AB  - This study advances research at the intersection of environmental degradation, social stratification, and population health in the United States. Expanding the theoretical principles of power, proximity, and physiology, we hypothesize that the harmful effect of fine particulate matter on life expectancy is greater in states with higher levels of income inequality and larger black populations. To test our hypothesis, we use two-way fixed effects regression analysis to estimate the effect of a three-way interaction between fine particulate matter, income share of the top ten percent, and the percent of the population that is black on state-level average life expectancy for all US states and the District of Columbia (2000-2014). The findings support our hypothesis: the estimated effect of the three-way interaction on average life expectancy is negative and statistically significant, net of various socioeconomic and demographic controls. Using post-estimation techniques, we visually illustrate that the harmful effect of fine particulate matter on life expectancy is especially pronounced in states with both very high levels of income inequality and very large black populations. We conclude by summarizing the theoretical and substantive implications of our findings, the limitations of the study, and potential next steps in this evolving area of interdisciplinary research.

AB  - While economic and environmental aspects of civil engineering have attracted the greatest attention among contemporary academy, its social side has frequently been set aside. However, the social impact that infrastructures have is huge and its analysis and understanding are fundamental. At the same time, social aspects such as culture or human behaviour can have significant effects during the different stages of the lifecycle of infrastructures. Therefore, a better understanding of the connections between civil engineering and society can help to better adapt infrastructures to their contexts, as well as minimise their negative impacts; as a result, this understanding can bring about infrastructures that are more socially sustainable. The scarce studies that have assessed the connection between society and civil engineering have considered this relationship as unidirectional. The real scenario is not so simple. The analysis of this relationship needs to be interdisciplinary, and it is in this context that this paper addresses the analysis of infrastructures and of social sciences from a sociotechnical point of view. We draw on the interrelationships found to propose a conceptual framework with the main objective of providing both practitioners and academics with tools to carry out more sustainable and context-adapted decisions. We classify the fields of civil engineering and social sciences into several different subflelds, namely six for infrastructures (transport, water, energy, environment, urban planning and buildings) and twelve for social sciences (culture and history, behaviour and mind, communication and interaction, socioeconomics, juridical sciences, life and health, politics, social problems, social groups, ethics and philosophy, arts and education and innovation). Afterwards, we review the existing literature at the intersection between the various categories. We conclude proposing a framework that can support decisions and actions made at different levels and working areas. The framework includes guidelines for a more holistic consideration of the interaction between infrastructures and society in key activities whereby an improved understanding of the effect of this relationship is often required. The guidelines provide a description of different key areas and can be applied to a wide variety of actions ranging from the development of university curricula to the social impact assessment of projects.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) have been shown to provide a number of environmental and social benefits relevant for a higher quality of life of residents. However, population growth in cities combined with urban planning policies of (re)densification can drive the conversion of UGS into residential land. This development might result in an unequal distribution of UGS in a city. We present an analysis of UGS provisioning in Berlin, Germany in order to identify distributional inequities between UGS and population which are further discussed in light of variations in user preferences associated with demographics and immigrant status. Publicly available land use and sociodemographic data at sub-district level are applied in a GIS, dissimilarity index and cluster analysis approach. Results show that although most areas are supplied with more UGS compared to the per capita target value of 6 m(2), there is considerable dissimilarity by immigrant status and age. To address rising concerns about socio-environmental justice in cities and to evaluate the (dis)advantages of applying UGS threshold values for urban planning, visitor profiles and preferences of a site-specific case, the park and former city airport Berlin-Tempelhof are analyzed. Results from questionnaire surveys indicate that the identified dissimilarities on sub-district level are not the same as socio-environmental injustice in Tempelhof, but point to a mismatch of UGS and user preferences. In addition to evaluating UGS distribution, the match between quality of a park and specific cultural and age dependent user needs should be considered for successful green infrastructure planning rather than focusing on target values.

AB  - Urban parks provide multiple ecosystem services to mitigate challenges from climate change and urbanisation. They promote health and well-being by providing space for physical activity and social interaction, which is particularly relevant for vulnerable groups such as children and older people. As a key element, park vegetation creates favourable environments, as it moderates heat, buffers noise and can be enjoyed by citizens. In this paper, we present the results of a multi-method empirical study conducted in the city of Leipzig, Germany, during the summer heat and drought period in July 2018. Visitation patterns were analysed through qualitative observation and structured counting in two differently characterised urban parks - a newly developed urban park on a former railway brownfield and a long-standing, older park with a mature tree population. The results indicate that park design elements are linked to park use activities and park user age groups such as young children, school children and older people. Young children were identified as mostly using playgrounds and natural lawn areas in the old park, while school children and teenagers tended to use the sports areas and semisecluded spaces in the newly developed park to play sports or to meet in groups and socialize. For older people, sedentary activity was exclusively observed on benches, and non-sedentary activity such as jogging was nearly exclusively identified in the larger, more shaded older park. The number of counted park users, particularly numbers of children and older people, significantly declined at the highest temperature of approximately 30 degrees C. Considering the provision and availability of inclusive design elements that support these use behaviours may increase the motivation of all age groups to use green spaces and to benefit from the services they provide. Planning for a more effective and just provision of ecosystem services requires the consideration of age-specific design elements to invite use from all population groups equally and to contribute to distributional justice.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) availability has become an increasingly important aspect of planning and research because of the importance of green spaces for the wellbeing of urban residents. Municipalities across the European Union (EU) use different indicators in this area. Some cities provide per-capita threshold values for urban green space (UGS); some have recommendations regarding the minimum distance to green space while others have no recommendations at all. In this study, we assess green space availability in 299 EU cities according to land use and a population data grid. The results show a diverse picture across the EU. Southern European cities show below-average availability values, which may be explained by their low forest and tree cover and reflect the history of cities in Southern Europe. Comparatively, the above-average availability values in Northern European cities are a result of not only their biophysical conditions and the presence of rich forestland in general but also of Northern European attitudes toward urban living that naturally value having forests close to home. This assessment is complemented by a detailed case study analysis of two European cities Berlin, Germany and Loa Poland. Results showed that this approach's explanatory power depends on the data used, scale of interest, resolution of data and estimated threshold value. By comparing results using different datasets and threshold values, we discuss opportunities and limitations for developing indicators of green space availability. We conclude that UGS availability is an important indicator to navigate urban complexity to improve human health and wellbeing but is only one component of the intricate social-ecological interactions within cities.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) can counter the ill effects of urbanization in high-density cities. Studies related to these aspects are rare in Indian cities, however. This article aims to assess the availability and accessibility of UGS in Raipur, India. The objectives are to identify the status of UGS alteration, determine the status of available UGS, and identify the optimum population density for which UGS can be made available and accessible. Land use change detection, fragmentation index, availability index, UGS per capita, and neighborhood accessibility are used to assess aspects of UGS. The results show an increase in built-up area (24.32 percent) from 2010 to 2020. They also show a decrease in the UGS availability index and an increase in the fragmentation index from the city center to the outskirts. Uneven distribution of UGS categories is found all over the studied urban area. Low-density areas have more UGS per capita available than high-density areas, whereas medium-high-density areas have the maximum UGS accessibility. The study concludes with density-wise implications to maximize the UGS benefits and identifies medium-high density as the optimum density that allows high accessibility to the available UGS.

AB  - This paper describes a series of sequentially implemented policies to mitigate local diesel truck impacts resulting from goods movement activity at two port facilities and simultaneously to improve traffic operations in the communities of Barrio Logan in San Diego, California, and Old Town in National City, California, both low-income communities of color. The paper provides the first comprehensive documentation of the unique process and solutions that emerged following the collaboration of all major stakeholders. Local impacts in Barrio Logan comprised air pollution, noise, and decreased pedestrian safety, while traffic operations in both communities were affected by congestion on the main freeway access, interchanges with insufficient capacity, and heavily mixed land uses both within and adjacent to the communities. These issues provided the impetus for the mitigation effort, the final implementation of which involved a permanent rerouting of all trucks weighing more than 5 tons to roads external to the community. Previous assessments of the project have described the extent to which mitigation strategies are expected to improve traffic operations or have assumed air quality improvements without carrying out an air quality analysis. A local-scale analysis of diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions in Barrio Logan is given. The results show that while the mitigation did not result in improved regional air quality, it did significantly improve air quality in the primary affected corridor and resulted in a 99% reduction in DPM emissions and an 87% reduction in diesel truck vehicle miles traveled.

AB  - Transportation policies, plans, and projects all flow through state institutions because of the substantial cost of infrastructure and the need to assess transportation system performance, including equity implications. But environmental justice scholarship interrogates the state's role in perpetuating injustice. Most research and planning practice related to transportation equity has relied upon state-sponsored analytical methods. Transportation planners and scholars can benefit from critical assessments of these approaches. We propose a shift in focus from transportation equity to a broader consideration of transportation justice that is more closely aligned with models of social change promulgated in the environmental justice literature and by related movements.

AB  - This case study of a community-supported agriculture (CSA) organization in New Orleans focuses on the lack of participation in the CSA market by the local residents despite its intentions, and how various constituencies diagnose the causes of the disengagement. Interview and ethnographic observation data indicate a general consensus on the economic constraints, but some non-resident supporters of the organization attributed the issue to lack of knowledge about the food system or the benefits of local food consumption. The residents, on the other hand, pointed to spatial and sociocultural barriers that made the market and its location less accessible to them, including the produce selection and purchase options, convenience of access to the market, and the race-related historical and spatial context of the market's location. These findings suggest that the food access concerns of the food justice movement may be more easily addressed than the food sovereignty concerns. Food as a unique resource poses an additional challenge for the movement to construct an effective food justice frame.

AB  - This study aims at expanding the scope of environmental justice measurement by evaluating the development zones in urban plans besides existing settlements. Focusing on the proximities to locally unwanted land uses (LULUs) in Afyonkarahisar, Turkey, the distance-based measurement method of this study utilised geographic information systems (GIS). Case-based results indicate that the trend of environmental (in)justice is continued through the urban plan of Afyonkarahisar. The disadvantaged settlements in terms of LULU proximity have the highest proportion (29.7%) of the population whereas the advantaged settlements have the lowest proportion (8.7%). In the disadvantaged group, there are four urban settlements with 219,923 people whereas there are six development zones and no rural settlements with such high scores. The study emphasises the gradual measurement method by using weighted scores of multiple distances to all LULUs from urban, rural, existing, and proposed settlements rather than a fixed distance to a certain facility from existing urban settlements.

However, the value of urban ecosystem services remains highly uncertain, especially across the diverse social, ecological and technological contexts represented in cities around the world. We review and synthesize research on the contextual factors that moderate the value and equitable distribution of ten of the most commonly cited urban ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper aims to make a modest contribution to the debate on how the ecologies of urbanization help us understand the socio-spatial changes we confront in the climate emergency. The intervention is constructed in four steps. First, it speaks to what kind of Urban Political Ecology (UPE)-or generally what I call a "spatialized political ecology"-may be appropriate for urban society. In a second step, it historicizes and spatializes the narrative by introducing an urban political ecology of landscapes. For that, the paper mobilizes the concepts of boundaries, belts, and in-betweens. The third part illustrates the transformation of postsuburban political ecologies in three rather different world regions. The last part of this paper examines what the potential is and what need for action exists in an urban society threatened and conditioned by the climate emergency and the Capitalocene. Ultimately, the paper aspires to move the debate on UPE more into the direction of making it relevant for the urban affairs of a suburban planet.

AB  - Urban greening is a popular nature-led regeneration policy based on the assumption that provision of greenspace improves the health and wellbeing of proximate communities. Entangled within these objectives are environmental justice principles that seek to remedy historical and contemporary concerns related to contaminated areas of post-industrial cities. This paper draws upon findings from an evaluation study of an urban greening project in a socio-economically disadvantaged suburb with a history of toxic contamination. Our aim is to understand if better and more greenspace derives improved social outcomes over time. Central to this inquiry is an attention to resident perspectives of the environment before and after greening to understand if meeting expectations of regeneration and environmental justice impacts upon subjective wellbeing.

AB  - With a myriad of associated health, ecological and social benefits, urban greening has become a prominent policy strategy to renew historically neglected sites in cities, so popular that its implementation often eludes scrutiny. Utilising resident interviews, this paper investigates the distribution of 'wellbeing' narratives and objectives in such transformations. We demonstrate how affinities with nature are utilised to hasten green happy-futures, whilst neglecting to address ongoing questions of social and environmental justice. This paper foregrounds these injustices by attending to the affective dimensions of past and present experiences of environmental damage, advocating for the prioritisation of caring-futures over happy-futures in urban greening imaginaries.

AB  - This study investigated how sporadic river datasets could be used to quantify temporal variations in the base flow index (BFI). The BFI represents the baseflow component of river flow which is often used as a proxy indicator for groundwater discharge to a river. The Bua catchment in Malawi was used as a case study, whereby the smoothed minima method was applied to river flow data from six gauges (ranging from 1953 to 2009) and the Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test was used to identify trends in BFI. The results showed that baseflow plays an important role within the catchment. Average annual BFIs > 0.74 were found for gauges in the lower reaches of the catchment, in contrast to lower BFIs < 0.54 which were found for gauges in the higher reaches. Minimal difference between annual and wet season BFI was observed, however dry season BFI was >0.94 across all gauges indicating the importance of baseflow in maintaining any dry season flows. Long term trends were identified in the annual and wet season BFI, but no evidence of a trend was found in the dry season BFI. Sustainable management of the investigated catchment should, therefore, account for the temporal variations in baseflow, with special regard to water resources allocation within the region and consideration in future scheme appraisals aimed at developing water resources. Further, this demonstration of how to work with sporadic river data to investigate baseflow serves as an important example for other catchments faced with similar challenges.

AB  - Which factors were most important in determining the outcomes of major environmental justice cases in Louisiana during the 1990s? In four cases studied here, local citizens mobilised and engaged in protracted struggles. In the successful cases, protestors took advantage of a combination of circumstances and strategies that served to raise their group's power to levels that could challenge the opposing growth coalition, pursuing a political strategy targeting federal agencies that were in the process of creating policy, 'marketing' the struggle to attract outside resources and support, using the media and outside allies to put pressure on federal agencies, and seeking non-displacing goals. Fighting the siting of new facilities is far more likely to succeed than fighting existing contamination and entrenched firms.

AB  - Urban informalities have shown global unprecedented growth rates in the past 50 years, currently housing around two thirds of Cairenes. As outdoor activities are fundamental to urban life, improving environmental performance of this urban product is essential. This paper investigates microclimate in Cairo's informal areas and how to improve it through low-tech interventions. It aims to identify relevant heat stress counter-strategies, and how they can be promoted among and accepted by residents. Building on previous work regarding an Outdoor Spaces Environmental Performance Assessment OSEPA tool, the researchers identified needed intervention areas within Imbaba informal district. Through an extensive participatory process, the team developed tailored solutions that help improve the urban microclimate using low tech and low-cost interventions. The field work identified vital prerequisites and revealed the necessity of engaging various stakeholders to ensure ownership and applicability. The analysis concludes with an Outdoor Spaces Environmental Performance Improvement OSEPI model for developing solutions to improve urban microclimate within spaces of informal areas and a toolbox for relevant interventions. This serves both as an input in informal areas upgrading projects and designing low to middle-income neighbourhoods. Thus, ensuring environmental justice and counteracting current practices that predominantly ignore environmental issues especially increased heat stress.

AB  - Undergraduates are interested in applied research focusing on environmental issues. To capitalize on this interest, four faculty members at Georgia Gwinnett College formed an interdisciplinary environmental research cluster so as to encourage undergraduate participation in research on these issues. The four cluster faculty include a physicist, chemist, environmental engineer, and environmental toxicologist. The cluster faculty support undergraduate environmental research by sharing resources and students while working on varied aspects of a suite of projects. Over the past five years, more than 50 students have participated in environmental cluster research projects. Student researchers have been 62% women and 48% under-represented groups, as defined by the National Science Foundation. This chapter briefly highlights three recent projects: river water analysis through popular recreational canoe and kayak routes in Georgia; toxic substances air sampling and environmental justice; and production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and grease from campus dining operations. Biodiesel project details are then presented to illustrate the depth of student research experiences.

AB  - To date, review articles examining stream daylighting (de-culverting buried streams) are limited in scope, report on only a fraction of available publications, and focus on publications' explicit (manifest) content rather than their underlying constructs (latent content). This review combines the methods of systematic literature reviews and inductive content analysis to better understand the scope and nature of the literature on stream daylighting. The study investigates four themes: the disciplines, terminologies, definitions, and case studies and their interconnections and covers all relevant English-language sources since 1992 through 2018. The results reveal three findings with implications for future research: 1) there is a dearth in studies that tackle crucial contemporary challenges like climate change and studies that delve into the complex connections among the sociocultural, physical planning, environmental, and economic dimensions of stream daylighting, such as socio-environmental justice, architecture, and urban design; 2) the terminology is inconsistent and a clear definition is absent; 3) Some important stream daylighting cases are overlooked, such as Ziirich's (Switzerland) city-wide initiative and Riyadh's (Saudi Arabia) first arid climate initiative. The inclusion of such case studies in the literature impacts the perception of stream daylighting and expands the scope and dimensions of this practice.

AB  - Until fairly recently, consideration of religion has been marginal or even non-existent in the scholarly discourse about environmental politics. Renewed attention to the intersection of these fields has been encouraged by a recent widening in discussions of 'environmental values' to include the role of religious institutions and personal belief in forming spiritual environmental values and renewed attention to the place of ethics and religious institutions in global environmental politics. Following a range of historic declarations by religious leaders, the recent encyclical by Pope Francis signalled a new level of integration between Catholic concerns for social and environmental justice. Yet, much of the continued engagement by large environmental NGOs and governments has continued to ignore the complex interrelation of local, intermediate and transnational religious political ecology. In this article, which is based on data gathered during five years of fieldwork, primarily with British Christian REMOs (religious environmental movement organizations), I probe the complexities of political engagement with religious environmentalism which arise from the many different organizational iterations these groups may take. On the basis of such investigation I suggest that effective high-level engagement with REMO groups will be greatly enhanced by a nuanced understanding of the many different shapes that these groups can take, the various scales at which these groups organize, and the unique inflection that political action and group identity can take in a religious context.

AB  - This paper aims to examine various built environment factors contributing to asthma and severe asthma morbidities in older people by performing spatial regression analysis. By controlling the socio-demographic factors of asthma in Seoul, we found a significant correlation of the built environment factors with severe asthma rather than with asthma in older people. The results suggest that population density and bus transit can make asthma severe in older people, while active transportation activities have a positive influence on severe asthma in older people. However, a significant contribution of built environment factors to asthma in older people is not identified. The findings from spatial regression imply that the collaboration of multi-level governments and agencies needs to develop policies for mitigating poor air quality from the perspective of environmental justice.

AB  - This research investigates the ways in which mainstream energy policy based on a utilitarian principle of the greatest good creates injustice. To be more specific, drawing on insights from the recent energy justice scholarship, we address a question of how economic growth-focused energy systems that serve to maximize the aggregate benefit for all interfere with social justice. On the theoretical side, we employ Jenkins and colleagues' three-pronged approach to assessing the fairness of energy services as a conceptual underpinning, comprising considerations of recognition, distribution and procedure. On the empirical side, we illustrate the case of South Korea that demonstrates how an energy system driven by inexorable compulsion towards economic growth stymies fairness. Overall, the analysis reported here underscores that energy decisions devoid of ethical considerations are detrimental, be it intentionally or inadvertently, to the powerless who reside in social peripheries. We anticipate that the South Korean experience will provide salutary lessons for emerging economies voraciously draining energy resources without social justice concerns.

AB  - This study examined the problems in the transboundary movement of e-waste with respect to the process of the importation and treatment of e-waste (electronic waste), from the point of view of environmental justice. If the relationships between e-waste-exporting countries and -importing countries is considered in terms of their economic interests, various positive factors surface. If the problem is considered from the standpoint of environmental justice, however, both countries are guilty of complicity. In the short-term economic interests, if these are understood in terms of economic justice, e-waste importation is still not recommended; and if it is considered in the context of environmental justice, it is clearly an international criminal act. In this context, this study also suggested why this problem requires another policy, in response to the WTO system that controls international trade.

AB  - This research explores the spatial patterns of environmental risk and their equity implications with particular focus on particulate matter (PM) air pollution in California, USA. Regarding risk distribution, two distinctive approaches have stood out in environmental scholarship: the risk society thesis and an environmental (in)justice claim. While the former asserts that modernization has made environmental risks more pervasive and less discriminatory extending beyond the traditional socioeconomic and geographic boundaries, the latter demonstrates the disproportionate influences of political and demographic trends on the distribution of environmental hazards. Against these intellectual backgrounds, the research presented here seeks to examine whether, and how, socioeconomic factors of race/ethnicity and unemployment affect PM distribution while controlling for other land-use (i.e. multi-housing and no vehicle) and geographic (i.e. elevation and tree canopy) features. Utilizing bivariate and multivariate analyses that incorporate spatial interaction, the research found PM exposure patterns to follow traditional postures of the environmental (in)justice claim, with Hispanics and Blacks disproportionately exposed to higher levels of PM.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between environmental risk and corporate bond credit ratings, and the moderating effect of market competition. We focus on Korean firms that are facing increasing risk of environmental crisis after the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, the Korean government has been controlling businesses while promoting policies to transform the economy into a low-energy, low-carbon economy. We find that a firm's greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption, which are direct indicators of environmental risk, are negatively associated with bond credit ratings. We also report that the negative effect of environmental risk on credit ratings is stronger in firms with low market competition. This study contributes to prior research by improving the understanding of the effect of environmental risk on credit ratings. In particular, it is significant to examine the effect of environmental risk, measured as direct environmental performance not affected by green washing, on credit rating. Therefore, we shed light on environment-oriented management beyond the determinants of credit ratings, which have been discussed in previous studies. We also suggest that policymakers need to manage market competition in terms of environmental justice, given that market competition has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between environmental risk and credit ratings.

AB  - This paper analyzes experiences of organic farmers after the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear reactor accident. Specifically, we draw on feminist political ecology to analyze the divergent perceptions of radiation threats. Based on farmer interviews, we find that different interpretations resulted in social tensions on multiple levels, even among family members, particularly along gender lines. The paper links these local struggles to larger political issues. The political and economic elites emphasized control and normalcy in accordance with hegemonic masculinity, while chastising citizens who were concerned with radiation as irrational and hysteric. Existing studies of disasters have acknowledged their gendered impacts, but the analysis has tended to focus on women's increased morbidity and mortality. Overall, our study suggests the utility of feminist political ecology in analyzing local risk interpretations and macro political dynamics from feminist perspectives. While gender difference in attitudes to radiation contamination is expected from the existing literature, this study suggests the need to examine how identities and socially constructed notions of masculinity/femininity mediate them.

AB  - Through a critique of existing regeneration literatures the paper points to the close relationship between regeneration and sustainable development. It suggests that the economic aspects of sustainable development have tended to dominate: leading to the neglect of nature in both regeneration and sustainable development, with regeneration having a principal focus on socio-economic issues in urban settings. To address these lacunae we suggest the need for a more environmentally sensitive regeneration theory. Using this approach the paper draws on recent in-depth research in three post-industrial coalfield areas where regeneration processes operate in the form of community forest projects. It provides a critical perspective on these regeneration processes, integrating theory with empirical data and highlighting how nature is drawn into broader economic and social processes of regeneration. In conclusion, using forestry initiatives as examples, we reflect on the conceptual dissonance apparent in regeneration theory and practice, and point to theoretical insights that could enable a more critical regeneration theory; more beneficial outcomes to regeneration processes; and an improved understanding of the relations between nature, capital and community in regeneration processes and sustainable development.

AB  - Under a changing climate, droughts are projected to increase in frequency and duration in the Southwestern USA. Between 2012 and 2016, California experienced one of the region's worst droughts, with record high temperatures and low snowpack, runoff, and precipitation. This study documents small drinking water system managers' experiences during the 2012-2016 Drought. We contribute to research on water system drought resilience by elevating small drinking water system manager perspectives and expertise. We are especially focused on small systems that are not reliant on imports from state or federal water projects. A mixed-method approach ensures each data collection period informs the next to gather statewide perspectives and experiences of managers. Based on an analysis of drinking water manager reflections, the types of impacts, responses, and barriers differed based on both system size and water source portfolio. Common disadvantages that hinder small drinking water systems' drought resilience and, similarly, climate adaptation include staff and administrative capacity; the financial burden of promoting water conservation over revenue compounded by onerous reporting and funding support programs; consumer awareness challenges; and challenges to consolidation from both local political differences and physical limitations. Systems that built technical, managerial, or financial capacity prior to the Drought were at an advantage over systems that lacked this capacity. In the long term, we found a dearth of adaptation planning among small water systems. Documentation of experiences from the 2012-2016 Drought can inform future planning for droughts and more broadly highlight needs for climate adaptation.

I draw attention to the ways in which culture within social movements is enacted embodied and emoted, as well as enunciated by conceptualizing the breast cancer,movement in terms of three different cultures of action. The first, represented by Race for the Cures, draws upon biomedicine, connects breast cancer to survivor identities and the display of heteronormative femininities, mobilizes hope and faith in science and medicine, and promotes biomedical research and early detection. The second, represented by the Women theta Cancer Walk, draws upon multicultural feminism, the women's health monument and AIDS activism, connects breast cancer to other women's cancers, challenges the emphasis on survival and the display of heteronormative femininities, emphasizes the effects of institutionalized inequalities, mobilizes anger against the institutions of biomedicine, and promotes social services and treatment activism. The third, represented by the Toxic Tour of the Cancer Industry, draws upon the feminist cancer and environmental justice movements, broadens the focus to include all cancers and environmentally-related illnesses, represents breast cancer as the product and source of profits of a global cancer industry, mobilizes outrage against corporate malfeasance and environmental racism, and replaces the emphasis on biomedical research and early detection with demand's for corporate regulation and cancer prevention. This three-dimensional conceptualization extends our understanding of breast cancer activism and contributes to a reorientation of social movements theory around the bodily dimensions of cultural production and collective action.

AB  - What do contemporary controversies in healthcare reveal about secular values and the location of religion within an English medical centre? Using a socio-spatial methodology designed to break open ideological perspectives and normative values, we analyse the doctor patient relationship, complementary and alternative medicine, and an issue that bridges the two, evidence-based medicine. In the physical, social and mental spaces of the medical centre we uncover the traces of religious activity and roles, and of alternative therapeutic regimes often informed by spiritual or religious systems. Furthermore, we disclose the heterogeneity of values that comprise the secular worldview of one group of contemporary general practitioners. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban fisheries provide an opportunity to recruit new participants to recreational fishing, provide experiences with nature that may be limited in urban settings, and build a support base of stakeholders who care about the future management and quality of fisheries and other natural resources in urban environments. Urban fisheries, however, are subject to other pressures perhaps more so than non-urban fisheries, including viral and bacterial pathogens and chemical contaminants that enter the aquatic system, leading to the potential for human exposure to these agents through fishing and fish Consumption. While contaminant-related concerns are often managed through the use of fish consumption advisories distributed by various organizations, including state and local government and civic society organizations, there are no standard advisories for pathogens beyond those for acute outbreak situations. Many studies demonstrate the differential effectiveness of fish consumption advisories in reaching white, male audiences versus anglers of other ethnic heritage, and women. The risks of pathogen and chemical contaminant exposure, however, may be greater in some cases for the fetus, or for immunocompromised individuals, suggesting women of childbearing age and individuals with particular health conditions merit specific attention. Urban anglers may fish more frequently and consume their catch more frequently than do nonurban anglers, and anglers in certain ethnic and minority groups may be at the higher end of the fish consumption spectrum, suggesting urban fisheries management should include concerns regarding environmental justice. Managing urban fisheries requires full evaluation of the potential health risks, including chemical contaminant and pathogen exposures, as well as accurate risk communication through effective community outreach, and responsive policy guidelines regarding stocking, signage, access, fish consumption advisories, and other considerations that may help to minimize human exposure to contaminants and/or pathogens. Urban fisheries also provide an opportunity to engage local constituencies, such as watershed associations and community groups, in working toward a cleaner environment.

AB  - Trees are not evenly distributed across urbanized areas and there is evidence that Black, Hispanic, and low-income residents have lower proximal tree canopy coverage. The complex interplay between social policy and the built/ physical environment contributes to these outcomes, but much of the research on environmental justice focuses on either producing evidence of inequity or assessing policy to determine its effect on the physical environment. This paper attempts to unite those two approaches by 1) measuring the urban tree canopy (UTC) at a scale that reflects local socio-political decision making and 2) assessing how the local policy documents regulating UTC acknowledge and attempt to remediate disparity. A maximum likelihood supervised classification of 1-m resolution imagery for a purposive sample of twelve historically racially segregated neighborhoods in two North Carolina cities estimated UTC at the block level. Using a spatial autoregressive model, we found a statistically significant negative association between UTC coverage, percentage of non-White population, the presence of nonresidential zoning, and percentage of parcel within the right-of-way. Content analysis found the municipal comprehensive plans and development management ordinances lack city-wide canopy coverage goals, do not utilize neighborhood geographies to target action and evaluation, and do not account for, or attempt to reduce, the potential inequitable distribution of urban trees. Existing policies could further contribute to disparate UTC outcomes by allowing neighborhoods to create their own UTC coverage standards and by crafting ordinances with variable standards for neighborhoods with non-residential zones. As a result, communities unable to counteract intensive zoning and/or advocate for enhanced tree canopy provisions are at a disadvantage in the remediation of UTC disparities. These findings highlight the need for analytical approaches that integrate the identification of disparities with the evaluation of present-day policy frameworks that may perpetuate and/or exacerbate inequitable outcomes.

AB  - Widespread population exposure to wildland fire smoke underscores the urgent need for new techniques to characterize fire-derived pollution for epidemiologic studies and to build climate-resilient communities especially for aging populations. Using atmospheric chemical transport modeling, we examined air quality with and without wildland fire smoke PM2.5. In 12-km gridded output, the 24-hour average concentration of all-source PM2.5 in California (2007-2018) was 5.16 mu g/m3 (S.D. 4.66 mu g/m(3)). The average concentration of fire-PM2.5 in California by year was 1.61 mu g/m(3) (-30% of total PM2.5). The contribution of fire-source PM2.5 ranged from 6.8% to 49%. We define a "smokewave " as two or more consecutive days with modeled levels above 35 mu g/m3. Based on model-derived firePM2.5, 99.5% of California's population lived in a county that experienced at least one smokewave from 2007 to 2018, yet understanding of the impact of smoke on the health of aging populations is limited. Approximately 2.7 million (56%) of California residents aged 65+ years lived in counties representing the top 3 quartiles of fire-PM2.5 concentrations (2007-2018). For each year (2007-2018), grid cells containing skilled nursing facilities had significantly higher mean concentrations of all-source PM2.5 than cells without those facilities, but they also had generally lower mean concentrations of wildland fire-specific PM2.5. Compared to rural monitors in California, model predictions of wildland fire impacts on daily average PM2.5 carbon (organic and elemental) performed well most years but tended

AB  - Urban parks provide multiple ecosystem services as an important element of the urban space and improve human health and wellbeing. This study used the Gaussian-based 2SFCA method to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution of and changes in park accessibility within the Sixth Ring Road in Beijing over 15 years. The study also used bivariate correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between urbanization factors and park access. The results showed that the overall park accessibility in both quantity and proximity had increased from 2000 to 2015, but there were still certain areas (percentage) that had limited access to parks. The inequity of distribution in park accessibility had been detected accompanying the rapid increase in park quantity in 2015. Furthermore, the development of urban parks mismatched that of urbanization in terms of urban land increase. The correlation between accessibility changes and population urbanization is not significant. Proper urban green space planning based on the distribution of population density and urban land use is indispensable in avoiding the aggravation of inequity in the process of urban expansion. This study contributes to the assessment of the current park allocation efficiency and helps urban planners and policymakers make prompt adjustments in the rapidly urbanizing process.

AB  - This paper examines whether state governments perform systematically less environmental enforcement of facilities in communities with higher minority and low-income populations. Although this is an important claim. made by environmental justice advocates, it has received little attention in the scholarly literature. Specifically, I analyze state regulatory enforcement of three U.S. pollution control laws-the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act-over the period 1985-2000. To test for disparities in enforcement, I estimate a series of count models and find strong evidence across each of the three environmental laws that states perform less enforcement in poor counties, but little evidence of race-based inequities.

AB  - Through the commodification of nature, the framing of the environment as a natural resource' or ecosystem service' has become increasingly prominent in international environmental governance. The economic capture approach is promoted by international organizations such as the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB). This paper will inquire as to how forest protection is related to issues of social and ecological justice, exploring whether forest exploitation based on the top-down managerial model fosters an unequitable distribution of resources. Both top-down and community-based approaches to forest protection will be critically examined and a more inclusive ethical framework to forest protection will be offered. The findings of this examination indicate the need for a renewed focus on existing examples of good practice in addressing both social and ecological need, as well as the necessity to address the less comfortable problem of where compromise appears less possible. The conclusion argues for the need to consider ecological justice as an important aspect of more socially orientated environmental justice for forest protection.

AB  - Visiting favourite natural settings may serve as a resource for regulating negative feelings and coping with perceived stress. The authors investigated the association between perceived health, the selection and experiential qualities of favourite places in four residential areas; 211 respondents (average age 40 years) responded to the questionnaire. Respondents with a certain amount of health complaints, such as headaches, chest or stomach pains, and faintness or dizziness, were more likely to select natural favourite places than those with few complaints. Respondents with health complaints benefited more in emotional terms from their visits to the favourite place although they did not visit their places more frequently than others. The change toward positive feelings was associated in particular with natural favourite places and relaxing in them. The results give impetus to research on the self-regulation of mood and neighbourhood context in health. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban gardens, consolidating spaces as new urban commons, are faced with the contradiction and challenge of being embedded in neoliberal landscapes of urban governance. While their transformative and justice potential has often, and rightly, been celebrated -offering new pathways towards food security and sovereignty; serving social empowerment and political engagement; making cities greener, healthier and more participatory- the mechanisms that can limit such potential have not been explored as much. Focusing on community gardens that have received some municipal support, we apply a feminist political ecology lens to examine the so far under theorized role of care and time in urban gardens, and the way these aspects are conditioning the sustenance and just distribution of benefits that we know can emerge from urban gardens. Our qualitative empirical analysis of eight municipally supported gardens in Athens, Barcelona, Dublin and Leipzig examines the conflicting time frames and priorities that gardening projects often have to navigate, revealing how the function of urban gardens is constrained by two types of 'clashing temporalities': (i) the invisibility of gardening needs and of their social benefits in a context of limited structural support, and (ii) the undermining of care materialities in light of short municipal timeframes and fast urban growth.

AB  - Urban greenways benefit urban dwellers by providing multiple ecosystem services and by supporting biodiversity conservation in cities. Increasing competition for open space in growing cities, however, often hinders the establishment of greenways in those places where social demands for related services are highest. In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, a new greenway, the "Green Belt Berlin," is being established within the former border zone, which now links Berlin's core with the rural hinterland. An analysis of the planning approaches and principles that directed the implementation of the greenway and the transformation of vacant urban land into new parks revealed ways to (i) extend urban green infrastructure in times and places of political transformation; (ii) justify new greenspace by combining multiple ecological, social, and cultural goals within overarching planning programs; (iii) conserve and stage remnants of the Berlin Wall, allowing the greenway to become part of a decentralized memorial landscape; (iv) work with novel ecosystems and wild urban nature by integrating ecology with urban planning and design; and (v) use design interventions to create "orderly frames." Spatial analyses indicate that the new greenway may reduce environmental inequity in Berlin as it largely intersects neighborhoods where disadvantaged status coincides with poor access to urban greenspace. This case study thus demonstrates opportunities to strengthen the urban green infrastructure of growing cities through integrative planning approaches.

AB  - Urban green spaces have gained attention because of their increasing relevance to human well-being in the context of challenges related to urbanization and climate change. Detailed, systematic, citywide assessments of specific urban green space characteristics that provide a sufficient understanding of resident interactions with green spaces and respective ecosystem service flows are lacking. We chose the city of Leipzig, one of the fastest growing cities in Germany, as a case study to assess the quality of publicly available green spaces by incorporating spatial context as a key dimension in determining their actual quality. We established 33 indicators that describe (1) natural elements, e.g., the types and configuration of vegetation and the proportion of water bodies; (2) built elements, e.g., various recreational facilities and path density; and (3) the embeddedness of green spaces within the built, social, and natural environment (context), e.g., the number of neighboring residents, nearby green or blue elements, and exposure to traffic. Based on these indicators, we developed a scoring approach that provides an evaluation of green space quality in terms of the potential to provide recreational ecosystem services. We identified and discussed spatial gaps and deficits in the quality of green space supply as well as leverage points for making operational improvements at the individual green space level. Our study provides urban planning guidance for identifying untapped potential for ecosystem services provision, e.g., because of usage barriers, and may help to balance the trade-offs between benefits for citizens and ecology and thus improve green spaces for both people and nature.

AB  - This paper examines conceptual and methodological issues in the analysis of environmental justice through use of the case of lead-exposure health risks. Researchers face important obstacles in measuring variable risks among population subgroups. The case of lead exposure, however, illustrates the dramatic potential where adequate data exist for identifying and correcting significant inequities in risk exposure. Despite sharp reductions in the general population's exposure to lead since the 1970s, substantial numbers of minority and low-income children continue to exhibit unacceptably high blood-lead levels due primarily to exposure to lead-based paint. Resolving environmental inequities in this and similar instances requires solid documentation of the risk and better integration of equity issues with other policy demands such as the call for cost-effective environmental policy.

AB  - This paper explores the use of empirical evidence to determine whether the exposure of minorities to environmental risks constitutes aversive racism. Connections are drawn between definitions of aversive racism and statistical approaches to research into the relationship between race and risk, paying particular attention to the influence of both non-racial discrimination and industrial location factors. Federal judicial and executive remedies to aversive racism are examined in light of the standards of evidence presented. An empirical study of the connection between race and exposure to toxic releases is then presented for Census block groups in Georgia and Ohio. It was found that the significance of race depends on the breadth of the explanatory model used in the analysis. A model of overall exposure to toxic releases shows that race is significant in a narrow model of discrimination but not ina broader model including industrial location factors. However, a model of targeting of minorities in the recent location of toxics-emitting facilities fails to show discrimination in any of the regression analyses. These findings support the view that environmental justice concerns cannot be addressed through reform of siting processes; broader remedies involving more stringent protection of exposure to toxic emissions are more likely to be effective.

AB  - What might it take for politically marginalized residents to challenge cuts in public spending that threaten to harm their health and wellbeing? Specifically, how did residents of Flint, Michigan contribute to the decision of an austerity regime, which was not accountable to them, to spend millions to switch to a safe water source? Relying on evidence from key interviews and newspaper accounts, we examine the influence and limitations of residents and grassroots groups during the 18-month period between April 2014 and October 2015 when the city drew its water from the Flint River. We find that citizen complaints alone were not sufficiently able to convince city officials or national media of widespread illness caused by the water. However, their efforts resulted in partnerships with researchers whose evidence bolstered their claims, thus inspiring a large contribution from a local foundation to support the switch to a clean water source. Thus, before the crisis gained national media attention, and despite significant constraints, residents' sustained organization-coupled with scientific evidence that credentialed local claims-motivated the return to the Detroit water system. The Flint case suggests that residents seeking redress under severe austerity conditions may require partnerships with external scientific elites.

AB  - Urban green and blue space interventions may bring about unintended consequences, involving trade-offs between the different land uses, and indeed, between the needs of different urban inhabitants, land users, and owners. Such trade-offs include choices between green/blue and non-green/blue projects, between broader land sparing vs. land sharing patterns, between satisfying the needs of the different inhabitants, but also between different ways of arranging the green and blue spaces. We analyze investment and planning initiatives in six case-study cities related to green and blue infrastructure (GBI) through the lens of a predefined set of questions an analytical framework based on the assumption that the flows of benefits from GBI to urban inhabitants and other stakeholders are mediated by three filters: infrastructures, institutions, and perceptions. The paper builds on the authors' own knowledge and experience with the analyzed case-study cities and beyond, a literature overview, a review of the relevant city documents, and interviews with key informants. The case studies indicate examples of initiatives that were intended to make GBI benefits available and accessible to urban inhabitants, in recognition of GBI as spaces with diverse functionality. Some case studies provide examples of trade-offs in trying to plan and design a green space for multiple private and public interests in densely built-up areas. The unintended consequences most typically resulted from the underappreciation of the complexity of social-ecological systems and more specifically the complexity of the involved infrastructures, institutions, and perceptions. The most important challenges addressed in the paper include trade-offs between the different ways of satisfying the residents' different needs related to the benefits from ecosystem services, ensuring proper recognition of the inhabitants' needs and perceptions, ecogentrification, caveats related to the formalization of informal spaces, and the need to consider temporal dynamics and cross-scale approaches that compromise different goals at different geographical scales.

The disparities of selected environmental indicators-exposure to traffic noise (road, rail, and air), NO2, external safety risks, and the availability of public green space-are analyzed both separately and in combination. Not only exposures to environmental burdens ("bads") were investigated, but also access to environmental benefits ("goods"). Additionally, we held interviews and reviewed documents to grasp the mechanisms underlying the environmental equity situation, with an emphasis on the role of public policy. Environmental equity is not a priority in public policy for the greater Rotterdam region known as the Rijnmond region, yet environmental standards have been established to provide a minimum environmental quality to all local residents. In general, environmental quality has improved in this region, and the accumulation of negative environmental outcomes ("bads") has been limited. However, environmental standards for road traffic noise and NO2 are being exceeded, probably because of the pressure on space and the traffic intensity. We found an association of environmental "bads" with income for rail traffic noise and availability of public green space. In the absence of regulation, positive environmental outcomes ("goods") are mainly left up to market forces. Consequently, higher-income groups generally have more access to environmental "goods" than lower-income groups.

AB  - While prior research has looked at big data's role in strengthening the environmental justice movement, scholars rarely examine the contexts, mechanisms and processes associated with the use of big data in monitoring and deterring environmental offenders, especially in the Global South. As such, this research aims to substitute for this academic gap through the use of multiple case studies of environmental offenders' engagement in illegal deforestation, as well as legal deforestation followed by fire. Specifically, we have chosen four cases from three economies in the Global South: Indonesia, Peru and Brazil. We demonstrate how the data utilized by environmental activists in these four cases qualify as true forms of big data, as they have searched and aggregated data from various sources and employed them to achieve their goals. The article shows how big data from various sources, mainly from satellite imagery, can help discern the true extent of environmental destruction caused by various offenders and present convincing evidence. The article also discusses how a rich satellite imagery archive is suitable for analyzing chronological events in order to establish a cause-effect chain. In all of the cases studied, such evidentiary provisions have been used by environmental activists to oblige policy makers to take necessary actions to counter environmental offenses.

AB  - This paper implements a framework that catalogs and maps opportunities at a city level to support the electrification of the transportation system in an equitable way. Leveraging on the use of hyper-local air quality data, paired with sociodemographic indicators, we evaluate the framework in the City of Oakland, CA under a context of public and private transport areas to prioritize interventions and incentives, while reducing environmental hazard exposure under an equity focus. Following the recognition of racial and socio-economic disparities, the subsequent steps of implementing operational strategies are to identify specific bus routes in the city in which decarbonization would render the highest impact with respect to the distribution of environmental burden, and to identify regions in which private vehicle interventions would render the highest impact with respect to racial and social equity and mobility.

AB  - This paper explores the concept of environmental justice (EJ) in solid waste management (SWM) in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It evaluates the extent to which EJ occurs in SWM and discusses the factors accounting for this state of affairs. The paper examines the relevant theoretical framework(s) and mechanisms that would facilitate the attainment of EJ in Kinshasa. It is argued that solid waste (SW) often ends up in the poorest and least powerful communities in the cities of the DRC. A qualitative research methodology, which includes exhaustive critical review of the literature, system analysis, reflections from best practices through case studies and discussion with stakeholders, was used for this study. Findings revealed that SWM in Kinshasa is a duty entrusted to publicly-funded municipal authorities. There are evidences of a clear divide between the rich and poor neighbourhoods in the manner SW is managed. This is an inequality that has only recently begun to be recognised as injustice practices in SWM. It is argued that a politico-cultural mechanism on remedying SWM inequities could enable changes that will address EJ in Kinshasa. Such a solution will go directly against the prevailing notion "some happy, others sad".

AB  - This paper investigates social and environmental injustices in solid waste management in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The urban poor in most parts of Kinshasa bear a huge encumbrance of the solid waste burden and face multiple challenges associated with poor management of solid waste. This situation has resulted in poor and unhealthy living conditions for the majority of the urban residents. The problem of solid waste management in Kinshasa has further been compounded by rapid urbanisation which has occurred in the face of poor urban governance, civil conflict and weak institutional set-up. The combination of these challenges has resulted in increased overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, lack of water and an unprecedented accumulation of solid waste which have triggered a myriad of urban problems. The worst affected are the poor urban who reside in locations that receive little or no socio-economic services from the Kinshasa Municipal authority. Using secondary data collected through a desk study, this paper argues that the poor solid waste situation in Kinshasa is not only a health risk, but also presents issues of both social and environmental injustices. These issues are analysed within the context of evolving arguments that focus on the need to develop a pro-poor approach in solid waste management that may present an opportunity for achieving both social and environmental justice for the urban poor in Kinshasa.

AB  - This paper is based on a review of the methodological approaches associated with solid waste management (SWM) in the context of subSaharan African (SSA) cities. Using Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as a case study, the paper proposes a new way of looking at solid waste in the bid to come up with alternative methods to improve the plight of SWM. A combination of qualitative research methods and system analysis have been employed to evaluate the causal relationships observed in contemporary SWM systems in Kinshasa. This paper argues that there is an absence of coherent and broad-based approaches to SWM in Kinshasa as is common in other SSA countries. Empirical evidence suggests that contemporary SWM strategies and approaches developed on a global scale which have increasingly been adopted by the Congolese national and local government authorities have proven inadequate to address the SWM realities on a local level. Using system thinking and system dynamics, this paper attempts to develop a feasible methodological framework focusing on the formulation of an appropriate approach to improve SWM in Kinshasa. It is argued that new ways of approaching the complexity that exists in SWM will facilitate the adoption of technologies and innovative ways of thinking and managing solid waste in a more sustainable, socially, and environmentally accepted manner.

AB  - With rising sea levels and possible storm intensification due to climate change, current United States urban coastal flood management strategies will be challenged. Due to limitations of current flood management strategies, evacuation is likely to become increasingly prominent in many coastal areas. Thus it is important to think critically about challenges for successful evacuation planning, particularly for vulnerable communities. This paper brings together the evacuation planning, climate change and environmental justice literatures. We describe the unique challenges that environmental justice communities face with evacuation, and identify best practice guidelines to improve the quality of evacuation planning for these communities. The guidelines presented, while not comprehensive, provide a framework for planners and policymakers to consider when developing evacuation plans, both for current and future climate conditions, and could improve the quality of evacuation planning.

AB  - Urban greenery is considered an important factor in sustainable development and people's quality of life in the city. To account for urban green vegetation, Green View Index (GVI), which captures the visibility of greenery at street level, has been used. However, as GVI is point-based estimation, when aggregated at an area-level by mean or median, it is sensitive to the location of sampled sites, overweighing the values of densely located sites. To make estimation at area-level more robust, this study aims to (1) propose an improved indicator of greenery visibility (standardized GVI; sGVI), and (2) quantify the relation between sGVI and other green metrics. Experiment on an hypothetical setting confirmed that bias from site location can be mitigated by sGVI. Furthermore, comparing sGVI and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at the city block level in Yokohama city, Japan, we found that sGVI captures the presence of vegetation better in the city center, whereas NDVI is better at capturing vegetation in parks and forests, principally due to the different viewpoints (eye-level perception and top-down eyesight). These tools provide a foundation for accessing the effect of vegetation in urban landscapes in a more robust matter, enabling comparison on any arbitrary geographical scale.

AB  - Translocal mobilizations on issues of social and environmental justice have arisen across the world, often in response to the depredations of extractive industries linked to global capital networks. A key challenge in theorizing such mobilization is to understand how dispersed and diverse actors come together contingently around common campaigns of justice, and enable powerless and marginal actors to contend with powerful state and corporate actors. In my paper, I draw on DeLanda's work on assemblages to engage with this question in the context of the case of Niyamgiri in India. The proposal to mine Niyamgiri, a mountain located in South Odisha in India, gave rise to a transnational mobilization which included local grassroots movements, activists, lawyers, conservation organizations and human rights/indigenous rights networks from around the world. I describe the mobilization as a translocal assemblage of resistance, individuated out of interactions between diverse actors across locations and scales. I discuss how this assemblage emerged through interactions between pre-existing actors, networks and institutions, and enabled marginalized and powerless communities to contend with powerful assemblages of state and capital. I argue that thinking in terms of assemblages can provide a strategic depth to social and environmental justice movements, which totalizing discourses of capital, power and revolution often foreclose.

AB  - This paper argues that environmental justice scholars have tended to overlook the significance of the state's role in shaping understandings of race and racism, and argues for the use of critical race theory to deepen insight into the role of the state in both fostering and responding to conditions of racialized environmental injustice. Critical race theory offers insights into both why and how the state manages racial categories in such a way as to produce environmental injustice, and how the state responds to the claims of the environmental justice movement. Closer attention to the interplay between the racial state and the environmental justice movement as a racial social movement will yield important insights into the conditions, processes, institutions and state apparatuses that foster environmental injustice and that delimit the possibilities for achieving environmental justice in some form or another.

AB  - We used geospatial techniques to study the potential impact of 2 exotic mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus and Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus, on the epidemiology of West Nile virus in Maryland. These 2 species have established populations in Maryland over the past 15 years. Larvae of both mosquito species are found in natural and artificial water-holding cavities and containers, particularly water in tires. Therefore, we used locations of licensed tire dealers and of tire dumps scheduled for clean up as an index for potential sources of mosquito vectors. This index was expected to underestimate the actual population of source habitats. West Nile virus activity in Maryland during 1999, 2000, and 2001 was indicated by the presence of dead, infected birds, particularly American crows and other corvids; infected pools of mosquitoes; and human and horse infections. Adult females of both mosquito species are aggressive, opportunistic feeders that have been observed to take blood meals from avian and mammalian hosts. Susceptible vertebrate hosts, particularly birds, are ubiquitously distributed throughout the developed areas of the state. This analysis demonstrated a spatial convergence of the virus, the exotic mosquito vectors, and susceptible hosts. This conjunction indicated that these 2 mosquito species have a high potential to serve as bridge vectors and thus, impact the epidemiology of West Nile virus under favorable environmental and climatic conditions. Positive mosquito pools were collected from only the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan corridor, suggesting a newly created enzootic focus for this virus. Land-cover analysis of the sites where virus activity had been detected showed predominantly developed land uses. Analyses of the environmental justice aspects (social, economic, and housing characteristics) of block groups with human West Nile fever cases or with positive mosquito pools were equivocal. Human cases seemed to occur in developed block groups with lower income levels.

AB  - This study explores the potential risks associated with the 65 U.S.-based commercial nuclear power plants and the distribution of those risks among the populations of both their respective host communities and of the communities located in outlying areas. First, it starts by examining the racial/ethnic composition of the host community populations, as well as the disparities in socioeconomic status that exist, if any, between the host communities and communities located in outlying areas. Second, it utilizes two independent-sample T tests to identify any differences in the sociodemographic compositions of the two areas. Third, it explores regional demographic trends by looking at the percent change in demographic variables in the host communities and communities located in outlying areas in 1990-2000 and 2000-2010. Findings reveal that during the past two decades more people were exposed to the risks as population living in the host communities increased.

Four risk levels are defined: low risk, moderate risk, high risk, and very high risk. Discrepancies that exist in the sociodemographic characteristics of the host communities' populations are examined as sorted by risk-level category. It is found that a greater percentage of minority groups are exposed to the highest levels of risk. In addition, percent "Hispanic" and percent "Other," a grouping that includes multiracial, mixed, interracial, as well as Hispanic and Latino groups (for example, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Spanish) are categories that show the greatest percent change in both the period 1990-2000 and 2000-2010.

AB  - Urban green space use is often associated with improved physical and mental health and lower noncommunicable disease (NCDs) burdens. Factors that influence green space visits have been documented in cities of the Global North, but evidence of urban green space use patterns for cities in the Global South is scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate factors influencing urban green space use patterns in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a megacity of the Global South, with a particular focus on how poor health condition and healthcare professionals' prescriptions to exercise outdoors (park prescriptions-ParkRx) impact the green space use of middle-aged adults. We collected green space characteristics and use factors (i.e., availability, accessibility, attractiveness, and attachment), health condition, ParkRx, and urban green space use intensity (i.e., frequency and duration) via a self-reported questionnaire from 169 middle-aged residents of Dhaka. We used multivariate modeling to estimate the association of green space characteristics, health condition, and ParkRx with use intensity. We further applied a mediation analysis to determine the influence of ParkRx on the relationship between residents' poor health conditions and use intensity. We found that green space availability and accessibility did not significantly influence use intensity, but attractiveness was negatively associated with use intensity. Green space use intensity was significantly and positively associated with attachment to the green space, poor health condition (i.e., having noncommunicable diseases), and ParkRx. ParkRx significantly mediated the relationship between health condition and use intensity. We observed limited supply, poor access, and low attractiveness when studying the urban green spaces in Dhaka, but these qualities did not affect use intensity, as found in many case studies in the Global North. In contrast, urban green space use intensity in our case study is mostly dependent on poor health condition and park prescriptions.

AB  - This paper unpacks the environmental justice concerns of rural migrants in relation to land tenure and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. We explore the "geography of recognition", whereby sense of community, identity and place interact to produce unequal experiences of recognitional justice in relation to the EIA process. We develop our argument by using qualitative research and a village case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, involving transmigrant communities and indigenous Kutai people. This study highlights how a failure to recognize transmigrants' identity creates barriers to their meaningful participation in the EIA. Structural flaws in the decentralized land-use system mean a failure to address the contested claims for recognition and land rights between transmigrant and indigenous communities, which in turn fuels social and environmental conflict. Resolving land tenure conflicts requires the empowerment of socially marginalized groups in the decision-making over land-use projects affecting them.

AB  - Urban trees play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, cleaning air, promoting physical activity, and improving mental health. However, it is still largely unknown how the density and species of urban street trees may impact local public health. This study demonstrates how open data mining and large-scale spatial data integration can contribute to deeper insights into the effects of urban forestry. We analyze the impact of the spatial distribution of street trees by species in New York City by combining crowd-sourced tree census data which includes geolocation, species, size, and condition for each of 652,169 street trees - with pollen activity, allergen severity, land use, housing conditions, and neighborhood demographic data. We further integrate neighborhood asthma hospitalization and emergency department visit rates and air quality data (PM2.5) to investigate how street trees impact local air quality and the prevalence of acute respiratory illness. Using a geographically weighted regression model, the results indicate that although a greater concentration of trees contributes to better local air quality, species with severe allergenicity can increase local asthma hospitalization rates in vulnerable populations, controlling for other covariates.

AB  - Urban design is an essential component of planning for climate transformation. However, the concept of transformation in urban design is complicated by the problematic legacy of design-led mega-projects. Such projects, often called Haussmannization, are criticized as inattentive to existing landscape, built, and social environments. While corrective movements have partially addressed criticisms of Haussmannization, they can also hinder justice-centered climate transformation, by empowering already powerful interests to defend status quo conditions or justifying inequity-deepening interventions in the name of climate action, a phenomenon we label climate Haussmannization. We present a schema connecting transformative urban design with procedural, distributive, and recognitional justice.

The aim of the paper is to improve understanding needed for sustainable climate change adaptation of inland systems, where sustainability encompasses social and psychological adaptation, environmental justice, and the preservation and enhancement of human dignity and natural resources. This requires participatory approaches with iterative problem framing and solution generation that are respectful of both human dignity and the integrality of nature. A vital component of developing adaptation strategies is the assessment of current vulnerabilities, namely the extent to which current climate variability and change, acting together with other stressors, impact inland systems. This assessment requires an understanding of the climate system and its impacts to inland systems, as well as the responses of the systems to changing climate. A complex adaptive systems approach can be useful in carrying out such an assessment. Important factors include how inland centers especially marginal lands, disadvantaged populations, and threatened ecosystems are resilient to both episodic shocks and to steady trends, which may be difficult to measure, monitor, or forecast. Climate change adaptation strategies for inland systems must also take into account transboundary issues, and take advantage of opportunities where present.

AB  - This study evaluated lead, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination in the residential communities adjacent to the Sydney, Nova Scotia, tar ponds, the area considered Canada's worst contaminated site. The tar pond remediation policy has been limited to the site and some residential properties. We compared background concentrations in 91 soil samples taken 5-20 km from the coke oven site with those in soil samples from the three communities surrounding the tar ponds: Whitney Pier, Ashby, and North End. These surrounding communities were statistically different from background regarding arsenic, lead, and PAHs. Twenty percent of the background soil samples and 95% of the tar pond soil samples were above the Canadian health-risk-based soil guidelines for arsenic (12 ppm), and 5% of the background samples and 80% of the tar pond soil samples were above the Canadian guidelines for lead (140 ppm). Regarding dust lead and arsenic loading, the results provide no evidence that Whitney Pier is significantly different than Ashby and North End. Children in these communities are predicted to have a 1-15% chance of blood lead > 10 mug/dL. The results suggest that lead and arsenic found in the homes originate outside. The lead content of paint in the homes was not evaluated, but consideration of painted wood at the doorway did not confound the results of the study. The results indicate that the residential environment has been adversely affected by PAHs, lead, and arsenic and should be considered for remediation.

AB  - While urban disamenities and pollution sources have received considerable attention in environmental justice research, few studies have examined sociospatial inequities associated with the distribution of desirable land uses. In this paper we focus on addressing this limitation by investigating the environmental equity implications of street trees-an important publicly financed amenity that provides several direct and indirect benefits to urban residents. The specific objective was to determine if the spatial distribution of public right-of-way trees is equitable with respect to race and ethnicity, income, and housing tenure in the city of Tampa, Florida, USA. We seek to extend research on equity analysis of urban amenities through several methodological innovations, including: (a) accounting for the heterogeneity of urban land use; (b) utilizing high-resolution remote sensing techniques to quantify parcel-specific tree cover; and (c) using multivariate regression models that control for spatial dependence within the data. The results support the inequity hypothesis by indicating a significantly lower proportion of tree cover on public right-of-way in neighborhoods containing a higher proportion of African-Americans, low-income residents, and renters. These findings have important implications for local public investment and policy strategies.

AB  - We use the hedonic method to examine the external effects of Rhode Island's voluntary brownfield program. We hypothesize that housing price impacts are a combination of valuation of environmental improvement and response to information disclosure initiated by remediation. The results indicate that housing prices decline after nearby remediation, suggesting incomplete information about the presence of risk. Further, we find empirical evidence that price impacts and the degree of incomplete information are different across neighborhoods. Specifically, low-housing-value neighborhoods experience price declines following remediation, while high-value neighborhoods experience price increases, leading to an overall regressive impact.

AB  - Visualizing, analyzing and assessing the dangers of toxins and other pollutants in both water and air continues to be a problem for low-income communities. Recent research suggests that minority neighborhoods in particular experience above average environment-related health problems. GIS mapping has proven to be a valuable policy tool in presenting local and regional environmental conditions to community organizations and policy makers. The challenge for the near future is to put this tool within reach of community groups to assist with their organizing and advocacy work. CUCREJ (The Community University Consortium for Regional Environmental Justice) developed a partnership with Cornell University and environmental justice grass roots community groups to assist in documenting water and air quality conditions and potential hazards within their vicinity. The emphasis is on creating a sustainable GIS website and layered map that contains demographic, commercial, and current environmental information. The process and purpose of academic involvement in community organizations can be problematic.

AB  - We are living in a time of crisis on planet Earth. Urgent calls for transformational change are getting louder. Technical solutions have an important role to play in addressing pressing global challenges, but alone they are not enough. After all, who decides what kind of transformation is needed, of what, and for whom? What principles guide those decisions, and how are decision-makers held accountable? This commentary article argues that these governance questions are central in any solution, in order to simultaneously address the planetary crises of forest and biodiversity loss and degradation and growing inequality. To this end, we examine governance in forests and around trees, in landscapes and on farms, through the lens of power and social justice. For applied research aimed at actionable solutions to these global problems, we propose a governance research agenda for the next decade that is both transformative and just.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) may present economic contributions through increases in proximate property values, encapsulated in the proximity principle (PP). More data on the PP is required from the Global South, where the quality and equitable distribution of UGSs are important considerations. This paper investigates the PP in Potchefstroom, South Africa following a quantitative approach, by statistically analyzing municipal property valuations in three districts differentiated according to their socioeconomic status (SES). Districts are divided into sample areas where three zones are demarcated according to their proximity to a UGS. The results show that property valuations are generally higher for properties in closer proximity to UGSs in lower- and higher-income samples, but are lower in middle-income areas. Neighborhood characteristics and SES, UGS amenity and maintenance, ecosystem services and disservices, domestic garden area and residential property size may be connected to the confirmation or rejection of the PR The rejection of the PP in middle-income areas indicates a need to improve public UGSs as amenity destinations. The results confirming the PP in low-income areas could incentivize expenditures to improve UGS area and quality to increase the willingness to pay for proximity to such spaces and, reciprocally, increase revenue from municipal property taxes.

AB  - This study addresses links between economic and nutritional variation in an urban North American setting. We employed a mixed-methods approach including mapping, semi-structured interviews, and food outlet surveys to investigate the public health impact of variation in the cost and availability of food between two socioeconomically distinct neighbourhoods of the City of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Food cost in supermarkets was not found to be higher in the low-income neighbourhood, though it was much higher in the variety stores that predominate in the low-income neighbourhood. Moreover, there was a very low availability of produce in the variety stores. Reduced fresh produce availability and lower incomes have the potential to negatively influence public health in the less-affluent study area by increasing the difficulty of acquiring healthy foods.

AB  - This paper surveys pressing issues facing current and future social policies in the European Union (EU) at the juncture of social justice demands and environmental concerns. European policy-makers have in fact only recently acknowledged the notions of environmental justice and environmental inequalities, which have been part of the US policy arsenal for almost two decades. Yet, challenges to equality and fairness in the environmental domain are many and growing within the European Union. After having defined environmental justice and environmental inequalities in the European context, the paper addresses two contemporary dimensions of those challenges for EU social policies: vulnerability and exposure to environmental disaster and risk; and fairness in environmental taxation and the related issue of fuel poverty.

AB  - This paper presents the first national study on environmental inequalities in France. It applies the Anglo-American concept of environmental justice, focusing on the distribution of environmental burdens, to the French setting and tests the hypothesis that poor and immigrant communities are disproportionately exposed to environmental risks. The location of eight types of hazardous sites (industrial and nuclear sites, incinerators, waste management facilities) and the socio-economic characteristics of populations are associated at the commune, or town, level for all 36 600 French towns. The analysis, descriptive and multivariate, uses simple and spatial regression techniques. It shows that towns with high proportions of immigrants tend to host more hazardous sites, even controlling for population size, income, degree of industrialization of the town and region. The study establishes the presence of environmental inequities in France and raises new public policy questions. However, it does not investigate the mechanisms that may explain inequities, which could include procedural injustices, land market dynamics and historical patterns of industrial and urban development.

AB  - To study the associations of annoyance to noise and exposure to residential traffic with sociodemographic, socioeconomic and regional characteristics as well as housing conditions, a population-based sample of 7,988 adults 18-79 years of age was studied in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1). Annoyance to noise and exposure to residential traffic were assessed by self-administered questionnaires. A total of 6.3 % of the participants reported a high to very high exposure to residential traffic noise, 3.7 % to neighbourhood noise and 2.1 % to aircraft noise. An excessive exposure to residential traffic was reported by 21.3 % of the participants. A high annoyance to traffic and neighborhood noise was associated with a lower equivalised disposable income and poor housing conditions. Additionally annoyance to neighborhood noise was associated with low socioeconomic and occupational status. A high annoyance to aircraft noise was only associated with a low equivalised disposable income and living in apartment blocks. Exposure to residential traffic was associated with all investigated indicators. At present in Germany environmental exposures are social unequally distributed and may lead to negative health consequences in social disadvantaged groups.

AB  - Urban populations benefit greatly from the ecosystem services provided by urban green and blue spaces. While the equity of provision of and access to urban green and blue spaces has been widely explored, research on equity of ecosystem service provision is relatively scant. Using household level data, our study aims to assess the supply equity of five regulatory ecosystem services in Singapore. We employed linear mixed-effects models and Hot Spot Analysis to analyze their distributional equity across individual households of various demographic characteristics (horizontal inequality), and calculated Gini coefficient for the distribution of PM10 removal service among households categorised into demographic subgroups (vertical inequality). Our results show little evidence of inequitable ecosystem service provision among Singapore's diverse socio-demographic groups. This can be attributed to the early integration of environmental management strategies and meticulous socio-economic desegregation efforts into urban development plans, which maximised provision and maintenance of urban green spaces to all residents.

I highlight how particular scientific knowledges are privileged throughout the rehabilitation process, but only so long as the rehabilitation problems at hand are deemed manageable. I also argue that the implications of the immense time scales of impacts are being ignored, and the question of monitoring, remediation, and regulation thousands of years into the deep future constitutes a kind of 'uncomfortable knowledge'. Ultimately, I contend that the legacy of the rehabilitated Ranger uranium mine will pose long-term threats to the environment and Mirarr Traditional Owners of the area, and that this slow violence constitutes a kind of unacknowledged environmental disaster, but one which is being disregarded through the active production of ignorance.

AB  - While the agricultural knowledges and practices of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and women have shaped agriculture in the US, these knowledges have been colonized, exploited, and appropriated, cleaving space for the presently dominant white male agricultural narrative. Simultaneously, these knowledges and practices have been transformed to fit within a society that values individualism, production, efficiency, and profit. The authors use a decolonial Feminist Political Ecology framework to highlight the ways in which the knowledges of Indigenous, Black, and women farmers have been and are being colonized; a tradition that makes alternative agriculture a predominantly white space. The authors interviewed 10 BIPOC and women farmers in Colorado to understand what values and knowledges were shaping their often-appropriated agricultural practices. Three themes emerged: people, place, and patterns. By centering these values, farmers create relational agricultural practices that support the well-being of human and more-than-human beings. To support the widespread implementation of these practices, food systems practitioners must elevate the voices and knowledges of historically excluded farmers. Only then can truly just and equitable alternative agricultural practices be realized in the US.

AB  - This study examines the use of emergency management laws as a policy response to fiscal emergencies in urban areas. Focusing on one Midwestern Rust Belt state, we use a mixed methods approach - integrating chronology of legislative history, analysis of Census data, and an ethnographic case study - to examine the dynamics of emergency management laws from a social justice perspective. Analysis of Census data showed that emergency management policies disproportionately affected African Americans and poor families. Analysis indicated that in one state, 51% of African American residents and 16.6% of Hispanic or Latinos residents had lived in cities that were under the governance of an emergency manager at some time during 2008-2013, whereas only 2.4% of the White population similarly had lived in cities under emergency management. An ethnographic case study highlights the mechanisms by which an emergency manager hindered the ability of residents in one urban neighborhood, expected to host a large public works project, to obtain a Community Benefits Agreement intended to provide assistance to residents, most of whom were poor families with young children. We conclude with a discussion of how emergency management laws may impact social service practice and policy practice in urban communities, framed from a social justice perspective. We argue that these are not race neutral policies, given clear evidence of race and ethnic disparities in their implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the unequal distribution of the environmental and social costs and benefits of the genetically modified (GM) soy model in Argentina and its impact on grievance formation and the emergence of contestation. In the 1990s, Argentina transitioned into a neoliberal agro-industrial model based on producing GM soy for export. Though celebrated as a success, the expansion of GM soy monocultures has brought widespread socio-ecological disruption. Various social actors have started to mobilize against the resulting environmental injustice. I focus on the peasant-indigenous movement in the north of the country, which is struggling for land rights, and the movements against agrochemical spraying in the central Pampas region. These groups, which are relatively powerless to control resources where they live, and that experience little or no benefit from GM soy production, nevertheless bear most of its social and ecological costs. These struggles link environmental and social well-being, becoming struggles for ecological sustainability as well as social justice and equity.

AB  - We examine the role of the regulatory state in the inequitable distribution of social advantages and disadvantages. To illustrate this, we examine the spatial distribution of exposures to air toxics from noxious land uses (commonly referred to as the environmental justice problem) and inquire into the nature of state action that would allow such inequity. Findings from our inquiry lead us to focus more closely on the administrative functions of the state, especially its role as a regulatory body. A case study focusing on health risks from incompatible land uses illustrates how spatial inequities result from the formally neutral rule-making actions of regulatory agencies and their particular organizational cultures. We describe the ethical basis of the regulatory state in terms of its formal, juridical, deontological underpinnings. In contrast to this stands the alternative ethical concept of care, which is inherently relational, contextual, and preferentially attentive to the needs of the vulnerable. We argue that the regulatory state can be reformed, building structures of care to better address issues of spatial inequity. We end with a discussion of how the institutional model of the caring state might be achieved in practice.

AB  - This paper tracks the development of climate justice discourse around leaving fossil fuels in the ground. It then looks forward to the questions of equity that calls for the decline of fossil fuel production raise. It argues, following the Lofoten Declaration for a Managed Decline of Fossil Fuel Production around the World, that global distributive justice requires rich countries, who have benefited the most from fossil fuel extraction, and who have most alternative available development pathways must lead in leaving fossil fuels in the ground. However, the paper shows that equitably managing the end of the fossil fuel era is complicated by how economic efficiency or the interests of frontline communities might at times diverge from global distributive justice. In response, the paper argues that a useful short-term strategy is to focus on how equity and economic efficiency both suggest that wealthy historically polluting countries should leave high-cost, carbon-intensive fossil fuels in the ground. Beyond that, the paper highlights how difficult questions and trade-offs emerge at points where considerations of equity and economic efficiency diverge. Such points of divergence represent a considerable challenge for advocates of an equitable decline of fossil fuel production, and are areas of significant interest for future research and advocacy.

Using cities as units of analysis and fifteen years of data, we examine their public funding efforts for parks and recreational spaces, evaluating the reliability of the findings across alternative modeling specifications. Social and institutional characteristics are explored as for explanations of public funding efforts for parks and recreational spaces. The main finding is that significantly different levels of parks and recreation spending are prevalent across American cities. Additional findings are that social and institutional conditions affect the public funding of parks and recreation programs, based on a pooled spatial analysis of cities. While its primary contribution is to research on disparities in urban parks and recreational spaces, the paper also integrates social and institutional literatures to identify factors influencing the allocation of public funds to those spaces in metropolitan areas.

AB  - Under Apartheid, marginalised groups had limited power to influence decisions contributing to environmental injustices. Democracy witnessed civil society as 'inclusive' to engage in formal decision-making. This paper examines the ability of the state and industry to effectively implement formal participatory decision-making spaces, including the ability of civil society to engage in these spaces. This paper presents viewpoints from stakeholders in Durban to examine engagement amongst civil society, the state and industry for participatory democracy. Investigations reveal that tokenistic participatory processes by provincial/local government and industry during development processes, government use of industrial consultants for decision-making, and fragmentation between some local community groups due to acquisition of industrial funding has not effectively included marginalised citizen's into participatory processes to inform decisions. Despite a democratic transition, participatory democracy for environmental justice is limited. This paper suggests that government and industry need to engage proactively with civil society before decisions are made on development processes, rather than as an afterthought. It is also suggested that consultants used during development processes be chosen in consensus between civil society, industry and government. Community coherence against industrial risks will also be better achieved if industrial funding was administered through a community fund with an appropriate monitoring system of how funds are used.

AB  - This paper seeks to map the extent to which civil society actors champion environmental justice in an industrial risk society. It examines the role of civil society actors in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, in being able to perceive industrial risk and push local concerns in development processes. The paper draws on qualitative and empirical research for a local case study in Merebank, South Durban, to explore how civil society engaged to organize and respond to local groundwater contamination caused by the German multinational Bayer, and also influence construction of knowledge around risk. It examines civil society networking to organize collectively and subsequent responses to government and industry during the risk assessment and remediation process. The final section engages in a discussion of findings and draws some conclusions.

AB  - This research explores relationships between the spatial distribution of industrial facilities that release lead and lead compounds, community characteristics, and levels of violent and property crime in Hillsborough County, Florida. The spatial distribution of selected Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) facilities was modeled using Getis-Ord Gi* to classify census tracts into three groups: (1) tracts with statistically significant spatial clusters of TRIs; (2) tracts where there was a non-random-absence of TRIs; and (3) tracts with a random distribution of TRIs. Results of one-way ANOVA comparing demographics of clustered locations of TRIs to random and dispersed areas found significant differences, but local prediction models from geographically weighted regression (GWR) were no more useful in understanding TRI concentrations in areas where they are more clustered than in random or dispersed areas. GWR models predicting property crime were improved when TRI concentration was used in random and dispersed areas, but TRI concentration did not improve models predicting violent crime rates.

AB  - This study drawing concepts from the fields of sociology, organizational behavior, and marketing examines residents' perceptions of justice in relation to environmental development. Although prior research raised issues related to environmental development from the justice perspective, very little is known about how residents perceive justice related to environmental development. Therefore, our study examines residents' perceptions of justice and how those perceptions influence the relationship with the government. More specifically, the study proposes that four types of justice (distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational) are related with the residents' trust in the government, which predicts their intentions to support for future projects and the government. To test the proposed model, we collected data from residents of four cities in China that were going through environmental development projects. The results of the study show perceptions of distributive justice and interpersonal justice have a significant positive effect on the residents' trust in the government and the environmental development. The study also finds that trust in the government and trust in the environmental development are positively related with residents' intentions to support the government and additional environmental developments. Our finding, however, does not support that either perceptions of procedural justice or perceptions of informational justice are important in the Chinese context. Implications of the study are presented.

AB  - Urban parks, especially of large size, are highly beneficial for the physical, mental, and social well-being of urban residents by providing various recreational services. However, traditional methods and data sources to evaluate the park provision of recreation service take no account of actual user distribution and the interactions between cities. In this study, we used the density of mobile phone park check-ins and the average service radius of large urban parks, extracted from a massive volume of anonymized mobile phone signaling data, as two rapid indicators of the recreational use efficiency of large urban parks for 11 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The results indicated the significant disparities among cities in terms of park visitation and service area in this region. Then, we conducted Hierarchical linear regression (HLR) models to explore the relationships between the two indicators and fourteen potential influencing city-level and park-specific factors for 206 sampled large urban parks. Park size was found to have the strongest and negative effect on the density of mobile phone check-ins of large urban parks, while the distance to the administrative center and park landscape shape index (LSI) was also negatively associated with the density of mobile park check-ins. Urban built-up area and the green coverage rate, positively associated with the density of mobile park check-ins, had a negative weight on the service radius of large urban parks. However, the number of POIs within the 1000m buffer and the overall park rating were positively associated with both the density of mobile park check-ins and the service radius of large urban parks. Our findings validated the trends of inter-city short trips on weekends and holidays, which necessitate a comprehensive plan on regional green space construction and sharing in city clusters, in order to improve both ecological and recreational services and benefit the health and well-being of urban residents at a larger scope.

AB  - Urban public green spaces (UPGSs) are rarely uniformly distributed across space. A subset of urban population is disproportionately well available of UPGSs, while other residents have considerably limited accessibility to UPGSs. Communicating and examining the spatial heterogeneity in UPGSs availability can formulate better land use policy. This paper applies the geographically weighted regression (GWR) to analyze the locality-specific relationships between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and UPGSs availability at district level in Shanghai, China. In particular, we construct a neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage index (NSDI) that incorporates elements from four dimensions including wealth, occupation, education and housing. Three domains of indicators (abundance, quality and accessibility) are developed to measure UPGSs. Results show that relationships between NSDI and UPGSs availability indicators present significant spatial non-stationarity. In general, UPGSs abundance and accessibility are lower in districts characterized by higher NSDI. However, converse trend is found in districts on the southwestern urban edge. UPGSs quality is poorer in districts with higher socioeconomic disadvantage within the central city, while UPGSs in the socioeconomically disadvantaged exhibit better quality within the outskirts. Our results highlight the importance of considering the locality-specific neighborhood socioeconomic profiles of UPGSs availability. The applied GWR framework presents promising potential for better UPGSs planning in a policy context. In the future, two principles are required for urban greening policies: (1) a comprehensive perspective in UPGSs availability evaluation; (2) locality-specific target strategies. The principles are not only key for China but also relevant to other nations who wish to achieve successful urban greening. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores analytical techniques to identify the environmental justice (EJ) population in a racially diverse area and to evaluate the benefits and burdens of transportation projects upon EJ and non-EJ populations. A statistical technique was developed to identify the block groups where minority and low-income populations were disproportionately concentrated, with variation in the size of the block groups taken into account. Four performance measures that represent the transportation benefits of and burdens on the identified EJ and non-EJ areas were determined to evaluate accessibility, mobility, safety, and equity. Specific questions and indexes for each performance measure were developed to define disproportionate impacts. To establish transportation projects' connection with local communities, those projects were categorized and selected on the basis of their type in addition to their geographical location. The method developed for Oahu, Hawaii, is transferable to states, cities, and metropolitan areas throughout the United States.

AB  - To meet the demand for identifying and controlling toxic air contaminants in environmental justice communities, we have recently developed a cost-effective spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy (SIBS) instrument for detecting and quantifying toxic metal air pollutants. We characterized the detection limit and linearity of this SIBS instrument by analyzing nebulized elemental standard solutions. The experimental parameters affecting SIBS performance were optimized, including the time delay to observation, the distance between electrodes, and the ablation voltage. The instrument successfully detected Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn, Co, and Ni, with limits of detection ranged from 0.05 mu g m(-3) to 0.81 mu g m(-3) at a flow rate of 151 min(-1) and a 30 min sampling duration. Similar to other investigations using ion breakdown spectroscopy, we did not observe strong emissions lines for As, Sb, Se, Hg, Pb, and Cd, which were likely due to spectral overlap, matrix effects, and the limited detection range of the optical components. Overall, SIBS is a promising technique for field measurements of toxic metals for environmental justice, industrial and urban applications.

AB  - Urban green spaces play a critical role in public health and human wellbeing for urban residents. Due to the uneven spatial distribution of urban green spaces in most of cities, the issue of the disparity between supply and demand has aroused public concern. In a case of Shenzhen, a modified Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is adopted to evaluate the disparity between park provision and the demanders in terms of accessibility at hierarchical levels under four types of distance (e.g., Euclidean distance, walking distance, bicycling distance, and driving distance), which is well aligned with hierarchical systems in urban green spaces in urban planning practice. By contrast and correlation analysis, among the four types of distance, the statistical correlations are relatively high between Euclidean distance and the other three. Nonetheless, the pattern of spatial accessibility under different type of travel distance is apparently variant. Accessibility calculated by Euclidean distance is overestimated relative to that of the other three, while the pattern of walking distance and bicycling distance is similar to each other. The choice of type of distance is worthy of caution when evaluating spatial accessibility by 2SFCA method. Results show that the accessibility to parks at all hierarchical levels is high particularly, particularly at the natural level. However, the disparity between the supply and demand is significant. The percentage of communities that have high population density but low park accessibility is over 40% (equivalent to approximately 55% of the population). The finding may provide implications on access to urban greens paces for urban planners and authorities to develop effective planning strategies.

AB  - Urban surface water floods pose growing threats in urban areas, which cause not only massive physical water disturbance, but also loss of human lives, destruction of social and economic infrastructures and disorder of society. The number and scale of flood damage in urban areas will continue to increase in the next several decades due to global trend in urbanization and climate change. Despite the extensive construction of grey infrastructures, many cities in the world remain vulnerable to surface water flooding, especially during the extremely weather events. Since the 1990s, green infrastructure has developed as an alternative and sustainable approach to mitigate flood hazard in urban areas. Despite the great effectiveness of urban green infrastructures in alleviating storm water runoff, there is comparatively little research for planners and designers to determine an appropriate strategy for green infrastructure planning. To address this gap, we propose a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation method to identify the priority areas to site green infrastructure, based on five criteria: 1) storm-water runoff mitigation; 2) social flood vulnerable group protection; 3) flood sensitive area road infrastructures protection; 4) flood sensitive area buildings protection and 5) environmental justice. The weights of the five criteria are defined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. We focus particularly on mitigating urban surface water flooding risk and demonstrate how the method can be applied using a case study of Ghent.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) provide numerous irreplaceable environmental and social benefits to humankind, but the lack of baseline information makes it difficult to propose a reasonable greening strategy so as to achieve an equitable allocation of community green spaces. This paper divides UGSs into three classes using the spatial design network analysis (sDNA) and quantifies the UGS accessibility of communities in central Wuhan. Based on these results and the Gini coefficient, we analyze the UGS equity of the spatial distribution at the community level, then propose future greening strategies both at the city and community levels. The results show that the railway station and old Wuhan city are the core areas of traffic network strength (TNS). UGSs are evenly distributed in the core areas of TNS, but the number of UGSs in non-core areas is small, and their distribution is relatively uneven, and the number of communities with medium UGS accessibility is the largest, carrying the densest residential population. Most communities perform well in terms of UGS equity, but the UGS equity of 163 communities, covering a population of more than one million, remains to be improved. The method and conclusions of this study will contribute to the future greening policy making of 965 communities in central Wuhan, thus promoting the orderly planning and high-quality construction of community living circles.

AB  - Urban public green space (PGS) provides a wealth of ecological and social benefits, and is the key for sustainable urban development and human well-being satisfaction. A comprehensive evaluation is an important basis for PGS refined governance and planning. However, few studies have comprehensively explored the fine dimension of PGS quality, accessibility, and population, for the evaluation of accessible PGS and its spatial equity. Therefore, we evaluated the accessible PUS at the community-scale with the consideration of temporal accessibility and PUS quality. We first evaluated the accessible PGS of communities using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) approach based on road network. Secondly, Gini coefficient was employed to examine the spatial equity of community-scale PGS. Finally, we proposed relevant strategies for improving PGS provision. The main findings of this study were: transportation modes did not change the average PGS level but had a spatial "flattening effect" on the accessible PGS. Transportation modes affected PGS equity as they changed the PGS accessibility, and the equity of accessible PGS progressively increases with walking, riding E-bike, and driving. The spatial imbalance of PGS quality exacerbated PGS inequity, not only existing quantity unfair, but also quality unfair. Comprehensive PGS supply improvement strategies were proposed in terms of quantity increase, accessibility improvement, and quality construction. This study is conducive to the implementation of human-scale green space planning, providing a basis for the refined urban management.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) has rich ecological and social benefits, and is closely related to the well-being of residents. Its spatial equity is a major concern for both residents and planners. However, effective decision-making support tools for UGS planning are still lacking. This study therefore proposes a UGS spatial optimization method that takes spatial equity and conversion cost into account to optimize the UGS layout in Xuzhou, China. The essence of the purposed optimization method is to constantly adjust the conversion probability of alternative land parcels into UGS to obtain a UGS layout that minimizes the overall conversion cost under the constraints of per capita UGS and spatial equity requirements. It is suggested that UGS spatial configuration is highly complex and that basic spatial units, population distribution, spatial equity, and the costs of conversion all need to be considered when planning UGS, which moreover needs to be optimized based on various spatial analysis. UGS spatial optimization should be integrated with planning regulated indicators such as per capita UGS and spatial equity, the implementation of which should be feasible based on the current UGS layout and land use situation. The proposed UGS spatial optimization method can generate optimized UGS layouts that meet controlling demands of planning, lowering UGS construction costs while improving spatial utility. It can provide decision support for UGS planning and has broad application prospect.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is essential for improving urban resilience and the well-being of residents, and UGS supply is an important aspect of the construction of eco-cities in China. As a quasi-public goods, compared to UGS equity studies within a city, there has been little research on UGS equity among different cities. This paper first established a conceptual framework for UGS provisioning of local governments, and then, based on multi-source data, the UGS equity among 58 major cities in China and the related influencing factors were investigated; lastly, strategies for making improvements were put forward. The findings showed that the proposed integrated conceptual framework could reveal the formational processes of current UGS in China's cities, providing a coherent framework for UGS supply improvement. The average UGS of 58 cities was found to be in undersupply compared to current standards, and its spatial equity was not good; climate, urban topography, proportion of secondary industry, and title incentive factors exerted significant effects on UGS coverage, per capita UGS and accessible UGS; furthermore, the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and land availability were found to have a significant influence on UGS coverage and per capita UGS; while population density only impacted the per capita UGS. Comprehensive governance strategies including policy innovations for the central government, capacity enhancements of local governments, UGS planning refinements in terms of contents, procedures, and standards, and the engagement of non-profit organizations should be implemented to strengthen the supply of UGS and alleviate intercity inequity.

AB  - What differentiates communities that emphasise social equity in their sustainability policy? We use a 2015 survey of 1899 cities and counties across the United States and find only 26% of local governments report prioritising social equity. We use a distributional justice lens to create measures of social equity policy, and a procedural justice lens to assess processes for community engagement. We find that both distributive and procedural justice are important in local sustainable development. Our regression models find that plans and organisational capacity are important, but what differentiates municipalities that engage in more social equity policy is procedural justice - formal citizen engagement through a citizen task force and cross agency collaboration, as well as explicit links to economic development actors - notably, municipal ownership of utilities, and pressure from local businesses. A more engaged governance that incorporates the public, business, with cross-sectoral government agencies may mitigate the conflicts between three Es and help localities pursue a more balanced local sustainability agenda.

AB  - This paper draws on a participant-observation study of two grass-roots environmental movements to illuminate difficulties in multicultural alliance building between activists. It focuses on different, taken-for-granted cultural patterns in the ways grass-roots movements create group bonds, and it conceptualizes these patterns as different forms of ''movement community.'' A ''personalized'' form of movement community in local U.S. Green movement groups contributed to difficulties in multicultural alliance building. These difficulties arose despite the U.S. Greens' explicit multiculturalist ideology and their validation of the ''environmental justice'' ideology upheld by some activists of color. The paper suggests that U.S. Greens share with other contemporary activists a way of building movement community that places cultural barriers in the path of multicultural alliances. It also suggests that the personalized form of community may be a reasonable, if problematic, response by activists like Greens to difficult cultural predicaments in multicultural alliance building.

AB  - This study advanced a rigorous spatial analysis of surface water-related environmental health vulnerabilities in the California Bay-Delta region, USA, from 2000 to 2006. It constructed a novel hazard indicator-"impaired water hazard zones"-from regulatory estimates of extensive non-point-source (NPS) and point-source surface water pollution, per section 303(d) of the U.S. Clean Water Act. Bivariate and global logistic regression (GLR) analyses examined how established predictors of surface water health-hazard exposure vulnerability explain census block groups' proximity to impaired water hazard zones in the Bay-Delta. GLR results indicate the spatial concentration of Black disadvantage, isolated Latinx disadvantage, low median housing values, proximate industrial water pollution levels, and proximity to the Chevron oil refinery-a disproportionate, "super emitter", in the Bay-Delta-significantly predicted block group proximity to impaired water hazard zones. A geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) specification improved model fit and uncovered spatial heterogeneity in the predictors of block group proximity to impaired water hazard zones. The modal GWLR results in Oakland, California, show how major polluters beyond the Chevron refinery impair the local environment, and how isolated Latinx disadvantage was the lone positively significant population vulnerability factor. The article concludes with a discussion of its scholarly and practical implications.

AB  - With a fast rise in large-scale wind power development in Sweden and other countries in recent years, issues related to energy justice generally and distributional justice specifically have become concerns in windmill siting. Some research, for instance, has indicated that it is easier to build windmills in economically marginalized communities. The evidence for this, however, is still limited. Thus, this study aims to statistically evaluate the extent to which the decisions to approve or reject windmill proposals in Sweden can be explained by factors related to the socio-economic characteristics of people living in the areas surrounding windmill sites. The study is based on an odds ratio analysis of decisions on all windmill proposals in Sweden, in which geo-referenced socio-economic data on an individual level for all inhabitants within 3 and 10 km of the windmill sites are studied. The results show skewness in the distribution of windmills, with a higher likelihood of rejection in areas with more highly educated people and people working in the private sector, compared to a higher likelihood of approval in areas with more unemployed people. Thin skewness, while not necessarily unjust, warrants further policy and research attention to distributional justice issues when developing wind power.

AB  - This paper identifies, through a literature review, how 53 circular economy (CE) practices are related to the capability approach (CA) proposed by Sen. The main goal was to identify how a virtuous cycle between CE and CA can be developed. Five instrumental freedoms (IF) were analysed: economic facilities, social opportunities, protective security, political freedoms, and transparency guarantees. These relationships were analysed in three flows: CE practices positively impacting IF, CE practices negatively impacting IF, and the feedback influence of IF on CE practices. The results show that 32 of the 53 practices previously mentioned have not yet been studied from the CA context, which indicates that there are several research opportunities. From the practices considered, 72 articles were analysed in the final sample. The results suggest that several CE practices are aligned with the CA, considering that all five IF were identified as positive outcomes of CE practices. However, in some contexts, certain practices can have negative outcomes, which indicates that CE, at least in some cases, may not be considered as sustainable, as it decreases IF and, therefore, the social aspect of sustainability. The results also highlight that there is a feedback from IF to CE, in such a way that investing in the expansion of IF can facilitate the development of CE practices. Therefore, this study concludes that CE is indeed a way to fully operationalize sustainable development.

AB  - Urban population growth is leading to growing concerns about land use change, green infrastructure, and the loss of beneficial ecosystem services. Human and environmental health is supported by services such as climate regulation, air filtration, and flood mitigation. However, maintaining these services within cities requires the preservation and equitable distribution of green infrastructure near where people live. Sydney, Australia, where the population is expected to grow from 4.3 million to 5.6 million by 2031, is undergoing an urban transformation. This study investigates the spatial distribution of green infrastructure within Sydney to determine how patterns of green infrastructure vary according to land use, residential density, and socio-economic variation. More than half of urban Sydney is comprised of residential land use, representing the single largest contribution to Sydney's green infrastructure. Two types of green infrastructure are examined in this study, public green space represented by parkland area and tree canopy cover and private green space represented by residential area and tree canopy cover. Results show that with greater dwelling density, both types of green infrastructure decrease. Availability of private versus public green infrastructure, however, differs according to socio-economic advantage. Suburbs of higher socio-economic advantage have significantly more private green cover, but slightly less public green cover than suburbs of greater disadvantage. These findings highlight that urban densification can lead to a general loss of two important reservoirs of urban green infrastructure (public parkland and residential tree cover). Disadvantaged communities may have a greater reliance on public green infrastructure in the form of parkland due to a lack of private residential tree cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - This study analyzes how information about noise pollution affects neighborhood composition and households' choice of housing quality. I find that the announcement of a renewal of an airport operating contract induced high-income households to shift away from the zone exposed to airport noise. High-income households who still located in the airport noise zone after the announcement selected homes of better quality. These results help reconcile mixed findings on residential sorting in the literature. (JEL Q53, R21)

AB  - This paper is about what people conceive as just principles for the distribution of open space maintenance. Housing staff and residents' conceptions of just distribution of open space maintenance were studied in rental housing areas with large green open spaces in Sweden. Qualitative interviews with nine housing staff members and 27 tenants in three multi-family housing areas owned and managed by different municipal housing companies revealed widely varying conceptions. These could be partly classified into three basic principles: equal outcome, same inputs and less inputs (when decline is high). The conceptions varied among interviewees with different roles in providing upkeep, suggesting that they partly depended on the individual's insight into the services. These personal conceptions of justice influence how people experience service distribution in a neighbourhood and pose a challenge for actors dealing with strategic decisions on open space maintenance.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide cultural ecosystem services, and urban policies typically aim to enhance these services by targeting new investments in deprived areas. The implementation of urban greening policies is one way to reduce inequalities in well-being, for example by targeting areas where increased access to green spaces will benefit citizens of low socioeconomic status. Most research has addressed the targeting of green infra-structure development by considering income and access to green spaces, while few studies have considered a multidimensional definition of well-being. The aims of this paper are to i) integrate inputs from the economic and political philosophy literature to propose a broader definition of well-being, including health, education, insecurity, and social relations; ii) develop a criterion to prioritise areas where urban greening would have the greatest impact on well-being inequalities; and iii) apply this criterion to the Paris metropolitan area (Ile-de-France region), a spatially heterogeneous region where areas deprived of access to green spaces are not systematically deprived in other dimensions. Our analysis shows that the city of Paris and the inner suburbs would be targeted when considering inequality in access to green spaces only. The results differ when inequalities in income or multidimensional well-being are taken into account, in which case the northern inner suburbs and some outer suburbs become a higher priority.

AB  - We examine how absences respond to particle pollution in a multi-year individual panel comprising 6500 children enrolled at international schools situated in a major economic hub in north China. These schools (and their parents) have been willing and able to respond to the dire state of air quality, by implementing defensive procedures (thresholds for outdoor play) and capital (air-tight windows and central air-conditioned filtration systems). Even in this setting, we find substantial heterogeneity in the response to ambient PM2.5. Pollution sensitivity is stronger among US/Canadian/European than Chinese, children who miss school the most, and a minority of children who depart within one year of arrival, but overall is modest compared to estimates for the US. This suggests that to some extent the school response can substitute, through defensive behavior, for the absence response. We offer a benchmark for school administrators in polluted middle-income countries, yet caution that more research is needed on the long-term implications of PM2.5 exposure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Wildfires burn more than 7 million acres in the United States annually, according to the US Forest Service. Little is known about which subpopulations are more vulnerable to health risks from wildfire smoke, including those associated with fine particulate matter. We estimated exposure to fine particles specifically from wildfires, as well as the associations between the presence of wildfire-specific fine particles and the amount of hospital admissions for respiratory causes among subpopulations older than 65 years of age in the western United States (2004-2009). Compared with other populations, higher fractions of persons who were black, lived in urban counties, and lived in California were exposed to more than 1 smoke wave (high-pollution episodes from wildfire smoke). The risks of respiratory admissions on smoke-wave days compared with non-smoke-wave days increased 10.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.9, 19.6) for women and 21.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.4, 47.3) for blacks. Our findings suggest that increased risks of respiratory admissions from wildfire smoke was significantly higher for women than for men (10.4% vs. 3.7%), blacks than whites (21.7% vs. 6.9%), and, although associations were not statistically different, people in lower-education counties than higher-educated counties (12.7% vs. 6.1%). Our study raised important environmental justice issues that can inform public health programs and wildfire management. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, evidence on vulnerable subpopulations can inform disaster preparedness and the understanding of climate change consequences.

AB  - This paper applies a spatial perspective to environmental problems in search for the paths to sustainability, using polluting plant relocation in China as a case study. It examines how environmental improvement in one place may lead to environmental degradation in another place, how geographic concepts such as location, distance, spread and backwash effects, and land use models can help understand such phenomenon, and what the implications are for the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and development policies. Field research was conducted from 2006 to 2012 in Chinese cities of Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. It involved intensive site observations and in-depth interviews with government officials of environmental protection, economic development, and business recruitment, and grassroots environmentalists. The results indicate that environmental improvement in all these cities has led to environmental degradation in their suburbs and rural areas due to relocation of polluting plants. Environmental spread and backwash effects may help explain the severe intra-regional environmental and economic disparities and environmental injustice. The powerful and wealthy may achieve rapid economic growth and environmental recovery at the expenses of the powerless and poor, leading to environmental poverty and sustainability disparities.

AB  - This paper examines rural-urban inequities in dusty lung (pneumoconiosis) deaths in China from 2002 to 2016 and possible causes for such inequities in the framework of social and spatial justice. The research reveals alarming results that have not been reported before. Dusty lung death rates for rural men increased twice as fast as those among urban men. The rural rates were particularly higher among middle-aged men, but lower in older age groups, as compared to urban rates. There were dramatic increases in death rates from 2011 to 2016 particularly among rural men aged 40-49 years old, who were many times more likely to die from dusty lung than urban men of a similar age. Chinese rural male victims also die at a younger age, compared to men in any of the seven countries or regions included in the study. For example, rural Chinese men aged 35-59 years old were many times more likely to die from dusty lung than their American, German, Polish, and Spanish counterparts. A possible explanation for the high death rates among middle-aged rural Chinese men is the tendency for rural migrant workers to be employed in unhealthy and unsafe working conditions in decent decades. Other explanations for the severe spatial injustice include the Hukou (household registration) system and the development policies that prioritize economic growth and urban development over occupational health and safety. The paper demonstrates the usefulness and weakness of the social and spatial justice concepts in understanding health inequity. Therefore, it proposes new definitions and models of social justice and spatial justice that combine the competing distribution and capabilities approaches and highlight interactions among multiple attributes.

AB  - With the rapid urbanization and industrialization, the uneven distribution of polluting enterprises among different socioeconomic groups has become a prominent environmental social problem in transitional China but is rarely recognized. This paper introduces environmental justice theories in industrial location studies. A heu-ristic analytical framework is proposed to analyze the distribution and determinants of polluting enterprises in Guangdong, China, a highly developed region but with high social and economic inequality. Polluting enterprises are mostly agglomerated in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region with the rest in the mountainous and hilly non-PRD region. Bivariate local spatial autocorrelation analysis shows the colocation of polluting enterprises and migrants. Our regression results reveal that the county where many migrant residents are concentrated histor-ically appears to attract many polluting firms to enter. However, less firms are found in the county with many highly educated groups and ethnic minorities. Land space planning, environmental regulation, labor costs, and agglomeration economy have driven the distribution of new polluting enterprises, whereas the influences of traffic accessibility and border effect do not work actually. To some extent, the distribution of new polluting enterprises must be recognized as a predictable result of the characteristics of prior demographic distribution.

AB  - With the national push for an ecological civilization under way, Chinese environmental governance is becoming more authoritarian as the central government exerts a stronger control over the enforcement of environmental policies. In this paper, I examine how the ecological civilization project has become a key driver of change in extractive regions, constituting new eco-politics of extractive governance that can be characterized by heightened authoritarian environmentalism, with the Central Environmental Inspection Team as a particularly important mechanism through which the centralization of environmental governance is achieved. I argue that the ambitious environmental goals of an ecological civilization are achieved by sacrificing the interests of extractive communities. As these vulnerable communities are highly dependent on their extractive industries and often face significant diversification difficulties, the eco-civilization project has devastating local socioeconomic impacts and are likely to accelerate structural decline and population shrinkage if not promptly addressed through external support. I argue that this constitutes a form of environmental injustice, where environmental policies impose unfair burdens on disadvantaged individuals and communities. In particular, extractive communities bear the greatest burden of both environmental exploitation and environmental protection. Achieving socially just environmental sustainability should be an important aspect of ecological civilization.

AB  - We revisit the standard methodology for evaluating proximity to urban services and recommend enhancements to address existing limitations. Existing approaches often simplify their measure of proximity by using large areal units and by imposing arbitrary distance thresholds. By doing so, these approaches risk overlooking vulnerable, access-poor populations - the very populations that such studies are often trying to identify. These limitations are primarily motivated by computational constraints. However, recent advances in computational power, open data, and open-source analytics permit high-resolution proximity analyses on large scales. Given the impetus for equitable accessibility in our communities, this is of fundamental importance for researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages these open source advances to (a) measure proximity using network distance at the building level, (b) estimate population at that level, and (c) present the resulting distributions so vulnerable populations can be identified. Using three cities and modes of transport, we demonstrate how the approach enhances existing measures and identifies service-poor populations where the previous methods fall short. The proximity results could be used alone, or as inputs to access metrics. Our collating of these components into an open source code provides opportunities for researchers and practitioners to explore fine-resolution, city-wide accessibility across multiple cities and the host of questions that follow.

AB  - To remain relevant in a rapidly changing society, social work must ensure that policies respond timeously and justly to mitigate the impact of continuous change on individuals, families, communities and the wider society. This requires rethinking social work's role in shaping policy in a broader context to address a new order, going beyond social welfare and social policy. In this conceptual article, the authors argue that to be relevant in the twenty-first century, social work has to adopt a transformative social policy approach, including policy advocacy. Furthermore, social work should contribute to policy transformation at the micro-macro nexus, where social justice can be promoted at the local and global, the personal and political levels. Policy transformation for just societies promotes economic prosperity and environmental sustainability; hence, social work must embrace a developmental approach embedded in a human rights-based framework that contributes to sustainable development. Social work education plays a critical role in preparing graduates to transform policy through advocacy practice and critical pedagogy. The article concludes that social work needs to expand its role from predominantly focusing on social policy to a wider policy scope that embraces social, economic and environmental justice which contributes to sustainable development.

AB  - This paper argues that the definition of food justice must be defined in more participatory terms. Current accounts of food justice tend to emphasize distributional inequalities. However, there is broad recognition that these distributional inequalities are the result of participative inequalities and that the participation of marginalized groups in advocacy plays an important role in creating just food systems. In addition, thinking of food justice in more participative terms also suggests a more well-rounded and comprehensive approach to dealing with inequalities within the food system. One manner in which the concept of food justice can be redefined to better capture the importance of participative justice is by considering what is required for informed consent.

AB  - This paper analyses the socio-territorial conflict prompted by Los Merinos: a residential-tourism project constructed in an ecological reserve that is vital to Andalusian livelihoods. It examines disputes concerning discourses, authorities and rules in order to understand the struggle over land and water. Using the echelons of rights analysis (ERA) framework, the paper scrutinizes the multiscale forces and strategies adopted by business and opposing movement networks in order to shape territory, thereby engaging local and supra-local governments. The authors' political-ecology lens on environmental justice and territorialization enhances the understanding of the relevance of social movements in contesting the misappropriation of socio-natural environments.

AB  - Urban sociology and urban studies increasingly employ the idea of sustainability to explain, analyze, and critique city redevelopment. While the ambiguous and oxymoronic nature of sustainability goals has been extensively covered in the past, the current resurgence and popularity of the term "sustainability," especially under the aegis of "urban sustainability" or "green" cities, requires us to rethink the usefulness of sustainability as a concept for understanding and evaluating urban redevelopment. Confronting this challenge, this article reviews three of the most common theoretical approaches to sustainability, problematizes those approaches in the context of North American cities, and then provides a working definition of urban sustainability. Finally, the article recommends four plausible research hypotheses to guide future research on urban sustainability.

AB  - Underprivileged urban communities often have less parks than wealthier communities. Even when new parks are built and are physically accessible to such communities, park design and programming is often undertaken without community input and may result in psychologically inaccessible parks. To address this problem, the California Department of Parks and Recreation piloted a community outreach intervention in a newly created Los Angeles park. It employed the promotores model, which uses community members as outreach ambassadors. Using participant observations, interviews, and a survey, we evaluated the intervention's success in recruiting and training promotores, organizing community outreach, and making the park more accessible to underprivileged communities. We found that the promotores helped increase community involvement in park programming, thus enhancing procedural justice, and also helped enhance park use by previously underrepresented groups. We conclude with recommendations about how the promotores model can be improved and used more effectively in park planning.

AB  - This study utilizes explores the challenges that hard-to-reach populations face in completing household activity surveys. We draw on qualitative data from hard-to-reach populations regarding the limits of the Oregon Household Activity Survey and find evidence that the survey methods lack social, cultural, and linguistic applicability for Black, Indigenous and other people of color, as well as low-income populations. We argue that Oregon's household travel survey prioritizes certain ways of understanding and experiencing mobility that are, by default, exclusionary. We conclude in sharing insights regarding how we might enhance data collection efforts. Broader efforts for transportation equity (and ultimately towards transportation justice) cannot be achieved when the data used to inform transportation planning fails to accurately reflect all populations.

AB  - This paper examines emerging trends in transport policy in the UK, as identified by the 2004 Transport White Paper and the supporting policy guidance to local transport authorities for addressing social exclusion through local transport provision; accessibility planning. It moves on to identify potential barriers to delivery at the local level and more fundamental challenges, risks and policy tensions. In this context, it critiques UK policies to deliver social equity through transport programmes in light of its Climate Change Agenda and the identified need to significantly reduce traffic levels on UK roads. It identifies the potential synergy between these two policy ambitions, but argues that currently there is a serious policy conflict between these agendas within the UK policy framework. In the light of this conclusion, it offers some key recommendations on the best way forward, which it recommends must be based on the synergistic and integrated delivery of policies for social and environmental equity within the transport sector. It concludes by identifying the key challenges this implies for applied research in this area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter provides details of the Social Justice Framework, which I have been developing for several years as an aid to environmental management, especially decision- making processes about natural resources. I discuss the Framework's origins, components, audience and intended usage. Although the Framework has already been described in several publications, this chapter is the most complete guide, detailing all the Framework components and using multiple case studies to explain and illustrate them. The three justice dimensions of distribution, process and interaction are dealt with in turn and individual justice principles within these dimensions are explained and illustrated with examples. The chapter ends with a discussion of some important caveats about what the Framework can and cannot achieve in decision making and points out the aspects that still require further development.

Buckminster Fuller by revisiting two of his major theoretical works, Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth and Utopia or Oblivion. It highlights Fuller's fascination with economic efficiency and environmental justice in his own pursuit of the practices of industrial design, urban planning, and vernacular engineering. In addition, the analysis stresses how the optimism and energy that Fuller gave to rethinking environmentalism so radically during the 1960s are vital qualities that contemporary green thinkers need to rekindle in their works today.

AB  - This study reevaluates the origins and operations of corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs since the 1980s and 1990s in the USA. Such enterprises mobilize sustainable development rhetoric as part of stylized political agendas for community outreach, social impact, cultural sensitivity and environmental justice campaigns endorsed by big business. These campaigns react to political pressures exerted by local, national or global anti-corporate movements, and sustainable development has become one moderately successful negotiated settlement in this battle between the private sector and civil society. Nonetheless, a brittle quality in weak interpretations of sustainable development remains engrained in many CSR programs as standard operating procedures. These profit-driven agendas push for development' over sustainability', lowering the bar for what sustainability should, or does, mean for businesses as they struggle to be more responsible ethical actors in society.

AB  - While interest in green criminology has rapidly expanded over the past twenty-five years, much of this growth has occurred on the periphery of orthodox criminology. This article suggests that green criminology's marginalization is partially a result of its non-quantitative methodology. We hypothesize that non-quantitative tendencies within green criminology distance it from orthodox criminology because orthodox criminology values quantitative methods (Tewksbury et al. in J Crim Justice Educ 16(2):265-279, 2005). Here, we examine how neglecting quantitative research methods may contribute to inattention to green criminology within orthodox criminology, and we consider what can be done to change that situation. We suggest that employing quantitative approaches within green criminology is one way to increase its appeal to mainstream criminology, and that quantitative studies, in conjunction with other research methodologies, can also enhance generalizability of findings, influence policy, and advance theory construction and hypothesis testing.

AB  - This study examines whether petroleum refineries that violate environmental laws in Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities tend to receive smaller fines than those refineries in White and affluent communities. The sample consists of all petroleum refinery facilities fined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 1998 and 1999 for violating the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and/or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (N = 60). The mean penalty for noncompliance is much lower in Black than in White census tracts ($108,563 vs. $341,590) and in low-income than in high-income census tracts ($259,784 vs. $334,267). Multivariate analysis suggests that these disparities are not due to factors such as the seriousness of violation, the number of past violations, the facility inspection history, the facility production, or the EPA region in which the violating refinery is situated. It is concluded that the government does a poor job of providing equal protection to racially and economically diverse communities.

AB  - Whilst air pollution is a major problem in China, little is known about how it is distributed socially and how such distributions are changing over time. We use a fine-grained population census and air quality data for 2000 and 2010 to explore socio-spatial and temporal inequalities in air pollution for Beijing, using distributional analyses and spatial regression models. We find that environmental inequalities exist with respect to measures of social disadvantage, such as hukou migrant status, very young children (0?4?years), and the elderly (?65?years). Our temporal analysis reveals that environmental inequality increases for migrants and the elderly, who bear a disproportionate and increasing share of declining air quality from 2000 to 2010. Regression results emphasise the spatial and temporal variations in environmental inequality, as the associations between air pollution and social demographics differ between different urban zones of Beijing; and their geographic patterns change significantly over time.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the importance of disaggregating population data aggregated by census tracts or other units, for more realistic population distribution/location. A newly developed mapping method, the Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System (CEDS), calculates population in hyper-heterogeneous urban areas better than traditional mapping techniques. A case study estimating population potentially impacted by flood hazard in New York City compares the impacted population determined by CEDS with that derived by centroid-containment method and filtered areal-weighting interpolation. Compared to CEDS, 37% and 72% fewer people are estimated to be at risk from floods city-wide, using conventional areal weighting of census data, and centroid-containment selection, respectively. Undercounting of impacted population could have serious implications for emergency management and disaster planning. Ethnic/racial populations are also spatially disaggregated to determine any environmental justice impacts with flood risk. Minorities are disproportionately undercounted using traditional methods. Underestimating more Vulnerable sub-populations impairs preparedness and relief efforts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using geospatial analytical methods, this study examines the association between one aspect of the built environment, namely, the concentration of vacant and derelict land (VDL), and the prevalence of mental health disorders (using the proxy variable of mental health medication prescription rates) in Glasgow, Scotland. This study builds on our previous research, which demonstrated the spatial correspondence between the locations of VDL in Glasgow and several physical health outcomes. Numerous studies of other locales have found similar correspondence between different elements of the built environment and various health outcomes. This is the first study of its kind to look at the spatial concentration of vacant and derelict land in relation to mental health, socio-economic indicators, environmental justice, and health inequities. The findings of this study demonstrate an inequity with respect to the distribution of vacant and derelict land, as confirmed by Pearson correlations between VDL density and deprivation (r = .521, p < .001). This suggests that many deprived communities are disproportionately burdened with environmental impacts and psychosocial stressors associated with this land use. Regression analyses show a significant positive association between the proportion of the population who were prescribed medication for anxiety, depression, or psychosis and the density of vacant and derelict land while adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics. This indicates that areas with higher VDL densities tend to exhibit higher rates of mental health issues. Based on these findings, strategies for constructive re-use of VDL are proposed.

AB  - Whilst an extensive body of literature exists on the environmental justice implications of urban greening in North America, Europe and to an extent Australasia, there are fewer analogous studies for tropical zone Asian city contexts. Given increasing global interest in the potential for urban greenspace to contribute to resilience in the face of environmental change and the higher vulnerability of Asian cities to environmental shocks, this is a notable gap. In response, this paper evaluates the contours of environmental justice debates within urban greenspace planning for one subtropical Asian city-Taipei. Through analysis of newspaper reporting on urban greenspace planning within Taipei, the potential and limitations of greenspace planning in contributing to equitably delivering benefits from urban greenspace towards resilience are assessed. Findings suggest that claims to environmental injustice in greenspace debates within Taipei follow broadly similar lines to controversies in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, the need for specific knowledge to understand the different ecosystem services provided by tropical zone ecosystems, and the potential for conflicts over greenspace versus development to be heightened in dense Asian city settings, are highlighted as potential areas where environmental justice debates in an Asian urban greening context may differ from Western cities.

AB  - Through an examination of a conflict over the management of forest resources in northern New Mexico between rural Hispanics and white environmentalists, this paper sketches a critique of the use of cultural activism on the part of environmental justice activists as they seek to maintain and diversify their political support base. Using resource mobilization and frame alignment perspectives as a lens on collective action, the central point derived from this analysis is that environmental activism which presumes shared interests on the basis of cultural values runs the considerable risk of losing sight of the structural factors that strongly influence the way ethnic and racial minorities will view environmental issues.

AB  - Utilizing data from the 2010 General Social Survey, three theoretical perspectives are used to explain differing levels of environmental concern and sustainable practices among native- and foreign-born race and ethnic groups in the United States. The most prominent pattern resulting from the analysis is that of ecological assimilation among the Mexican-origin population, with the foreign-born portion of this group being much more likely than their native-born counterparts or whites to both engage in sustainable practices and express a willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of the environment. There is evidence for a concern gap between African Americans and whites in the responses to questions tied to economic progress and standard of living reductions, though the inverted concern gap implied by the environmental justice literature is also apparent in responses to questions about perceived environmental risks where the majority of non-whites in the survey showed higher levels of concern than whites.

AB  - We examine varying levels of perceived environmental risks among nine U.S. race and ethnic group categories using the 2010 General Social Survey. Three interrelated questions motivate our analysis. First, how does the environmental risk perception of air pollution, water pollution, agricultural chemicals, climate change and nuclear power generation vary among specific categories of race and ethnicity? Second, to what degree are higher levels of perceived risk among immigrant-origin groups subject to change as a result of cultural assimilation over generations? And third, to what degree are race and ethnic differences in environmental risk perception a reflection of other possibly more significant factors such as education, income, gender and conservative political views? Though we find some evidence for attitude assimilation among generations of Mexican-origin people, the dominant pattern is greater perceived risks among non-whites than whites across generations in the U.S. Additionally, not only did race and ethnic groups show greater concern for the threats posed by climate change and nuclear power generation than whites, they also expressed more concern about these two topics than they did for more localized issues such as air pollution emanating from industry and transportation. Despite our statistical controls for socioeconomic status, race and ethnic categories remained strong independent predictors of perceived environmental threats.

AB  - We explored how air quality management processes associated with Assembly Bill 617 (AB 617) in West Oakland, California, represent a shift in power relationships between government agencies and communities toward the goal of addressing legacies of environmental injustice. We drew from a statewide assessment of community engagement in AB 617's first year, and an analysis of the West Oakland AB 617 process. The first comprised 2 statewide surveys (n = 102 and n = 106), 70 key informant interviews, observation of all AB 617 first-year sites, and analysis of related planning documents. The second comprised 2 rounds of interviews (n = 22 and n = 23, with a total of 19 individuals) and extensive participant observation. Several factors are necessary for pursuing environmental justice: (1) invest in community partnerships 0 and collaborations, (2) honor community knowledge and data, (3) ensure that community constituents share power in environmental governance, and (4) adopt explicit racial justice frameworks. Although still a work in progress, AB 617 offers important lessons for community and policy organizations nationwide engaged in environmental justice.

AB  - This paper examines the prospects for integrating Internet platform GIS or 'web-GIS' into environmental justice and related public health research. Specifically, we document the development of a web-GIS created for investigating relationships between health, air quality and socioeconomic factors in Hamilton, Canada. After development of the web-GIS site, we assembled a focus group of public health professionals to test functionality and render opinions about the potential of the site and geographic information in their program implementation. Results show overwhelming support for the further integration of GIS into public health practice. The results also underscore the potential of web-GIS to alleviate concerns of cost and data availability that often limit the use of GIS in community debates centred on environmental justice issues.

AB  - Urban biodiversity provides critical ecosystem services and is a key component to environmentally and socially sustainable cities. However, biodiversity varies greatly within and among cities, leading to human communities with changing and unequal experiences with nature. The "luxury effect," a hypothesis that predicts a positive correlation between wealth, typically measured by per capita income, and species richness may be one indication of these inequities. While the luxury effect is well studied for some taxa, it has rarely been investigated for mammals, which provide unique ecosystem services (e.g., biological pest control) and exhibit significant potential for negative human-wildlife interactions (e.g., nuisances or conflicts). We analyzed a large dataset of mammal detections across 20 North American cities to test whether the luxury effect is consistent for medium- to large-sized terrestrial mammals across diverse urban contexts. Overall, support for the luxury effect, as indicated by per capita income, was inconsistent; we found evidence of a luxury effect in approximately half of our study cities. Species richness was, however, highly and negatively correlated with urban intensity in most cities. We thus suggest that economic factors play an important role in shaping urban mammal communities for some cities and species, but that the strongest driver of urban mammal diversity is urban intensity. To better understand the complexity of urban ecosystems, ecologists and social scientists must consider the social and political factors that drive inequitable human experiences with nature in cities.

AB  - We explore how the language of "just sustainability" may become subsumed into a sustainability fix strategy, depoliticizing the utility of concepts such as justice and/or equity. Building from critical GIS insights, we combine digitized spatial data from participatory mapping exercises and community-organization-based focus group in Portland, Oregon, regarding a proposed six-mile biking and walking path around downtown. We find that 80 percent of participants' typical travel destinations are outside of downtown Porltand and that participants experience planning and sustainability in a highly localized manner, challenging the equity rationale of downtown investment. We argue the top-down planning model, which presumes that the spatial diffusion of benefits is equitable, is inherently ahistorical and fails to benefit those in historically marginalized neighborhoods. Finally, we argue for the value of community-oriented research, which, in this case, inspired a coalition of community organizations to formally oppose a city-led project based on the inequitable distribution of infrastructure benefits.

AB  - To tackle the crisis associated with the rising commercial food waste generation, it is imperative to comprehend how corporates' recycling behaviour is influenced by different industry structures and economies. This study aims to fill in the information gap that various factors might be affecting corporates' recycling behaviour in two different economies due to environmental inequality by comparing upper-middle-income region (Malaysia) and high-income region (Hong Kong), respectively. A questionnaire survey regarding food waste management according to the Theory of Planned Behaviour was conducted with representatives coming from diverse industries of the hotel, food and beverage, and property management. The questionnaire responses were evaluated based on quantitative structural equation modelling and correlation analysis. The analysis results showed that the model fit the data well, explaining 78% of the variance in recycling behaviour. The findings demonstrated that the most substantial factor on individual's recycling intention by Malaysian commercial food waste generators was perceived behavioural control, and logistics and management incentives. Subjective norms demonstrated significant and adverse effects on the behaviour of food waste recycling. The variable of administrative incentives and corporate support presented strong positive correlations with moral attitudes as well as logistics and management incentives. Hotel industries from both Hong Kong and Malaysia have a higher acceptance level on human resources regarding food waste recycling. In comparison, food and beverage industries from both regions have a lower acceptance level. These findings could enrich our knowledge of the concerns in establishing regional policy strategies to encourage economic behavioural changes for sustainable development. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report five studies that examine preferences for the allocation of environmental harms and benefits. In all studies, participants were presented with scenarios in which an existing environmental inequality between two otherwise similar communities could either be decreased or increased through various allocation decisions. Our results demonstrate that despite well-established preferences toward equal outcomes, people express weaker preferences for options that increase equality when considering the allocation of environmental harms (e.g., building new polluting facilities) than when considering the allocation of environmental benefits (e.g., applying pollution-reducing technologies). We argue that this effect emerges from fairness considerations rooted in a psychological incompatibility between the allocation of harms, which is seen as an inherently unfair action, and equality, which is a basic fairness principle. Since the allocation of harms is an inevitable part of operations of both governments and businesses, our results suggest that where possible, parties interested in increasing environmental equality may benefit from framing such proposals as bestowing relative benefits instead of imposing relative harms.

AB  - Unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production has rapidly expanded, making the U.S. the top producer of hydrocarbons. The industrial process now pushes against neighborhoods, schools, and people's daily lives. I analyze extensive mixed methods data collected over three years in Colorado - including 75 in-depth interviews and additional participant observation - to show how living amid industrial UOG production generates chronic stress and negative mental health outcomes, such as self-reported depression. I show how UOG production has become a neighborhood industrial activity that, in turn, acts as a chronic environmental stressor. I examine two key drivers of chronic stress - uncertainty and powerlessness - and show how these mechanisms relate to state-level institutional processes that generate patterned procedural inequities. This includes inadequate access to transparent environmental and public health information about UOG production's potential risks and limited public participation in decisions about production, with negative implications for mental health.

AB  - With increased discussions of nuclear energy as a solution to both energy and climate change issues, addressing nuclear policy deserves urgent attention. Though waste storage dominates public attention, uranium mining and milling present their own complexities for individual and community well-being. This case study of Monticello, Utah, a rural community in southeastern Utah that hosted a uranium mill, illustrates uranium's problematic legacy on the Colorado Plateau. Monticello's storyrelated through interview excerpts, analyses of government documents, and local newspaper articlestells of individuals still coping with health impacts from America's last foray into nuclear technology. Framed within the literatures of risk society and environmental health movements, this study examines community health issues, the federal government's response to these issues, and residents' reactions to government. Through this study, we better understand people's daily struggles in the rural, isolated communities likely to be affected by renewed interest in uranium.

AB  - This paper explores the multi-purpose nature of Waste-to-Energy (WtE), which adheres to three different policies in the EU: 1) waste management; 2) energy union; 3) air quality/climate change. While WtE is subject to different EU policies and must comply with different sets of EU regulatory frameworks, the policies are largely intertwined and share common objectives enabling the achievement of a sustainable European future via the circular economy. With support from the theoretical foundation for the potential to unite climate, energy, and environmental justice, the paper calls for a streamlined policy in the context of WtE. The paper also highlights the value of this linkage from a practical perspective illustrating how these different policies could be bridged through the new technology - the patented micro-scale Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU), which has been invented to process all unwanted domestic materials and generate energy for the household.

AB  - This chapter explores the intersection between two major strains of environmental thought and praxis, environmental justice and ecofeminism, two fields of inquiry which each examine the conceptual and material linkages between the degradation of natural places and the marginalization and oppression of human communities. It shows how the critique of unequal power relations-both intra-and trans-human-central to each can help scientists and policy makers to comprehensively address current environmental issues. The current state of environmental discourse tends to view environmental issues as problems for science, and not as issues of social justice. Such an approach ignores the fact that not all groups of humans are situated equally in regard to ecological degradation and exposure to environmental toxins, as a direct result of histories of inequality and oppression. These histories are linked through processes of dualism, in which nature/humans, Anglo-European "whites"/people of color, and masculinity/femininity are placed into opposition. Such conceptual pairings are gendered, as well as raced, classed, and specied. Ecofeminism directly interrogates the sources and effects of these pairings, exposing the ways in which sexist ideologies are connected to "naturism." Therefore, this chapter argues, struggles for environmental justice that do not incorporate an explicitly gendered and ecofeminist analysis of ecological problems will not adequately understand the ways in which systems of oppression (such as racism, colonialism, gender discrimination, and environmental degradation) are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. For this reason, ecofeminism, a political movement and theoretical stance which identifies and articulates these interconnections, is a necessary intervention into discussions and debates about how to alter the fact of environmental injustice.

AB  - This paper aims to deepen current understandings of the ways in which historical power differentials and stigmatization shape the injustices faced by urban Roma populations. It argues, firstly that spatial segregation cannot be analytically separated from social and environmental factors that marginalize and disempower this vulnerable community; and secondly, that a multi-scalar approach is necessary to capture the ways in which stigmatization acts both within the affected community, and at the levels of local policy, national policy, and wider culture. The authors then consider the advantages and the pitfalls of using participatory processes to empower Roma segregated communities, drawing on the experience of a participatory action research process carried out over an eight-year period in the city of Szeged, Hungary. The findings suggest that it is necessary to be attentive to the paradoxes, dilemmas, and conflicts that surround the attempt to empower a highly stigmatized group as citizens, in a culture where exclusion and racism still dominate. The conclusions call for a comprehensive raft of policy measures to tackle Roma stigmatization, and for a continuous process of reflection on the moral and practical problems associated with participation in a context where power differentials still dominate.

AB  - This study seeks to understand the factors that influence the variability in distribution of public and private sector investments in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) projects across the diversity of neighbourhoods in the City of Philadelphia, PA, U. S. A. using indicators of community context and capacity. For this study, context is defined as characteristics of disadvantaged communities and capacity as factors that facilitate individual and collective action. Community context and capacity are deemed integral to the success of the Philadelphia GSI programme as the Philadelphia Water Department is relying upon collaborative approaches to facilitate public investments in neighbourhoods and voluntary implementation of GSI practices on publically and privately owned lands. Private sector investments in GSI mandated by stormwater regulations for new construction and major rehabilitation also are assessed in relation to these two sets of indicators. The geographic information systems and statistical analyses reveal an inequitable distribution of GSI projects, which largely is driven by market forces. The paper concludes with a community capacity-based framework to prioritise public sector investment in disadvantaged communities to achieve more equitable distribution of GSI projects and associated benefits.

AB  - This paper quantifies the health impacts of petroleum leaks from underground storage tanks, the effectiveness of tank regulation, and the role of information as a policy tool in the same setting. Exposure to a leaking underground storage tank during gestation increases both the probability of low birthweight and preterm birth by 7-8 percent. Compliance with regulations requiring the adoption of preventative technologies mitigated the entire effect of leak exposure on low birthweight, and information increased avoidance and moving among highly educated mothers. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the health benefits of preventative regulations exceed the upgrade cost to facilities.

AB  - Traditional infrastructure adaptation to extreme weather events (and now climate change) has typically been techno-centric and heavily grounded in robustness-the capacity to prevent or minimize disruptions via a risk-based approach that emphasizes control, armoring, and strengthening (e.g., raising the height of levees). However, climate and nonclimate challenges facing infrastructure are not purely technological. Ecological and social systems also warrant consideration to manage issues of overconfidence, inflexibility, interdependence, and resource utilization-among others. As a result, techno-centric adaptation strategies can result in unwanted tradeoffs, unintended consequences, and underaddressed vulnerabilities. Techno-centric strategies that lock-in today's infrastructure systems to vulnerable future design, management, and regulatory practices may be particularly problematic by exacerbating these ecological and social issues rather than ameliorating them. Given these challenges, we develop a conceptual model and infrastructure adaptation case studies to argue the following: (1) infrastructure systems are not simply technological and should be understood as complex and interconnected social, ecological, and technological systems (SETSs); (2) infrastructure challenges, like lock-in, stem from SETS interactions that are often overlooked and underappreciated; (3) framing infrastructure with a SETS lens can help identify and prevent maladaptive issues like lock-in; and (4) a SETS lens can also highlight effective infrastructure adaptation strategies that may not traditionally be considered. Ultimately, we find that treating infrastructure as SETS shows promise for increasing the adaptive capacity of infrastructure systems by highlighting how lock-in and vulnerabilities evolve and how multidisciplinary strategies can be deployed to address these challenges by broadening the options for adaptation.

AB  - This chapter addresses a gap in the literature on climate justice by examining inequity at the urban scale. Such a perspective builds on the concept of a climate-just city, which prioritizes the needs of those most vulnerable to climate change. This study focuses on Bangkok, a city not only highly vulnerable to climate change, but a city with one of the highest carbon emissions per capita. The chapter highlights instances of urban climate injustice by presenting three case studies: Bangkok's public transportation sector, the state's response to the 2011 floods, and coastal erosion in southern Bangkok. The cases show that the city's governance of climate change has unjustly benefited the upper echelon of society, while low-income communities have been adversely affected.

AB  - This study advances understanding of environmental inequality by examining its production through the interaction of two ubiquitous and ongoing urban-ecological processes: industrial land-use changes and changing patterns of residential segregation. We employ longitudinal data from the Rhode Island Directory of Manufacturers (1953-2012) and tract-level US Census data measured at four panel-years (1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010) to study the effects of these interactions in Rhode Island's historical industrial cities of Providence, Pawtucket, and Central Falls. Spatial patterning analysis and hybrid spatial panel modeling of residential exposure to active and legacy industrial sites in relation to ongoing racial and industrial change reveal two novel findings. First, we find a "legacy effect," suggesting that the spatial organization of industrial activities prior to the study period has measurable impacts on patterns of residential segregation in later decades. Our results also indicate that over the study period Latinx and African-American residents have become increasingly less likely to bear disproportionate impacts of active manufacturing sites, despite very different spatial patterns of population growth. This is strong evidence that environmental inequality formation is a variable process in which historically distinct pathways can lead to similarly disproportionate exposure to environmental risk.

AB  - We used spatial analyses to examine exposure of people in vulnerable occupational groups to neighborhood-level environmental pollutants in the Bronx borough of New York City. Five-year estimates of environmental ambient exposures (derived from land use regression models for PM2.5 [particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m] and black carbon) and demographic and occupational variables were harmonized at the census tract level. Correlations revealed that areas with high environmental exposures also had high proportions of people in service industries and manufacturing and high proportions of socioeconomically vulnerable populations. This combination of vulnerabilities may be cumulative, suggesting residents could have high occupational and residential exposures in addition to sociodemographic-related inequity.

AB  - This paper highlights current events and original research to explore the tensions between First Nations, industry and government in the context of uranium mining and nuclear waste management in Australia. We outline challenges faced by Aboriginal Australians in their role as custodians of the land, and as community leaders. A critical examination of some of the barriers to First Nations empowerment includes government engagement through legislation and practices that have repeatedly resulted in dispossession and disempowerment of Australian Aboriginal Traditional Owners. Laws ostensibly designed to provide rights and protections to Aboriginal people are repeatedly curtailed or overridden to facilitate nuclear projects-in particular radioactive waste repositories and uranium mines. We argue that existing measures provide feeble rights and protections for Aboriginal people as laws have repeatedly produced outcomes that favour government and industry and deny Aboriginal rights to sovereignty. Our research highlights patterns of colonial oppression that transgress human rights, and frames mining and nuclear waste in a way that lacks a decolonisation strategy and are based on industrial violence. Theoretical understandings of Indigenous sovereignty through a decolonising lens will highlight Indigenous standpoints, the continued contestation of Indigenous peoples' customary land rights, and the limitations of post-colonial environmental justice.

AB  - U.S. political polarization is at a high point since the Civil War, and is a significant barrier to coordinated national action addressing climate change. To examine where common ground may exist, here we comprehensively review and characterize successes and failures of recent state-level decarbonization legislation, focusing especially on bipartisanship. We analyze 418 major state-government-enacted bills and 450 failed bills from 2015 to 2020, as well as the political contexts in which they were passed or defeated. We use bivariate analyses and regressions to explore correlations and partial correlations between the policy characteristics and political contexts of bills, and their passage or failure, their bipartisanship, and vote shares they received. Key results include (i) nearly one-third of these state-level decarbonization bills were passed by Republican-controlled governments. (ii) Bipartisan or Republican co-sponsors disproportionately passed financial incentives for renewable energy, and legislation that expands consumer or business choices in context of decarbonization goals; Democrat-only co-sponsors disproportionately passed bills that restricted consumer and business choice, such as mandatory Renewable Energy and Efficiency Portfolio Standards (REEPS) and emissions standards. (iii) Bipartisan bills were disproportionately proposed in "divided" states, did not restrict consumer and business choice, had environmental justice components framed economically, and lacked environmental justice components framed either using academic social-justice jargon or non-neutrally with respect to immutable characteristics such as race. (iv) Bills that expand consumer or business choice were disproportionately enacted. Though climate change is a polarized issue, our results provide tangible insights for future bipartisan successes.

AB  - While distributive aspects have been a topic of discussion in relation to cost-benefit analysis (CBA), little systematic thought has been given in the CBA literature to the focus of such an equity analysis in evaluating transport projects. The goal of the paper is to provide an overview of the various directions an equity analysis, carried out within the context of a social cost-benefit analysis, could take. The paper starts from the widely-shared definition of distributive justice: the morally proper distribution of goods and bads over members of society. Following this definition, carrying out an equity analysis requires that decisions are made about: (1) the benefits and costs that are distributed through a transport project; (2) the members of society between whom benefits and costs are distributed; and (3) the distributive principle that determines whether a particular distribution is fair. Much of the discussions about cost-benefit analysis and equity do not address these questions in any systematic way. The paper aims to provide a framework. Three sets of benefits and costs are identified as a possible focus of an equity analysis: (1) net benefits; (2) mobility-enhancing benefits; and (3) individual benefits and costs. For each set, a discussion follows regarding the way in which members of societies could be divided into meaningful groups, as well as the possible yardstick for judging whether a certain distribution is fair. While the paper acknowledges that the choice between the three sets is ultimately a political decision, it ends with a set of arguments that suggest that the equity analysis of transport projects should focus first and foremost on the mobility-enhancing benefits generated by such projects.

AB  - This paper seeks to provide a theoretical basis for a distributive approach to transport. Using the theory developed by Michael Walzer in his 'Spheres of Justice' (1983), I argue that the transport good, defined as accessibility, should be distributed in a so-called separate sphere, i.e. independent from the way in which other key goods, like money or power, are allocated. I subsequently explore what kind of justice principle could guide the distribution of the transport good, once a separate sphere would be established. This preliminary exploration results in the elimination of a number of widely supported distributive principles, and in the tentative identification of a criterion matching the particularities of the transport good. The explorations in the paper are not intended as final answers, but rather seek to open the debate about the need for an explicit distributive transport policy and the distributive principle that should guide such a policy.

AB  - Transportation improvements inevitably lead to an uneven distribution of user benefits, in space and by network type (private and public transport). This paper makes a moral argument for what would be a fair distribution of these benefits. The argument follows Walzer's "Spheres of Justice" approach to define the benefits of transportation, access, as a sphere deserving a separate, non-market driven, distribution. That distribution, we propose, is one where the maximum gap between the lowest and highest accessibility, both by mode and in space, should be limited, while attempting to maximize average access. We then review transportation planning practice for a priori distributional goals and find little explicit guidance in conventional and even justice-oriented transportation planning and analyses. We end with a discussion of the implications for practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper introduces a themed section on global environmental in/justice. In doing so it pays particular attention to two matters. First, it explores the value of a global' perspective on justice, highlighting how this framing reflects the nature and scales of contemporary environmental problems, the political-economic forces that pattern the uneven access to resources, and the vocabularies and narratives that are used to make claims about these inequities. Perhaps more significantly, the paper argues that a global framing appears to foreground particular aspects of environmental justice analysis, especially political and economic forces that produce injustices. Second, the introduction looks across the five papers in the section, each of which looks at a different environmental sector/issue: forests, transboundary waters, biodiversity conservation, energy and climate change, and disasters. It draws out the emergent themes across the papers, which involves discussions of the location of environmental struggles at new commodity frontiers, the limitations of distributive approaches to justice, and the relationship between social and environmental justice.

AB  - This paper proposes that biodiversity conservation practice will benefit from assessment of environmental justice outcomes, especially in contexts of poverty and social marginalisation. Whilst there is an existing body of work that implicitly considers the justices and injustices arising from biodiversity conservation interventions, we suggest that a more explicit justice assessment might complement this work. We develop some general guidelines for such assessment, drawing on traditions of social and environmental justice, highlighting the importance of considering two types of justice outcome: distribution and recognition. We note the non-equivalence of these different justice values, implying that they cannot be traded-off against each other. We try out these guidelines through a case study of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. We find that the assessment helps us to identify intolerable social impacts of conservation, notably failures to adequately address the long-term impoverishment and domination of the indigenous Batwa people, and offers constructive insight for how conservation can better align with the need for environmental justice.

AB  - This research is concerned with the trend towards commodification of forestry, in the context of community forest governance for sustainable development in the tropics. In these contexts, commodification takes different forms, including sales of certified timbers and sales of carbon credits. In addition to the general aim to enhance income, these market-based forestry interventions typically aim to align with sustainable development agendas, including (a) safeguarding ecological integrity and (b) promoting poverty alleviation. Our concern here is that the process of forest commodification might lead to a shift in local norms of benefit-sharing, in ways that can hinder these key components of sustainable development goals. We report the results of a survey (N = 519) conducted across sites in Bolivia, China and Tanzania that shows that switching from non-monetary to monetary benefits is associated with changes in preferences for distributional fairness in ways that may be detrimental to the poor. In particular, we show that forest commodification is associated with a lower likelihood of selecting pro-poor or egalitarian approaches to benefit sharing and higher likelihood of selecting to distribute benefits in a way that rewards individual contributions or compensates losses.

AB  - This paper explores the potential for an environmental justice framing to shed new light on conservation controversies. We argue that, in order to make such progress, environmental justice analysis will need to provide a difference-friendly' conception of justice and that this will necessarily involve moving beyond dominant liberal conceptions of distributional fairness. We are largely welcoming of global deployments of distributive justice principles. However, we also explore the dangers of focusing on distribution alone, questioning the assumption of positive relationships between benefit sharing and more culturally defined dimensions of justice such as recognition. The limits of access and benefit sharing for delivering justice writ large is that it can disenfranchise people who are less well equipped or less willing to navigate its prevailing system of knowledge. We argue that, especially in the context of resource poverty, efforts to improve distribution can require potential beneficiaries to assimilate to dominant discourses of society and nature. Such conditionality can contract the opportunities for local and autonomous constructions of different' ways of knowing nature, and in doing so may also contract possibilities for flourishing biodiversities.

AB  - This study seeks answers to whether certain gender groups are overexposed to land surface temperature (LST) and whether or not the levels of such overexposure differ across socioeconomic groups and locations? The results of a geographically weighted regression model on 2400 Dutch residential zones show that LST is feminized. Gender composition alone explains about 10% of LST variations, regardless of other socioeconomic characteristics. For a 1% increase in women's population in a residential zone, LST increases by more than 0.1 degrees C. When socioeconomic characteristics are considered, the model explains more than 75% of variations. It shows that women living in low-value and relatively-old buildings are more exposed than men in 51% and 41% of the zones. Older-than-65-years and high-income women are more exposed than men in 24% and 22% of zones. Feminization of LST has a spatial pattern, too. It is more likely to occur in a moderate climate than in areas with extreme cold or warm climates. This study discusses the results and offers a series of possible explanations: Women's overrepresentation in urbanised areas, gender imbalance in economic sectors, suburbanisation of poverty, unequal access to green, different life expectancy among gender groups, and high variation of LST in moderate climates.

AB  - This paper begins with the observation that the contemporary eco-building movement in the UK focuses on technology with the principal aim of reducing carbon emissions and so combating climate change. While this focus may translate into justice for future generations, there seems markedly less regard for justice for others in intragenerational space. I analyse the eco-building movement's framings of sustainable development and sustainability, seeking out statements of equity via the criteria used for building materials selection. Closely defining equity as theory and practice, analysis reveals that framings of sustainable development and sustainability in the eco-building movement vary considerably in their engagement with intragenerational equity. This begs the question of whether the movement has a shared political critique. There is a marked tendency to view discourses of environmental sustainability and social justice as distinct rather than mutually constitutive. I propose that the eco-building movement should engage in a politics of the common good (Sandel, 2010), contesting equity in the public domain. Wary of the reach of markets, the eco-building movement should debate not only the right way to distribute building materials and shelter but also the right way to value them.

AB  - With increasing urbanization, the treatment and disposal of municipal biosolids (processed sewage sludge) is emerging as another area of controversy in the global waste management conundrum and in the drive towards a circular economy. Drawing on in-depth interviews (n=23), this paper examines residents' conceptions of processed biosolids fertilizer products as waste or resource in rural Southgate, Ontario. Findings reveal the importance of residents' conception of biosolids, with the positive view of its resource properties clashing with the negative perceptions of biosolids as an intrusive waste product bringing inequitable risk. Overall, residents' relational conceptions of place and technology emerged as influencing residents' views of biosolids fertilizers as either belonging/natural or intruding/unnatural in their community. Findings contribute to an emerging field of rural environmental justice showing the contested felt injustices related to urban biosolids processing in the rural landscape. Concevoir les dechets comme une ressource: le traitement des biosolides urbains dans le paysage rural Avec la croissance de l'urbanisation, le traitement et l'elimination des biosolides municipaux (boues d'epuration traitees) soulevent un nouveau sujet de controverse dans le dilemme de la gestion mondiale des dechets et la tendance vers une economie circulaire. S'appuyant sur des entrevues en profondeur (n=23), cet article examine la conception qu'ont les residents des engrais biosolides traites comme << dechets >> ou << ressources >> dans le Southgate rural, en Ontario. Les conclusions revelent l'importance de la conception des residents a propos des biosolides, l'opinion positive des proprietes de leurs ressources etant inconciliable avec les perceptions negatives des biosolides comme dechets intrusifs qui entrainent un risque inequitable. Dans l'ensemble, leur conception relationnelle du lieu et de la technologie est apparue comme un facteur qui influence leur opinion a propos des engrais biosolides comme appartenant/etant naturels ou encore comme s'imposant/etant contre nature dans leur collectivite. Les conclusions contribuent au developpement d'un nouveau domaine de justice environnementale rurale en montrant les injustices contestees ressenties reliees au traitement des biosolides urbains dans le paysage rural.

AB  - Wildfires can be detrimental to urban and rural communities, causing impacts in the form of psychological stress, direct physical injury, and smoke-related morbidity and mortality. This study examined the area burned by wildfires over the entire state of California from the years 2000 to 2020 in order to quantify and identify whether burned area and fire frequency differed across Census tracts according to socioeconomic indicators over time. Wildfire data were obtained from the California Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) and National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), while demographic data were obtained from the American Community Survey. Results showed a doubling in the number of Census tracts that experienced major wildfires and a near doubling in the number of people residing in wildfire-impacted Census tracts, mostly due to an over 23,000 acre/year increase in the area burned by wildfires over the last two decades. Census tracts with a higher fire frequency and burned area had lower proportions of minority groups on average. However, when considering Native American populations, a greater proportion resided in highly impacted Census tracts. Such Census tracts also had higher proportions of older residents. In general, high-impact Census tracts tended to have higher proportions of low-income residents and lower proportions of high-income residents, as well as lower median household incomes and home values. These findings are important to policymakers and state agencies as it relates to environmental justice and the allocation of resources before, during, and after wildfires in the state of California.

AB  - Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) has long been characterized as Canada's skid row within public narratives that raise concerns about communicable diseases, open drug use, survival sex work, and homelessness. This stigmatizing gaze has bolstered a deficit-oriented philosophy that emphasizes measures to mitigate these threats, ostensibly by erasing the moral and environmental depravity from the landscape. However, such measures threaten to further marginalize DTES residents by perpetuating public sentiments of fear and disgust toward the inner city. In this paper, we challenge this orientation by reporting the results of a research process in which DTES residents chronicled their impressions of the neighbourhood. Our findings reveal a paradoxical therapeutic response to environmental injustice in the inner city, one that enables society's most marginalized people to find support, solidarity, and acceptance in their everyday struggles to survive, even thrive, amidst the structural and physical violence of the urban margins.

AB  - This ethnographic study explores challenges raised by distinctions between insiders and outsiders in community organizing. By examining conflicts between locals and nonlocals collaborating on an Indian environmental justice campaign, this study finds that those engaged in the collaboration had mutually opposed views of the ethical purpose of the campaign. Moreover, the opposition between these two perspectives was integral to how the distinction between local and nonlocal was produced and sustained. Anthropological theories of scale help to explain how these differences of ethical purpose both served to distinguish insiders from outsiders and set them at odds over how collaboration should proceed. This article contributes to the community organizing literature by describing how value differences can lead to conflict in insider/outsider collaborations and by recommending a flexible, tactical approach to working across such differences.

AB  - While many of the concerns over the economic valuation of nature have gained broad exposure, justice concerns remain largely peripheral. Within both scholarly debate and actual valuation exercises, the emphasis is most often on reconciling cultural and monetary valuation. Increasingly, as the valuation of nature gains momentum, proponents of the trend seek to relieve apprehensions by suggesting that economic valuation is entirely compatible with intrinsic and esthetic values. This attempt to mollify skeptics, however, misses the mark; regardless of whether or not nature may be valued simultaneously in cultural and economic terms, the social and environmental justice implications of monetary valuation remain. The purpose of this commentary is to clarify that much of the resistance to the economic valuation of nature is motivated by these justice concerns and that reassurances about the cultural value of nature do little to quell them. Several of the justice reasons to remain cautious of the economic valuation of nature are also elaborated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study develops and applies the Institutional Panarchy Framework (IPF) to examine institutional adaptations in the rights, rules, and authority to govern public access and use of 'nonmeandered waters' (NMWs) overlying private lands in the South Dakota Prairie Pothole Region (SD PPR). Data collection from March 2017 through July 2019 involved field observations of legislative and other public meetings and review of legislation, policy, court cases, documents, and existing statistics. Findings demonstrated how hydrological changes resulted in everyday, operational level changes in how access and use rights to NMWs were executed, conflict over rules governing use and access of NMWs at the collective choice level, and eventually constitutional level changes in the authority to determine rights and rules of access and use of NMWs. A key contribution for commons and socio-hydrological governance scholarship is that institutional resistance and pressures for change are not unidirectional; feedbacks from lower institutional levels spur change at higher levels and broader scales. Broader policy implications include institutional mechanisms for potential improvements in water quality, farm sustainability, and climate justice.

AB  - This paper draws on climate justice principles developed in the context of international negotiations between national governments to assess the distribution of carbon reduction roles between different actors involved in residential energy use within the UK. In so doing, it aims to provide a new understanding of equity aspects of current residential policy and to highlight opportunities for more effective and equitable policy. The paper uses three criteria: rights and corresponding duties; mitigation responsibilities and capabilities. It applies them systematically to assess the roles of five key actors involved in residential energy use in the UK. The assessment finds a suboptimal distribution of actors' duties, responsibilities and capabilities and roles and discusses whether and how a more effective and fair allocation of outcomes, in terms of carbon reduction and fuel poverty, could be achieved. In particular, it raises questions about whether the right actors are being legally obliged or incentivised to deliver energy efficiency improvements, and suggests that particular actors - local authorities and community groups - are under-used and require greater government support with capability. The paper represents the first use of international climate justice frameworks to investigate residential energy policy within a country.

AB  - With the dual challenges of reducing emissions from fossil fuels and providing access to clean and affordable energy, there is an imperative for a transition to a low carbon energy system. The transition must take into consideration questions of energy justice to ensure that policies, plans and programmes guarantee fair and equitable access to resources and technologies. An energy justice framework is outlined to account for distributional, procedural and recognition inequalities, as well as emerging themes such as cosmopolitan and non Western understandings of justice, in decision-making relating to energy systems. The spectrum of research offers critical perspectives on the energy transition as well as tools for decision-making and policy processes. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods all contribute to our understanding of the problems and the success of responses. The studies presented in this special issue illustrate that the field of energy justice is a rapidly growing arena. There is constant innovation taking place in enabling the transition with new structures, processes and metrics being introduced to guide decision-making and a more holistic view of the community emerging where acceptance, mobilisation and empowerment are opening possibilities for a just transition to a low carbon energy system. The importance of introducing the interdisciplinary approach between social sciences and natural sciences as well engineering implementation supported by scientific data and experiments shall be emphasized in future studies.

AB  - We evaluate the current status of the global marine fisheries using the frameworks of conflict, food security and vulnerability. Existing trends suggest that there is likely to be greater food insecurity and fisheries conflicts due to issues such as: declining fishery resources; a North-South divide in investment; changing consumption patterns; increasing reliance on fishery resources for coastal communities; and inescapable poverty traps creating by low net resource productivity and few alternatives. Consequently, managing fisheries from a food security perspective will become increasingly necessary, and we therefore briefly review fisheries from the perspective of food security and evaluate it using a vulnerability framework. Specifically, we describe three key components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) for selected fisheries. This is followed by proposals to build the adaptive capacity of fisheries and recommendations to avoid future conflicts. Adaptive capacity attributes include assets, social flexibility and organization attributes, and learning. We present some key ways to build these aspects of the fishery to reduce the many potential environmental and social threats that increase the vulnerability of fisheries. Recommendations include fewer subsidies, reduced capital investment, precautionary management to minimize risks of ecosystem collapse, conservation of remaining resources, diversified portfolios of production and markets, and greater equity in contracts and distribution. Further, we recommend a contextual diagnostic and environmental justice framework to assess a range of options for fishery governance.

AB  - While forced labor in the world's fishing fleet has been widely documented, its extent remains unknown. No methods previously existed for remotely identifying individual fishing vessels potentially engaged in these abuses on a global scale. By combining expertise from human rights practitioners and satellite vessel monitoring data, we show that vessels reported to use forced labor behave in systematically different ways from other vessels. We exploit this insight by using machine learning to identify high-risk vessels from among 16,000 industrial longliner, squid jigger, and trawler fishing vessels. Our model reveals that between 14% and 26% of vessels were high-risk, and also reveals patterns of where these vessels fished and which ports they visited. Between 57,000 and 100,000 individuals worked on these vessels, many of whom may have been forced labor victims. This information provides unprecedented opportunities for novel interventions to combat this humanitarian tragedy. More broadly, this research demonstrates a proof of concept for using remote sensing to detect forced labor abuses.

AB  - This paper introduces a scalable "climate health justice" model for assessing and projecting incidence, treatment costs, and sociospatial disparities for diseases with well-documented climate change linkages. The model is designed to employ low-cost secondary data, and it is rooted in a perspective that merges normative environmental justice concerns with theoretical grounding in health inequalities. Since the model employs International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) disease codes, it is transferable to other contexts, appropriate for use across spatial scales, and suitable for comparative analyses. We demonstrate the utility of the model through analysis of 2008-2010 hospitalization discharge data at state and county levels in Texas (USA). We identified several disease categories (i.e., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, heat-related, and respiratory) associated with climate change, and then selected corresponding ICD-9 codes with the highest hospitalization counts for further analyses. Selected diseases include ischemic heart disease, diarrhea, heat exhaustion/cramps/stroke/syncope, and asthma. Cardiovascular disease ranked first among the general categories of diseases for age-adjusted hospital admission rate (5286.37 per 100,000). In terms of specific selected diseases (per 100,000 population), asthma ranked first (517.51), followed by ischemic heart disease (195.20), diarrhea (75.35), and heat exhaustion/cramps/stroke/syncope (7.81). Charges associated with the selected diseases over the 3-year period amounted to US$5.6 billion. Blacks were disproportionately burdened by the selected diseases in comparison to non-Hispanic whites, while Hispanics were not. Spatial distributions of the selected disease rates revealed geographic zones of disproportionate risk. Based upon a down-scaled regional climate-change projection model, we estimate a >5% increase in the incidence and treatment costs of asthma attributable to climate change between the baseline and 2040-2050 in Texas. Additionally, the inequalities described here will be accentuated, with blacks facing amplified health disparities in the future. These predicted trends raise both intergenerational and distributional climate health justice concerns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Warren County, North Carolina, is heralded as a watershed event of contemporary environmentalism, as the birthplace of the environmental justice movement. This article identifies four requirements for the emergence of a social movement (cultural frames, social networks, disruptive action, and political opportunities) and argues that all four were met in the Warren County situation. The article then illustrates how the master frame of environmental justice emerged out of the specific collective action in Warren County. Lastly, the article shows how criteria for waste management decisions have shifted as a result and how these decision processes have become more participatory.

AB  - This paper is directed towards answering questions such as the following:center dot How can policy makers develop agreement on what constitutes and supports well-being of the planet rather than the gross domestic product of a nation state (Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi)?center dot How can nested forms of participatory democracy and systemic governance do the following: (i) support the appropriate distribution and consumption of resources; and (ii) protect social and environmental diversity and justice at the local and regional levels? To this end, the paper addresses pathways to redress the commodification of relationships across human beings, the voiceless and the environment, on the basis of considering the consequences for the next generation of life on the planet. It makes the case that the technologies of humility' for social and environmental justice (Jasanoff) need to be informed by a caretaking approach.

AB  - This chapter describes several justice theories and counterposes these with a series of actual decisions in key water management cases. The decisions occurred under state laws and the Water Act 2007 and hence the relevant laws differ. Hence, the first point that this chapter makes about justice is, that the differences between the relevant laws, creates differences and these may lead to injustice between residents of different states. This would be in the nature of a different outcome on the same facts. This arises from the constitutional settlement in 1901, which entrenched state pre-eminence in this domain and others such as criminal law. Hence, distributive justice is not achieved by this process of having different state laws. Procedural and informational justice are also a product of the different state systems too, and hence also differ from state to state. Therefore justice is not served well by having so many different rules about water management in Australia. For example, all urban water supply businesses provide relief to customers if they cannot pay their water bill, but use different criteria. Overall, the state level focus has impeded national thinking about water management. The change to this was the radical adoption of the Water Act 2007, which provides limited oversight of state laws in the Murray-Darling region. This Act imposes a clear human rights statement that requires critical human water needs to be the first priority. This chapter deals with rural water use for production and regional water allocation plans that attempt to create sustainable use that ensures ecologically sustainable development (ESD). This chapter then considers the gaps between the theory and practice. It asks what has been the outcome of the laws and the processes and applies them to rural water management in Australia over the last 200 years, and then suggests some institutional and law reforms to make the future more just. It uses studies of key cases adjudicating disputes over powers to change consumptive water uses to achieve (ESD) in the new instrument, called 'regional water plans'. The Australian states have many names for these, and many hundreds of plans exist. The chapter decides that ESD is a conception of justice that incorporates present and future generations and finds that ESD has been operationalised very well through judges. The chapter however, suggests reform along the lines of Corporations Law: that is, that governments should pass identical state laws with uniform definitions. This chapter is a personal reflection on our greatest natural resource, water, and how it is the basis for all wealth. Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else. (Aristotle(1)) My reflection on the legal system is that we must think like a nation with regard to water management. Water is our commons, and the greatest offence to common sense is to manage it using political boundaries. Water supply is a human right and it should be the first role of government to provide water in a sustainable way that preserves the environment for future generations. They hang the man and flog the woman That steal the goose from the common But let the greater villain loose That steal the common from the goose. (English folk poem, Anonymous)

AB  - We evaluated population size and factors influencing environmental justice near oil and gas (O&G) wells. We mapped nearest O&G well to residential properties to evaluate population size, temporal relationships between housing and O&G development, and 2012 housing market value distributions in three major Colorado O&G basins. We reviewed land use, building, real estate, and state O&G regulations to evaluate distributive and participatory justice. We found that by 2012 at least 378,000 Coloradans lived within 1 mile of an active O&G well, and this population was growing at a faster rate than the overall population. In the Denver Julesburg and San Juan basins, which experienced substantial O&G development prior to 2000, we observed a larger proportion of lower value homes within 500 feet of an O&G well and that most O&G wells predated houses. In the Piceance Basin, which had not experienced substantial prior O&G development, we observed a larger proportion of high value homes within 500 feet of an O&G well and that most houses predated O&G wells. We observed economic, rural, participatory, and/or distributive injustices that could contribute to health risk vulnerabilities in populations near O&G wells. We encourage policy makers to consider measures to reduce these injustices.

AB  - With the power to break Earth Systems comes responsibility to care for them, and arguably to repair them. Climate geoengineering is one possible approach. But repair is under-researched and underspecified in this context. In a first attempt to establish basic principles for the obligations of repair in the Anthropocene, five disciplines of repair are briefly reviewed: reconstruction of historic buildings; remediation of human bodies; restoration of ecosystems; reconfiguration of cultural materials and artifacts; and reconciliation of broken relationships. In each case ethical practices and debates are described to help identify key themes and challenges in understanding repair. Three interlinked pragmatic ethics or virtues of repair in the Anthropocene are suggested: care, integrity, and legibility. Implications for climate geoengineering, climate politics, and the possibilities of climate justice are explored. Climate repair is defended against objections that it would exacerbate a moral hazard effect, or frame climate responses as politically conservative.

AB  - When Congress rejected President Lyndon Johnson's Rat Extermination and Control Bill in the summer of 1967, in a mood of growing conservatism, it inadvertently sparked a heated political controversy that brought the desperate conditions of life in inner-city America into sharp focus. This article focuses on the issue of rat infestation to explore the conditions of "urban blight" that disproportionately afflicted ghetto communities in the United States during the 1960s and that represented a form of environmental inequality linked to racial marginalization and poverty. It is suggested that a growing awareness of environmental aspects of inequality increasingly fueled ghetto discontent, feeding the outbreak of riots during the "long, hot summers," and spurring liberals to think of new ways to understand the problems of inner-city poverty.

AB  - This paper investigates the distribution of three common air pollutants, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and fine particulates (PM10), in England and Wales with respect to social class, ethnicity and population density. A multilevel model is used to demonstrate regional differences in the social distribution of pollution. The results show that, allowing for ethnicity and population density, there are different relationships between socio-economic status and exposure to air pollution within different regions in England and Wales. These differences suggest that national legislation introduced to reduce air pollution levels may give rise to environmental injustice, with geographical and social differences in the costs and benefits arising to the population due to such legislation.

AB  - Urban greenspace can provide physical and mental health benefits to residents, potentially reducing health inequalities associated with socioeconomic deprivation. The distribution of urban greenspace is an important social justice issue, and consequently is increasingly studied. However, there is little consistency between studies in terms of methods and definitions. There is no consensus on what comprises the most appropriate geographic units of analysis or how to capture residents' experience of their neighbourhood, leading to the possibility of bias. Several complementary aspects of distribution equity have been defined, yet few studies investigate more than one of these. There are also alternative methods for measuring each aspect of distribution. All of these can lead to conflicting conclusions, which we demonstrate by calculating three aspects of equity for two units of aggregation and three neighbourhood sizes for a single study area. We make several methodological recommendations, including taking steps to capture the relevant neighbourhood as experienced by residents accurately as possible, and suggest that using small-area aggregations may not result in unacceptable levels of information loss. However, a consideration of the local context is critical both in interpreting individual studies and understanding differing results.

AB  - Urban greenspace can improve the health of local residents by facilitating physical activity, psychological restoration, and social contacts, as well as through amelioration of the physical environment and immune system modulation. In some cases, greenspace exposure has been reported to reduce health inequalities associated with deprivation. However, studies investigating the socioeconomic equity of greenspace distribution find conflicting results. We investigate how greenspace distribution varies with socioeconomic deprivation in Sheffield, UK, for three aspects of greenspace distribution (access; provision, or accessible greenspace area; and population pressure, or potential for crowding), and for three types of greenspace (any publicly accessible greenspace; greenspaces meeting criteria that increase the likelihood of providing health benefits; and greenspaces with specific provision for children and young people). We find that the accessibility of greenspace favours people living in more deprived areas, although the total area provided is not proportionally greater, and greenspaces have a greater potential for crowding. When looking only at high quality greenspaces, the relationship with deprivation is far weaker, although the potential for crowding remains greater in more deprived areas. When looking only at greenspaces with provision for children and young people, accessibility once again favours people in more deprived areas, but the total area provided is less and the potential for congestion is greater. Our results are influenced by the historic choice of locations for urban parks in Sheffield, i.e. within walking distance of working class neighbourhoods. Both methodological details and local historic context are key drivers of whether greenspace distribution is equitable within cities, and increasing the complexity of questions being asked also increases the complexity of results. Researchers should carefully consider which aspects of equity are of interest when designing studies. We recommend that planners and policy makers ensure that greenspaces are designed and maintained to a high standard that meets the cultural, recreational and accessibility needs of urban residents, including those belonging to minorities, in order to provide maximal public health benefits.

AB  - This paper employs qualitative content analysis to assess 28 brownfield redevelopment plans produced as part of a US Environmental Protection Agency programme. The analysis framework followed the economic, ecological, and social equity dimensions of sustainable development. The findings illustrate that, in terms of economic dimensions, most plans discussed financing the overall project, but few mentioned site values or the pivotal cost of remediating brownfield sites or addressed questions related to liability, the transfer of ownership of sites, or the end use of remediated sites. In terms of ecological dimensions, while many plans suggested "green" uses of existing brownfields, few discussed the impacts of the plans on urban ecological issues or offered technical feasibility of remediating the sites. In terms of social equity dimensions, half of the plans described potential local jobs stemming from the proposed redevelopment, but many did not discuss the human impacts of remediating contaminated sites or the costs of doing nothing. Most plans mentioned community engagement methods but not their outcomes, making the degree to which the lessons gleaned from such engagement influenced the plans totally unclear. Despite the programme's explicit focus on the nexus of environmental justice and local environments, many plans struggled to address the topic in favour of tackling broader economic, environmental, and equity issues. Overall, this paper contributes to the understanding of brownfield redevelopment planning by not only summarising and synthesising the tendencies of existing plans but also suggesting strategies to address areas in which current planning efforts fall short.

AB  - We contribute to the diversification of environmental justice (EJ) by using it to frame ecotourism-related solid waste management problems. Ecotourism is a service industry portrayed as benevolent (providing benefits), and benign (reducing negative impacts). We propose four characteristics shared by ecotourism-based communities in the Global South and communities struggling with more conventional EJ conflicts. We apply these characteristics to the solid waste crisis in Tortuguero, Costa Rica, a renowned ecotourism destination. First, we show that, despite their general absences from the EJ literature, service industries such as tourism and hospitality can create environmental injustices that disproportionately impact certain types of communities. Second, we highlight the roles of location and socio-economic marginality in siting ecotourism development, in complicating related environmental impact management, and in limiting local abilities to respond to environmental management shortcomings. Third, we provide an example of opportunities to introduce EJ concepts and theory into the study of tourism.

AB  - This paper presents research on the distribution of economic benefits from brownfield cleanup and land development. There is growing concern that cleaning up blighted areas, including brownfields, can entrench inequality by disproportionately benefiting some demographic groups more than others. We look for evidence of disproportionate benefits by relating changes in move decisions to land use activity in Chicago using a heterogeneous sorting model. Our research produces two key insights: first, Black and Hispanic households benefit less than White households from brownfield cleanup and vacant land development. Second, owners appear to benefit more than renters from cleanup and development. Overall, these results provide evidence of differences associated with race and housing tenure in who benefits from local land use actions.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate self-reported exposure to the Ringwood Mines/Landfill Superfund Site in relation to chronic health outcomes among members of the Ramapough Lunaape Turtle Clan nation and other local residents of Ringwood, New Jersey. Community surveys on personal exposure to the nearby Superfund site, self-reported health conditions, and demographics were conducted with 187 members of the Ramapough Lunaape Turtle Clan Nation and non-Native Americans residing in Ringwood, New Jersey from December 2015 to October 2016. Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the association between ethnicity and a Superfund site exposure score developed for this study, as well as between exposure score and several chronic health conditions. Native Americans were 13.84 times (OR 13.84; 95% CI 4.32, 44.37) more likely to face exposure opportunities to Superfund sites as compared to non-Native Americans in the same New Jersey borough. For the entire surveyed cohort, increased Superfund site exposure routes was significantly associated with bronchitis (OR 4.10; 95% CI 1.18, 14.23). When the analyses were restricted to Native Americans, the association between self-reported Superfund site exposure and bronchitis remained significant (OR 17.42; 95% CI 1.99, 152.45). Moreover, the association between greater exposure score and asthma in this same population also reached statistical significance (OR 6.16; 95% CI 1.38, 27.49). This pilot study demonstrated a significant association between being a Ringwood resident of Native American ethnicity and self-declared opportunities for Superfund site exposure. It also showed a strong association between self-reported Superfund site exposure and the prevalence of bronchitis and asthma.

AB  - This paper reports on an ongoing initiative that seeks to enhance the detection, monitoring, and reporting capabilities of local communities in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon through the introduction of hardware and digital tools, as a strategy to strengthen their ability to produce socio-environmental evidence. A Community Based Monitoring (CBM) system has been created to link social organizations, fighting for environmental justice, and academics working on the region in topics related to oil extraction and environmental change. This paper first, conceptualize the need for rural participatory systems of data collection, analysis, and distribution of environmental liabilities in extractive frontiers. Second, the paper provides a description of this community monitoring system in the Ecuadorian Amazon, in a way that can be used by communities and researchers in different contexts. Finally, the paper reflects on lessons learned to understand the main challenges and opportunities of similar systems.

AB  - This study examines the spatial distribution and enforcement of air polluting facilities in the state of New Jersey, as listed in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Aerometric Information Retrieval System. Results show that air-polluting facilities tend to concentrate near minority neighborhoods, although this relationship is partially explained by factors of population density, manufacturing employment, and land use. Other results suggest that facilities in areas with a relatively high percentage of minority population tend to have a weaker record of environmental enforcement as compared to other facilities. Of the socioeconomic variables considered, employment in manufacturing appears to be the most strongly related to environmental enforcement.

AB  - Through their synergies, trade-offs, and contradictions, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have the potential to lead to environmental justices and injustices. Yet, environmental justice (EJ), and social justice more broadly, are not currently embedded within the language and spirit of the SDGs. We part from the premise that "many 'environmental' problems are, by their very nature, problems of justice" (Lele, Wiley Interdiscip Rev Water 4:e1224, 2017). We review progress in EJ frameworks in recent years, arguing for the need to move beyond a focus on the four principles of mainstream EJ (distribution, procedure, recognition, and capabilities) towards a more intersectional decolonial approach to environmental justice that recognises the indispensability of both humans and non-humans. EJ frameworks, and the SDGs should recognise power dynamics, complex interactions among injustices, and listens to the different 'senses of justice' and desires of theorists, activists, and other stakeholder from the Global South. We analyze how EJ frameworks are, or fail to be, incorporated in the SDGs with a focus on the food-water-health nexus (SDG2, 3, 6); climate-energy (SDG7, 13), conservation (SDG14, 15); and poverty and inequality (SDG1, 10). We call attention to the 'elephant in the room'-the failure to go beyond GDP but instead include economic growth as a goal (SDG8). We argue that sustainable degrowth and intersectional decolonial environmental justices would create better conditions for the transformative changes needed to reach the broader aim of the SDGs: to leave no one behind.

AB  - This course, Environmental Justice, brings together two topics often separated by academic disciplines, chemistry and social justice, and two groups of students usually separated by razor wire, liberal arts students and incarcerated men. Case studies are the backbone of the course. Each case has a principle source and a secondary reading on fundamental social questions. For example, chapters from Rachael Carson's Silent Spring are paired with Environmental Ethics by Homes Rolston and the movie Erin Brockovich with A Theory of Justice by John Rawls. The case studies let students explore how human activities produce consequences for natural systems and how cultural, economic, and political factors affect environmental policymaking. The teaching methods are a mixture of reading, writing, discussion, and presentation. Using a variety of methods gives students opportunities to play to their strengths and develop new skills, which is critical in a classroom where educational backgrounds and interest in the topic vary.

AB  - This work maps and interprets the evolution of the urban footprint of Phnom Penh from 1973 to 2015 and reviews its main socio-ecological impacts. The quantified patterns of urban growth and land-use change are based on the processing and analysis of Landsat satellite images (MSS, TM, and OLI sensors) and are enhanced by observation- and interview-based information obtained in the field. The growth of Phnom Penh is shown to have encroached initially on the fertile agricultural lands of the Mekong River floodplain, but since 2006 the city has been sprawling predominantly over natural lakes and wetlands that until then were functional components of the urban mosaic and underpinned the livelihoods of its population. Urban land areas increased from 3000 ha in 1973 to 4000 ha in 1990, subsequently soaring to 25,000 ha in 2015, i.e. an average annual increase of 850-1000 ha. The discussion of these changes focuses on (i) changing livelihoods on the urban fringe; (ii) the numerous, and sometimes large, real-estate projects that have sprung up around the city centre on former wetland areas and are funded by strongly imbricated capital interests between the nation's elites and foreign investors; (iii) a comparison of the urban growth figures with other Asian cities; and (iv) current land policies in Cambodia. The results call for urgent policymaking to address the diseconomies that arise from the impending loss of ecosystem services; from the accentuation of flood hazards caused by the rapid, ongoing suppression of wetland habitats at the delta head of the eighth largest river in the world; and from the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of urban growth among the metropolitan population.

AB  - This paper will outline the concrete steps and challenges of, one of the most comprehensive brownfield redevelopment. projects in the USA. A road to be constructed in 2002, gave rise to a vision capturing $237 million of investment to date. The paper includes historic and current photos, maps, charts, and newspaper stories. The Phalen Corridor Initiative is a complex public-private collaborative where corporations learn to work with neighborhood groups and every level of government. This project addresses environmental justice as African Americans, Hmong, Somali, and Hispanics have: moved to. the East Side of Saint Paul. However, the once thriving plants and decent housing have been replaced by absentee owned rental houses and polluted land. Successes of the project include... 1) Williams Hill Business Center, a converted brownfield and winner of the Minnesota Economic Development Award for 2000. The site includes 650 jobs, and the companies hire through a job bank the collaborative established. 2) Medium density, mixed income, sustainable housing designed by a partnership with fourteen corporations (3M and Andersen Window, etc.), community groups, Habitat for Humanity and the City. 3) A retail center, built on a marsh, was tom down in the nation's first example of retail re-conversion to a wetland. Now, a bank, a 62 million-dollar state agency, over one hundred units of senior housing and a national grocery are being built surrounding the new wetland. 4) A multi-modal transit corridor that includes a new road, bicycle/pedestrian trails, storm water ponding, a large bridge, rail, a $60 million interstate interchange, and bus transit. This paper will include a complex funding strategy with corporate, federal, local and state dollars.

AB  - This paper puts forward two claims about funding carbon capture and storage. The first claim is that there are moral justifications supporting strategic investment into CO2 storage from global and regional perspectives. One argument draws on the empirical evidence which suggests carbon capture and storage would play a significant role in a portfolio of global solutions to climate change; the other draws on Rawls' notion of legitimate expectations and Moellendorf's Anti-Poverty principle. The second claim is that where to pursue this strategic investment poses a morally non-trivial problem, with considerations like near-term global distributive justice and undermining legitimate expectations favouring investing in developing regions, especially in Asia, and considerations like long-term climate impacts and best uses of resources favouring investing in the relatively wealthy regions that have the best prospects for successful storage development.

AB  - This paper assesses whether the Clean Air Act and its Amendments have been equally successful in ensuring the right to healthful air quality in both advantaged and disadvantaged communities in the United States. Using a method to rank air quality established by the American Lung Association in its 2009 State of the Air report along with EPA air quality data, we assess the environmental justice dimensions of air pollution exposure and access to air quality information in the United States. We focus on the race, age, and poverty demographics of communities with differing levels of ozone and particulate matter exposure, as well as communities with and without air quality information. Focusing on PM(2.5) and ozone, we find that within areas covered by the monitoring networks, non-Hispanic blacks are consistently overrepresented in communities with the poorest air quality. The results for older and younger age as well as poverty vary by the pollution metric under consideration. Rural areas are typically outside the bounds of air quality monitoring networks leaving large segments of the population without information about their ambient air quality. These results suggest that substantial areas of the United States lack monitoring data, and among areas where monitoring data are available, low income and minority communities tend to experience higher ambient pollution levels.

AB  - This paper presents a geographic information systems (GIS) methodology for evaluating the environmental justice implications of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Burden Reduction Rule, which was issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December 2006 under the authority of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986. This rule exempts industrial facilities meeting certain higher reporting thresholds from filing detailed reports about the quantities of chemicals used, released, or managed as waste. Our analytical approach examines demographic characteristics within a 1, 3, and 5 km buffer around a georeferenced facility location, applied on a national, regional, and state scale. The distance-based GIS analysis demonstrates that TRI facilities that are eligible for reduced reporting are more likely to be located in proximity to communities with a higher percentage of minority and low-income residents. The differences are more pronounced for percent minority and percent minority under age 5 in comparison to percent in poverty, and the demographic differences are more apparent at increasingly resolved geographic scales.

AB  - This article will discuss Paulo Freire's global influences on environmental pedagogies and argue that ecopedagogical reinventions are essential for 'quality' education, as touted in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #4, for global, all-inclusive 'development' that is planetarily sustainable. The politics of how 'development' is taught or not taught to be critically read linguistically and dialogically will be problematized through Freire's work, and reinventions of his work, on ecopedagogy. As Freire was a pedagogue of critical literacy, ecopedagogical literacy widens 'reading the word to read the world' (all humans, human populations) to read Earth to read the world as part of Earth. Such reading is not anthropocentric. The article will first describe Freire's influence on reinventing environmental pedagogies, including education for (un)sustainable development (ESD), with specific discussions on how language of 'development' and corresponding (un)sustainability is framed. These influences from Freire will then be discussed through his de/re/constructions of citizenship, utopia and education, and globalization. Throughout the article, I will argue the need for teaching ecopedagogical literacy with ecolinguistics is essential to better understand the politics of language and (non)hierarchical dialogue which influence how 'development' goals are constructed, including the SDGs.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the first national study of air quality in Britain to consider the implications of its distribution across over ten thousand local communities in terms of potential environmental injustice. We consider the recent history of the environmental justice debate in Britain, Europe, and the USA and, in the light of this, estimate how one aspect of air pollution, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, affects different population groups differentially across Britain. We also estimate the extent to which people living in each community in Britain contribute towards this pollution, with the aid of information on the characteristics of the vehicles they own. We find that, although community NOx emission and ambient NO2 concentration are strongly related, the communities that have access to fewest cars tend to suffer from the highest levels of air pollution, whereas those in which car ownership is greatest enjoy the cleanest air. Pollution is most concentrated in areas where young children and their parents are more likely to live and least concentrated in areas to which the elderly tend to migrate. Those communities that are most polluted and which also emit the least pollution tend to be amongst the poorest in Britain. There is therefore evidence of environmental injustice in the distribution and production of poor air quality in Britain. However, the spatial distribution of those who produce and receive most of that pollution have to be considered simultaneously to see this injustice clearly.

AB  - Traffic assignment, pollutant emission and dispersion models were applied to a major UK city so as to assess the air quality impacts of five road pricing schemes, Schemes were evaluated with reference to: exceedence of air quality standards for six pollutants; greenhouse gas emission; redistribution of pollution, an environmental justice concern; and road network performance as traffic speed and trip distance. Results were compared to alternatives of do nothing, network development and clean fuel promotion. The air quality benefits of a modest distance-based charge are highlighted. However, whilst road pricing shows potential as an air quality management tool, its value and suitability are strongly sensitive to prior air quality and emission source apportionment in the application city.

AB  - We describe contemporaneous changes in environmental quality and social deprivation in English local authority districts over four decades, using secondary source GIS modelled data on environmentally intrusive development. The distribution of this development is described with respect to the Townsend material deprivation score, corroborated against the Breadline Britain index. Spatial patterns of environmental intrusion and material deprivation change markedly over the period, although a clear environmental inequality remains throughout. However, it is not the most deprived who experience the greatest decline in their environmental quality, as most of the increase in environmental intrusion occurs in those districts whose population were amongst the most affluent in the early 1960s. We note that the environmental justice implications of these observations are dependent upon conceptions of justice held, and reflect on the challenge of testing, through empirical longitudinal analysis, the notion that environmental sustainability and social justice are incompatible.

AB  - This research investigates the relationships between airborne and depositional industrial lead emission concentrations modeled using Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) and childhood blood lead levels (BLL) in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) 2006-2013. Linear and mediation interaction regression models estimated the effects of older housing and airborne and depositional lead emission concentrations on black and white childhood BLLs, controlling for neighborhood levels of racial isolation and poverty-important social structures in the DMA. The results showed a direct relationship between airborne and depositional lead emissions and higher childhood BLL, after controlling for median housing age. Lead emissions also exacerbated the effect of older housing on black and white children's BLLs (indirect relationship), after controlling for social structures. Findings from this research indicate that black and white children exposed to lead-based paint/pipes in older housing are further impacted by industrial lead pollution that may lead to permanent neurological damage.

AB  - Through each era, the southeastern United States was and continues to be an epicenter for industrial companies to establish factories and plants. Though this development attracts economic gain for the companies and surrounding areas, low-income and predominantly Black communities bear the brunt of the environmental consequences while frequently remaining stagnant economically. This qualitative, community-based participatory research study grew out of a larger study designed to recruit lay community advisors from communities labeled as hard to reach in research. We focus on Holt, Alabama, an unincorporated community in the southeastern United States region. The primary goal of this research inquiry is to thematically analyze community interviews stemming from a topic of research, practice, and policy interest to community members: the effects of industrial pollution on Holt citizens' daily lives. Content analysis of focus-group transcripts revealed four emergent themes, including: (1) how the pollution affects their water, soil, and air quality; (2) illness related to pollution; (3) community engagement and empowerment; and (4) suggestions regarding what government officials could do to address this area of need. Building upon the prior research regarding environmental justice, human flourishing, and the definition of nurturing environments, suggestions are made regarding the creation, implementation, and maintenance of project advisory councils focused on issues of environmental justice. Community advocacy and empowerment as well as community and scientific partnerships are imperative to alleviate problems associated with environmental justice.

AB  - This paper investigates spatial relationships regarding the accessibility of urban green space, the overall yearly vitality of the surrounding vegetation, and additional indicators such as air and noise pollution, in urban areas. The analysis uses socio-economic data sets derived from a sophisticated disaggregation approach. It results from applying a new tool that processes data from coarse and small-scale data sets to smaller spatial units in order to derive more fine-grained insights into the characteristics of the smallest suburb. The consequent data sets are then augmented by comprehensive raster-based accessibility network analysis and the incorporation of measured data on air and noise pollution. Gaining an overview over the whole area on the one hand, and looking at smaller city districts in detail on the other, unveils whether there is an imbalance regarding all combined indicators. After correlating two socio-economic indicators, a spatial comparison of the preliminary results determines whether this approach reveals neighborhoods wherein residents of a lower socio-economic status are exposed to multiple threats at once. As a result, the paper presents a workflow to obtain a broader and, at the same time, more small-scale overview of polycentric agglomeration. Simultaneously, it provides a large-scale insight into single sites, right down to the city block level. Consequently, this study provides a sophisticated approach that helps to assess the quality, quantity and characteristics of the specific spatial distribution of environmental justice in small- to large-scale urban areas at a glance. The results help to identify regions of inequalities and disadvantages. They allow for querying additional values assigned to large-scale spatial units. These versatile variables provide a means to reveal other noticeable indicators. Furthermore, this entails the opportunity to evaluate the distinct living conditions of locally affected demographic groups, and improve them with tailored approaches. Finally, the results can enhance the perception of these living conditions, and be used to promote the capacity for organizing the lives of the respective residents more sustainably, helping the neighborhood to grow accordingly.

AB  - This paper explores some of the challenges encountered in organizing multiple stakeholders in working toward the revitalization of an urban waterway. Drawing primarily from positive experiences with a creek revitalization project in Syracuse, New York, we identify several factors concerning the context and challenges - both material and social - that have helped to shape the outcomes. Use of collaborative participation processes, co-production, and directly addressing environmental justice issues for engaging stakeholders in such projects are discussed. We seek to identify key points and lessons that can help inform others about participatory processes in communities coping with water-related environmental justice issues. Outcomes include: greater levels of participation by those previously lacking a voice in the process, the conceptual plan itself, indirect physical project outcomes, and establishing new standards for participatory processes in the region.

AB  - Underserved communities suffer from environmental inequities. Gases lead to hypoxia and respiratory compromise, ozone to increased respiratory illnesses and decreased mental acuity, and mercury to prenatal cognitive disabilities and antisocial behaviors. Lead toxicity is associated with developmental delays. Cadmium is linked with cancer. The smaller sizes of air pollution particulate matter are pathogenic and are associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and nervous system disorders. Bisphenol A is being studied for possible links to cancer and pregnancy risks. Physicians should be aware of these dangers, especially in under served communities and populations. Investigating possible environmental risks and education are key.

AB  - This study examines links between racial residential segregation and estimated ambient air toxics exposures and their associated cancer risks using modeled concentration estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxics Assessment. We combined pollutant concentration estimates with potencies to calculate cancer risks by census tract for 309 metropolitan areas in the United States. This information was combined with socioeconomic status (SES) measures from the 1990 Census. Estimated cancer risks associated with ambient air toxics were highest in tracts located in metropolitan areas that were highly segregated. Disparities between racial/ethnic groups were also wider in more segregated metropolitan areas. Multivariate modeling showed that, after controlling for tract-level SES measures, increasing segregation amplified the cancer risks associated with ambient air toxics for all racial groups combined [highly segregated areas: relative cancer risk (RCR)=1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-107; extremely segregated areas: RCR=1.32; 95% CI, 1.28-1.36]. This segregation effect was strongest for Hispanics (highly segregated areas: RCR=1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; extremely segregated areas: RCR=1.74; 95% CI, 1.61-1.88) and weaker among whites (highly segregated areas: RCR=1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; extremely segregated areas: RCR=1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.33), African Americans (highly segregated areas: RCR=1.09; 95% CI, 0.98-1.21; extremely segregated areas: RCR=1.38; 95% CI, 1.24-1.53), and Asians (highly segregated areas: RCR=1.10; 95% CI, 0.97-1.24; extremely segregated areas: RCR=1.32; 95% CI, 1.16-1.51). Results suggest that disparities associated with ambient air toxics are affected by segregation and that these exposures may have health significance for populations across racial lines.

AB  - Two policy frameworks, environmental justice and the precautionary principle, have begun to transform traditional approaches to environmental policy making and community organizing related to public health. Despite having several important overlapping policy goals, little effort has been made to purposefully integrate these two frameworks. This article discusses preliminary research on environmental inequality in ambient air toxics exposures and associated health risks among schoolchildren in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Results indicate that children of color, namely, Latinos and African Americans, bear the highest burden of estimated cancer and noncancer health risks associated with ambient air toxics exposures while they are in school. The implications of these study results for controversial policy decisions related to school siting and construction in urban districts are discussed within the context of environmental justice and the precautionary principle.

AB  - This paper identifies an emerging commonality between the professional spheres of planning, education and social or community work constellating around the concept of sustainable development (SD). It explores the contested nature of the concept of SD giving rise to a wide variety of sometimes conflicting 'readings'. It then goes on to advocate a 'strong' reading of SD, namely 'Just Sustainability', which lays particular stress on 'social justice', 'environmental justice' and inclusion. This, in turn, is understood to require a form of education which is empowering and is referred to as 'Education for Just Sustainability' (EJS). A particular focus of such work is the empowerment of local communities to understand and take action in their home localities. Therefore, place-based education is presented as an orientation suited to progressing EJS. A number of illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the potential for such an educational approach. Finally, some concluding observations are made as to the potential and requirements for place-based EJS in the UK and other contexts.

AB  - Urban expansions to adjoining greenfield sites, particularly in metropolitan regions, have become a global occurrence. Such urbanization practice results in a significant loss in ecosystem services and triggers climate change-where these changes in land cover and emissions of certain pollutants are the fundamental drivers of climate change. Despite its crucial importance, little is known on how to quantify the impact of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change. This study aims to address the question of how the impacts of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change can be measured. The study utilizes a remote sensing approach to investigate the impacts of a period of over 30 years (1989-2019) in Brisbane, Australia and its adjoining local government areas. The methodological steps of the study are two-fold. First, we measure the greenfield development and corresponding ecosystem services losses and, then, we quantify the risk of such losses attributable to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change. The findings of the study reveal the followings: (a) the utilized remote sensing method is a useful technique in quantifying the impacts of climate change; (b) over the last 30-year period, Brisbane and its adjoining areas encountered a total loss of about USD 4.5 billion in ecosystem services, due to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change; (c) peri-urban areas encountered the biggest losses in ecosystem service values; (d) peri-urban areas experienced the highest greenhouse gas emission production levels, and; (e) ecosystem services should be backed up by robust urban management policies-this is critical for mitigating climate change.

AB  - This paper examines the multiple meanings of justice embedded in the notion of environmental justice. It uses research on South Africa's Water Allocation Reform policy to explore how ideas of justice have shifted in the course of crafting the policy, employing the notion of 'allocation discourses' to capture the changing conceptions of justice. South Africa's reform efforts are part of a global trend that vests the ultimate authority over water resources with the State, which provides it with a large degree of discretion in allocating use rights to resources. Drawing on discourse analysis and interviews with key stakeholders, the paper demonstrates how the early versions of the policy were characterised by desert-oriented and utilitarian interpretations of justice, which then shifted to an explicitly egalitarian perspective in the final version, but which, to-date, has had little practical consequence, however. In the early versions, existing users were portrayed as unilaterally beneficial and productive, and the process of redistribution as a risky venture that could lead to environmental degradation and the economy being undermined, whilst failing to acknowledge the waste and pollution of existing users. The paper highlights the importance of unpacking key concepts and understanding how particular framings of human-nature relations influence ideas of justice, and how these may shift over time.

AB  - Urban parks provide many benefits, though evidence of environmental injustice associated with certain park investments is growing. Some cities fail to engage communities in park planning, which can reduce residents' sense of ownership of new and renovated parks and disconnect them from the neighborhood social fabric. Thus, this study assessed the outcomes of resident engagement with an urban park nonprofit located in a low-income community of color in Philadelphia. We developed new metrics measuring perceived engagement with park planning and programming and its association with perceived community ownership and perceptions of the park as part of the neighborhood social fabric. We analyzed these variables following a renovation using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Results showed significant relationships between perceived community engagement and perceptions of the park as a community asset. These findings underscore the importance of engaging communities in park planning to enhance ownership and avoid feeling excluded.

AB  - This paper explores a tension between environmental justice and green jobs. Photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing processes involve hazardous chemicals similar to those found in the electronics industry, where impacts such as groundwater contamination, worker exposures to chemicals, and other air and water emissions overlap with environmental inequality. In the US, cadmium-based thin-film PV was financed with support from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act producing new political ecological configurations of energy procurement and generation, linking Malaysian thin film PV fabs to public lands in the US desert southwest. By integrating traditions in global commodity chains, political ecology, and science and technology studies, this research shows how life cycle assessment was used to shape the debate about cadmium pollution from thin-film PV. As metrics have the power to obscure environmental injustice, the findings call for humility when interpreting life cycle assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Utility-scale solar energy (USSE) development is an emerging cause of land use change across the American Southwest. Many proposed projects in the region have encountered resistance from environmental groups because of concern about endangered, threatened, and special status species. Projects have also faced resistance from impacted local communities and Native American tribes. This research documents land use conflicts that surfaced during the initial wave of USSE development from 2009 to 2015. The goal is to identify potential roots of land use conflict over renewable energy development, to help explain why there is consistent support for renewables in general, but widespread opposition to projects during the proposal and development stages. The primary data presented include public comments to formal rule-making processes, semi-structured interviews conducted from 2009 to 2013, and various media sources. The paper concludes describing emerging planning frameworks that identify sites for USSE with fewer land use conflicts.

AB  - With Sustainable Development Goal 7, the United Nations has declared its ambition to ensure access to modern energy for all by 2030. Aside from broad appeals to differentiated responsibilities and 'greener' technologies, however, the goal leaves significant procedural questions unaddressed. This paper argues that the basic orientation of this approach is problematic, undermining possibilities for progress toward energy justice and equitable development. First, in framing the issue of global energy distribution in broad techno-managerial terms it obscures how particular geographies of energy poverty have been shaped by critical political economic influences. Second, in privileging modern forms of energy and focusing on an end state of universal adoption, over a broader goal of eliminating energy poverty, the approach of SDG7 presents tangible hazards to many of those it seeks to benefit. Using a case study of Sierra Leonean rural cooking energy policy, we demonstrate how the underlying mentality of SDG7 feeds into existing discourses that marginalise producers and users of 'traditional' energy sources, threatening important livelihoods. With such evidence, we argue that for justice in energy policy to be realised holistically, there is a need to question how our knowledge of energy 'problems' have emerged to avoid epistemologically autarchic policy positions.

AB  - While the proliferation of industrial toxic substances over the past century has had drastic environmental and bodily effects, conventional methods of measuring and mitigating those effects continue to produce uncertainty. The project of living in a toxic world entails ethical, technical, and aesthetic efforts to understand toxicity as a contingent encounter among beings, systems, and things, rather than as a fundamental characteristic of particular substances. Anthropologists do not just observe such encounters; they live and work within them. This review examines recent anthropological research on toxicity, proposing that responses to toxic disaster and occupational exposure, as well as acts of familial, state, or corporate care, are all modes of "toxic worlding." The review concludes with a summary of recent research in collaborative and engaged anthropology, suggesting that such approaches are essential not so much for purifying or detoxifying the world as for making it otherwise.

Although virtually all studies in the environmental justice literature analyze cross-sectional data, we construct a panel data set and estimate an econometric model of exposure utilizing the generalized method of moments. In addition, we postulate a surrogate for class position derived from data on estate tax collections. Even after accounting for some of the criticisms of the environmental justice literature, class and race are still significant correlates of the distribution of environmental burdens.

AB  - Urbanisation brings with it increased pressure on land and land uses, particularly green spaces. There has been considerable interest in community food growing in green spaces as part of a wide trend for gardening in the UK, which has been found to bring social, health, and well-being benefits. Such activity tends to take place in community-managed gardens and allotments. In light of the context of austerity within which local authority parks departments currently operate, this study tested the acceptability and feasibility of parks as a potential urban setting for Community Food Growing (CFG) in Sheffield, UK. Employing a combination of resident questionnaires and interviews with community groups and professionals, the study results showed localised differences in the acceptability and feasibility of CFG. Residents' propensity to want to get involved in CFG differed by age and household composition, which, if acted on across the city, could significantly change the demographic make-up of parks-based community groups in the city. Barriers to CFG in parks were described by community groups and park managers as security and vandalism, need for resources, and undue pressure on the local authority as land-owner. We discuss the emergent questions around who is best placed to manage urban parks, particularly when the public sector is subject to stringent austerity budget measures. The paper concludes with commentary and recommendations about the importance of governance arrangements if CFG is to be included as part of the activities supported and managed in urban parks.

Through application of a series of linked models of traffic, emission and pollutant dispersion, air quality was modelled in response to RUC scenarios. The pollutant modelled were NO2, PM10, CO, benzene and 1,3-butadiene, though results of NO2 are used in this study. The RUC scenarios were compared with the 'base' scenario, all set for the year 2005. The RUC initiatives result in the differences in ambient concentrations of NO2. The study correlates NO2 concentrations with derived indices of social deprivation and health. The study concludes that positive but weak relationship exists between air quality and social deprivation, and indicates that deprived population groups are disproportionately exposed to higher NO2 levels. The relationship between air quality and health status of the population is weak. There is a strong relationship between social deprivation and health status of die population. The study concludes that RUC scenarios result in reducing disparity between affluent and deprived populations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the persistent impacts of historical racebased discriminatory housing policies on contemporary urban environments in the United States. Specifically, we examine the relationships between Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades assigned to neighborhoods in the 1930s and the current distribution of tree canopy and level of exposure to air pollution hazards. Our results indicate a clear gradient in tree canopy by HOLC grade, with better neighborhood grades associated with significantly higher percentage of tree canopy coverage. The pattern also exists for airborne carcinogens and respiratory hazards, with worse neighborhood grades associated with significantly higher hazards exposure. Our findings indicate that early 20th century discriminatory housing policies exert a contemporary influence on patterns of green space exposure in American cities, with implications for health and health inequities. Our findings suggest that, in order to achieve equitable access to the benefits of urban greenspace, we must acknowledge these historical influences and consider policies and practices that directly counter these influences, for example, through targeted greenspace development in areas historically identified as unfit for investment.

AB  - This research investigates the practices, knowledge and beliefs that socio-environmental organisations and movements have developed and acquired relating to environmental justice. A literature review is presented first, followed by the methodology. The findings reveal the perceptions of the leaders of socio-environmental organisations and movements. Their remarks are structured into the following two categories: (i) the purposes of the socio-environmental organisations and movements and (ii) the beliefs that support their action. Finally, there is a discussion and the conclusions are presented. The conclusions indicate that socio-environmental organisations and movements are a collective social force against environmental inequality and that the information on the practices and knowledge of these organisations and movements illuminates new perspectives on environmental justice and should be integrated into social work education and practice. It is generally accepted that the effects of climate change are a significant threat to human ecosystems, culture and health, and to global economic development as a whole. In response to these environmental changes and the attendant human vulnerability, it is imperative that social workers can more consciously lead the planning and social advocacy efforts needed to meet this challenge. The poorest and most vulnerable communities generally suffer the worst effects of climate change, and it is, therefore, essential to understand the different experiences of socio-environmental organisations and movements in response to environmental justice issues. This article presents the results of a comparative exploratory research study on Chile and Colombia, focusing on the practices and knowledge of socio-environmental organisations and movements in the Maule Region, Chile and the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. The research uses qualitative methodology and considers the views of nine social actors and leaders, four in Chile and five in Colombia. The conclusions indicate that these socio-environmental organisations see their purpose as defending water and territory, they fulfil a local advocacy role and they raise awareness and provide education on issues through participation and collective action.

AB  - This contribution sets out to combine the perspective of the degrowth paradigm with that of Critical Community psychology. Following the degrowth argument, the advancement of human well-being calls for a shift from growth-based societies to ones grounded in the ethos of degrowth. In this regard, we acknowledge the necessity for both theoretical principles and examples of good practice, which can lead to this transition. To this end, the article combines some of the underlying principles of the degrowth paradigm (i.e. decolonisation of the imaginary, reciprocity and conviviality, and environmental sustainability) with those of Critical Community Psychology, as well as, in one case, of Liberation Psychology (i.e. conscientisation and de-ideologisation, responsible togetherness, and environmental justice). This integration intends to equip academic scholars, practitioners, and social activists with visions and practices for the implementation of strategic actions aimed at individual and social well-being. The article concludes with a thorough reflection on social justice and how to better promote it through the combined contributions of both degrowth and Critical Community psychology.

AB  - This paper and Special Issue build a case for why justice matters in water governance and why it should be explicitly accounted for in water management and allocation. It describes four characteristics of water and their implications for social and environmental justice. These four characteristics - the spatial and temporal uneven distribution of water; the fact that water is essential for all life, with minimums needed for the survival of both the environment and humankind; water's added benefits to human well-being through the goods and services it provides; and the ensuing political dimensions of power asymmetries affecting water governance - have resulted in a plethora of disciplinary interpretations of justice in an attempt to capture its relevance and importance. The collection of papers in this Special Issue provides a glimpse into the diverse range of issues that can emerge when justice considerations are taken or not taken into account in water governance. Water justice is particularly significant when societal change occurs because of altered allocations, institutional rules of the game or in the underlying hydrological regime. We summarise 10 steps that contribute to the continuing articulation of a 'water justice framework' by researchers interested in this field of research and practice.

AB  - This study investigates the extend of environmental inequality related to industrial air pollution in Austria. Using more than 170.000 census grid cells, each at 250 m2, and pollution measures of the E-PRTR, this study is able to provide high geographical resolution data on a national scale. The randomisation strategy applied compares the empirical socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of populations living close to industrial facilities to characteristics of those close to randomly allocated facilities. The results are then confirmed by the use of the spatial regression model SLX, which takes spatial spillovers between neighbouring units into account. The study finds robust evidence for the existence of environmental inequality in Austria. The presence of a foreign population consistently indicates a significant and positive association with the level of pollution. Whereas this pattern holds on a national scale, it is even stronger within urban areas. The spatial dependence follows this pattern, reaffirming the choice of spatial regression techniques. In contrast to past European studies in the field, a positive correlation between income and pollution can be seen in rural areas. By using high-resolution spatial data on a national scale, as well as advanced spatial methods, methodological limitations of these prior studies can be addressed.

AB  - This multi-voice script highlights the process of five years of research with coastal fishing communities in the Azores islands of Portugal. Initially, we used photo elicitation and focus groups to invite people to speak about the sea and all the deep, complex and sometimes contradictory meanings that it may have. In later years, the researchers sought environmental justice within everyday processes, using deep ethnographic and autobiographic narrative inquiry which led to participation in learning about as well as supporting collaborations between fishers, scientists and policy makers. The text is constructed via arts informed research methodology and consists of two parallel, creative narratives, intermittently interrupted by a visual narrative. This work calls for looking at the sea through new eyes, hearing with new ears, feeling differently and awakening to the possibility of knowing the sea in unfamiliar ways.

AB  - Urban green equity, broadly defined as equitable access to and governance of urban forests, mediates urban residents' ability to derive ecosystem services from urban forests. This article explores conceptions of, barriers to, and strategies for urban green equity as understood by urban forestry and related green practitioners in three multicultural cities in the US. Practitioners identified two principle dimensions of urban green equity: (1) distributional equity, and (2) recognitional equity. The key barrier to distributional equity was the perception of urban forests as amenities, while the key barrier to recognitional equity was multiple identities and urban forest priorities, reflecting existing theories of political ecology and social justice. The research identified and systematized additional sub-barriers to urban green equity and strategies used to overcome barriers in practice. While similar themes of urban green equity emerged across the study cities, key areas of disagreement provide important insights. Interestingly, practitioners identified and discussed distributional equity twice as frequently as recognitional equity, indicating a potential gap in understanding and use of the concept. As cities become increasingly aware of ecosystem services and urban green equity, this research can inform urban forestry and sustainability strategies.

AB  - This research examines the distributional equity of urban vegetation in 10 US urbanized areas using very high resolution land cover data and census data. Urban vegetation is characterized three ways in the analysis (mixed vegetation, woody vegetation, and public parks), to reflect the variable ecosystem services provided by different types of urban vegetation. Data are analyzed at the block group and census tract levels using Spearman's correlations and spatial autoregressive models. There is a strong positive correlation between urban vegetation and higher education and income across most cities. Negative correlations between racialized minority status and urban vegetation are observed but are weaker and less common in multivariate analyses that include additional variables such as education, income, and population density. Park area is more equitably distributed than mixed and woody vegetation, although inequities exist across all cities and vegetation types. The study finds that education and income are most strongly associated with urban vegetation distribution but that various other factors contribute to patterns of urban vegetation distribution, with specific patterns of inequity varying by local context. These results highlight the importance of different urban vegetation measures and suggest potential solutions to the problem of urban green inequity. Cities can use our results to inform decision making focused on improving environmental justice in urban settings.

AB  - Urban vegetation, and in particular urban forests, provide a wide range of ecosystem services to urban societies and may thus be classified as environmental goods. Their status as goods suggests that urban societies' interactions with urban vegetation should be subjected to equity analyses to determine the fairness of such interactions. However, despite good evidence that the distribution and governance of urban vegetation are inequitable in many cases, there is no urban forestry-specific framework for analysis of urban green equity: how we access and govern urban vegetation. To begin to fill this gap, this paper reviews research in the fields of ethics, social and environmental justice, political ecology, and urban forestry research and practice, with a focus on urban forestry, and presents a discussion of the dimensions and sub-dimensions of urban green equity. The principal dimensions that emerged from the analysis were (1) the spatial distribution of urban vegetation, and (2) recognition in urban vegetation decision making, defined here as acknowledgement of participants' difference, existence and validity in decision-making processes, both formal and informal, and the inherent inclusion and power associated with that acknowledgement. Sub-dimensions of spatial distribution included temporality, condition, preference, and ownership, and sub-dimensions of recognition included representation and procedure, and the desire and ability to participate in decision making processes. These dimensions provide a framework for future urban green equity analyses and can help inform public conversations on urban green equity.

AB  - Water is an essential human resource tied to many social and environmental needs and values. Although water has been a focal point of many environmental justice studies, ambient water quality (i.e. water quality before the tap) has been overlooked. This oversight has resulted in only a partial understanding of how water quality may correlate with communities facing environmental justice issues. We analysed data from the US Environmental Protection Agency STOrage and Retrieval (STORET) database and the 2010 US Census to identify poor ambient water quality within non-white and low-income communities across the Southeastern USA using hotspot analysis, ordinary least squares, and geographically weighted regressions. Our analyses indicate that non-white and low-income communities are significantly impacted by copper, lead, and mercury contamination. Race correlates more strongly with poor ambient water quality than do community income levels. The results suggest our approach and analyses are effective for identifying potential environmental justice issues across large spatial scales using a top-down rather than a bottom-up approach.

AB  - Urban agriculture provides a range of ecosystem services (as well as potential disservices). This study examines the spatial extent, physical characteristics, and residents' perceptions of community and private gardens in Detroit, a city that has high potential for agricultural development given its abundant vacant and abandoned land. Despite popular narratives of Detroit as a mecca for urban agriculture, spatial analysis of the city's Lower Eastside (~15 sq. miles) reveals that gardens cover less than 1% of the vacant land and are often an ephemeral form of land use. Interviews indicate that residents plant gardens primarily for the cultural ecosystem services (e. g. social cohesion, community building) they provide and secondarily for provisioning services (i.e. food production). Uncertainty over land tenure, legacy environmental pollutants, unknowns regarding potential ecosystem disservices, and lack of government support and capital investment are the primary obstacles to scaling up urban agriculture in Detroit and other cities and will need to be addressed. To facilitate its expansion, we propose that urban agriculture be framed as a form of multifunctional green infrastructure. We conducted GIS-based analysis to identify suitable parcels for scaling up agriculture in the study area. To maximize the distribution of ecosystem service benefits, our modeling recommends dispersing rather than clustering gardens in the urban landscape. This strategy would provide more benefits to more people while countering the gentrification effects that may occur when cities expand green space.

AB  - This paper explores the political economy of the just transition' to a low carbon economy. The idea of a just transition' increasingly features in policy and political discourse and appeals to the need to ensure that efforts to steer society towards a lower carbon future are underpinned by attention to issues of equity and justice: to those currently without access to reliable energy supplies and living in energy poverty and to those whose livelihoods are affected by and dependent on a fossil fuel economy. To complicate things further this transition has to be made compatible with the pursuit of climate justice' to current and future generations exposed to the social and ecological disruptions produced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Here we seek to identify and analyse the immensely difficult political trade-offs that will characterise collective attempts to enact and realise a just transition. We explore procedural and distributional aspects of energy politics and practice in particular as they relate to the just transition: energy access for those who do not have it; justice for those who work within and are affected by the fossil fuel economy; and attempts to manage the potential contradictions that might flow from pursuing energy and climate justice simultaneously.

This was the backdrop to the COP25 climate change summit which took place in Madrid in December 2019. This paper assesses the outcomes of the meeting and the path towards the critically important meeting in Glasgow at the end of 2020. It analyses and explains the key points of contention over levels of ambition, the rules which should govern global carbon markets and sensitive issues such as loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change. The analysis is situated within a broader geopolitical and economic context of right-wing populism, deepening forms of marketization and financialization of responses to climate change and against a background of a world increasingly feeling the effects of the climate crisis.

AB  - This paper makes a normative argument for the greater strategic utilization of human rights institutions, practices, and discourses by those seeking a robust response to climate change. Bandwagoning between these two regimes is hardly a new thing. The environmental movement has long looked to the human rights movement for ideas and support, and vice versa. Here, we argue that there is potential for even more explicit bandwagoning in ways that will most directly benefit those who are suffering, and will continue to suffer, from climate change's greatest impacts. The human rights framework offers a guide to more effective climate action via two interconnected arenas: a legal arena that provides an established set of tools for climate activists, and a political arena that provides a normative underpinning for a range of judicial and non-judicial actions in support of 'climate justice'. Ultimately, moral and strategic guidance from the human rights movement points the way to a more equitable and enduring climate politics, with fairness at its heart.

AB  - Until recently the environmental protection was focused on well defined issues, such as preservation of wildlife and habitat, pollution, over population. Presently the environmental protection is entering a new phase of activism, that of social justice, as a response to the environmental racism accusations. Today's trend, scientifically proven, regarding this type of politics is to deposit hazardous waste and locate the appropriate facilities for it in areas inhabitted by an ethnic minority. Regarding environmental racism at international level, countries with a well developed industry sector export highly toxic waste to the developing countries. Social, economics, race criteria represent key factors in selecting the storage/deposit location. Most efficient method to find environmental justice is that of combining the strategies and techniques used by activits groups with the political, technical, financtial resources of the key environmental organisations, thus creating an efficient alliance.

Our study identified temporal and spatial variations in asthma hospitalization across the study region and explored the combined effect of exposure to ambient ozone and air toxics on asthma hospitalization. Asthma hospitalization hot spots and clusters were mostly not located on zip codes with reported high quantities of total air releases of chemical pollutants. There was no significant interaction between ambient ozone exposure and toxic air releases relative to asthma hospitalization. The major predictor of asthma hospitalization was season, with hospitalization rate per 10,000 people for asthma being highest in winter period when ozone levels are usually lowest.

AB  - Time and time again, Indigenous people throughout the world are faced with the need to reassert their way of life, and to "buck" political and social systems that continually marginalize their treaty rights. In this article, I explore the role of Indigenous activism at different scales-personal, tribal, and collective-to intervene in key moments to uphold treaty rights and protect Indigenous ways of life. In defending treaty rights, Indigenous peoples have become leaders in the social and environmental justice movement, particularly in relation to climate justice and fishing rights. The article recounts three ethnographies that illustrate how access to rights is wrapped up in geopolitics and the political economy. Highlighting these acts of resilience and leadership in the face of crisis is the central work of this article. The article concludes with a call to fundamentally rethink governance mechanisms and structures, to protect ecological and human health.

AB  - While neo-imperialism is becoming increasingly discussed within academia and by public intellectuals, this paper hypothesises that, due to resource needs of social movement organisations, neo-imperialism is not a major diagnostic frame used by international solidarity organisations in the Global North. We tested this hypothesis by examining diagnostic collective action frames used online by 30 organisations across three solidarity movement issues: climate justice, refugee solidarity and debt relief. While the frame was infrequently used across the organisations, results reveal that those organisations that did utilise the frame with some regularity had constituencies that have suffered from historical forms of imperialism. A qualitative analysis was used to locate the contexts in which the frame was used and the prominence these uses had within the organisations' public broadcasting.

AB  - This paper aims to explore how the principles of participatory action research (PAR) articulate with questions of climate justice. Drawing on three qualitative case studies in Brazil, Fiji and Kenya, the paper explores university institutional capabilities, asking how the principles of mobilising PAR to support transformative outcomes can further climate justice. The paper argues that for participatory action research to become a pathway to build universities' capabilities, key considerations are needed. PAR needs to: (a) move beyond change in individual behaviour to respond to climate change and affect institutional norms, procedures and practices; (b) recognise and partner with marginalised groups whose voice and experiences are at the periphery of climate debate, enabling reciprocal flows of impact and knowledge between universities and wider societies; and (c) foster "relationships of equivalence" with actors within as well as outside university to influence university governance and wider climate-related policy-making processes.

AB  - With increased interest in integrating environmental justice into the process for developing environmental regulations in the United States, analysts and decision makers are confronted with the question of what methods and data can be used to assess disproportionate environmental health impacts. However, as a first step to identifying data and methods, it is important that analysts understand what information on equity impacts is needed for decision making. Such knowledge originates from clearly stated equity objectives and the reflection of those objectives throughout the analytical activities that characterize Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), a process that is traditionally used to inform decision making. The framework proposed in this paper advocates structuring analyses to explicitly provide pre-defined output on equity impacts. Specifically, the proposed framework emphasizes: (a) defining equity objectives for the proposed regulatory action at the onset of the regulatory process, (b) identifying specific and related sub-objectives for key analytical steps in the RIA process, and (c) developing explicit analytical/research questions to assure that stated sub-objectives and objectives are met. In proposing this framework, it is envisioned that information on equity impacts informs decision-making in regulatory development, and that this is achieved through a systematic and consistent approach that assures linkages between stated equity objectives, regulatory analyses, selection of policy options, and the design of compliance and enforcement activities.

AB  - Trees provide important ecosystem services and benefits, with some, such as air pollutant and heat reductions, being linked to improved human health and well-being. The uneven distribution of tree cover in urban areas and subsequently the ecosystem services and benefits it provides has potential implications related to environmental justice, especially if disadvantaged socio-demographic or socio-economic and marginalized communities lack these services and benefits. This study explores the distribution of ecosystem services and benefits provided by tree cover in the Bronx, NY. Utilizing census block group specific spatial datasets, we employ a Mann-Kendall trend test and the Sen slope estimator to describe the relationship between median income, per capita income, percent minorities, population density, poverty percent and total educational attainment, and carbon storage and sequestration, stormwater runoff reduction, air pollutant removal and heat index reduction ecosystem services and benefits for 2010 tree cover conditions. We explore the equality in ecosystem service and benefit distributions across socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroups using the Atkinson inequality and Theil entropy indices decomposed into within and between subgroup inequalities for each ecosystem service and benefit. These inequality indices allow us to better assess current inequalities and work to achieve greater equity in the distribution of ecosystem services. Using population and ecosystem service data, all ecosystem services and benefits appear to be unequally and inequitably distributed in the Bronx, with disadvantaged socio-demographic and socio-economic block groups receiving disproportionately lower ecosystem services from urban trees. The vast majority of the inequality is explained by variations within each socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroup rather than variations between subgroups. To reduce this inequity, efforts should be made to strategically increase services and benefits by initially targeting disadvantaged block groups with extremely low tree cover.

AB  - Water-related disasters have become more unpredictable amidst human-induced climatic and hydroecological changes, with profound effects on people inhabiting fragile river basins. In this article, I analyse drastic waterscape transformations and people's differentiated exposure to water-related vulnerabilities in the Grijalva River lower basin, southeastern Mexico, focusing on how state authority is reinforced through waterscape alterations and how altered waterscapes shape state-making and scalar politics. Examining interlinkages between 1) state-making and governance; 2) resource-making and politics of scale; and 3) hazard-making and the dynamics of socionature, the article contributes to scholarly and development practice discussions on environmental vulnerability. I argue that the goals of consolidating state power and promoting development through massive waterscape changes and resource extractions have provoked hazards that are difficult to control, resulting in differentiated distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. Drawing on archival research, documentary analysis, thematic interviews, and ethnographic fieldwork, the study illustrates the overlapping and cumulative effects of state-making, politics of scale, and the dynamics of socionature on socially differentiated vulnerability. Although the forms of governance shift over time, statecraft as a mode of consolidating state authority and controlling lower basin environments and residents persists. The government prevents social mobilisation through political persuasion and pressure, and disciplines residents to adapt to altered waterscapes, while allowing few changes in prevalent power structures. Simultaneously, the study demonstrates that water cannot be controlled by political rules and requisites, while local residents reinterpret dominant ways of governing through claim-making, negotiation, everyday resistance, and situational improvisation, albeit within unequal power relations. The study enhances understanding of water-related vulnerabilities resulting from recurrent, yet temporally remoulded agendas of state-making combined with socially differentiating politics of scaling and the dynamics of socionature, which altogether reformulate human-nonhuman interactions and make local smallholders and pen-urban poor increasingly vulnerable to floods.

AB  - This paper presents a collaboration between the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM) and a community to establish Puerto Rico's first solar community in the southern part of the Island. This community-university collaboration is leveraging on well-organized community leadership and their efforts towards community self-reliance. Electrical engineering capstone design projects have been used as the cornerstone for the technological aspects of the collaboration. The community had initially planned to expand its community center building to provide more services to residents. Their initial idea of including a solar power system was expanded with help from UPRM researchers, to a solar community initiative. Using the community center as the spearhead for the initiative, and going beyond technology, the solar community project combines citizen empowerment, technology, social and environmental justice to yield sustainable energy and energy self-reliance.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of 'new nature writing' - a literary genre currently popular in the UK - as a kind of arts activism, in particular in terms of how it might engage with the environmental crisis and lead to a kind of collective politics. We note the limitations of the genre, notably the reproduction of class, gender and ethnic hierarchies, the emphasis on nostalgia and loss, and the stress on individual responses rather than collective politics. But we also take seriously the claims of art to enable us to imagine other futures, suggesting that new nature writing has the potential to play a role in collective forms of environmental justice and capabilities.

AB  - This study explores the combined effect of lead (Pb) exposure and an index of chronic physiological stress on cardiovascular disease mortality using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2008 linked to 1999-2014 National Death Index data. Chronic physiological stress was measured using the allostatic load (AL) index, which was formed by analyzing markers from the cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic systems, with Pb levels, assessed using blood lead levels (BLL). The dataset was analyzed with statistical techniques to explore (a) the relationship between Pb exposure and AL, and (b) the combined role of Pb and AL on cardiovascular disease mortality. Results indicated that AL was more elevated in those with BLLs above the 50th percentile in the US population and that those with elevated AL were more likely to have high BLL. Finally, the interaction of AL and BLL significantly increased the likelihood of cardiovascular disease mortality. These findings highlight the need for considering the totality of exposures experienced by populations to build holistic programs to prevent Pb exposure and reduce stressors to promote optimal health outcomes and reduce cardiovascular mortality risk.

AB  - Toxic waste is chemical compounds that, when ingested or inhaled, can cause physiological impairment and, in extreme cases, death. It is also known for its detrimental effect on the environment when disposed of in an unsafe manner. Yet, countries in the Gulf of Guinea continue to be targeted by Western waste-brokers notwithstanding the existence of laws prohibiting the transboundary disposal of such materials. There is also a rise in the export of electronic waste (e-waste) from developed countries to countries in the region, purportedly as reusable electronics, much of which ends up in landfills. The primitive recycling techniques of this e-waste undermines the health of the local populations and their environment due to inadequate care of the heavy metal and toxin content. Drawing on examples from Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana, this paper argues that toxic waste dumping in the Gulf of Guinea amounts to environmental racism. The article makes recommendations relating to the challenges of toxic waste dumping in the Gulf of Guinea, including the need for countries to implement the provisions of the Basel and Bamako conventions in their entirety, recognise acts of environmental racism as violations of human rights, and for young people to rise to the occasion as 'agents of change'.

AB  - With specific focus on two environmental regimes (the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and the Climate Change Convention), this paper seeks to indicate the prospects and limitations of the aspirations for distributive justice by the political South within the context of sustainability in general, and the institutions for global environmental governance in particular. It is argued that while these aspirations have produced important normative shifts in the rule-structure of global environmental management, they have not proved momentous enough to generate policies outside of what the prevailing neoliberal socio-economic regime might permit. Hence, although the texts of global environmental agreements accommodate concepts that express egalitarian notions of justice, core policies remain firmly rooted in market-based neoliberal interpretations of justice, which mainly serve to sustain the status quo.

AB  - With a focus on key themes and debates, this article aims to illustrate and assess how the interaction between justice and politics has shaped the international regime and defined the nature of the international agreement that was signed in COP21 Paris. The work demonstrates that despite the rise of neo-conservatism and self-interested power politics, questions of global distributive justice remain a central aspect of the international politics of climate change. However, while it is relatively easy to demonstrate that international climate politics is not beyond the reach of moral contestations, the assessment of exactly how much impact justice has on climate policies and the broader normative structures of the climate governance regime remains a very difficult task. As the world digests the Paris Agreement, it is vital that the current state of justice issues within the international climate change regime is comprehensively understood by scholars of climate justice and by academics and practitioners, not least because how these intractable issues of justice are dealt with (or not) will be a crucial factor in determining the effectiveness of the emerging climate regime.

AB  - Understanding differential disease susceptibility requires new tools to quantify the cumulative effects of environmental stress. Evidence suggests that social, physical, and chemical stressors can influence disease through the accumulation of epigenetic modifications. Geographically stable epigenetic alterations could identify plausible mechanisms for health disparities among the disadvantaged and poor. Relations between neighborhoodspecific epigenetic markers and disease would identify the most appropriate targets for medical and environmental intervention. Complex interactions among genes, the environment, and disease require the examination of how epigenetic changes regulate susceptibility to environmental stressors. Progress in understanding disparities in disease susceptibility may depend on assessing the cumulative effect of environmental stressors on genetic substrates. We highlight key concepts regarding the interface between environmental stress, epigenetics, and chronic disease.

In the field of the campaign, circumstantial activists learn to think critically about the environment, they learn informally and incidentally, through socialization with experienced activists from and through nonformal workshops provided by the Environmental Nongovernment Organization Friends of the Earth. This article uses Bourdieu's "theory of practice," to explore the mobilization of activists within the Lock the Gate Alliance field and the practices which generate knowledge and facilitate adult learning. These practices have enabled a diverse movement to educate the public and citizenry about the serious threat fracking poses to the environment, to their land and water supply. The movements successful practices have won a landmark moratorium on fracking for coal seam gas in the State of Victoria.

The framework is applied to assess spatial equity regarding the accessibility of individuals and social groups to urban parks in the city of Tel Aviv. Availability of house-level data was found to be essential for identifying differential accessibility of social groups according to income and national-ethnic identity as well as for evaluating the validity of accessibility assessments based on traditional aggregated measurement at the administrative district level. Also discussed are data usability issues arising when employing local-scale geo-referenced census data, including the potential effect on decisions regarding allocation of local urban services as well as spatial equity practice and discourse.

AB  - Working with local level actors to enable country ownership is applauded within the multilateral climate finance landscape. However, are emerging adaptation interventions equitable by reflecting the priorities of local level vulnerable populations? This research sought to find out whether the engagement of local institutions in projects that seek to achieve country ownership enabled local level vulnerable groups to participate in and influence adaptation decision-making processes and outcomes, thereby enabling them to have a voice in local level adaptation. It used a case study of a Global Environmental Facility-managed coastal adaptation project in Tanzania, which sought to restore and protect mangroves to enable adaptation to sea level rise. Data was generated from 13 Focus Group Discussions and survey questionnaires administered to 629 individuals in three locations on the mainland of Tanzania and in Zanzibar. The findings indicate that community-based organizations were used to facilitate the implementation of project activities at the community level. However, participation spaces created in the project and facilitated by these local institutions were exclusionary and failed to enable vulnerable community groups to have a voice on mangrove restoration and protection. Use of these local institutions altered local level power relations and disempowered other pre-existing and (in)formal local resource management institutions. Community members questioned legitimacy of actions implemented by these local institutions. These findings suggest that working with local level stakeholders to generate country ownership does not automatically guarantee that actions will address the needs of local vulnerable groups. Multilateral climate finance institutions should acknowledge these risks and implement measures to address them.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of an environmental justice (EJ) program adopted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) as a part of its regulation to phase out a toxic chemical used by dry cleaners. SCAQMD provided financial incentives to switch early and gave establishments in EJ neighborhoods priority in applying for grants. Despite this pro-EJ policy, available data show that dry cleaners in low-income, predominantly minority, and EJ-designated areas were less likely to be an early adopter of green technologies, and this finding holds even after accounting for firm and market characteristics. Dry cleaners in disadvantaged neighborhoods were also less likely to receive a grant to switch technology despite the district's effort to set aside half of the funding for applicants from EJ areas.

AB  - This study documents the response of 6500 rural households in a 25 km(2) area of Bangladesh to interventions intended to reduce their exposure to arsenic contained in well water. The interventions included public education, posting test results for arsenic on the wells, and installing 50 community wells. Sixty-five percent of respondents from the subset of 3410 unsafe wells changed their source of drinking water, often to new and untested wells. Only 15% of respondents from the subset of safe wells changed their source, indicating that health concerns motivated the changes. The geo-referenced data indicate that distance to the nearest safe well also influenced household responses. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To explore the way that international law can unintentionally work against the guaranteeing of the rights of indigenous people, the paper provides an initial assessment of the way that the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and ILO principles concerning health and safety (OHS) combine to produce unwelcome and unintended consequences. The analysis seeks to show why contemporary international environmental law relegates the rights of indigenous people, and in doing so looks at how the CBD created internationally accepted rules for resource exploitation, and which, although it envisaged possible threats and human rights violations for indigenous peoples, nevertheless failed to secure measures for protecting indigenous peoples from potential violations. In light of this, the paper reviews the commitments by actors, towards indigenous people; within the auspices of CBD, and contextually ILO treaties that deal with OHS, to assess whether the systems for ensuring that the ideals of the CBD 'trickle down' to operate effectively and equitably. By providing an initial assessment of this process, the analysis starts to provide a framework for answering whether such regimes actually solve the environmental challenges facing indigenous people, and whether they promote environmental justice at the grassroots level. Questions for further analysis are identified, and the need for a more substantial piece of research to answer the questions posed, is proposed.

AB  - Today the terms sustainable development and sustainable innovation are often used. But what is meant by these terms, other than that they in some ways are connected to the terms 'green' and 'ecological' seen in a long-term perspective? How, in turn, are sustainable innovations developed? Studying the literature on the topic leads to the conclusion that there is no precise or established definition of sustainable innovation, sustainability and sustainable development. A conclusion in the paper is that we now need to focus on how to develop new sustainable innovations, and for these, product development is the most important element. It has been found that Dynamic Product Development (DPD (TM)) is a model that satisfies the different definitions on sustainability that have been proposed. The result of a product development project is based on the product developer's knowledge, experience and ability. The leadership of an entrepreneur (or intrapreneur) is also important for the level of sustainability of an innovation that is achieved. Therefore, the product developers and entrepreneurs need to be educated in a broader perspective than is common in the technical field today. The product developers must also be monitored in the actual work situation to ensure that new products that are not sustainable are not being marketed. This, in turn, calls for a similar, broader perspective in management education. To describe what a sustainable innovation is and how it is developed, the following definitions are proposed: a sustainable solution is a solution that has been developed to be a long-lasting, environmentally responsible solution for the provider (the business), the society and also the users; an innovation is a new solution that has been 'sold' and is used by more than one user or that is used in at least one-use situation; the innovation process, done as an innovation project, contains all of the stages from idea generation, development (R&D) and commercialization to an implemented solution on the market.

AB  - This Article takes up the increasingly important land use question of siting for renewable energy. As concern over climate change grows, new policies are being crafted at all levels of government to support renewable energy as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These policies are driving the need to site and construct new power plants that will utilize renewable resources. Historically, power plant siting has been the province of state and local governments, so the regulatory context into which renewables are being integrated varies, sometimes significantly, jurisdiction by jurisdiction. To examine this regulatory context, this Article focuses on Florida, a state which consumes the third-most electricity in the United States but Which generates less than 2 percent of that electricity from renewable resources. The Article first provides an overview of Florida's power supply sector and sets out the existing regulatory context for terrestrial siting of energy facilities. It then situates Florida's most promising renewable resources within that context, identifies regulatory barriers that implicate siting, and considers the siting issues unique to each resource. As the article explains, we now have a window of opportunity in which state and local governments can plan for and guide renewable energy siting an approach that contrasts with utility-driven planning and siting that has long been standard practice.

AB  - This paper presents a conceptual link among green marketing, environmental justice, and industrial ecology. It argues for greater awareness of environmental justice in the practice of green marketing. In contrast with the type of costs commonly discussed in the literature, the paper identified another type of costs, termed "costs with positive results," that may be associated with the presence of environmental justice in green marketing. A research agenda is finally suggested to determine consumers' awareness of environmental justice, and their willingness to bear the costs associated with it.

AB  - Using an activist-orientated dataset (the EJAtlas) of place-based mining resistances, we conduct a statistical analysis of 346 mining conflicts around the world to better understand patterns and conditions associated with activist perceptions of environmental justice (EJ) in mining conflicts. Our study uses a large set of variables, including location, project and conflict characteristics, impacts and resistance attributes. The results show that controlling for other factors, conflict intensity, timing of mobilisation, the centrality of the company in the network, conflict events, project status and the presence of international financial organisations are significant correlates of perceived EJ success. We find that mobilising during the prevention stage, and high-intensity reactions, as well as the ability to halt a project, are positively associated with perceived EJ success. In turn, the intensity of the mobilisation relates to immediate potential socio-economic and environmental impacts, and the presence of excluded and marginalised groups, whereas stopping a project relates to the timing of mobilisation and institutional contexts. We discuss these findings in the light of the literature on political ecology and social movements. We hope that our analysis will help those who seek evidence-based support for EJ activism and prompt further enquiry on mining politics in the world.

AB  - With the adoption of the Warsaw International Mechanism in 2013, the international community recognised that anthropogenic climate change will result in a range of adverse effects despite policies of mitigation and adaptation. Addressing these climatic losses and damages' is now a key dimension of international climate change negotiations. This article presents a normative framework for thinking about loss and damage designed to inform, and give meaning to, these negotiations. It argues that policies addressing loss and damage, particularly those targeting developing countries, should respect norms of compensatory justice which aim to make victims of unwarranted climatic disruptions whole again'. The article develops a typology of different kinds of climate change disruption and uses it to (1) explain the differences between losses' and damages', (2) assign priorities among compensatory measures seeking to address loss and damage and (3) explore a range of equitable responses to loss and damage.

AB  - While increasing urbanization intensifies the need for ecological restoration in densely populated areas, projects implemented in urban settings are often beset with conflicts stemming from a mismatch between traditional restoration practices and social realities. As ecological restoration practitioners seek to protect and remediate urban ecosystems, I contend that the broad set of principles developed by the environmental justice movement can provide an excellent conceptual framework for integrating social ecologies into restoration plans. Successful integration is constrained, however, by a number of challenges both within the Principles of Environmental Justice and ecological restoration theory and practice. Using a case study of New York City's Green Guerillas community gardening program, I show how the principles can begin to be operationalized to provide an effective grounding methodology for the design, development, and implementation of urban restoration projects.

AB  - Urban greenways have received significant attention due to their many publicized benefits and costs that make them contentious recreational developments. Most prior studies have approached urban greenways from a demand-side perspective solely focused on their users. This study adds to the literature by taking a supply-side approach to assessing resident attitudes towards greenways and using these attitudes to predict support for greenways. Building off of Weber's theory of formal and substantive rationality and social exchange theory, resident support for the Atlanta BeltLine is posited to be a function of different extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsically, it is hypothesized support for the BeltLine is a function of residents' frequency of use and their perceptions of how the greenway trail generates economic benefits within their neighborhood. Intrinsically, it is hypothesized resident support for the BeltLine is a function of how the BeltLine psychologically, socially, and politically empowers or disempowers residents. To test these hypotheses, surveys were distributed across three neighborhoods adjacent to portions of the Atlanta BeltLine using door-to-door systematic census-guided random sampling. The 568 usable surveys (60% response rate) were entered into SPSS' AMOS and used to assess both the construct validity and predictive validity of the measures. The model explained 62% of the variance in support for the Atlanta BeltLine with four of the five antecedents being significant. Implications suggest that support for greenways is more than just a function of frequency of use, but a complicated mix of use and perceptions of the trail's economic benefits and empowerment.

AB  - This chapter introduces the section of Linking Ecology and Ethics for a Changing World on Ethics, Epistemology and Justice, three of the major concerns of environmental philosophy. It provides an overview of the chapters that constitute this section by Palmer, Longino, Hayward, Northcott, Eliot, and Mallory and picks out important themes that link these chapters. In particular, this chapter focuses on questions of scientific knowledge, the role values play in science (as discussed in Longino's paper) and what kinds of things in the environment might be thought of as being valuable (discussed in Palmer's and Eliot's papers). The chapter also provides an outline of different approaches to global environmental justice as developed by Hayward, Northcott and Mallory. Hayward focuses on the idea of 'ecological space', Northcott on climate injustice, and Mallory on the importance of recognizing issues of gender and race in any discussion of environmental justice.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of some key, and contrasting, ideas in environmental ethics for those unfamiliar with the field. It outlines the ways in which environmental ethicists have defended different positions concerning what matters ethically, from those that focus on human beings (including issues of environmental justice and justice between generations) to those who argue that non-human animals, living organisms, ecosystems and species have some kind of moral status. The chapter also considers different theoretical approaches to environmental ethics in terms of consequentialist, broadly deontological and virtue theories. Finally, three different interpretations of moral pluralism in environmental ethics are introduced: pluralism about values, pluralism about theories, and a pragmatic, methodological pluralism.

Yet, the diversity in understandings of the interconnections between cities and nature is the starting point for our research interest. This volume contains nine thoroughly refereed contributions concerning a wide range of topics in landscape architecture and urban green infrastructure. While some papers attempt to conceptualize the relation further, others clearly have an empirical focus. Thereby, this special issue provides a rich body of work, and will act as a starting point for further studies on biophilic urbanism and integrative policies, such as the sustainable development goals of the United Nations.

AB  - This study examines whether the level of community accessibility to green spaces varies as a function of socioeconomic factors, focusing on three underexplored aspects affecting green inequity assessment implications of alternative green measures, spatial non-stationarity of socioeconomic impacts, and regional/local context. Using six green measures involving general greenness, tree canopy, developed open space, agricultural lands, parks, green trails, golf courses and sports fields, Geographically Weighted Regression models are developed, and coefficient surfaces are created and compared over two metropolitan areas, Columbus and Atlanta. Second-order effects among individual factors are tested to explore synergistic linkages among them. The results show that the identified patterns of green access inequity vary significantly with the selected green measure. In both metropolitan areas, access to parks, green trails, golf and sports fields turns out to be spatially independent from general greenness and tree canopies. GWR coefficient surfaces show that the socioeconomic-green relationships are spatially heterogeneous and context-dependent, affected by a complex web of forces, including urban heritage, racial and lifestyle diversity, and natural landscape. While natural landscape and income have greater effects in Columbus, racial disparity is dominant in Atlanta. Income-driven disparities are most visible in inner suburban areas and tend to abate in the urban core and exurbs. Urban greening programs need to diversify in terms of green type and location to address localized deficits over a wide urban spectrum.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of spatiotemporal distributions of racial groups on disparities in exposure to traffic-related air pollution by considering people's daily movement patterns. Due to human mobility, a residential neighborhood does not fully represent the true geographic context in which people experience racial segregation and unequal exposure to air pollution. Using travel-activity survey data containing individuals' activity locations and time spent at each location, this study measures segregation levels that an individual might experience during the daytime and nighttime, estimates personal exposure by integrating hourly pollution maps and the survey data, and examines the association between daytime/nighttime segregation and exposure levels. The proximity of each activity location to major roads is also evaluated to further examine the unequal exposure. The results reveal that people are more integrated for work in high-traffic areas, which contributes to similarly high levels of exposure for all racial groups during the daytime. However, white people benefit from living in suburbs/exurbs away from busy roads. The finding suggests that policies for building an extensive and equitable public transit system should be implemented together with the policies for residential mixes among racial groups to reduce everyone's exposure to traffic-related air pollution and achieve environmental justice.

AB  - We develop and apply a systematic review methodology to identify and understand how the peer-reviewed literature characterises Indigenous peoples' involvement in marine governance and management approaches in terms of equity and justice worldwide. We reviewed the peer-reviewed English-language research articles between January 2015 and September 2020 for examples of Indigenous peoples' involvement in marine governance and management using the analytical lens of environmental justice. The majority of research studies highlighted that Indigenous peoples experienced some form of environmental injustice linked to existing marine governance and management, most notably in the context of inequitable decision-making procedures surrounding the establishment and operation of marine protected areas. However, there are significant gaps in the current literature, including a notable absence of studies exploring Indigenous women and other gender minorities' involvement in marine planning and management and the limited number of studies about Indigenous peoples living throughout Asia, the Arctic, Russia, and Africa. More studies are needed to explore collaborative and intersectional approaches, including co-governance and co-management and ecosystem-based management, and critically evaluate what constitutes inclusive, equitable, and just marine governance and management processes, practices, and outcomes for different Indigenous peoples occupying diverse social-ecological systems.

Given that African peoples globally suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation as well as the role that the burgeoning "Green Jobs" sector could have in engendering job growth in the Black community, the environment should play a role in Africana Studies programs and research. This article showcases the absence of an environmental focus in both Black scholarly research and Africana Studies programs-and other academic programs-across the country. Given the important role that the environment plays in the Black community and could continue to play in the near future, this article advocates for the necessity of an environmental focus within the field of Africana Studies.

AB  - This study investigated variations in perceptions of air quality as a function of residential proximity to busy highways, across two suburbs of South Auckland, New Zealand. While plenty is known about the spatial gradients of highway emissions, very little is known about variation of lay understanding at the fine spatial scale and whether there are gradients in severity of concerns. One-hundred and four near-highway residents agreed to participate in a semi-structured interview on their knowledge and attitudes towards highway traffic emissions. Proximity to the highway edge varied within 5-380 in at the predominantly downwind side of the highway and 13-483 m at the upwind side. Likert-type ordered response questions were analysed using multivariate regression. Inverse linear relationships were identified for distance from highway and measures of concern for health impacts, as well as for noise (p < 0.05). Positive linear relationships were identified for distance from highway and ratings of both outdoor and indoor air quality (p < 0.05). Measures of level of income had no conclusive statistically significant effect on perceptions. Additional discussion was made surrounding participant's open-ended responses, within the context of limited international research. Findings indicate that there may be quantifiable psychological benefits of separating residents just a short distance (40 m+) from highways and that living within such close proximity can be detrimental to wellbeing by restricting local outdoor activity. This work lends additional rationale for a residential separation buffer of 100 m alongside major highways in the interests of protecting human health. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Understanding persistent and increasing spatial inequalities in health is an important field of academic enquiry for geographers, epidemiologists and public health researchers. Delivering robust explanations for the growing spatial divide in health offers potential for improving health outcomes across the social spectrum, but particularly among disadvantaged groups. One potential driver for the increasing geographical differences in health is the disparity in exposure to key characteristics of the physical environment that are either health promoting or health damaging. While the framework of 'environmental justice' has long been used to consider whether disadvantaged groups bear a disproportionate burden of environmental disamenities, perhaps surprisingly, the research fields of environmental justice and health inequalities have remained largely separate realms. In this paper we examine the confluence of environmental characteristics that potentially function as key mechanisms to account for the socio-economic gradient in health outcomes in the UK. We developed the Multiple Environmental Deprivation Index (MEDIx), an area-based measure that represented the multiple dimensions of health-related environmental disamenities for census wards across the UK. By comparing the index to an area measure of income deprivation, we found that, at the national level, multiple environmental deprivation increased as the degree of income deprivation rose. Using mortality records we also found that MEDIx had an effect on health that remained after taking into account the age, sex and socio-economic profile of each area. Area-level health progressively worsened as the multiple environmental deprivation increased. However, this effect was most pronounced in least income-deprived areas. Our findings emphasise the importance of the physical environment in shaping health, and the need to consider the social and political processes that lead to income-deprived populations bearing a disproportionate burden of multiple environmental deprivation. Future research should simultaneously consider the 'triple jeopardy' of social, health and environmental inequalities.

AB  - This paper analyzes environmental gentrification (EG), or the exclusion, marginalization, and displacement of long-term residents associated with sustainability planning or green developments and amenities, such as smart growth, public park renovations, and healthy food stores. We consider how activists, communities, and urban planners address these unjust processes and outcomes associated with EG and how these strategies compare to those used by environmental justice (EJ) activists. Our evaluation of relevant literature indicates several similarities with EJ resistance tactics, including collective neighborhood action, community organizing, and direct tactics. We also identify several different strategies enabled by certain urban environmental conditions, such as leveraging environmental policies and taking an active role in neighborhood redevelopment planning processes, collaborating with 'gentrifiers,' and creating complementary policies to manage displacement and exclusion. Our analysis indicates a need for more research on how activists can better assert the social and political dimensions of sustainability and their right to the city, and how green and sustainable cities can achieve justice and equity.

AB  - This paper is a study of an emerging environmental decision-making model that attempts to move beyond traditionally adversarial approaches toward "consensus building." Consensus-based decision making ostensibly allows activists equal power with industrialists and state actors in environmental policy-making. This research builds upon the growing literature on frame-analysis by demonstrating that there are instances when challengers actually engage in collaborative framing with their adversaries. This does not presume that activists reject oppositional framing altogether In these cases, environmentalists actually draw on a mixture of confrontation and negotiation in this innovative form of collective action that positions them in contexts most environmentalists never experience-a place at the decision-making table with elites. This study reveals that environmentalists are becoming more sophisticated in their efforts to protect local communities and natural resources.

AB  - Using general loglinear analysis and GIS spatial analysis, we evaluated the socio-economic inequities in exposure to SO2 in the urban and rural areas at census scale. The results show that differences of exposure inequities among socioeconomic groups exist in the urban and rural areas. Further studies are needed to analyze the impacts of scales and statistical methods on the accuracy of air pollution exposure justice assessment.

AB  - While prisons are often seen as locally undesirable land uses (LULUs), nuance and historical analysis is needed to understand why this is not the case for all places, as well as why many of these "sites of acceptance" are layered upon legacies of resource extraction and environmental degradation. Central Appalachia has seen a shift from coalfields to prisonfields in the past three decades as policymakers turn to the incarceration industry to stem unemployment and depopulation as coal mining declines. Using the conceptual lens of trash, I contend that the literal trashing of the ecosystems of this region has been fostered by the metaphorical representation of Appalachians as "white trash." In turn, the space is now viewed as a logical location for the deposition of "societal castoffs" in the form of prisoners.

AB  - To complement a recent flush of research on transnational environmental justice movements, we sought a deeper organizational history of what we understand as the contemporary environmental justice movement in the United States. We thus conducted in-depth interviews with 31 prominent environmental justice activists, scholars, and community leaders across the US. Today's environmental justice groups have transitioned from specific local efforts to broader national and global mandates, and more sophisticated political, technological, and activist strategies. One of the most significant transformations has been the number of groups adopting formal legal status, and emerging as registered environmental justice organizations (REJOs) within complex partnerships. This article focuses on the emergence of REJOs, and describes the respondents' views about the implications of this for more local grassroots groups. It reveals a central irony animating work across groups in today's movement: legal formalization of many environmental justice organizations has made the movement increasingly internally differentiated, dynamic, and networked, even as the passage of actual national laws on environmental justice has proven elusive.

AB  - This study examines the sociodemographic characteristics of people living near industrial sources of air pollution in three areas of the United States: (1) the Kanawha Valley in West Virginia; (2) the Baton Rouge-New Orleans corridor in Louisiana; and (3) the greater Baltimore metropolitan area in Maryland. Using data from the 1990 Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and the 1990 Census, we analyze relationships between variables assumed to be independent, such as location of single or multiple industrial emission sources, and the dependent variables of race (black/white) and poverty status (above/below poverty level). Results from all three study areas are consistent and indicate that African Americans and those living in households defined to be below the established poverty level are more likely, on average, to live closer to the nearest TRI facility and to live within 2 miles of multiple TRI facilities. Conversely, whites and those living in households above the poverty level are more likely, on average, to live farther from the nearest TRI facility and to live within 2 miles of fewer facilities, compared to African Americans and poor people.

AB  - This study builds on earlier work investigating statistical relationships between sociodemographic characteristics of populations and their residential proximity to industrial sources of air pollution. The analysis uses demographic data from the 1990 U.S. Census and industrial site data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s 1990 Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). The focus is on examining interactions among race (African Americans and Whites), poverty (above and below household poverty threshold), and age (children from birth to 5 years of age and elderly people 65 years old or older). Results from three different study areas (Kanawha Valley in West Virginia, the Baton Rouge-New Orleans Corridor in Louisiana, and the greater Baltimore metropolitan area in Maryland) suggest: there are important interactions among race, poverty, and age that are likely to have consequential ramifications for efforts aimed at investigating issues related to environmental justice. Our results indicate that a substantial proportion of all demographic groups studied live within a mile of the nearest facility, with values ranging from 22% of Whites above poverty in the Baton Rouge-New Orleans Corridor to 60% of African Americans below poverty in Baltimore. Likewise, a substantial proportion of all demographic groups also live within 2 miles of four or more industrial facilities, with values ranging from 16% for Whites above poverty in the Corridor to 70% for African Americans below poverty in Baltimore. In all three study areas, African Americans were more likely than Whites to (1) live in households with incomes below the household poverty line, (2) have children 5 years of age or younger, (3) live closer to the nearest industrial emissions source, and (4) live within 2 miles of multiple industrial emission sources. Findings indicate that, compared with White children, a substantially higher proportion of African-American children 5 years of age or younger lived in poor households that were located in relatively close proximity to one or more industrial sources of air pollution.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between mining, memory and environmental suffering on the Bolivian Altiplano (Andean plateau). Mining activity has had a long and well documented role in transforming landscapes throughout the Andean region, and Bolivia provides some of South America's starkest examples of mine-related water and soil contamination. In Bolivia, mining is publicly memorialised as central to the collective national experience, and public murals and monuments help construct a national identity as a pais minero (mining country). Memory is similarly important, though less public, for populations impacted by mine-related pollution and their demands for remediation and reparation. In discussing these conditions, residents of the region draw on memories of past landscapes and waterscapes, which they often represent as verdant and bountiful. Such memory narratives are less important for what they tell us about the former landscapes - which were likely less pristine than reported - than what they tell us about contemporary conditions. Drawing on ethnographic research, I argue that memory - as represented in stories told about past experience - necessarily requires selective remembering and selective forgetting, and may function as a political and ideological resource in its own right. In this sense, memory can be mobilised in various forms and at a range of scales, from the individual to the national. As a representation of the past, memory is always also a representation of the present, and a reflection of contemporary realities, which in turn informs political demands. The paper ends by considering the potential and limitations of memory as a conceptual tool for envisioning environmentally just futures.

AB  - This special issue of Social Problems provides an interdisciplinary look at the relationship of class, ethnicity, gender, and race to community and workplace environmental problems. Drawing upon case studies, interviews, textual analysis, survey research, and household, community, labor force, and policy data, these articles represent a methodologically eclectic approach to the interpretation of environmental issues as problems of justice in a stratified society. While the disparate impact of social problems on minorities, women, and the poor has long been a central concern in sociology, few sociologists have focused their attention on the environment. A growing public awareness of pollution, toxic exposures, and resource limits has produced new social movements with implications for social theory and practice. A dialogue on environmental justice is emerging in community groups and in the network of national and international organizations which support them. This suggests the need for a parallel dialogue within the community of academics.

AB  - Warren County, NC, is the birthplace of the environmental justice movement. This study argues that the discursive efforts of Warren County residents have, in Farrell's words, "critically interrupted" two stories that frame their ongoing environmental struggle. By examining the inventional resources communities possess, I conclude, rhetorical scholars more fully may appreciate the ways in which citizen groups are able to reframe the narratives that sustain oppressive environmental conditions. This investigation challenges the referent of Warren County as solely an "origin," offers insights into evaluating the "success" of a movement, and encourages environmental communication scholars to further explore environmental justice.

AB  - This essay offers a narrative of rhetorical field methods and intertwined climate justice exigencies. We argue the emergence of and resistance toward rhetorical field methods responds to a growing ecological consciousness, reflecting a changing understanding of the relationship between human agency and the planet. Drawing upon fieldwork from our own research and other scholars in the field, we organize our argument in three related themes: culture, interconnection, and voice. Given the expansive objects, people, and practices rhetorical field methods engage, this approach offers one compelling way to listen to and amplify marginalized voices. Overall, this essay explores how rhetorical field methods have provided and might further offer a compelling set of principles and practices for resisting structures of ecological and social precarity for life on Earth.

AB  - Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin. This law underpins federal regulations and policies collectively referred to under the label "environmental justice." Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), which receive federal funds for transportation planning, must demonstrate that their plans and programs comply with environmental justice expectations. The Southern California Association of Governments, an MPO in Los Angeles and the largest MPO in the United States, employed a number of new analytical techniques to assess the distribution of benefits and burdens of its 2001 Regional Transportation Plan, a 25-year blueprint for regional transportation investments. In general, the analysis showed that the plan would not cause inequitable distributions of benefits or burdens for minority or low-income residents of the region. A disproportionate aviation noise burden was identified in the analysis and influenced regional policy makers to pursue a distributed regional aviation policy to minimize this and related aviation impacts.

AB  - Urban ecology began as a biological science practised within cities. As such, it sought out forests, abandoned or undeveloped land, meadows and surface waters as analogues of the places outside of cities where ecologists had worked for decades. In 1997, the call for proposals by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) programme for urban research sites required integration of biological and physical structures and processes with social structures and processes. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study, referred to as BES, was one of the two successful responses to that call, and thus worked along with the Central Arizona Phoenix LTER to craft a new, integrated approach to the understanding of urban ecological systems. The conceptual and visionary framework to support this integration is termed 'ecology of the city', which for North America is a new kind of social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) research. The ecology of the city has required BES to establish interactions across disciplinary boundaries, linking with sociology, geography, anthropology, economics, engineering, climatology, public health and urban design. Furthermore, to meet the challenges of the region in which the project is embedded, BES has had to become transdisciplinary, that is to move beyond the scope of individual or even linked scientific disciplines. Transdisciplinary research engages with communities, non-governmental organizations and people from federal, state, county and city governments to answer questions that are of interest to science, while at the same time addressing needs of society. As a result, BES exemplifies growth beyond the traditional disciplinary focus of ecology on biological habitats within urban areas. That growth first linked various social, biological and physical science disciplines and, ultimately, was integrated with policy, management and design concerns. We trace the development of BES to illustrate integrative science and practice.

AB  - What is a hilly city, and which cities are hilliest? This study outlines a basket of methods for quantifying the differential hilliness of U.S. cities. We rank the 100 largest cities in the contiguous United States, using a selection of eight methods to evaluate their comparative hilliness. We then reflect on how four key modes of encounter with terrain shape human perceptions of urban hilliness: visual, pedestrian, automotive, and imagined/conceptual. Varying priorities among these different modes of encounter shape which of our indices may best correlate with lay understandings of urban hilliness or particular policy problems. We conclude with implications of this work for contemporary geographic scholarship and suggestions for further research, particularly with regard to the political and economic effects of hilliness.

AB  - This chapter is a critical analysis of the role that social media plays enforcing environmental justice around the world. It particularly examines how social media has been used internationally to foster Greenpeace International's actions to enforce environmental justice and compliance in three selected countries, namely India, Canada and Russia. The cases examined are a.) the Essar Ltd.'s coal mine project in the Mahan Forests in India; b.) Prirazlomnaya Oil Company's offshore drilling in the Artic Sea, and c.) Resolute Forests Products' mining in the Boreal Forest in Canada. The paper concludes that social media can be used to promote and foster environmental justice globally.

AB  - With awareness of multiple identities and controversies associated with labelling people, this article assesses how policy-oriented reports are building the case for greater recognition and participation of groups often labelled as 'the most vulnerable' to climate change. Similar to how Tanner and Mitchell (this IDS Bulletin, 'Entrenchment or Enhacement') have identified opportunities to reduce the poverty of different groupings through climate change adaptation, this article explores the contribution of emerging literature differentiated by gender, ethnicity, age and physical disability to realising concepts of 'climate justice' and 'rights to adaptation'. It considers the rights-based and instrumental approaches being taken by those documenting the experiences, responses and rights of these groups to participation' in climate change adaptation at different scales. This analysis is essential to identifying how marginalised groups can influence climate policy in a period of breakneck negotiations, as well as understanding how emerging policy processes can be seized as opportunities for shifting power relations, reducing vulnerabilities and preventing mal-adaptation.

AB  - This article suggests the need for a new "green" and "Earth-based" reassessment of the work of Booker Taliafaro Washington. Although it includes global and national perspectives, the African American community of South Central Los Angeles will provide the primary perspective. A general societal overreliance on petroleum-based chemicals has worked to the long-term environmental detriment of the African American community there. This article draws upon the works of four key environmental activists: Benjamin Chavis Muhammad, Robert Bullard, Van Jones, and Majora Carter. Working across a range of academic disciplines, the authors integrate contemporary "diagnostic" concepts of community health and environmental justice with older "prescriptive" concepts of employment in the primary trades and community self-reliance. The authors suggest that these old "Bookerite" concepts merit reconsideration, reframing, and re-messaging. The life's work of Washington has therefore been recast here, in light of its newfound green relevance for the African American community, today.

AB  - Urban stormwater systems traditionally used "grey" infrastructure to manage runoff. Contemporary designs now incorporate "green" infrastructure, which offers additional potential benefits such as urban amenities and health. Understanding how green and grey infrastructure investments are distributed across urban areas is important for new goals of promoting environmental justice in planning. In California, for instance, public investments increasingly require a percentage of funds to be spent in disadvantaged communities. Recent advancements in the availability of high-detail geographic data in cities can support prioritising investments to fulfil these multiple benefits. This paper analyses the distribution of stormwater infrastructure in Los Angeles (LA) County in relation to design criteria, urban structure and sociodemographic information. It demonstrates an approach for identifying projects that simultaneously address engineering needs and promote equity. Statistical analysis of high-detail sewer locations reveals geographic correlations with key local design parameters, urban characteristics and sociodemographic indicators. Watershed areas in LA County were identified that support multi-benefit projects, meeting dual criteria for infrastructure improvements and disadvantaged community status. As stormwater systems are increasingly designed for multi-benefit outcomes, new design frameworks can emphasise both performance and social equity.

AB  - Under Executive Order 12898, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must perform environmental justice (EJ) reviews of its rules and regulations. EJ analyses address the hypothesis that environmental disamenities are experienced disproportionately by poor and/or minority subgroups. Such analyses typically use communities as the unit of analysis. While community-based approaches make sense when considering where polluting sources locate, they are less appropriate for national air quality rules affecting many sources and pollutants that can travel thousands of miles. We compare exposures and health risks of EJ-identified individuals rather than communities to analyze EPA's Heavy Duty Diesel (HDD) rule as an example national air quality rule. Air pollutant exposures are estimated within grid cells by air quality models; all individuals in the same grid cell are assigned the same exposure. Using an inequality index, we find that inequality within racial/ethnic subgroups far outweighs inequality between them. We find, moreover, that the HDD rule leaves between-subgroup inequality essentially unchanged. Changes in health risks depend also on subgroups' baseline incidence rates, which differ across subgroups. Thus, health risk reductions may not follow the same pattern as reductions in exposure. These results are likely representative of other national air quality rules as well.

AB  - We assessed the impact of an HIV/AIDS programme for Nepalese migrants to India that involved writing letters. The programme created opportunities for sending HIV/AIDS-related messages to the migrants in India, and encouraging them practicing safer sex. Initially, they received the messages only from the programme, but later from their colleagues, spouses or other family members. They discussed the messages in groups, disseminated them, and sought more knowledge in their destinations. These findings indicated that using letters could be an effective way to reach inaccessible migrants at their destinations, and help them to improve their HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, and safer sex practices.

AB  - We examine distributions of pollution and wealth among countries over a 20 year period. We distinguish between pollution produced within a country and pollution triggered along global supply chains by a country's consumption. We explain pollution and wealth distributions via network characteristics. Our findings show a positive, (log-) linear relationship between a country's network position and both ways of accounting for pollution. In addition, core countries and/or ones with higher numbers and volume of export ties increase their shares of global wealth faster than shares of pollution.

AB  - This paper provides a re-signification of industrial risk as a slow-burning issue (Mah [2017] "Environmental justice in the age of big data: challenging toxic blind spots of voice, speed, and expertise." Environmental Sociology 3 (2): 122-133.), invisibly and violently diffusing across time and space and affecting relational entanglements between human and non-human components of risk landscapes. As an alternative to a planning approach based on quantitative and objective data, the authors propose to build strategic planning of riskscapes upon what they call small data, that is, the ensemble of qualitative and embodied data that can be gathered through street science (Corburn [2005]. Street Science: Community Knowledge and Environmental Health Justice. Cambridge: MIT Press.) and toxic autobiographies (Armiero et al. [2019]. "Toxic Bios: Toxic Autobiographies - A Public Environmental Humanities Project." Environmental Justice, 1-5. ). In order to discuss the potential role of both small data and toxic autobiographies in the planning field, the authors present the results of an ongoing empirical case study in Gela, a Sicilian town converted into one of the main Italian petrochemical poles in the 1960s by a multinational oil company. The authors analyse Gela's risk landscapes through the perceptions of citizens and their initiatives to tackle environmental injustices. Finally, the authors argue that small data can provide a better understanding of the landscape of risk through four lenses that allow seeing the slow and diffused change brought by industrial risk: memories of injustice, memories of smell, trans-corporeal stories, and relational stories.

AB  - This study documents the prevalence of historically marginalized populations (across age, income, education, race-ethnicity, and language) living near active oil and gas wells throughout the USA, at both local and aggregated scales. This is performed by way of areal apportionment using well location data and population characteristics from the American Community Survey. A clustering analysis of marginalized populations living near a high density of wells reveals four distinct regions of high prevalence: southern California, southwest Texas, Appalachia, and northwest New Mexico. At the nationwide scale, we find large absolute numbers of people living near wells, including marginalized groups: nearly 18 million people in total across the USA, many of which are Hispanic (3.3 million), Black (1.8 million), Asian (0.7 million), and Native American (0.5 million), live below the poverty line (3 million), older individuals (3 million), or young children (over 1 million). In certain states, this represents a large share of the total population - over 50% in the case of West Virginia and Oklahoma. Estimates are subsequently compared to county-level control groups to assess patterns of disproportionality. Wide variations are found across regions and metrics, underscoring the locally specific nature of these data. Our research contributes to the field of environmental justice by describing the populations living near oil and gas wells.

AB  - This paper considers how conservation litigation seeking to protect wilderness from degradation can overlook those living nearby or within it, even though the degradation also threatens residents. We use as a case study the controversial siting of a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) in a chronically impoverished, all-white community in the remote Arkansas Ozarks of the United States. Because the CAFO is at the cusp of federally protected wilderness, it attracted the attention of national conservation interests, who sued seeking the CAFO's closure. These events provide a basis for illustrating how and theorizing why the community was disserved by its rurality and its whiteness. We suggest that widely held rural associations with the pastoral and bucolic imaginaries that are at least implicitly white may have blinded those strategizing the litigation to the place's deep and entrenched poverty and therefore to the residents' vulnerability. Alternatively, the conservation-oriented plaintiffs and attorneys may have viewed these poor white residents as transgressing wilderness as having trashed pristine nature by their very presence and thus as unworthy of advocacy. Either way, the plaintiffs did not bolster their conservationist claims with environmental justice advocacy, presumably because of the absence of a clear optical trigger for the latter. Finally, we consider these events through three lenses typically associated with environmental law: conservationist, economic, and social (environmental justice). Finding each of these lacking, we illustrate how the robust and multi-dimensional concept of rurality can synthesize these individual frames while surfacing voices and issues not otherwise heard. Turning a rural lens on these events also reveals sociospatial obstacles to environmental justice, explaining, for example, why multigenerational residents are unwilling to assert their legal rights. The result is essentially a meta-narrative of rurality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study integrates publicly available datasets to provide a county-based assessment of socio-economic disparities of population exposure to flood hazards in the United States. Statistical analyses were applied to reveal the national trends and local deviations from the trends. Results show that approximately 21.8 million (6.87% of) U.S. population are exposed to 100-year-flood in 2015, and most of the exposure is near water bodies (e.g. ocean and rivers). Additionally, communities near water bodies are more responsive to potential flood hazards by avoiding residence in flood zones than inland communities. At the national scale, economically disadvantaged population are more likely to reside in flood zones than outside. At the local scale, economically disadvantaged population tend to reside in flood zones in inland areas, while coastal flood zones are more occupied by wealthier and elderly people. These findings point to an alarming situation of inland communities where people are generally less responsive to flood hazards and people in flood zones are in a lower economic condition. Using "hot spot" analysis, local clusters of disadvantaged population groups with high flood exposure were identified. Overall, this study provides important baseline information for policymaking at different levels of administration and pinpoints local areas where diversified and ad hoc strategies are needed to mitigate flood risk in communities with diverse socio-economic conditions. This study provides empirical evidence of socio-economic disparities and environmental injustice associated with flood exposure in the U.S. and offers valuable insights to the underlying factors.

AB  - UN human rights organs have persistently invoked the integration of fundamental rights into the UNFCCC regime and the Paris Agreement now provides that the 'Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights'. How integration should be achieved is nevertheless a matter of international law development. At the regional level, a tendency seems to progressively emerge to ground integration in the fundamental right to a sustainable environment. Against such a background, it is argued in this article that a third generation environmental claim simplifies the complex establishment of a causal nexus between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and first and second generation fundamental rights. This would allow international human rights protection mechanisms to be triggered based on (minimum) reduction targets under the UNFCCC regime. The international recognition of a human right to a sustainable environment therefore emerges as fundamental to determining human rights responsibility for climate change, with particular regard to States. It thus facilitates systemically integrating fundamental rights into climate change regulation and taking consequential institutional action. This argument adds strings to the bow of those scholars who support the idea of intergenerational environmental justice on legal and moral grounds.

AB  - With 9 million hogs, North Carolina (NC) is the second leading hog producer in the United States. Most hogs are housed at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where millions of tons of hog waste can pollute air and water with fecal pathogens that can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and/or nausea (known as acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI)). We used NCs ZIP code-level emergency department (FD) data to calculate rates of AGI ED visits (2016-2019) and swine permit data to estimate hog exposure. Case exposure was estimated as the inverse distances from each hog CAFO to census block centroids, weighting with Gaussian decay and by manure amount per CAFO, then aggregated to ZIP code using population weights. We compared ZIP codes in the upper quartile of hog exposure ("high hog exposed") to those without hog exposure. Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, we created a control with similar demographics to the high hog exposed population and calculated rate ratios using quasi-Poisson models. We examined effect measure modification of rurality and race using adjusted models. In high hog exposed areas compared to areas without hog exposure, we observed a 11% increase (95% CI: 1.06, 1.17) in AGI rate and 21% increase specifically in rural areas (95% CI: 0.98, 1.43). When restricted to rural areas, we found an increased AGI rate among American Indian (RR = 4.29, 95% CI: 3.69, 4.88) and Black (RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.91) residents. The association was stronger during the week after heavy rain (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.62) and in areas with both poultry and swine CAFOs (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.48, 1.57). Residing near CAFOs may increase rates of AGI ED visits. Flog CAFOs arc disproportionally built near rural Black and American Indian communities in NC and arc associated with increased AGI mast strongly in these populations.

AB  - This environmental justice study investigates whether disempowered segments of the population in Hamburg, Germany, namely, foreigners and the poor, reside disproportionately in neighborhoods that contain, have higher concentrations of, and are in closer proximity to facilities releasing toxic chemicals into the environment. Methods include choropleth mapping; comparisons of means, correlation, and ordinary least squares (OLS); and spatial econometric regression. The results provide evidence that toxic release facilities are disproportionately located within, and closer to, neighborhoods with comparatively higher proportions of foreigners and the poor as compared to those with higher proportions of German citizens and the non-poor. We speculate that the causes of this pattern of environmental inequity are similar to the causes scholars have proposed for comparable patterns observed in many U.S. cities, where marginalized immigrant or minority groups subject to discrimination in housing and employment have sought low-wage labor in industrial areas, whereas wealthier German citizens have settled in environmentally safer parts of the city.

AB  - This paper interrogates the specific workings and stakes of slow violence on Indigenous ground. It argues that despite similarities with other environmental justice struggles, Indigenous ones are fundamentally distinct because of Indigenous peoples' unique relationship to the polluted or damaged entity, to the state, and to capital. It draws from Indigenous studies, history, anthropology, geography, sensory studies, and STS, to present results from research with the Mowachaht Muchalaht First Nation, an Indigenous people on the west coast of British Columbia. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, this community used successive strategies to try to render its knowledge about health, environment, and authority visible to the settler state. Each strategy entailed particular configurations of risk, perceptibility, and uncertainty; each involved translation between epistemologies; and each implicated a distinct subject position for Indigenous peoples vis-a-vis the state. The community's initial anti-colonial, environmental justice campaign attempted to translate local, Indigenous ways of knowing into the epistemologies of environmental science and public health. After this strategy failed, community leaders launched another that leveraged the state's legal epistemology. This second strategy shifted the balance of risk and uncertainty such that state actors felt compelled to act. The community achieved victory, but at a price. Where the first strategy positioned the community as a self-determined, sovereign actor; the second positioned it as a ward of the state. This outcome illustrates the costs that modern states extract from Indigenous peoples who seek remedial action, and more generally, the mechanisms through which the colonial present is (re)produced.

AB  - Where rights over natural resources are contested, the effectiveness of conservation may be undermined and it can be difficult to estimate the welfare impacts of conservation restrictions on local people. In particular, researchers face the dilemma of estimating respondents' Willingness To Pay (WTP) for rights to resources, or their Willingness To Accept (WTA) compensation for foregoing these rights. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with respondents living next to a new protected area in Madagascar, using a split-sample design to administer both WTP and WTA formats, followed by debriefing interviews. We first examined the differences in response patterns to the formats and their performance in our study context. We also used the two formats to elicit respondents' attitudes to conservation restrictions and property rights over forestlands. We found that the format affected the relative importance of different attributes: WTA respondents strongly favoured livelihood projects and secure tenure whereas neither attributes were significant for WTP respondents. The WTA format outperformed WTP format on three validity criteria: it was perceived to be more plausible and consequential; led to fewer protest responses; and was more appropriate given very low incomes. Seventy-three percent of respondents did not accept the legitimacy of state protection and strongly aspired to secure forest tenure. The use of a WTP format may thus be inappropriate even if respondents do not hold formal rights over resources. We conclude that estimating the opportunity costs of stopping de jure illegal activities is difficult and coercive conservation lacks procedural legitimacy and may not achieve full compensations. Our findings question the viability of the current conservation model and highlight the importance to conservation policy of locally legitimate property rights over forestlands.

AB  - Understanding the short-and long-term impacts of a biomonitoring and exposure project and reporting personal results back to study participants is critical for guiding future efforts, especially in the context of environmental justice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate learning outcomes from environmental communication efforts and whether environmental health literacy goals were met in an environmental justice community. We conducted 14 interviews with parents who had participated in the University of Arizona's Metals Exposure Study in Homes and analyzed their responses using NVivo, a qualitative data management and analysis program. Key findings were that participants used the data to cope with their challenging circumstances, the majority of participants described changing their families' household behaviors, and participants reported specific interventions to reduce family exposures. The strength of this study is that it provides insight into what people learn and gain from such results communication efforts, what participants want to know, and what type of additional information participants need to advance their environmental health literacy. This information can help improve future report back efforts and advance environmental health and justice.

AB  - What would abolitionism mean for climate justice? "Resilience" is proposed by experts as a solution to climate change vulnerability. But this prescription tends to focus on adaptation to future external threats, subtly validating embedded processes of racial capitalism that have historically dehumanised and endangered residents and their environments in the first place. This article focuses on majority Black areas said to be vulnerable to extreme weather events and targeted for expert-driven resilience enhancements in America's capital city, Washington, DC. Drawing on key insights from Black radical, feminist, and antiracist humanist thought, we reimagine resilience through an abolitionist framework. Using archival analysis, oral histories, a neighbourhood-level survey, and interviews conducted between 2015 and 2018, we argue that abolitionist climate justice entails a centring of DC's historical environmental and housing-related racisms, the intersectional drivers of precarity and trauma experienced by residents beyond those narrowly associated with "climate"; and an ethics of care and healing practiced by those deemed most at risk to climate change.

AB  - Urban green space has environmental benefits of purifying the air, reducing the heat island effect and providing the social and economic benefits of rest places and social platforms. An integrated and organized green space system is important for fully realizing the positive functions of an urban ecosystem. Previous studies have considered green space supply and demand, but few studies have examined large-scale, diverse and small-scale systems, making it difficult to conduct a comparative study of urban green space accessibility and equity under the same conditions (such as data sources and calculation methods). Using the two-step floating catchment area method, this study evaluates the equity of 254 urban green spaces in China within four ranges of accessibility: 1 km, 2.5 km, 5 km and 10 km. The study also considers urban house price in the research. The results show the following: (1) There are large differences in the accessibility of green space between different cities in China. Within the accessibility threshold of 10 km, the city with the most accessible urban green spaces has an accessibility level that is 27,813 times that of the city with the lowest accessibility. (2) Within the range of walking/cycling, there are significant inequalities in green space access in the 254 cities; the inequality of green space accessibility in most of the studied cities is at the "dangerous" level. (3) The two-step floating catchment area method indicates that the social superiority (high social class) represented by high housing prices is associated with a greater opportunity to access urban green space services. This paper highlights the main problems associated with the accessibility of urban green space in China and proposes targeted development recommendations. These recommendations provide a reference for urban managers to develop effective green space development policies and realize the optimal allocation of urban green space.

AB  - This study presents a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) method for spatially identifying and assessing multiple elements of environmental justice in urban blue space. We used this method in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, to examine: (1) the diversity and spatial distribution of clusters based on the activities undertaken in urban blue space; (2) the diversity of users in each cluster, representing a composite measure of income, age and family income, and; (3) the extent of perceived problems and unpleasant experiences (PPUE) in each cluster. Proportionately more high activity and high user diversity areas were found in Helsinki than Espoo and Vantaa municipalities. Contrasting combinations of activity and user diversity (high-low, low-high) show very different spatial distributions, dominant activities and PPUE. The method enables landscape and urban planning strategies to be tailored to different types of activities and users, and to be responsive to the PPUE found in urban blue spaces. We encourage future landscape and urban planning research to further develop and apply this PPGIS method for assessing multiple elements of environmental justice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the 2015 summit on global climate change in Paris, political action will (or will not) be taken to tackle the threats of the global climate crisis. Both social scientists as well as conservationists have come to the conclusion that human activity is one of the main reasons for climate change and nature degradation, and the main target of justice related mitigation and adaptation responses. This article puts human (in)activity into focus, and introduces a social identity perspective on environmental justice. Specifically, it shows how conservation scientists can draw from the idea of a common human identity (CHI). It delineates how the representation of a "common human ingroup" could inform beliefs about environmental justice, which in turn should motivate individuals and groups to act in favor of the natural environment. The review highlights that social identification with all humans may represent a potential path to global environmental justice, and combines recent insights from social identity research with conservation behavior.

AB  - This work seeks to advance and synthesize leftist political and environmental theory and enhance historical and contemporary understanding of environmental activism, especially related to the movement to halt climate change. We share findings from our participatory action research (PAR) on the internal dynamics and debates among the three main climate activist networks mobilizing at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meetings in Copenhagen in 2009, those of the reformist Climate Action Network (CAN), the more marxian-inspired Climate Justice Now! (CJN), and the autonomist and anarchistic Climate Justice Action (CJA). We elucidate how leftist reformist and especially the more radical currents are engaging with non-or anti-Western indigenous praxis to forge the contemporary transnational environmental movement.

AB  - Upward trends in ground-level warming are expected to intensify, affecting the health of human populations. Specific to the United States, the Northeast (NE) region is one of the most vulnerable to these warming trends. Previous research has found social disparities in the distribution of heat, while recent studies have examined associations between metropolitan racial/ethnic segregation and heat exposures. We advance upon previous research by including a novel measure of neighborhood-level racial/ethnic diversity in our examination of social inequalities in heat for NE neighborhoods (census tracts). We paired data derived from the United States Geological Survey on mean land surface temperature (LST) for the summer months of 2013-2017 with sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey (5-year estimates, 2013-2017). We use multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEEs) that adjust for geographic clustering. Findings reveal heat exposure disparities across NE neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minorities, people of lower socioeconomic status, households without access to an automobile, and greater diversity experience higher temperatures. Diversity was more strongly related to increased heat in neighborhoods with lower Latinx and lower Black composition suggesting that neighborhood homogeneity confers a differentially greater cooling effect based on higher White composition. The social groups that carry the unequal thermal burdens are also those who are most vulnerable. Interventions to reduce heat risks in the NE should therefore prioritize reducing the burden on historically disadvantaged communities.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between mobile source emissions and subsequent human exposure is crucial for emissions control. Determining this relationship over space is fundamental to improve the accuracy and precision of public policies. In this study, we evaluated the spatial patterns of link-based PM2.5 emissions and subsequent human exposure in a large Canadian metropolitan area - the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). This study was performed in three stages. First, we estimated vehicle emissions using transportation models and emission simulators. Then we evaluated human exposure to PM2.5 emissions using the Intake fraction (iF) approach. Finally, we applied geostatistical methods to assess spatial patterns of vehicle emissions and subsequent human exposure based on three prospective goals: i) classification of emissions (Global Moran's I test), ii) level of emission exposure (Getis-Ord General G test), and; iii) location of emissions (Anselin Local Moran's I). Our results showed that passenger vehicles accounted for the highest total amount of PM2.5 emissions, representing 57% emissions from all vehicles. Examining only the emissions from passenger vehicles, on average, each person in the GTHA inhales 2.58 x 10(-3) ppm per day. Accounting the emissions from buses and trucks, on average each person inhales 0.12 x 10(-3) and 1.91 x 10(-3) ppm per day, respectively. For both PM2.5 emissions and human exposure using iF approach, our analysis showed Moran's Index greater than 0 for all vehicle categories, suggesting the presence of significant clusters (p-value <0.01) in the region. Our study indicates that air pollution control policy must be developed for the whole region, because of the spatial distribution of housing and businesses centers and inter-connectivity of transportation networks across the region, where a policy cannot simply be based on a municipal or other boundaries.

AB  - This Article tackles a question that has vexed the administrative state for the last half century: how to seriously take account of the distributional consequences of regulation. The academic literature has largely accepted the view that distributional concerns should be moved out of the regulatory domain and into Congress's tax policy portfolio. In doing so, it has overlooked the fact that tax policy is ill suited to provide compensation for significant environmental, health, and safety harms. And the congressional gridlock that has bedeviled us for several decades makes this enterprise even more of a nonstarter. The focus on negative distributional consequences has become particularly salient recently, playing a significant role in the 2016 presidential election and threatening important, socially beneficial regulatory measures. For example, on opposite sides of the political spectrum, environmental justice groups and coal miner interests have forcefully opposed the regulation of greenhouse gases through flexible regulatory tools in California and at the federal level, respectively. The time has come to make distributional consequences a core concern of the regulatory state; otherwise, future socially beneficial regulations could well encounter significant roadblocks. The success of this enterprise requires significant institutional changes in the way in which distributional issues are handled within the executive branch. Every president from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama has made cost-benefit analysis a key feature of the regulatory state as a result of the role played by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the Trump administration has kept that structure in place. In contrast, executive orders addressing distributional concerns have languished because of the lack of a similar enforcement structure within the executive branch. This Article provides the blueprint for the establishment of a standing, broadly constituted interagency body charged with addressing serious negative consequences of regulatory measures on particular groups. Poor or minority communities already disproportionally burdened by environmental harms and communities that lose a significant portion of their employment base are paradigmatic candidates for such action.

AB  - Whether used to support or impede action, scientific knowledge is now, more than ever, the primary framework for political discourse on climate change. As a consequence, science has become a hegemonic way of knowing climate change by mainstream climate politics, which not only limits the actors and actions deemed legitimate in climate politics but also silences vulnerable communities and reinforces historical patterns of cultural and political marginalization. To combat this "post-political" condition, we seek to democratize climate knowledge and imagine the possibilities of climate praxis through an engagement with Gramscian political ecology and feminist science studies. This framework emphasizes how antihierarchical and experiential forms of knowledge can work to destabilize technocratic modes of governing. We illustrate the potential of our approach through ethnographic research with people in southern Appalachia whose knowledge of climate change is based in the perceptible effects of weather, landscape change due to exurbanization, and the potential impacts of new migrants they call "climate refugees." Valuing this knowledge builds more diverse communities of action, resists the extraction of climate change from its complex society-nature entanglements, and reveals the intimate connections between climate justice and distinct cultural lifeways. We argue that only by opening up these new forms of climate praxis, which allow people to take action using the knowledge they already have, can more just socioecological transformations be brought into being.

AB  - While the uneven causes and impacts of climate change are widely known, it is also becoming evident that many elements of the response to the climate crisis are also reinforcing discrimination, segregation, and displacement among marginalized peoples. This is entrenching a system of climate apartheid, one that is evidenced by uneven vulnerabilities to the climate crisis, as well as inequitable implementation of climate-oriented infrastructures, policies, and programs. These efforts often secure privileged populations while harming, excluding, and criminalizing populations whose lives have been made precarious by climate change. Like previous incarnations of state-sponsored "separateness," climate apartheid is rooted in processes of colonization, racial capitalism, and hetero-patriarchy that render some populations expendable. In this paper, we show how these interlocking historical structures of oppression facilitate a response to climate change that is systematically promoting spatial, socio-economic, and ecological segregation in many mainstream attempts to safeguard economic and socio-political structures amidst global ecological catastrophe. We then offer frameworks and interventions intended to introduce meaningful pathways forward for climate justice that seek to render all life indispensable.

AB  - Urban residents can benefit from spending time in outdoor spaces and engaging with nature-related activities. Such engagement can improve health and well-being, support community cohesion, and improve environmentally-friendly behaviours. However, engagement with nature may not be equal amongst different members of society. We investigated individual variation in engagement with nature in Singapore, a high-density city in tropical Southeast Asia. Through a survey of 1000 residents, we analysed relationships between demographic factors such as age, income, and sex, and the frequency of visitation to different ecosystem types, and the frequency of engagement with different nature-related activities. Parks and neighbourhood open spaces were among the most commonly-visited outdoor spaces, with nature reserves and other natural areas being visited less frequently. Common activities included sitting outdoors, art and photography, and running, while hiking and nature recreation were less frequent. In contrast with previous studies, we found relatively small differences among different groups of the population in their preferred types of outdoor activities. Older people, those with lower incomes, and without degrees were less likely to visit most types of outdoor space and engage with most types of nature-related activities. In the case of nature reserves, the distance from the visitor's home had a significantly negative influence on the frequency of visitation. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of engagement with nature are not equally enjoyed by all demographic groups, and that some groups lack engagement across the board. Strategies to increase nature engagement in tropical cities could include increasing the local availability and accessibility of different types of outdoor space, and education and public outreach programmes to encourage participation.

AB  - While the literature documents known barriers to research participation in underserved communities, there are still very few evidence-based strategies that have successfully addressed gaps regarding recruitment and retention. To this end, we developed a replicable model designed to establish community-academic partnerships and advance environmental health research in underserved communities. The Environmental Justice Community Alert Matrix (EJCAM) was implemented in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and includes programmatic elements of both citizen science and community engagement: (1) Outreach - Community Action Teams, (2) Involvement - Urban Transition Cities Movement, (3) Participatory Research - Mobile Air Quality Monitoring Bicycle Campaign, and (4) Consultation - Indoor Air Quality Assessments. Resident-led workshops were used to increase environmental consciousness in communities through peer-to-peer education. Adapting citizen science methods, commercially available particle counters were retrofitted to bicycles and the associated data used to develop GIS maps of particulate matter dispersion. Results show spatially-resolved PM(2.)5 values increase from background levels by an order of magnitude or 1000 counts adjacent to construction sites and public transportation hubs. As distrust in outside institutions has limited the reach of environmental justice research in underserved communities, bottom-up principles that start with individuals are essential, and should be undertaken as a meaningful and ongoing process.

AB  - Urban tree cover is inequitable in many American cities, with low-income and non-white neighborhoods typically having the least coverage. Some municipal and non-profit tree planting programs aim to address this inequity by targeting low-income neighborhoods; however, many programs face lack of participation or resistance from local residents. In this study, we aimed to uncover the economic, social, cultural, and physical barriers that community leaders face in planting trees and fostering engagement in a neighborhood with low tree canopy. In collaboration with an urban greening nonprofit in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (US), twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with community leaders in a low canopy neighborhood, North Philadelphia. Half of these leaders were already involved with local tree planting programs, while the other half were not. Findings reveal that despite broad appreciation for trees and greenspaces, there are concerns about the risks and costs residents assume over the course of a tree's life cycle, the threat of neighborhood development and gentrification associated with trees, limited plantable space, and limited time and capacity for community organizations. Additionally, these barriers to participation may be amplified among low-income and communities of color who face the legacies of historical tree disservices and municipal structural disinvestment. Addressing community concerns regarding the long-term care of trees beyond the initial tree planting would likely require further programmatic support. Overall, this research highlights the complexity of addressing inequities in tree canopy and the importance of integrating resident and community leader perspectives about disservices and management costs into tree planting initiatives.

AB  - Young people - including children and teenagers are spending less time playing outside in nature than previous generations. This decrease is problematic, as parks can provide young people with physical and mental health benefits. Also, growing health disparities exist between white and ethnic minority young people in the U.S. These concerns motivate an investigation into access to parks for young people of different ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Although several recent studies have focused on park quality, no previous inquiry has employed a youth-centered framework to measure access, nor has used an index of park quality describing young people's park needs. To address these gaps, I investigated access to parks in Denver, Colorado through a comprehensive geospatial approach including park proximity, acreage, and quality that models park and walkability features supporting frequent park use for children and teenagers. My findings show a multifaceted pattern of environmental injustice. Ethnic minority and low-income people have better access than other groups in terms of park proximity. High-income and white people, however, have access to significantly more acres of parks per youth, to more parks with excellent levels of quality, and to safer parks than other groups. The dramatic disparities in park safety might strongly limit park use among Denver's low-income young people of color. This analytical framework can help park planners identify specific gaps in park provision for youth and develop strategies to address quality and acreage disparities.

AB  - Visiting urban parks regularly can provide significant physical and mental health benefits for children and teenagers, but these benefits are tempered by park quality, amenities, maintenance, and safety. Therefore, planning and public health scholars have developed instruments to measure park quality, but most of these tools require costly and time-consuming field surveys and only a handful focus specifically on youth. We rectify these issues by developing the QUality INdex of Parks for Youth (QUINPY) based on a robust literature review of studies on young people's park visitation habits and an extensive validation process by academic and professional experts. Importantly, the QUINPY relies on publicly available geospatial data to measure park quality. We then successfully pilot test the QUINPY in Denver and New York City. We believe that park agencies, planning consultants, researchers, and nonprofits aiming to assess park quality will find this tool useful. The QUINPY is particularly promising given the increasing amount of publicly available geospatial data and other recent advancements in geospatial science.

AB  - Transboundary collaboration between the United States (US) and Mexico in the Colorado River Basin has heightened in recent years, as climate change, population growth, and overallocation threaten the long-term stability of the region. Through a combination of document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, we examine patterns of change in the governance of the Colorado River, as the US and Mexico navigate socioeconomic, cultural, and political asymmetries to jointly share water over the past two decades. We ask: What key events and environmental agreements have influenced transboundary water governance in the Colorado River over the past 20 years? We draw on the rich scholarship on transboundary water governance, especially around international river basin organizations, to uncover patterns of engagement and collaboration over time. We focus on the binational scale with an eye to study governance at multiple scales including interactions and impacts at the national and subnational scales. Our findings illustrate how Mexico's role has evolved from a narrow one following a strict interpretation of the 1944 Treaty toward a more creative partnership between the US and Mexico demonstrated in binational negotiations and the creation of joint solutions to emerging challenges around water conservation and ecological restoration. We find transboundary water governance in the basin is influenced by both long-term and short-term contextual changes that can inform strategies key actors employ to bolster institutional resilience and take advantage of opportunities for transformative change. Further, we find that the evolution of the binational relationship is reflected in changes in the negotiation process and structure, which highlights the importance of trust and relationship building, transparency, joint fact-finding, and information sharing to foster collaboration. However, we also find uneven institutionalization of stakeholder participation and transparency in engagement patterns that may ultimately, serve to hinder governance and cooperation in the basin.

AB  - This longitudinal flood-relief study assessed the impact of the March 2019 Cyclone Idai flood event on E. coli contamination of hand-pumped boreholes in Mulanje District, Malawi. It established the microbiological water quality safety of 279 community supplies over three phases, each comprising water-quality survey, rehabilitation and treatment verification monitoring. Phase 1 contamination three months after Idai was moderate, but likely underestimated. Increased contamination in Phase 2 at 9 months and even greater in Phase 3, a year after Idai was surprising and concerning, with 40% of supplies then registering E. coli contamination and 20% of supplies deemed 'unsafe'. Without donor support for follow-up interventions, this would have been missed by a typical single-phase flood-relief activity. Contamination rebound at boreholes successfully treated months earlier signifies a systemic problem from persistent sources intensified by groundwater levels likely at a decade high. Problem extent in normal, or drier years is unknown due to absence of routine monitoring of water point E. coli in Malawi. Statistical analysis was not conclusive, but was indicative of damaged borehole infrastructure and increased near-borehole pit-latrine numbers being influential. Spatial analysis including groundwater flow -field definition (an overlooked sector opportunity) revealed 'hit-and-miss' contamination of safe and unsafe boreholes in proximity. Hydrogeological control was shown by increased contamination near flood-affected area and in more recent recharge groundwater otherwise of good quality. Pit latrines are presented as credible e-coli sources in a conceptual model accounting for heterogeneous borehole contamination, wet season influence and rebound behavior. Critical to establish are groundwater level -flow direction, hand-pump plume draw, mul-tiple footprint latrine sources -'skinny' plumes, borehole short-circuiting and fast natural pathway (e.g. fracture flow) and other source influences. Concerted WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) sector investment in re-search and policy driving national water point based E. coli monitoring programs are advocated. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper is a response to the keynote address by Mary McDonald delivered at the 2008 NRPA Butler Lecture. Her paper on "Dialogues on Whiteness, Leisure, and (Anti)Racism" was subsequently published in the Journal of Leisure Research in the first quarter of 2009. While there are several areas of congruence and historical accuracy regarding McDonald's work, this present article includes a distinctive line of reasoning for how whiteness influences the leisure experiences of ethnic minorities. A different perspective on understanding racism in relation to recreation and use of parks as leisure spaces is offered and some competing viewpoints provided. This response paper provides a contribution towards the discussion of power, privilege and the continued existence of oppression and discrimination in this field. It suggests we continue to explore critical race theory in recreation and leisure studies yet this must begin with perceptions of "justice," coupled with a fundamental belief in the mere existence of injustice, if change is truly to occur. The intention of this paper is to support key components of McDonald's premise while also challenging conventional thinking. Additionally, assorted questions are asked to counteract some of those noted by McDonald, relationships between social and environmental justice and leisure are explored from a different lens, and suggestions for research directions are offered.

AB  - This chapter puts the idea of justice in environmental and natural resource management in a historical context, particularly since the rise of 'the environment' and the global era in the 1940s. It argues that the future is understood by different experts at different times, and that justice cuts across many sectors: prominent in law, history and governance, but also invoked by natural scientists concerned about the environment and resources. Key global ideas in environmental justice include human rights, sustainability and intergenerational equity, and the precautionary principle, all of which became important in global settings, but have specific local and national applications for natural resources such as water, forests and fisheries.

AB  - This paper extends the terms of engagement between social science, posthumanist debates and One Health by questioning whether 'the public' may include non-human animals. The One Health concept refers to interdependence between human beings and non-human species in socio-ecological systems. One Health interventions and critiques have tended to emphasize the prevention of zoonotic infections, whereas this paper reflects on more than a decade of engaged research in One Health promotion. Repeatedly, this particular approach to One Health promotion has highlighted the imprint of multi-species entanglements in public life, especially the problematization and politicization of people's pets. Serious consideration for multi-species entanglements cautions against conflating 'the public' with human beings and human interests, to the exclusion of all others. Human beings have never lived separate and apart from non-human species, and we all depend on shared environments. To do justice to multispecies entanglements, socio-ecological theory should undergo expansion in health promotion.

AB  - To be an effective player in the urban arena, foresters must span the boundaries between a range of professions, environmental issues, political jurisdictions and the Media. just as rural foresters must think larger than a stand of trees when seeking a sustainable approach to management, the urban forester must think larger than the city to have a significant, sustainable impact on the quality of life in inner-city neighborhoods. In this article, the Greater Boston Urban Resources Partnership serves as a model for demonstrating how forestry can begin to expand its influence in restoring the health of our dysfunctional urban landscapes.

AB  - This paper examines the opportunities and challenges faced by "Adaptation to the Health Impacts of Air Pollution and Climate Extremes in Latin American Cities" (ADAPTS). ADAPTE is an issue-driven research endeavor that integrates different disciplinary domains to explore the complex nature of urban vulnerability/adaptive capacity to weather and air pollution in Buenos Aires, Bogota, Mexico City and Santiago. The paper also critically reflects on some of the possible challenges to be encountered, along with the benefits to be gleaned, when doing issue-driven research that seeks to be scientifically robust and socially relevant and is defined by such attributes as integration of heterogeneous research domains, interactivity and reflexivity. ADAPTE's efforts to integrate concepts, methods and data from different disciplines were fundamental in the design of a conceptual framework on urban vulnerability. The integrating research question and the use of quantitative and qualitative methods allowed ADAPTS to shed a slightly different light on the nature and interconnections between the different dimensions of urban vulnerability. However, it has proven difficult for us to fully explore the dynamics of urban vulnerability as well as the issues of scale and context. A set of cultural and communication challenges has arisen, not only from the diverse conceptualization approaches, methods, differing terminologies and mechanisms for analyzing and presenting results that ADAPTS has attempted to integrate, but also from institutional and interpersonal issues affecting team interactions.

AB  - This paper explores whether the health risks related to air pollution and temperature extremes are spatially and socioeconomically differentiated within three Latin American cities: Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, Mexico, and Santiago, Chile. Based on a theoretical review of three relevant approaches to risk analysis (risk society, environmental justice, and urban vulnerability as impact), we hypothesize that health risks from exposure to air pollution and temperature in these cities do not necessarily depend on socio-economic inequalities. To test this hypothesis, we gathered, validated, and analyzed temperature, air pollution, mortality and socioeconomic vulnerability data from the three study cities. Our results show the association between air pollution levels and socioeconomic vulnerabilities did not always correlate within the study cities. Furthermore, the spatial differences in socioeconomic vulnerabilities within cities do not necessarily correspond with the spatial distribution of health impacts. The present study improves our understanding of the multifaceted nature of health risks and vulnerabilities associated with global environmental change. The findings suggest that health risks from atmospheric conditions and pollutants exist without boundaries or social distinctions, even exhibiting characteristics of a boomerang effect (i.e., affecting rich and poor alike) on a smaller scale such as areas within urban regions. We used human mortality, a severe impact, to measure health risks from air pollution and extreme temperatures. Public health data of better quality (e.g., morbidity, hospital visits) are needed for future research to advance our understanding of the nature of health risks related to climate hazards.

AB  - When humans interact with nonhuman nature in seemingly normative ways, through consumption, recreation, admiration, romanticizing, etc., an imperfect but intact binary is often perpetuated; that is, humans are positioned as distinct from nature. Posthumanist political ecology destabilizes the human experience as the sole source of nature-society knowledges. With contributions from actor-network theory and assemblages, posthumanist political ecology provides systems-based analyses where nonhuman actants are underscored within socioenvironmental systems. This research leverages posthumanist political ecology to approach experiences and perspectives concerning unsheltered homelessness, with particular attention to individuals living in urban parks. Using etic and emic accounts, our developed network critically considers nonhuman, wild, and sociopolitical contributions to a contested, dynamic system of unsheltered homelessness. We present posthumanist political ecology as an avenue for leisure research and scholarship to contest problematic binaries concerning nonhuman nature and to more critically address issues of social and environmental injustice.

AB  - Understanding mechanisms of policy engagement and the participation of different actors in urban climate governance is particularly important as cities follow climate emergency declarations with corresponding action, to ensure that inequalities are not exacerbated by climate action. Citizens' juries are a deliberative democracy tool that allows a demographically representative sample of the population to learn about a contested issue from experts, and discuss, debate and develop policy recommendations. Leeds City Council declared a climate emergency in March 2019, compelling the local authority to take serious measures to implement a reduction in carbon emissions to net zero by 2030. A citizens' jury was established by an independent local body, the Leeds Climate Commission, to debate various possible courses of action in response to the declaration. This research critically examined the processes surrounding and embedded in the Leeds citizens' climate jury with a focus on procedural justice and representation justice. Emerging lessons include that recognition of power differentials between various social groups should be carefully considered throughout deliberative processes to ensure representation justice is achieved in decision making. Representation justice demands that those who are included in decision making spaces are able to harness their position to voice their experiences, opinions, hopes and concerns in deciding which trade-offs will be made. In citizens' juries, facilitation style and techniques play a critical role in achieving this participatory parity, alongside other factors. There is potential for important procedural co-benefits to emerge, such as trust-building, place identity and hope for the future.

AB  - This study estimates the size and distribution of the population living near high volume roads in the US, investigates race and income disparities in these near roadway populations, and considers the coverage of the national ambient air quality monitoring network. Every US census block is classified by traffic density and proximity to roads falling within several traffic volume ranges using year 2008 traffic data and the 2010 and 2000 US Census. The results indicate that 19% of the population lives near high volume roads. Nationally, greater traffic volume and density are associated with larger shares of non-white residents and lower median household incomes. Analysis at the county level finds wide variation in the size of near roadway populations and the severity of environmental justice concerns. Every state, however, has some population living near a high volume road and 84% of counties show some level of disparity. The results also suggest that most counties with residents living near high volume roads do not have a co-located regulatory air quality monitor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wicked problems are difficult or impossible to solve. To overcome this dilemma, I propose an approach to better understand and contribute to solve a wicked problem that is particularly pervasive in the Anthropocene: biocultural homogenization. This approach can also help to guide biocultural conservation processes. Toward this aim, I propose to use the "3Hs" conceptual framework of the biocultural ethic that values the vital links among unique life habits of co-inhabitants who share specific habitats. A first outcome is the identification of feedback processes entailing interwoven losses of biological and cultural diversity. Then, I organize these feedback processes in a hierarchical sequence of increasing structural complexity. Analysis of these processes offers a theoretical framework for understanding the interrelations between the homogenization of habits and habitats and the consequences of biocultural homogenization for the lives of diverse human and other-than-human co-inhabitants. Co-inhabitants are subjects (not objects). They co-constitute their identities and share habitats that they co-structure through co-inhabitation relationships of complementarity and reciprocity. Habitats are the condition of possibility for the existence and well-being of the co-inhabitants. I have introduced the notion of co-inhabitants as an ethical justification to oppose biocultural homogenization and to demand biocultural conservation in terms of socio-environmental justice.

AB  - This paper investigates the historical sources of soil-lead contamination in Santa Ana, California. Even though dangerous levels of soil-lead have been found in a wide variety of communities across the United States, public health institutions lack clarity on the historical origins of these crises. This study uses geo-spatial data collected through archival research to estimate the impact of two potential sources of lead contamination in the past - lead-paint and leaded gasoline. It examines, through a combination of statistical and historical methods, the association between lead concentrations in contemporary soil samples and patterns in the evolution of the city's physical features, such as the growth of urbanized areas and the historical flow of traffic. We emphasize the value of historical data collected through archival research for understanding the sources of environmental lead, particularly leaded gasoline, which our study found to be the most likely and most prominent contributor to soillead in Santa Ana's environment. This research contributes to environmental-justice advocacy efforts to reframe lead poisoning as a systemic environmental issue and outlines the path forward to community-level remediation strategies.

AB  - Unlike the vast majority of European capitals, and despite growing income inequality, descriptive measures of socioeconomic segregation seem to show a desegregation trend in Bucharest over the last two decades. Socioeconomic segregation and environmental justice studies provide completing insights of the intricated uneven geographies of social, economic and environmental disparities of post-socialist cities. And Bucharest is paradoxically the most populated and yet less studied of the capitals of Central and Eastern Europe. This paper explores changes in the patterns of socioeconomic segregation in post-socialist Bucharest, sheds more light on the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics and the patterns of segregation, and includes 'attractor' and 'repellent' environmental factors, contributing to combine environmental justice and socioeconomic segregation approaches. Despite the apparently continuous desegregation trend, and even when controlling for the presence and proximity of other predictors, environmental factors play an increasing role in shaping local socioeconomic segregation patterns. This would suggest the need for consideration of the environmental factors in public policies aimed at mitigating the social cost of the transition and residential segregation. This should also lead to use descriptive measures of segregation more cautiously and to explore the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics, environmental conditions and the local patterns of segregation instead.

UN General Comment No. 15 served to re ! ne the human right to water, recognizing it as "a public good fundamental for life and health."It is estimated that women spend a combined total of 200 million hours per day collecting water, making them subject to violence on long treks and susceptible to water - borne illness. Other global initiatives have addressed issues of gender equality and equality for minorities. We summarize our suggestions for water managers. Representatives of public trust, water managers ought to represent community values. In doing so, they can serve the tenets of "water democracy."

AB  - This study investigates the presence of environmental inequality in Germany and analyses its spatial pattern on a very fine grained level. Using the 2011 German census and pollution measures of the E-PRTR, the study relies on nearly 100,000 one squared km census cells over Germany. SLX and community-fixed SLX models incorporate spatial spillover-effects into the analysis to account for the spatial distribution of socio-demographic characteristics. Results reveal that the share of minorities within a census cell indeed positively correlates with the exposure to industrial pollution. Furthermore, spatial spillover effects are highly relevant: the characteristics of the neighbouring spatial units matter in predicting the amount of pollution. Especially within urban areas, clusters of high minority neighbourhoods are affected by high levels of environmental pollution. This highlights the importance of spatial clustering processes in environmental inequality research.

AB  - This research examines the contribution of social ecological factors to the variation in sex offender residence restriction (SORR) violation rates, operationalized as a sex offender residing within a buffer zone around a school or a day care. Drawing on data from two Midwestern states, we utilize a quasi-experimental cohort-control group design to examine the correlates of county-level SORR violation rates among a cohort of post-SORR sex offender parolees, and three counterfactual cohorts (pre-SORR sex offenders, pre- and post-SORR non-sex offender parolees). We model the violation rate using a series of fractional logit regressions, examining the contribution of housing market, environmental justice, and system resource variables. We observe that county-level variation in post-SORR sex offender violation rates is directly associated with concentrated disadvantage and the density of residence restrictions. The direct effect of concentrated disadvantage was unique to the post-SORR sex offender cohort. Model predictions suggest that the relationship between SORR density and concentrated disadvantage varies across the study states. The results suggest that factors found to be associated with sex offender clustering (i.e., housing market characteristics) are not associated with SORR violation rates. Instead, this research suggests a model which allows for the simultaneous influence of environmental justice and system resource effects. Future research on the mechanisms underlying these effects is warranted.

AB  - With the stay at home orders during the pandemic, the often semi-public green spaces of the residential environment, usually created during the building of the houses, became our literal spheres of experience. In our study, we explored use and perceptions of local greenery by residents after sixteen months of the COVID-19 crisis, using face to face questionnaires in eight socially disadvantaged neighborhoods of Berlin, all exposed to high loads of environmental stressors and belonging to four relevant building types of Central European cities. Residential greenery was highly appreciated by residents during COVID-19, and fostered a more active appropriation such as meeting neighbors to reduce the sense of loneliness, doing sports and co-creating refugia in challenging times (e.g. greened balconies). Having children or doing home office/schooling encouraged people to use the green in front of the door in more active ways, such as gardening or even during winter. A minor proportion of respondents reduced contacts mainly due to fear of infections, underlining the need to overcome those distances and to re-connect neighbors and living inside and outside the houses in a post-pandemic city. Our data prove the functionality of residential greenery as 'social tissue' or 'social hubs' of neighborhoods by fostering attachment to place and people and, at the same time, as healthy environment for practices such as enjoying nature and physical activity in fresh air.

Our longitudinal analysis of sitings in the State of Michigan from 1950 to 1990 reveals a distinct temporal pattern supporting our hypotheses. Whereas significant racial, socioeconomic, and housing disparities at the time of siting were not in evidence for facilities sited prior to 1970, patterns of disparate siting were found for facilities sited after 1970. Thus, we call for environmental justice studies employing longitudinal methods to understand the processes and factors contributing to environmental inequalities with greater consideration to changes in historical context.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between the print media and toxic releases in the first wave of Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) filings. It first studies the degree to which neighborhood characteristics like racial composition and income status associate with the number of newspaper articles written about a TRI establishment, controlling for the volume of toxic releases, industry and observable establishment characteristics. It follows up to study whether establishments that receive media attention reduce toxics releases more than those that do not. Neither a qualitative review of the articles nor regression results show any significant correlation between race or income and the likelihood of being included in media reports. A difference-in-difference approach shows a statistically significant decrease in the toxic releases of establishments that received media attention compared to those that did not.

AB  - This paper reports on the development of a land use regression (LUR) model for predicting the intraurban variation of traffic-related air pollution in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, an industrial city at the western end of Lake Ontario. Although land use regression has been increasingly used to characterize exposure gradients within cities, research to date has yet to test whether this method can produce reliable estimates in an industrialized location. Ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO,) were measured for a 2-week period in October 2002 at > 100 locations across the city and subsequently at 30 of these locations in May 2004 to assess seasonal effects. Predictor variables were derived for land use types, transportation, demography, and, physical geography using geographic information systems. The LUR model explained 76% of the variation in NO2. Traffic density, proximity to a highway, and industrial land use were all positively correlated with NO, concentrations, whereas open land use and distance from the lake were negatively correlated with NO2. Locations downwind of a major highway resulted in higher NO2 levels. Cross-validation of the results confirmed model stability Over different seasons. Our findings demonstrate that land use regression can effectively predict NO, variation at the intraurban scale in an industrial setting. Models predicting exposure within smaller areas may lead to improved detection of health effects in epidemiologic studies.

AB  - Urban green spaces' well documented role as a hub for physical and mental health was enhanced by restrictions to mobility issued worldwide as a response to COVID-19. In this context, managers of urban green spaces (UGS) were prompted to provide controlled access under impromptu safety protocols. This unprecedented challenge required planning and operational strengths reflecting flexibility, innovation and learning. These management features are essential for an adaptive governance - an underdeveloped research topic within the study of UGS. Using eighteen semi-structured interviews from six countries, we analyze adaptive governance as reflected by UGS managers' responses across Latin America - a region where access to UGS is a matter of public health and of environmental justice. We document responses that can be categorized based on the governance arrangement in place. On one hand, both polycentric and dedicated-management governances have been able to learn through piloting ideas, adapting personnel roles and the function of UGS infrastructure, and adjusting their decisionmaking process. On the other hand, managers within municipal public services areas - the most prevalent governance arrangement across Latin America - report difficulty to adapt - likely due to their dependence on political will, limited autonomy, insufficient budgets, absence of formal paths to self-funding, shortage of technical know-how, and insufficient citizens' involvement. We discuss implications of UGS adaptive governance in terms of capacity to deal with future public health, climate-related or other types of shocks.

AB  - Understanding the resilience of social-ecological systems can advance our ability to transform environmental governance and achieve ecologically sustainable and socially just outcomes. However, measuring this multidimensional emergent system property has been elusive. We translated theoretical principles of resilience into ecological and social metrics and used expert knowledge to assess how they have changed through three sequential governance regimes of the Pacific herring fishery in northwestern Canada. We showed a significant reduction in system-wide resilience between previous Indigenous and historical colonial governance regimes, and limited change with the onset of the latest environmental justice era. We also detected recent signs of recovery among several metrics of resilience, thereby signaling that this system exhibits the preconditions for governance transformation. Pinpointing the erosion and recovery of attributes that confer social-ecological resilience can reveal leverage points and highlight strategic pathways to enable deliberate transformation toward a more ecologically sustainable and socially just future.

AB  - This study finds that a significant and hitherto ignored determinant of home energy demand is ambient particle pollution. I access longitudinal data for Singapore, a newly affluent Asian city-nation and arguably a harbinger of what is to come in the urbanizing tropics. Singapore today combines high (yet unequal) defensive capital stocks, such as residential air conditioning, with widely varying particle pollution. Overall, residential electricity demand grows by 1.1% when PM2.5 rises by 10 mu g/m(3). I compare the pollution-electricity response to the well-known heat-electricity response, and show how it varies over the socioeconomic distribution. Local pollution control has the cobenefit of reducing electricity generation, via lower household demand, and thus mitigating carbon emissions. The observed inequality in defensive expenditure may also exacerbate health inequalities, as suggested by an exchange between epidemiologists and government.

AB  - Transportation infrastructure decisions contribute to social, economic, and health inequities in the U.S. Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) may improve understanding of potential strategies to mitigate adverse effects on quality of life from planned developments. We use the Gordie Howe International Bridge (GHIB), currently under construction in southwest Detroit, MI, as a case study to examine 15 years of community mobilization, which resulted in community benefits that included an HIA. We describe community engagement processes, household survey methods, and select findings of the baseline HIA, with a focus on their application to inform recommendations to promote quality of life. Baseline HIA results indicated significantly higher self-reported asthma rates among children living within 500 feet of trucking routes. Residents reported substantial economic (e.g., decreased home values), health (e.g., adverse outcomes, lack of health care access), and environmental (e.g., air pollution) concerns related to the GHIB. We discuss specific recommendations, based on HIA results, to reduce adverse impacts of the GHIB. These recommendations will inform ongoing community benefits negotiations. This case study provides lessons for community, academic, and government partners conducting HIAs, especially during building and operation of major infrastructure, and discusses their potential role in improving community engagement opportunities towards environmental justice.

AB  - This paper explores the history of economic, social and environmental change associated with the Pine Point lead-zinc mine, a now-abandoned industrial site and town in the Northwest Territories. Recent perspectives in cultural geography and environmental history have sought to rehabilitate mining landscapes from their reputation as places of degradation and exploitation-the so-called 'mining imaginary'. We argue that the landscapes of Pine Point epitomise the failures and contradictions of mega-project resource development in the north. While the mine and planned town built to service it flourished for nearly a quarter century, the larger goals of modernisation, industrial development and Aboriginal assimilation were unrealised. Ultimately, the mine's closure in 1988 resulted in the town's abandonment and the removal of the rail link, leaving behind a legacy of environmental destruction that remains unremediated. At Pine Point, the forces of mega-project development joined with modern mining's technologies of 'mass destruction' to produce a deeply scarred and problematic landscape that failed in its quest to bring modern industrialism to the Canadian sub-Arctic.

AB  - This exploratory work seeks to shed light on disaster governance by looking into potential linkages between the production of vulnerability and disaster governance in Chile. Our point of investigation is the case of post-disaster Chaiten and the Chilean model of Disaster Risk Management. The work begins by situating disaster governance and the production of vulnerability in a broader context of existing governance system that includes a multiplicity of actors and socio-economic, socio-ecological, and political processes. Coming from a multi-scalar perspective, we use the disaster Pressure and Release (PAR) model to enable a differentiated analysis of the multiplicity of actors, rules, and processes related to DRM that participate in the production of disaster vulnerability in the current Chaiten. With this we address the questions as to 'why' the Chilean model of DRM is prominently centralised and 'what' are the effects on the production of disaster vulnerability for the case of post-disaster Chaiten.

AB  - This paper assesses the effects of public policies on the occurrence of natural disasters related to extreme rainfall. By using a unique and geolocated database on natural disasters in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I test whether variables related to public policies - e.g. forest cover and urban infrastructure - affect the occurrence of natural disasters, conditional on the existence of extreme rainfall. Results point to a significant role for public policies in order to mitigate effects of extreme weather events. More specifically, results point to an important role for urban infrastructure, as proper sewage and waste collection, and forest cover in reducing the impacts of extreme rainfall. Moreover, I discuss how these heterogeneous effects have distributional consequences and can be linked to the Environmental Justice literature. Finally, this paper reinforces the idea that adaptation policies to disasters are essential in reducing local vulnerabilities and can yield distributional and fiscal benefits.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes prevalence is increasing dramatically across the globe, imposing a tremendous toll on individuals and healthcare systems. Reversing these trends requires comprehensive approaches to address both classical and emerging diabetes risk factors. Recently, environmental toxicants acting as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have emerged as novel metabolic disease risk factors. EDCs implicated in diabetes pathogenesis include various inorganic and organic molecules of both natural and synthetic origin, including arsenic, bisphenol A, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides. Indeed, evidence implicates EDC exposures across the lifespan in metabolic dysfunction; moreover, specific developmental windows exhibit enhanced sensitivity to EDC-induced metabolic disruption, with potential impacts across generations. Importantly, differential exposures to diabetogenic EDCs likely also contribute to racial/ethnic and economic disparities. Despite these emerging links, clinical practice guidelines fail to address this underappreciated diabetes risk factor. Comprehensive approaches to stem the tide of diabetes must include efforts to address its environmental drivers.

AB  - With concepts like structural racism and social determinants of health currently trending in both academic and public discourse, examining the health consequences of legacies of racism in the built environment is increasingly timely. Resource scarcity in neighborhoods and the emergence of resource deserts in urban cities are critical sources of urban social inequality. As research shows how the sociodemographic makeup of neighborhoods can predict resident access to important material resources like grocery stores, pharmacies, and parks, exploring how this lack of access might impact health is imperative. Employing an environmental justice framework, this study brings together scholarship on environmental racism and stress theory to explore the impacts of spatial inequality on health at the neighborhood level. Using public-use data from the American Community Survey (ACS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Provider Identifier (NPI) registry, and local and state government sources, the author examines the influence of co-occurring resource scarcity (i.e., multiply-deserted areas [MDAs]) on health in neighborhoods across urban cities in the American South. Results indicate that MDAs have higher prevalence of physical inactivity, asthma, diabetes, and obesity compared to neighborhoods with low or no resource scarcity. In addition, across MDAs, neighborhoods that are predominantly Black have higher prevalence of physical inactivity, asthma, diabetes, and obesity relative to nonpredominantly Black neighborhoods. Results also suggest that higher income MDAs have lower obesity prevalence compared with low-income MDAs. Findings contribute to a growing area of literature connecting and examining the structural racism-health connection.

The paper argues that the pesticide disaster was the culmination of an agrarian modernization project implemented in the region by the state-owned Plantation Corporation of Kerala (PCK). An exploration of the political ecology of the disaster shows the recolonization of residents and nature by PCK through neocolonial forms of centralized and exclusionary spatial and resource control mechanisms. In this context, the paper questions the glorification of the Kerala model of development from the standpoints of environmental justice and resource rights, relying on the lived experiences of the people of Kasargod.

AB  - Though the often semi-public green spaces of the residential environment, usually created during the building of the houses, are of a pivotal importance for less-mobile people, after-work recreation and healthy development of children, there has been relatively little research on them. Using face-to-face questionnaires, we explored residents' use and perceptions of local greenery in eight disadvantaged neighborhoods of Berlin that are exposed to high loads of environmental stressors and belonging to four relevant building types of Central European cities. We find that the greenery of housing complexes of modernism is highly appreciated by local residents; that residents visit parks not more often than once a week but benefit daily from residential greenery; that passive use (enjoying the sun, fresh air) dominates active (meeting neighbors, exercising); that residents visit parks once per week but benefit daily from residential greenery; that the baseline for judgement differs among respondents with different perspectives on the city (e.g. car drivers vs. users of public transport; active vs. passive users); and that residents are highly attached to place but not to their neighbors. Co-creative involvement of residents in the design and management of the residential greenery in order to encourage social contacts and neighbor's physical activity on the doorstep can bring about change, making residential greenery the social tissue of 'disadvantaged' neighborhoods.

AB  - Turkey's recent venture involving the construction of hundreds of small-scale hydropower projects is a significant trend, both in regard to its contribution to Turkey's hydroelectricity production and the social and environmental impact of these projects at the local level. Turkey's hydropower policy was premised on a conventional understanding of water driven by science, technology, and the market. This approach, however, does not seem to have paid sufficient attention to the socio-ecological characteristics of water. Developing policies from a solely technical perspective creates political, economic, and cultural inequalities that adversely affect the social and ecological realm. Hence, this paper attempts to deconstruct the design, execution, and aftermath of Turkey's small-scale hydropower policy through the lens of the hydro-social cycle. We aim to explain various dimensions of Turkey's small-scale hydropower program in a conceptual framework that merges the concept of the hydro-social cycle with patterns of distributive environmental justice. We find that state-led, techno-centric and market-oriented approaches to water instrumentalize a rhetoric of justice in order to justify the development of small-scale hydropower ventures. Our analysis, however, demonstrates Turkey's small-scale hydropower policy falls short of delivering on its promise of distributive justice in three relevant dimensions, namely the distribution of burdens and benefits, vulnerabilities, and responsibilities at local level.

AB  - Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.

AB  - Wind energy is a key technology in the transition toward a low-carbon society, but acceptance is considered to be a constraining factor in achieving ambitious wind deployment targets. Based on an Austrian case study, this paper investigates eight decisive patterns of acceptance and non-acceptance of wind energy. We apply qualitative research methods, such as interviews, focus groups, and WorldCafe discussions, with stakeholders on the national level and with citizens and local decision-makers at potential wind power expansion sites. The results show that local opposition to wind energy cannot be explained by single factors but is caused by a complex set of individual and collective preferences rooted in institutional and socio-political arrangements. The problem concerning these conflicting patterns is that they are trapped in often opposing or confronting policy core beliefs, which are unlikely to change. Hence, it is necessary to appeal to overarching targets like the claims of environmental justice to counterbalance the impacts of wind energy. We conclude that there is a strong demand for fair decision-making processes and an equal distribution of environmental and economic gains and losses.

AB  - This chapter endeavours to show how scarcity, in the form of limited budgets, as well as competing goals and assessment criteria, can affect the importance of social justice in environmental planning and policy. When distributing a resource or burden, efficiency and equity are often seen to come into conflict. Traditionally, economists have considered efficiency as the primary criterion for allocation decisions, with equity as a secondary concern, because doing otherwise would lead to welfare losses for society. The factors determining the existence of such trade-offs and their severity have not to date been thoroughly explored. This chapter uses two case studies to show that the relationships between social equity and a competing concern (such as economic efficiency) are generally not direct, but mediated by structural factors, such as stakeholders holding different valuation criteria or equity norms, the severity of budget constraints, or the proportion and types of stakeholders affected. Such factors strongly affect the role that equity concerns play in environmental decisions, in some cases resulting in a specific equity norm leading to outcomes that contradict the purpose of that norm; for instance, an egalitarian norm can lead to very unequal outcomes!

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) provision across cities is often assessed from per capita quantities. However these aggregate measures say little about the actual use of UGS because they ignore the relative location of UGS and citizens. Spatial accessibility approaches consider this relative location but mostly assume that benefits happen within close proximity of residences. We challenge this assumption for three European cities comparatively, based on similarly acquired survey data. We study which factors influence how far people travel to their most used UGS, as defined by users themselves. We find that travelled distances (1.4-1.9 km) and inter-city differences are surprisingly high compared to the few hundred meters set in policy targets and accessibility analyses. We identify socio-demographic effects and a role for perceived rather than objective quality of local UGS. More than a spatial interaction trade-off between proximity and size, our results suggest that UGS visits are part of a more complex set of activities, further away from residences and with a diversity of sizes and proximities. Our results call for a re-evaluation of UGS analytical practices and provision policies beyond aggregate and accessibility perspectives, towards multi-scalar and spatially varying measures.

AB  - While calls for 'environmental justice' have grown recently, very little attention has been paid to exactly what the 'justice' of environmental justice refers to, particularly in the realm of social movement demands. Most understandings of environmental justice refer to the issue of equity, or the distribution of environmental ills and benefits. But defining environmental justice as equity is incomplete, as activists, communities, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) call for much more than just distribution. This essay examines how definitions beyond the distributive in these movements can help us develop conceptions of global environmental justice. The argument is that the justice demanded by global environmental justice is really threefold: equity in the distribution of environmental risk, recognition of the diversity of the participants and experiences in affected communities, and participation in the political processes which create and manage environmental policy. The existence of three different notions of justice in the movement, simultaneously, demonstrates the plausibility of a plural yet unified theory and practice of justice.

AB  - This paper analyses the emergence of recent activism in Grangemouth, Scotland's major petrochemical centre and an important BP site since 1924. Today this is a town in crisis. In a mood of growing pessimism and distrust, public doubts about the economic security and environmental safety of the town have provoked increasingly vocal local opposition to planning applications which would extend activity in chemicals while economic diversification is denied. The analysis starts by examining local interpretations of the new activism. The authors then move on to consider three alternative explanatory approaches: Douglas's analysis of 'risk positions'; the emerging 'environmental justice' perspective; and the distinction between 'siting' and 'exposure' in environmental controversies. All have explanatory limitations in this context, as public risk concerns are subsumed within rapidly changing judgements about the town's future prospects.

AB  - While conventional crimes like violence and juvenile delinquency attract most of the criminological interest, eco-crimes receive far less attention. Though the study of environmental harm has flourished in English speaking countries under the term "green criminology" in the past 20 years, a green perspective, however, has hardly been noticed in Germany. This paper will trace the developments to date and subject the fundamental premises of a green criminology of a critical appraisal.

AB  - Transnational debates, for instance on the finiteness of fossil resources and their harmful effects on the climate, are often regarded as interdisciplinary challenges in the social and natural sciences. By contrast, in the past two decades, notably in the 2000s, geography appears to have been forgetful of resources. In this paper it is argued that more attention needs to be paid to resource studies in human geography. It starts by comparing existing understandings and definitions of resources in respect of their usefulness as guiding concepts for research. This is followed by an overview of resource-related debates in various subdisciplines of geography. In (environmental) economic geography, the concept of global production networks has proved helpful for the discussion of problems connected with resources. An adaptation of this concept is presented here which can be used to analyse material and energy flows with the aid of social categories (e.g. such as power relations or governance) and to evaluate them in the light of normative categories (e.g. ecological sustainability or environmental justice).

AB  - This case study investigated the outcomes of an environmental service learning program that incorporated pedagogical components taught within the transformative learning and environmental justice frameworks at an urban ecoliteracy and environmental justice center in Albany, New York. Authors conducted participant observation and gathered data from surveys, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and journaling with high school, college student, and community stakeholders in an Ecojustice Summer Youth Employment Program. In the short-term, service learners adopted enhanced pro-environmental behaviors, an heightened awareness of community environmental issues, and an increased interest in civic engagement, with multiple participants returning for consecutive service periods. Transformative learning outcomes were documented in relation to affirming/changes in longer-term academic, life, and career paths. This research contributes to the field of experiential environmental education that advocates for a better understanding of the outcomes of pedagogies that emphasize social justice youth development, issues of power and justice, and the enhancement of social action and critical consciousness.

AB  - This paper investigates how different dimensions of water - water as a public health concern, as an essential prerequisite for producing livelihoods, and as a cultural heritage or an element of spiritual practice - are taken up in international guidelines and certification schemes for the extractive sector. As a notoriously water-intensive economic activity, mining frequently infringes on other forms of water use. Simultaneously, the legal articulations and governance implications of the hydrological aspects of mining are complex, as commercial interactions associated with mining span the globe, governance efforts occur primarily at the national level and negative externalities manifest locally. Increasingly, transnational initiatives play a role in setting rules and norms for 'responsible' or 'sustainable' mining. We assess to what extent these rules and norms take into account the hydrological implications of mining, looking at eight guideline documents and ten certification schemes for mineral extraction that originate from international organizations, corporate groups, or multi-stakeholder initiatives. We then illustrate the influence of transnational institutions in two cases, one in Mongolia and one in South Africa. Our results show that water as a public health concern receives the most attention while water as a cultural heritage is reflected the least. However, all institutions in our sample that were devised over the last two years refer to the different dimensions of water use comprehensively.

AB  - This special issue relates the key analytical constructs of environmental justice scholarship - distributive justice, procedural justice and environmental racism - to a series of Third World case studies. It calls attention to the need to theorize both distributive burdens and benefits; treat the relative salience of race as a category of differentiation as an empirical question; and examine new avenues of procedural justice that have opened up to transnational environmental justice activists. The basic position advanced in the collection is that the core issues at the heart of environmental justice struggles are universal. In this sense, the case studies presented here should be read not as though they were part of exceptional Third World circumstances, but instead as part of broader patterns of distributive, procedural and racial injustice with global significance.

AB  - While in many cases the benefits of ecosystem services (ES) can be enjoyed on different scales, the provision of ES requires engagement and commitment at the local scale. Therefore, the local level becomes important when thinking about compensation schemes or payments for ecosystem services (PES) as an approach to managing ES. The difficult task of bringing together different actors and institutions at different scales for specific conservation projects at the local level often remains in the hands of intermediaries. In this paper, we investigate the role of a civil society organisation (CSO) as an intermediary organisation in a PES scheme, the Community Blue Carbon Project (CBCP) in Costa Rica. To assess the role of intermediaries in a PES scheme, we rely on social network analysis and examine the position and role of the intermediary organisation. Based on Net-Map interviews, which is an interview-based mapping tool that helps people understand, visualise, discuss and improve situations in which many different actors influence outcomes, we find that the intermediary organisation in the CBCP is composed of several institutional and individual intermediaries who create both formal networks for connecting the international to the local level and informal networks for creating trusting relationships among the actors. Different spatial levels are reflected within the CSO's organisational structure, and the CSO mitigates the distributional, procedural, recognition and contextual aspects of environmental justice.

AB  - This study examines the relative importance of six policy outcomes related to different fairness principles for the perceived fairness and acceptability of pricing policies aimed at changing transport behaviour. The fairness and acceptability of six different types of transport pricing policies were systematically higher if policy outcomes were related to environmental justice and equality. The policy measures were evaluated as more acceptable and fair when respondents believed that future generations, nature and the environment were protected (reflecting environmental justice), and to a lesser extent, when everybody was equally affected by the policy outcomes (reflecting equality), irrespective of absolute differences in fairness and acceptability of the policies. Policy outcomes reflecting egoistic concerns (e. g. being financially worse off and being worse off than others) and equity (e. g. proportional to people's income and contribution to problems) were related to the fairness and acceptability of some policy measures, but no systematic pattern was found across six policy measures. This suggests that policy outcomes related to distributions that focus on collective considerations appear to be more important for the fairness and acceptability of transport pricing policies than those focusing on individual interests. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - This introduction as well as this entire special issue begin with the idea that for leisure scholars to stay relevant in our current society, the topic of digital leisure spaces and cultures should become a central rather than periphery focus. We suggest three courses of action for leisure scholars engaging in digital leisure scholarship: 1) We should emphasize what people do with the majority of their leisure time, 2) we should study it in a way that is timely and accessible, and 3) we should do so with a focus on social and environmental justice. This article introduces the special edition by providing a review of the key theorists currently working on digital leisure studies and an introduction of key concepts. We conclude with a Wikipedia page on digital leisure studies and an invitation to you, our reader, to help us write, think, and theorize the future of digital leisure studies.

AB  - This study examines the distributional equity of urban tree canopy (UTC) cover for Baltimore, MD, Los Angeles, CA, New York, NY, Philadelphia, PA, Raleigh, NC, Sacramento, CA, and Washington, D.C. using high spatial resolution land cover data and census data. Data are analyzed at the Census Block Group levels using Spearman's correlation, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), and a spatial autoregressive model (SAR). Across all cities there is a strong positive correlation between UTC cover and median household income. Negative correlations between race and UTC cover exist in bivariate models for some cities, but they are generally not observed using multivariate regressions that include additional variables on income, education, and housing age. SAR models result in higher r-square values compared to the OLS models across all cities, suggesting that spatial autocorrelation is an important feature of our data. Similarities among cities can be found based on shared characteristics of climate, race/ethnicity, and size. Our findings suggest that a suite of variables, including income, contribute to the distribution of UTC cover. These findings can help target simultaneous strategies for UTC goals and environmental justice concerns.

AB  - This paper explores whether the risk of a toxic release during transport is greater in poor and minority neighborhoods using a combination of mapping and statistical methods. Cluster analysis is used to examine the density of facilities and transport spill events as well as test for the spatial covariance between facilities and spills. Strong clustering of transport spills is evident, as well as clustering between factory sites and transport spills. A spatial model demonstrates raised rates of transport spills surrounding clusters of toxic firms. Most spills in Los Angeles occurred within 2 km of an intermodal facility. The last step of the analysis compares risk and facility clustering between neighborhoods and socio-economic groups, finding that hazmat spills during transport disproportionately occur in Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The results clarify the spatial distribution of risk and nuisance from freight in urban landscapes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trinidad and Tobago is an oil exporting small island developing state (SIDS) with a 0.12% contribution to global emissions and with important socio-economic challenges. It has producer, electricity and transport fuel subsidies. It is at an interesting juncture in subsidy reform: the government faces the embeddedness of distributive justice norms that are contested by fiscal prudence and environmental stewardship norms. The value of the paper is twofold. First it develops a subsidy intractability framework to explain reform global narratives that highlights: the power of agents, the nature of contested economic, justice and environmental norms and the availability of mechanisms for reform. Second, this framework is used to explain reform narratives and trajectories in Trinidad and Tobago using data from public documents and from a unique elite survey of former and present heads of state, politicians, policy makers and stakeholders. Even in conditions of falling oil prices and national revenue and pressures to reduce emissions, where redistributive justice arguments are heavily embedded in public discourses, those aspects of the subsidy that have developmental or distributive justice goals are more intractable. The results of the study have implications for carbon emission reduction strategies in developing states with fossil fuel reserves.

The article charts how Caribbean vulnerability to temperature rises of more than 1.5 degrees C of warming comprise an existential threat structured by contemporary social relations that are imperialist in character. Hope can be taken from a politics of climate justice which acknowledges the climate debts owed to the region.

AB  - Unsustainable production systems can exacerbate the negative consequences of deforestation and land use change, increasing the vulnerability of local populations to environmental or economic crises. We developed and applied a participatory method to assess the sustainability of agricultural production systems in the Chaco region of Northern Argentina. We used a combination of theoretical, methodological, and analytical approaches. The theoretical foundation of our study was Elinor Ostrom's general framework for analyzing the sustainability of social-ecological systems (SESs). Our main methodological tool was a participatory, empirical, semi-quantitative multi-criteria decision making methodology based on expert meetings, field trips, and semi-structured interviews. We also made use of a political ecology approach to situate our case study and put our empirical results in perspective by relating them to issues of power and environmental justice. Our findings suggest that local farmers perceive their production systems as barely sustainable, with variables such as type of activity and farm size, among others, clearly influencing their sustainability estimations. Sustainability seems dependent on the skills and organization abilities of local farmers, with the State failing to provide sufficient basic infrastructure and enabling services. Our method could inform policy making aimed at improving the sustainability of agricultural practices in the region.

AB  - We assessed concurrent exposure to a mixture of >50 environmental chemicals by measuring the chemicals or their metabolites in the blood of 43 ethnically diverse children (3-6 years of age) from a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood in Minneapolis. Over a 2-year period, additional samples were collected every 6-12 months from as many children as possible. We analyzed blood samples for 11 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 2 heavy metals (lead and mercury, 11 organochlorine (OC) pesticides or related compounds, and 30 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. The evidence suggests that numerous VOCs originated from common sources, as did many PCBs. Longitudinal measurements indicate that between-child variance was greater than within-child variance for two VOCs (benzene, toluene), for both heavy metals (Pb, Hg), for all detectable OC pesticides, and for 15 of the measured PCB congeners (74, 99, 101, 118, 138-158, 146, 153, 156, 170, 178, 180, 187, 189, 194, 195). Despite the relatively small sample size, highest measured blood levels of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, styrene, m-/p-xylene, Pb, Hg, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), trans-nonachlor, and PCB congeners 74, 99, 105, 118, 138, 146, 153, 156, 170, and 180 were comparable with or higher than 95th percentile measurements of older children and adults from national surveys. Results demonstrate that cumulative exposures to multiple environmental carcinogens and neurotoxins can be comparatively high for children from a poor inner-city neighborhood.

AB  - We examine the social resistance against large dams as environmental justice movements in four case studies - the Sardar Sarovar Project from India, the Hidrosogamoso from Colombia, the 'new water culture' movement in Spain, and the Lesotho Highlands Project from Lesotho - with diverse social, political and environmental contexts. We discuss three broad issues. First, the nature of the involvement of civil society and metropolitan intelligentsia in leadership roles. Second, how cross-class and multi-sectoral alliances have been forged between the local and the global. And third, how the notion of environmental justice in relation to social justice is adopted in these movements.

AB  - Water rights trading is an effective way to optimize the allocation of water resources. However, the existing practice of water rights trading in China lacks any consideration of the practical value of the exchanged water. This deficiency may lead to disputes between transferor and transferee during the implementation of the water rights trading contract. This paper puts forward the concept of Standard Water (SW). First, getting the original value of exchanged water by the shadow price model based on input-output table; Second, based on the original value, building the economic profits or costs model to obtain the practical value of exchanged water; Third, establishing SW quantity measurement model according to the principle of rewarding excellence and punishing inferiority, so as to convert the water quantity of exchanged water into SW quantity. With the standardization method, this paper takes the water rights transaction between Dongyang City and Yiwu City in 2000 as an example to carry out case study, and provides policy recommendations. The results show that when the contract requires the provision of 49.999 million m(3) water of Class I the quality, if the exchanged water quality provided is in Class II-V, the corresponding SW will be decreased to 48.699-37.399 million m(3). The application of this research will be conducive to ensuring the fairness and durability of the water rights trading processes.

AB  - Using descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, one-way ANOVA, and an environmental justice lens, we considered the social and physical vulnerability factors associated with climate change and flood-related disaster declarations for Alaska Native Villages (ANVs), which are indigenous communities. We found that, on average, compared with communities not involved in disaster declarations, communities with disaster declarations between 1977 and 2014 had lower elevation, more exposure to erosion, less precipitation in summer and fall, larger populations, less population growth, a higher percentage of youth, larger household size, a higher percentage of Alaska Natives, more population below the poverty level, and lower per capita income. This finding is positive, because it suggests that, collectively, communities with greater vulnerability are getting more disaster declarations, which come with disaster aid. However, some of the most vulnerable communities may not be getting all the help they need. In particular, southwestern communities along the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers were statistically more likely to get disaster declarations than were ANVs that received attention in the media and the literature for their vulnerability.

AB  - This paper describes a novel school-based, visual environmental public health educational intervention intended to help reduce the exposure of children-and adults-to outdoor air pollution, including known environmental asthma triggers like ozone and particles. The overarching goal was to enhance the learning, recreational, and work environments of students and staff, The specific purpose of the Asthma-Friendly Outdoor (Ambient) Air Quality Flag Program was to establish an education and communication tool for Central California communities that would accomplish two things: 1) Establish permanent local policy change to existing operating procedures in school districts and schools to help reduce the exposure of students, teachers, staff, and nearby communities to outdoor environmental asthma triggers and 2) provide education on air quality and potential health effects of exposure to air pollutants. Data on the program from its initial years are presented, To date, the following important lessons have been learned: 1) Science-based, simple, visual, low-cost school-based educational interventions to help reduce human exposure to outdoor environmental asthma triggers (i.e., ozone, particles, and pollens) can work in socioeconomically and ethnic. ally diverse urban and rural or agricultural communities, and 2) local health and environmental justice groups such as asthma coalitions can successfully lead school-based environmental interventions to help improve children's quality of life.

AB  - This study presents a proof-of-concept agent-based model (ABM) of health vulnerability to long-term exposure to airborne particulate pollution, specifically to particles less than 10 micrometres in size (PM10), in Seoul, Korea. We estimated the differential effects of individual behaviour and social class across heterogeneous space in two districts, Gwanak and Gangnam. Three scenarios of seasonal PM10 change (business as usual: BAU, exponential increase: INC, and exponential decrease: DEC) and three scenarios of resilience were investigated, comparing the vulnerability rate both between and within each district. Our first result shows that the vulnerable groups in both districts, including those aged over 65, aged under 15, and with a low education level, increased sharply after 5,000 ticks (each tick corresponding to 1 day). This implies that disparities in health outcomes can be explained by socioeconomic status (SES), especially when the group is exposed over a long period. Additionally, while the overall risk population was larger in Gangnam in the AC100 scenarios, the recovery level from resilience scenarios decreased the risk population substantially, for example from 7.7% to 0.7%. Our second finding from the local-scale analysis indicates that most Gangnam sub-districts showed more variation both spatially and in different resilience scenarios, whereas Gwanak areas showed a uniform pattern regardless of earlier prevention. The implication for policy is that, while some areas, such as Gwanak, clearly require urgent mitigating action, areas like Gangnam may show a greater response to simpler corrections, but aggregating up to the district scale may miss particular areas that are more at risk. Future work should consider other pollutants as well as more sophisticated population and pollution modelling, coupled with explicit representation of transport and more careful treatment of individual doses and the associated health responses.

AB  - We develop a framework to conceptualize the multiple ways forests contribute to poverty reduction and inform development interventions in forest landscapes. We identify five key strategies for reducing poverty in forest landscapes: a) improvements in productivity (P) of forest land and labor; b) governance reform to strengthen community, household and women's rights (R) over forests and land; c) investments (1) in institutions, infrastructure and public services that facilitate forest-based entrepreneurship; d) increased access to markets (M) for timber or non-timber forest products; and e) mechanisms that enhance and enable the flow of benefits from forest ecosystem services (E) to the poor. We test the utility of the framework through a review of the forestry portfolio of the World Bank Group, the largest public investor in forestry. Many of these projects include several, but not all, PRIME components. We devote particular attention to forest-related investments in two contrasting countries, Vietnam and Mexico, to examine synergies among the pathways. Results suggest that each strategy in the PRIME framework may play an important role in alleviating poverty, but pronounced impacts may require multiple pathways to be jointly pursued. The PRIME framework can guide research to address knowledge gaps on pathways to prosperity in forest landscapes, serve as an easily remembered checklist for managers, and nudge forest program designers in government and development organizations, who are interested in poverty reduction, to focus on the importance of both a comprehensive framework and synergies across different pathways.

AB  - This study builds upon earlier work to investigate diversity and intersectionality among 39 extensively burdened communities. Thirteen different types of hazardous facilities were mapped onto census maps for the nine-county Philadelphia MSA. Using 2000 census data, each of 366 communities was classified as to its racial/ethnic composition, its social class status and its location (bordering the Delaware River, on a rail line, in urban, inner-ring, or outer-ring suburban communities). Risk for extensive burdening and mean number of hazards was calculated for each community type. Location in the city and in industrialised areas near the Delaware River appears to intersect with disadvantage and with racial/ethnic status to boost risk for burdening, while substantially White racial composition, affluence and location near rail lines and in the outer suburbs decrease risk and the number of hazardous facilities. However, more diversity was found among burdened communities than previous research would indicate.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) offer a wide range of ecosystem services to city dwellers, contributing to their health and well-being. The resources of formally designated UGS, such as parks and forests, are frequently under-provided, however. This results in unequal access to UGS, which has become an environmental justice issue. We investigated the potential of informal green spaces (IGS) to complement existing formal UGS to reduce distributional inequity in UGS availability. We focused on the most vulnerable groups of citizens, children and elderly residents, for whom the availability of UGS plays a particularly important role. The study was performed in two Eastern-European cities, Warsaw and Lodi, both characterised by a well-developed system of UGS but of different spatial composition and UGS configuration. We focus on unmanaged areas within IGS and link them to the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services, such as enabling direct contact with nature. We identified different categories of formal and informal UGS based on publicly available data, supported by NDVI values, followed by UGS availability analysis of formal and informal UGS in the service area of 300 m for each residential building. We found that informal UGS are equally important as formal ones, and they may contribute to better access to selected urban ecosystem services. Both cities are characterised by unequal distribution of formal UGS. In Lodi, children are least favoured in terms of UGS availability, while in Warsaw, elderly citizens are most excluded. In both cities, it is the green areas associated with transportation routes communication routes, multifamily housing and agricultural lands along with grasslands that have the greatest potential to improve the equal availability of UGS to residents. We propose maintaining various types of unmanaged green areas in cities to help limit disparities to UGS access, and it would also increase their importance in the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services.

AB  - This essay explores shifting scientific understandings of fish and the evolution of fisheries science, and it grapples with colonialism as a system of power. We trace the rise of fisheries science to a time when Western nation-states were industrializing fishing fleets and competing for access to distant fishing grounds. A theory of fishing called "maximum sustainable yield" (MSY) that understands fish species in aggregate was espoused. Although alternatives to MSY have been developed, decision-making continues to be informed by statistical models developed within fisheries science. A challenge for structured management systems now rests in attending to different systems of knowledge and addressing local objectives, values, and circumstances. To deepen and illustrate key points, we examine Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and the expansion of commercial herring fisheries and state-led management in British Columbia, Canada. A feedback between colonialism and fisheries science is evident: colonialism generated the initial conditions for expansion and has been reinforced through the implementation of approaches and tools from fisheries science that define and quantify conservation in particular ways. Some features may be unique to the herring illustration, but important aspects of the feedback are more broadly generalizable. We propose three interconnected goals: (a) transform the siloed institutions and practices of Western science, (b) reimagine and rebuild pathways between information (including diverse values and perspectives) and decision-making, and (c) devolve governance authority and broaden governance processes such that multiple ways of knowing share equal footing.

AB  - This paper contributes to nascent efforts to highlight the urban dimensions of global environmental change (GEC) and human security to reflect humankind's now predominantly urban locus. Following an overview of key issues and concerns within recent urban research relevant to human security, we draw attention to appropriate conceptual frameworks and methodological tools for understanding risk and vulnerability in the context of acute inequalities, poverty and the unsustainability of contemporary urbanism. This requires a combination of political, ecological and sustainable livelihoods analysis, linked to agendas of social and environmental justice. Key urban challenges for human security in the context of GEC relate to overall ecological footprints, maintaining institutional and infrastructural integrity, and safeguarding shelter, utilities, economic activities and livelihoods. These take on somewhat different complexions in coastal and inland urban areas. Although in wealthier parts of the world urbanization has generally stabilized or declined, it continues to increase in many poorer regions as a result of complex forces and processes. These increasingly include mobility to escape rural impoverishment and hunger through the adverse effects of GEC on rural livelihoods. The challenge of providing for large in-migrant populations in expanding cities with inadequate resourcing, while at the same time seeking to mitigate and adapt to the effects of GEC, is likely to create threats to political stability and human security in many contexts.

AB  - This critical assessment of climate adaptation and transformation challenges, agendas and actions across Africa draws on the principal findings and analyses of the papers in this special issue of COSUST. Situated in the context of the broader conceptual and comparative literature, we structure our analysis around three themes, namely conceptual and analytical approaches; the research environment; and challenges of implementation. African climate change research reflects diverse mixtures of local priorities and international trends, often with some time lag. The research reviewed and represented in this special issue reveals clear gaps and weaknesses in relation to gendered understandings, approaches to environmental valuation, and climate and environmental justice. Implementational challenges range from resource constraints and perceived conflicts between meeting immediate development needs and longer term climate change action to lack of policy integration and effective governance. The potential importance of socio-ecological and technological transformations remains very largely unexplored and a sea change in attitudes and attention is required if the adaptation challenges are to be met.

AB  - Where environmental procedures do not adequately include affected parties in decision-making, particularly those from vulnerable and marginalized sectors of society, environmental justice cannot be realized, Further, the practice of EIA will likely perpetuate the negative and disproportionate distribution of environmentally associated harms on vulnerable persons. Thus, this paper explores the potential merits of the capabilities approach for establishing sufficiency grounds for public participation in environmental impact assessment (EIA). The paper identifies shared principles of justice in decision-making between the practice of EIA and the capabilities approach by highlighting key ethical and theoretical concepts of the latter as a means to fortify this weakness in the participation practice of EIA. Capability probes explore individual stakeholder's opportunity, ability and constraints to participation. The findings of four South African (EIA) case studies are discussed, highlighting the instrumental relationship between participatory actions, potentials and entitlements as they are mediated by empowering or disempowering procedural mechanisms. Cases exhibiting convincing stakeholder empowerment demonstrate the value of sufficient support for participatory achievement. Instances of disempowerment in the cases underscore the dangers of insufficient and inequitable participation. Reflecting on the findings, the work applies the recent notions of capability 'sufficiency' (Nielsen and Axelsen, 2016) to outline what can be delimited, and later contextually specified, for support provisions in EIA building towards more meaningful, and perhaps more just, public participation processes.

AB  - This chapter explores the role of ecotourism in the sustainable development of protected areas. It specifically examines the aims of ecotourism in simultaneously contributing to economic development and environmental sustainability in protected areas. The chapter further analyzes protected areas within the ecological, human, and institutional dimensions, and demonstrates how the outcomes of ecotourism are linked to the economic, social, and environmental pillars that drive sustainable development. The chapter also discusses challenges surrounding the sustainability of ecotourism in protected areas and several mitigation strategies. It concludes that while ecotourism aims for economic development it can have detrimental effects on the ecological resources and host communities if not managed in a strategic sustainable way. The chapter recommends that ecotourism in protected areas should be carried out within the realm of environmental justice where all stakeholders and the natural environment are treated with respect and equity.

AB  - This paper reviews efforts at defining, conceptualizing and demarcating the periurban. We draw on different perspectives in conceptualizing and defining the periurban, employing a combination of primary data and a review of the global literature on periurban processes. The primary data is a result of longitudinal research following an empirically inductive approach to arrive at this understanding of a periurban space and dynamics. The literature on the experience of periurbanization in India and other cities around the globe has been drawn upon; we look at different approaches and methods used to delineate, define and characterize periurban spaces as well as to address the governance and natural resource management challenges confronted by them. The limitations of these approaches are described. We conclude by making a case for a deeper understanding of the processes of transition underway in periurban contexts. These should inform approaches to policy and interventions, as well as shape efforts at theorizing about the periurban.

AB  - Wastewater treatment by-products (WTBP), such as sewage sludge (SS) may be used to enhance soil chemical, physical, and biological properties. These enhanced soil properties, in turn, could from its source of production to its site of application. These concerns may be mitigated by incineration of the SS to produce ash (SSA) and dissolved in water and stored in ponds as contribute to an increase in plant growth, production, mineral nutrition. Some SS is difficult to handle due to bad odor in its raw state and has large mass, hence expensive for transportation weathered SSA (WSSA). A greenhouse study was conducted using Candler fine sand CFS; (CFS; pH = 6.8) and Ogeechee loamy sand OLS; (pH = 5.2) with application of either 0, 24.7, 49.4, 98.8, or 148.2 Mg ha(-1) as either SS, SSA, or WSSA to evaluate the biomass production and elemental composition responses of sorghum-sudan grass (Sorghum vulgaris var. Sudanese hitche). Shoot and root biomass were 2 to 3 fold greater in the soil amended with SS, than either SSA or WSSA. Concentrations of nutrient and trace elements in the shoots and roots increased with increasing rates of amendments. Application of these by-products up to 98.8Mg ha(-1) rate did not adversely affect growth or accumulation of trace elements in sorghum-sudan grass. Long-term field studies are recommended to investigate the potential leaching of various elements from the amended soils in addition to evaluation of plant growth and production responses to determine the acceptable rates of these by-products as amendments to agricultural soils.

AB  - This paper examines the role of public participation mechanisms in certain major environmental disasters. It examines situations in which people's lifestyles or their lives have been directly threatened, and thus elicited citizen participation. Threatening issues often seem morally, physically, socially, economically, religiously, and otherwise unacceptable to a group. As will be presented in this paper, citizens voluntarily participate in a community activity when they see that their way of life has been threatened. An introductory historical perspective, the legal framework upon which it is based, and background information on the participatory mechanisms, all emphasizing the importance and need for empowering citizens with participatory skills so as to bring changes in the existing educational, legal, and social systems are presented. The major environmental accidents/disasters of Minamata, Japan; Bhopal, India; Seveso, Italy; Chernobyl, Ukraine; and Exxon-Valdez, Alaska are discussed, mainly to indicate the reaction, and the participatory mechanisms used by the affected communities in each of the sudden disasters that occurred. If citizens worldwide had been active participants in the environmental issues, it is quite possible that we would have experienced fewer environmental accidents.

AB  - This paper observes how the social, political and legal life of rights continues to evolve in response to growing natural resource scarcity and deteriorating climate conditions worldwide. In particular, it assesses the type of interpretive repertoires actors bring to bear on issues of justice between generations and human rights eligibility, documenting arguments put forward in defense, as well as against assigning a rights status to those not yet born. It notes how scientific research documenting the 'forcing effects' of escalating atmospheric pollution on long-term planetary wellbeing triggers a new conversation on the limits of traditional approaches to environmental justice and highlights the need to consider once again how a more long-term perspectivism on duties, rights and responsibilities can be institutionally applied.

AB  - This paper considers the concept of environmental justice in Scotland. It reviews the research and developments in law and policy in this area, starting with the Dynamic Earth speech in Edinburgh in 2002. It analyses the findings by grouping causes and solutions to environmental justice and identifies a particularly wide definition of the concept in Scotland. It concludes that the inclusion of social justice is a defining feature of environmental justice in Scotland; however, measures to mitigate environmental injustice are being implemented in an incremental way, with the most significant achievements being through the implementation of international obligations.

AB  - Urban agriculture is widely promoted as a strategy to advance sustainability goals. Urban community gardens serve as multifunctional green infrastructure, providing an array of social and environmental co-benefits. While these services, such as increased access to nutritious food, have been studied extensively, research on siting community gardens remains sparse, especially in their multifunctional roles. This paucity is significant because the spatial distribution of gardens determines which residents benefit from them, the long-term garden success, and the multiple co-benefits for neighborhoods and metropolitan areas. To overcome potential biases related to decisions made ad hoc or by community requests, this study presents a systematic stakeholder-driven approach for strategic urban community garden siting through Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), reducing thousands of potential parcels to a small number for subsequent in-depth site analysis. We apply this methodology in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Utilizing local stakeholder-weighted criteria, we develop siting indices that incorporate physical and sociodemographic factors that either contribute to site potential or represent priority locations for gardens. The resulting indices-a Social Characteristics Index, Physical Setting Index, and Comprehensive Index-are applied to an expansive inventory of vacant candidate parcels across the metro. The three indices identify moderate to high-scoring parcels within the urban core, but siting scores diverge towards the urban fringe. When tasked with assessing the siting criteria comprehensively, stakeholders prioritize social criteria. Thus, the Social Characteristics and Comprehensive indices prioritize disadvantaged communities in the urban core, potentially excluding aspiring gardeners who live in suburbs. This highlights a potential tradeoff between planning urban community gardens to maximize desired co-benefits and other siting criteria that may influence long-term success.

AB  - This paper examines climate justice from the perspective of three remote indigenous Carib communities located in northeastern St. Vincent, amidst their vulnerability to climatic hazards. The study contributes to the growing body of literature that explores the impacts climate-induced changes are having on Indigenous peoples through its explicit focus on this distinctive social group. The paper entails a detail case study of the particular ways the recent onset of two consecutive extreme weather events have impacted livelihood activities in these traditional farming villages. Primary data were collected in the aftermath of a severe drought that was followed by Hurricane Tomas in 2010, using a mixed method approach involving a questionnaire survey of 311 households, 70 unstructured interviews and 2 focus group sessions held in each of the three communities. The combined impact of these extreme weather events not only brought to light how exposed and sensitive these communities are to climatic hazards, but also illustrated some of the underlying issues driving vulnerability at the local scale that must be dealt with if climate justice is to be achieved. We argue that the factors driving vulnerability within these communities are partly a function of centuries of economic neglect and political marginalization and are also strongly related to the communities' characteristically lower-socio economic status, geographic location, heavy reliance on land-based resources, coupled with a range of cognitive barriers that affect residents' capacity to adapt to a changing and variable regional climate regime.

AB  - Through complex interactions and feedback processes between coastal ecological and social components at different temporal and spatial scales, coastal environments coproduce a range of ecosystem services (ES) and benefit different social groups. In these highly populated areas, multiple actors, interests, and activities coexist, leading to intensified conflicts between stakeholders. The research presented here aims to understand how coastal social-ecological complexity is studied within coastal ES literature. A systematic review of the literature consisting of 199 manuscripts was performed using the PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The results show that coastal ES research has been focused on understanding ecological processes for ES provision and value. Hence, coastal ES studies fall short of considering the social components and social-ecological interactions of coastal systems: ES flows, demand, coproduction, power relations, institutions and governance, temporal and spatial scales, value pluralism, uncertainty, and human well-being multidimensions and distribution. The partial integration of social-ecological complexity within coastal ES research limits coastal ES management because nonlinear interactions among social and ecological components are not well understood, particularly stakeholders' relations, their roles, and the links to ES. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates the gaps identified during the review. The framework places coproduction and power relations as the core factors of assessments of coastal ES, as means to understand complex, nonlinear social-ecological interactions and feedback processes. Hence, it also provides necessary tools to address normative issues of coastal management such as control, access, trade-offs, and benefits.

AB  - Wildlife trade is an increasing problem worldwide, whether legal or illegal. It causes species extinction, connects to organized crime and contributes to social unrest. Wildlife trade is regulated through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a convention that includes most of the countries in the world. Even though wildlife trade is not necessarily breach of any law, wildlife trade still constitutes severe breaches of species justice, ecojustice, environmental justice, and animal rights. By employing these perspectives in the study of wildlife trade, the harms nonhuman animals suffer as victims of this trade receives a broader concern than that encompassed through conventional criminology. This article addresses nonhuman animal victimization through a theoretical lens that includes the justice perspective found in green criminology, and Nussbaum's concept of dignified existence. Empirically the article is based on an ongoing research project: Criminal Justice, Wildlife Conservation, and Animal rights in the Anthropocene (CRIMEANTHROP). The article starts with an introduction, followed by theoretical outlining and a presentation of empirical findings. These findings are discussed using the theoretical perspectives mentioned above. The concluding discussion suggests a radical shift in the function of CITES, from trade to conditional aid.

AB  - Understanding the environmental justice implications of the mortality impacts of air pollution exposure is a public health priority, as some subpopulations may face a disproportionate health burden. We examined which residential environmental and social factors may affect disparities in the air pollution-mortality relationship in North Carolina, US, using a time-stratified case-crossover design. Results indicate that air pollution poses a higher mortality risk for some persons (e.g., elderly) than others. Our findings have implications for environmental justice regarding protection of those who suffer the most from exposure to air pollution and policies to protect their health.

AB  - This qualitative social media framing analysis captures the discursive engagement with COVID-19 in Fridays for Future's (FFF) digital protest communication on Facebook. In offering comparative insights from 457 posts across 29 public pages from FFF collectives in the European Union, this study offers the first analysis of social movement frames employed by FFF during the pandemic. By coding all Corona-related messages across collectives, we chart three framing processes: adaptation (compliance, solidarity), reframing (reclaiming the crisis, nexus between climate and health), and mobilization (sustained involvement, digital protest alternatives). We discuss our findings alongside social movement framing theory, including frame bridging and scope enlargement to accommodate the pandemic topicality into FFF's environmental master frame, and frame development by FFF movement leaders. This study thus provides key insights into discursive shifts in social movements brought on by external crises that threaten to marginalize the cause and demobilize adherents.

AB  - This paper uses an environmental justice framework to explore whether existing vulnerabilities in Puerto Rico are associated with the rate of electricity restoration after Hurricane Maria. Based on the literature discussing the relationship between vulnerability and environmental justice, we expected that the areas identified as vulnerable to environmental injustice would recover more slowly than less vulnerable areas. We use regression analysis to analyze how well three vulnerability indices based on environmental justice variables predict electricity restoration. We also map the resulting data to spatially situate recovery patterns. This analysis produces mixed evidence of our predictions. In addition to environmental justice factors, other factors, such as terrain and proximity to electric transmission lines, also affected recovery rates, complicating the narrative of recovery. These findings suggest that policymakers seeking to mitigate vulnerability to electricity outages in the wake of natural disasters should incorporate environmental justice analysis in their recovery prioritization decisions, and that this analysis should be contextually specific to the recovery area. Our analysis also includes the construction of environmental justice indices, which have the potential to be a useful advocacy tool for communities seeking to uncover the priorities of stakeholders engaged in recovery.

AB  - Though it is far from obvious, concepts from justice, philosophy, and ethics can significantly inform energy consumers and producers. This study details how energy justice can serve as a novel conceptual tool for philosophers and ethicists that better integrates usually distinct distributive and procedural justice concerns. Energy justice serves as an important analytical tool for energy researchers striving to understand how values get built into energy systems or to resolve common energy problems. Energy justice presents a useful decision-making tool that can assist energy planners and consumers in making more informed energy choices. Our energy justice framework has elements of Kantian ethics, which takes each person as an end. It has libertarian elements of freedom and choice, suggesting that good societies present people with a set of opportunities or substantial freedoms, so they can choose to exercise these or not. It is pluralist about value, holding that capabilities for people are different and also that their own interests vary. It is concerned with justice as recognition, noting that failures of procedural justice can result in discrimination and marginalization. It, also, has elements focused on utilitarianism and welfare, attempting to improve the quality of life for all people, as defined by their capabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While controversial plans for fossil fuel pipeline-building continue across Indigenous lands without consent, how are visual practices - including watching and witnessing - serving as modes of resistance? Drawing on a participant-observation ethnography over the 2018-2021 period with environmental defenders on Coast Salish land, in what is colonially called 'British Columbia, Canada', this article offers a lens for exploring visual realms of resistance amid expanding extractivism, police surveillance and reconfigured pipeline opposition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grassroots photography in land-based monitoring, artistic communication in and around courtrooms and other visual practices have been serving as powerful inflection points, countering multiple facets of petro-colonialism - ecological destruction, health threats, and moral and legal transgressions by companies and state institutions. They have also been stimulating new collective actions, some led by Indigenous land protectors extending longstanding traditions of protecting human and non-human life. As 'more-than-representational', visual encounters can be active players in constructing knowledge, challenging structures of dispossession, genocide and ecocide, and cultivating understandings of care, sovereignty, climate justice and anti-colonial solidarity from heterogeneous vantage points. Some environmental defenders' visual creativities invite deep reflection on ontologies rooted in reciprocity and respect that are thoroughly ignored in extractivist settler-colonial cultures. The article situates visual strategies in fraught political contexts of ramped-up police and corporate surveillance targeting Indigenous land protectors and other environmental defenders, underscoring critical concern about superficial optical allyship and hollow gestures by state actors responding to racism and state violence on Indigenous land. It calls for attention to dialectical relationships amongst state visual tactics and counter-hegemonic visual practices in struggles to resist colonial energy regimes and to cultivate efforts towards alternative, less destructive energy futures.

AB  - Visual practices of representing fossil fuel projects are entangled in diverse values and relations that often go underexplored. In Canada, visual media campaigns to aggressively push forward the fossil fuel industry not only relegate to obscurity indigenous values but mask evidence on health impacts as well as the aspirations of those most affected, including indigenous communities whose food sovereignty and stewardship relationship to the land continues to be affronted by oil pipeline expansion. The Tsleil-Waututh Nation, based at the terminal of the Trans Mountain Pipeline in Canada, has been at the forefront of struggles against the pipeline expansion. Contributing to geographical, environmental studies, and public health research grappling with the performativity of images, this article explores stories conveying health, environmental, and intergenerational justice concerns on indigenous territory. Adapting photovoice techniques, elders and youth illustrated how the environment has changed over time; impacts on sovereignty-both food sovereignty and more broadly; concepts of health, well-being and deep cultural connection with water; and visions for future relationships. We explore the importance of an intergenerational lens of connectedness to nature and sustainability, discussing visual storytelling not just as visual counter-narrative (to neocolonial extractivism) but also as an invitation into fundamentally different ways of seeing and interacting.

It contributes to the extant literature by examining if the political representation of Latinos influences levels of inspections for Hispanic populations. Using data from the Integrated Database for Enforcement Analysis (IDEA), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), this paper examines patterns of state enforcement of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) nationwide from 2005 to 2011 to determine if there are disparities in levels of inspections. Using zero-inflated negative binomial models, results indicate minimal evidence of ethnic or class-based disparities in enforcement of the RCRA during this time period. However, there is evidence indicating weaker enforcement efforts in African American counties.

AB  - Understanding how ecological distribution conflicts (EDCs) have changed through the transition from socialism to capitalism in the European semi-periphery can provide valuable lessons for global efforts towards sustainability. This article traces the social, political and economic origins of EDCs, and evaluates the outcomes of the 74 most illustrative cases of such conflicts from five ex-Yugoslav countries reported in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJatlas): Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. It analyses how the occurrence and characteristics of the conflicts changed through three distinct phases in the region's history, i.e., the periods of Socialism (1945-1990), Transition (1991-2003), and EU-accession (2004-present), each characterised by different socio-metabolic, political and institutional profiles. The article also evaluates the level of environmental justice (EJ) in the region. The greatest diversity of conflicts were identified in the last phase, a period characterised by an increase in material and energy flows through a number of controversial projects, many of which arose as a result of 'modernisation'. Fortunately, the resulting 'unsustainabilities' were immediately politicised by EJ movements, whose composition, demands and success differed in line with changing dominant political and institutional conditions. Currently, the EJ movements in ex-Yugoslavia are led by national NGOs, while urban movements embrace the broadest spectrum of socio-environmental issues. Timely mobilisation and support from local authorities have been crucial for the successful resolution of conflicts. However, EJ movements have proved impotent to resist projects deemed to be of national economic interest in contexts characterised by high levels of corruption and low political accountability. Stronger alliances among different movements would assure more EJ and lasting sustainability solutions in the region.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of public engagement in environmental risk contexts through a rhetorical analysis of the key term "community" in a risk assessment of mining-caused soil contamination. Drawing on Burke's concept of terministic screens and method of cluster criticism, the analysis shows the divergent constitutions of "community" in the Sudbury Soils Study's official discourse and the citizen-activist rhetoric of the Community Committee on the Sudbury Soils Study. Tracing the verbal and visual clusters within each organization's articulation of "community" as place and people reveals how the official Study's technical-regulatory ideology of environmental risk and citizen participation is countered by the Community Committee's contestatory environmental justice ideology. These competing views of "community" are mutually constitutive in that the official Study's mainstream risk discourse establishes the terms for the Community Committee's reactive counter-discourse, thus limiting citizen participation mainly to questions of "downstream" impacts. Our rhetorical analysis of "community" suggests a generative method for understanding the complex power relations animating specific risk communication contexts as well as for potentially reinventing "community" in terms more conducive to meaningful citizen engagement.

AB  - Toxic chemicals - "toxicants" - have been studied and regulated as single entities, and, carcinogens aside, almost all toxicants, single or mixed and however altered, have been thought harmless in very low doses or very weak concentrations. Yet much work in recent decades has shown that toxicants can injure wildlife, laboratory animals, and humans following exposures previously expected to be harmless. Additional work has shown that toxicants can act not only individually and cumulatively but also collectively and even synergistically and that they affect disadvantaged communities inordinately - and therefore, as argued by reformers, unjustly. As late as December 2016, the last full month before the inauguration of a president promising to rescind major environmental regulations, the United States federal environmental-health establishment, as led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), had not developed coherent strategies to mitigate such risks, to alert the public to their plausibility, or to advise leadership in government and industry about their implications. To understand why, we examined archival materials, reviewed online databases, read internal industry communications, and interviewed experts. We confirmed that external constraints, statutory and judicial, had been in place prior to EPA's earliest interest in mixture toxicity, but we found no overt effort, certainly no successful effort, to loosen those constraints. We also found internal constraints: concerns that fully committing to the study of complex mixtures involving numerous toxicants would lead to methodological drift within the toxicological community and that trying to act on insights from such study could lead only to regulatory futility. Interaction of these constraints, external and internal, shielded the EPA by circumscribing its responsibilities and by impeding movement toward paradigmatic adjustment, but it also perpetuated scientifically dubious policies, such as those limiting the evaluation of commercial chemical formulations, including pesticide formulations, to only those ingredients said by their manufacturers to be active. In this context, regulators' disregard of synergism contrasted irreconcilably with biocide manufacturers' understanding that synergism enhanced lethality and patent-ability. In the end, an effective national response to mixture toxicity, cumulative risk, and environmental injustice did not emerge. In parallel, though, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which was less constrained, pursued with scientific investigation what the EPA had not pursued with regulatory action.

AB  - Through more than two decades of multilateral climate change negotiations, China has steadfastly opposed emission limits for developing countries. Scholars have traditionally explained the rigidity of Chinese diplomacy with reference to economic interests and power, and in the process understated the importance of equity norms. In international negotiations, China has served as one of the key architects and promoters of the common but differentiated responsibility principle, which holds that global environmental justice requires that developed countries bear the primary obligation for combating climate change. China has used this principle strategically in order to legitimize its opposition to emission limits. However, China's negotiating stance cannot be defined simply as the instrumental use of norms, as Beijing is genuinely sensitive to issues of equity. These equity concerns have occasionally led China to act in a manner that, from a strict cost-benefit analysis, runs counter to its own economic interests. In sum, notions of environmental justice are simultaneously a tool China uses to pursue its interests and a force that structures China's interest.

AB  - This paper is about intra- and inter-generational equity, connecting environmental justice discourse with necessary responses to climate change. It offers a review of the role of globalization in this pervasive context, contrasting the disaggregated nature of localized impacts, and seeks to address the potential for adjusting law-policy frameworks as a key part of the search for solutions. It argues that environmental justice approaches can incorporate values into law-policy processes based upon vital aspects of the integrity and functioning of communities, distributional fairness, and capacities for wider engagement and participation in the search for necessary behavioural change. The conclusion is that the ultimate success of the urgent process of addressing climate-related threats, through a meaningful degree of mitigation and adaptation, and multiple levels of decision-making and response, must be informed by the precepts of environmental justice.

AB  - Water stories told in Kilimanjaro Region, such as Mami Wata narratives conveyed across Africa and the Atlantic, give horrific insights into morally problematic forms of wealth acquisition through environmental destruction. This paper approaches farmers' stories of water spirits and water management practices as indices of farmers' witness to their own social displacement by government-backed agribusinesses. Analysis shows that farmers are drawn to, and are already part of, a system that waits and watches for their death. As perverse as many forms of necropolitics can be, this form of social devivification, duplicitously advanced in the name of environmental conservation and sustainability, is all too familiar and ordinary. This article unveils agro-industrial conceits about water management and contrasts these conceits to farmers' life-sustaining practices.

AB  - Understanding potential disparities in community compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) will help managers effectively and fairly allocate funding for improving drinking water systems. Environmental justice is experienced at the scale of the individual, the household, the neighborhood, or the water service provider and is too fine-grained a scale for spatial analysis with most available state datasets. This research represents an effort to ascertain which spatial analysis method selected to estimate the demographics of water service areas best supports environmental justice analysis at the state scale. To understand whether there are disparities in compliance with the SDWA, this study specifically investigated the relationship between socioeconomic status and race as well as other water system variables, and violations to the SDWA of community water system (CWS) in the state of Pennsylvania. The sociodemographic characteristics of the water systems were estimated using three different CWS-level spatial analysis methods (areal weighting, dasymetric mapping, areal interpolation) and a county-level spatial analysis method. Negative binomial regression was used to evaluate whether these sociodemographic characteristics, and other water system variables, including size of the water system, ownership, and water source, are associated with SDWA violations. This research demonstrates that the spatial analysis method selected for an environmental justice study can affect the results and conclusions of the research. Evidence that SDWA violations were associated with race or socioeconomic status was not found; however, this study did determine that small CWSs (<200 connections) and CWSs serving rural areas are less likely to be compliant with the SDWA.

AB  - This essay compares two philosophical proposals concerning the relation between values and science, both of which reject the value-free ideal but nevertheless place restrictions on how values and science should interact. The first of these proposals relies on a distinction between the direct and indirect roles of values, while the second emphasizes instead a distinction between epistemic and nonepistemic values. We consider these two proposals in connection with a case study of disputed research on the topic of environmental justice and argue that the second proposal has several advantages over the first.

AB  - Within the current climate of change (environmental, economic and social) what constitutes 'justice' is continually shifting in relation to vulnerable people, places and species. This is most acute in cities, where the majority of people now live and the need to create new pathways of co-existence between humans and other species has been recognized. The convergence of rapid urbanization and anthropogenic climate change has had disproportionately negative effects on the urban poor and those most marginalised (human and non-human). This paper provides a critical overview of the emergent field of urban climate justice which focuses on the complex links between environmental sustainability, human vulnerability and biodiversity loss in the natural environment. This is an interdisciplinary agenda demanding new forms of sustainability research and practical engagement underpinned by calls for a more integrated approach to eco-social justice principles around human and other species equity in cities.

AB  - Watersheds are often degraded by human activities, reducing their ability to provide ecosystem functions and services. While governmental agencies have put forward plans for improving watershed health, resources are limited, and choices must be made as to which watersheds to prioritize and what actions to take. Prioritization tools with sufficient specificity, resolution, and automation are needed to guide decisions on restoration and management actions across large scales. To address this need, we developed a set of tools to support the protection of streams and associated riparian habitats across the state of California. We developed and tested watershed condition estimation models based on bioassessment data, used the EPA's StreamCat dataset to identify stressors, incorporated environmental justice factors and developed reach-specific models to prioritize actions. We applied the prioritization tools statewide and were able to identify 18% of stream reaches that are in good condition but that are most vulnerable to existing stressors and an additional 19% of stream reaches that are degraded and are highest priority for restoration and management. The remaining 63% of stream reaches were prioritized for protection and periodic monitoring or minor remedial actions. The results of this project can help regional stakeholders and agencies prioritize hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to protect, acquire, and restore stream and riparian habitats. The methods are directly transferable by using any regional condition and stress data that can be readily obtained.

AB  - Waterkeeper v. EPA represents a limited victory for advocates of reporting requirements. In this case, the court held that the Environmental Protection Agency could not exempt farms from air pollution reporting requirements based on the use of the de minimis doctrine, which allows for exemptions from regulations to avoid trifling matters. Prior to this case, in most environmental cases involving the de minimis doctrine, courts have upheld agency use of the doctrine unless a court finds that the statutory language is "extraordinarily rigid" and therefore does not permit this interpretative tool. Here, however, while the majority did not uphold the agency action, the decision also omitted any discussion whatsoever of whether the statutory language of either the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act was so "extraordinarily rigid" as to preclude de minimis exemptions. This therefore weakens the precedential value of the decision for advocates in similar future cases, because it leaves the door open for the possible use of the de minimis doctrine to avoid regulatory responsibilities. However, advocates can overcome this precedential weakness in two ways. First, advocates can highlight the environmental justice benefits of reporting requirements to communities, the government, and businesses. This will greatly reduce the probability that a given reporting requirement will "yield a gain of trivial or no value." Second, advocates can emphasize the fact that it is unnecessary for the Environmental Protection Agency to invoke its de minimis authority to shield small business owners from reporting requirements, since it can use its prosecutorial discretion to do so. Thus, advocates of reporting requirements have several tools in their "toolbox" if agencies attempt to use the de minimis doctrine to justify similar exemptions in the future.

AB  - This special issue is a contribution to environmental labour studies, which aims to investigate the practices and theories that integrate labour and nature, by focusing on labour environmentalism. While nature is privately appropriated and exploited by Capital, workers' organizations tend to construct nature as labour's other, a place to enjoy or a place to be protected from destruction at best. In the following introductory article to this special issue, we present our view of what environmental labour studies are investigating and might investigate in the future and the place of labour environmentalism within this broader agenda. We also suggest an analytical framework to evaluate the depth, breadth, and level of the agency of the variations of labour environmentalism. We suggest that environmental labour studies can be a way of studying not only the intersections between social and environmental justice, climate change and working conditions but can also contribute to building a bridge between environmental theory and practice.

AB  - Vehicle emissions are major sources of air pollution linked to negative health outcomes in children. Consequently, California State Bill 352 stipulates that new schools may not be sited within 500 ft of major roadways. However, the exposure of existing schools to roadway emissions and the uneven distribution of the burden of air pollution have not been systematically explored for most cities. IN response, the objectives of our study were twofold: We used spatial analysis and an evaluation of traffic count data to develop a proximity-based approach to assessing school exposure to roadway air pollution emissions. Second, we applied our method to ask whether the risk of exposure to high concentrations of roadway emissions is equally distributed for schools in Santa Clara County (SCC; USA), and which demographic or spatial patterns emerge. In the process, our proximity-based approach estimated total annual traffic counts throughout SCC, identified major roadways, and assessed cumulative emission burdens and socio-economic indicators for each school in the study area. Results were compared to output from a physically-based model and to county asthma data. Our results suggest that (i) 14% of schools in SCC are potentially exposed to high levels of air pollution from roadways, a rate that is higher than the national average, and (ii) students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and receiving aid are more likely to be educated in schools with higher risk of exposure to elevated levels of roadway vehicle emissions. Asthma hospitalization rates are highest in socio-economically disadvantaged areas with a higher density of major roadways. Areas of higher vehicle emissions determined by the physically-based model are in general agreement with those of the distance-based approach. We propose a combination of shortand long-term mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to vehicle emissions for school children.

AB  - This paper examined the impact of an environmental justice class positioned against the backdrop of the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. Students questioned the link between the water crisis and environmental and racial injustice, as Flint citizens are largely African American and reside below the poverty line. The inquiry guiding this research centered on how students might use their voices to garner agency due to their participation in this class. The students' narratives became counter-stories; at the end of the course, their counter-stories highlighted a positive relationship between students' agency and their desire to become involved in the democratic process. The findings illustrate how participatory projects, ones that students direct themselves, can result in students' feelings of anxiety and complicate the role of the teacher in shaping the curriculum. The discussion examines curriculum design and place-based education adjacent to the complex undertaking of civic engagement with students.

AB  - Toxic environmental emissions have the potential to harm already susceptible populations living in close proximity to industries with pollutant emissions such as coal-fired electrical power plants. The organized dissemination of information in communities that find themselves susceptible to occupation by industries with pollutant emissions is a crucial step in the long and arduous process of preventing such harm. Here, we present a blueprint that can be used by community organizations to prevent industries that pollute the environment from locating in communities that are already disproportionately exposed to pollution (referred to here as environmental justice communities). We base this blueprint on a specific case in Taylor County, Florida, where the steps outlined successfully prevented the Taylor Energy Center (TEC) consortium from obtaining the necessary permits for the operation of a proposed coal-fired electrical power plant, thereby minimizing the risks of additional toxicant exposure to the affected community.

AB  - This article traces how the notion of finite limits to emissions based on 2 degrees C carbon budgets was applied to increase the credibility of a carbon-constrained future in two very separate realms, social movements contesting fossil-fuel development and the financial sector-a process yet to be described in the relevant political and financial literatures. For each realm and sub-areas within them, we apply a three-wave taxonomy to trace the application of 2 degrees C carbon budget based concepts-including stranded assets, the carbon bubble, divestment, and anti-pipeline campaigns-from the fringe to the mainstream in under 10 years. We do so by drawing on relevant primary documents and peer-reviewed literature, complemented by a quantitative textual analysis of relevant discourse from news sources. The article establishes how, in efforts to shift expectations, climate proponents used 2 degrees C carbon budgets to frame a stark choice between a safe climate with strict carbon constraints and growth-oriented fossil-fuel interests. The article also demonstrates that these concepts, and efforts inspired by them, contributed to constraints on fossil-fuel developments and interests, arguably further enhancing the credibility of a carbon-constrained future. We conclude with a discussion of the potentially self-reinforcing nature of such expectation dynamics and by highlighting overlapping implications for actors across finance, where investors reorient risk assessment around climate, and social movements, where activists disrupt states' entrenched commitment to fossil-fuel expansion.

AB  - This work draws upon previous studies of environmental inequity to investigate the distribution of estimated air lead concentrations across 3,111 U.S. counties. Data for this research come from the U.S. Census Bureau's 1990 Census of Population and Housing: Summary Tape File 3A and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1990 Cumulative Exposure Project. Findings from OLS and WLS regression suggest that air lead concentrations are associated with county racial composition. Counties with the largest proportion of Black youth under 16 years of age (10th decile = 0.09) have nearly 7.9 percent more lead in the air than counties with no Black youth (1st decile = 0.00). Counties with the largest proportion of White youth under 16 years of age (10th decile = 0.25) have nearly 10.0 percent less lead. in the air than counties with the smallest proportion of White youth (1st decile = 0.13). These findings persist despite adjustments for urbanization, income, and housing values. This work proposes that the distribution of air lead levels has important implications for the field of sociology and the study of racial inequality.

AB  - This research expands upon organizational ecology theory to examine variations in founding of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental justice movement across U.S. counties for two time periods (1990-1999 and 2000-2008). Cross-movement effects are examined to determine if founding is more or less likely to occur in counties where related civil rights and environmental organizations are located. Consistent with the notion of agglomeration effects, we hypothesize that during the 1990s the relationship among civil rights density, environmental density, and environmental justice founding is positive and suggests cooperative efforts. That is, environmental justice organizations should form in counties where civil rights organizations and environmental organizations exist. Because the focus of environmental justice organizations may have expanded over time and created a more competitive atmosphere, cross-movement relationships that were positive across counties during the 1990s are hypothesized to turn negative across counties during the 2000s. Multivariate analysis suggests mixed support for these hypotheses. Specifically, civil rights density is positively associated with environmental justice founding during the 1990s and negatively associated with environmental justice founding during the 20005 suggesting potential cooperative and then competitive effects across counties over time. However, the correlations between environmental density and environmental justice founding, while positive and statistically significant during the 1990s, are not statistically significant during the 2000s. Thus, in the case of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental and environmental justice movements it appears that there is a trend toward competitive effects even as those effects have yet to materialize.

AB  - This study investigates the association between air-lead levels and crime rates across 2,772 US. counties. Data for the analysis come from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Census, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Results suggest that air-lead levels have a direct effect on property and violent crime rates even after adjusting for general levels of air pollution and several structural covariates of crime. We also find that resource deprivation interacts with air-lead levels. The association between air-lead levels and crime rates-property and violent-is strongest in counties that have high levels of resource deprivation and weakest in counties that have low levels of deprivation. This interaction is consistent with arguments and evidence in the health care literature that populations most at risk of lead poisoning are least likely to get the resources required to prevent, screen, and treat the illness.

AB  - This study draws upon concepts in landscape research and environmental justice to examine the association between community poverty and environmental violations that occurred between 2002 and 2008 across 110 coal strip mining operations located within the United States. Multivariate results suggest that residential poverty is greater around facilities that have been identified as violating an environmental law. In addition, the association between poverty and violations is dependent upon regulatory inspections. While an increase in inspections is associated with an increase in the odds that a violation will be discovered, it is also associated with lower levels of community poverty. We conclude that this pattern of associations between poverty, inspections, and violations is consistent with arguments in the environmental justice and landscape literatures.

AB  - This research extends the study of natural resource violations by examining the association between conservation organizations and the enforcement of natural resource violations across 67 Florida counties in 2006. Specifically, the authors look at natural resource violations as an organizational outcome that is influenced by perceived community organization around environmental conservation. To do this, they examine the association between the number of conservation organizations and the level of enforcement for natural resource violations. The results suggest that even while controlling for organizational capacity (i.e., number of officers), offenders and targets, proportion rural population, and economic benefits from natural resource use, a positive association exits between conservation organizations and natural resource enforcement levels. This relationship is not replicated in the case of animal rights and hunting and fishing organizations. Although issues related to environmental justice are always a concern in studies of environmental enforcement, the authors find no evidence of an association between social and economic disadvantage and community organizing. Finally, a post hoc examination of the data suggests that the association between conservation organizations and the level of natural resource enforcement is stronger for those counties where more officers enforce natural resource violations than for those counties where fewer officers enforce violations.

AB  - We examined the effects of human connection to nature on residents' concerns about justice in conservation policies of Natura 2000. Expansion of Natura 2000 conservation network has resulted in local communities having to consider Natura 2000 in their development plans, and justice concerns have been strong in some communities near Natura 2000 sites. We conceptualized Natura 2000 justice within a framework composed of 3 domains of conservation justice: distribution, recognition, and representation. To examine the effect of nature connection on perceived justice of Natura 2000, we conducted a door-to-door survey of rural resident (80.09% response rate) in 3 municipalities of Pomerania in Poland. The effect of connection to nature on perceived distribution of Natura 2000 benefits was positive (b = 0.187, t= 7.057,p < 0.001); perceived communication about Natura 2000 was positive (b = 0.089, t = 2.940 p < 0.01); perception of limitations was positive (b = 0.078, t = 2.416, p < 0.01); perceived recognition was positive (b = 0.117, t = 3.367, p < 0.001); and perceived representation was positive (b = 0.123, t = 5.015, p < 0.001). Our results suggest local residents' bonds with nature matter and they should be considered when new conservation approaches, such as Natura 2000, are introduced.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban green space provides multiple recreation opportunities with important benefits for physical and psychological well-being, but access to these benefits is often unequally distributed. Various methodologies to assess outdoor recreation opportunities exist, but they rarely take into consideration dimensions of environmental justice. The aim of this paper is to map and assess nature-based outdoor recreation opportunities with a focus on green space accessibility for different social groups, and discuss the results in light of of environmental justice. We use the Oslo metropolitan area, Norway, as a case study. We combine statistical analysis with spatial modelling to assess recreation preferences and distribution of nature-based recreation opportunities. We also analyse accessibility for different social groups, including children and the elderly, migrants and low-income households. Our results show that most people prefer large wooded green areas, high density of trees, and presence of water, although preferences differ depending on age and place of residence. Areas for daily recreation are accessible to the whole population in the study area, but they are unequally distributed, migrants and low-income households having relatively less access. Our methodology can also be applied in other cities and metropolitan areas to assess differences in accessibility to outdoor recreation opportunities. We discuss whether and to which extent these results illustrate a situation of environmental injustice. We conclude that the relation between access to green space and environmental justice can be complex, and that injustice may not automatically result from uneven access.

AB  - This essay is an ecocritical analysis of Duff Wilson's book, Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret (2002). While the book is in many ways the result of journalistic investigation, it also has literary value through its zest for story-telling, giving readers an insight into small-town America, and the weight that bears upon the sense of community owing to the corporate interest of the chemical industry. Duff Wilson's book narrates how chemical wastes that would be expensive to treat according to current legislation are dumped into fertilizers that are later sprayed across vast expanses of land in Quincy, a small town in Washington State, endangering humans, cattle and the land alike. Lawrence Buell has rationalized the possible polarizations of environmental writing, and found that the "health of the physical environment" is one, while the other is "social welfare or interhuman equity." Duff Wilson no doubt finds that environmental writing has duties in both areas of concern, but, as he moves on, the biocentric view gets the upper hand, though the more social perspective is not discarded. Duff Wilson's book, while examining questions which may sound unliterary, such as agricultural price-levels and competition in the chemical industry, delves into issues of literary ethics and grasps human intimacies when they are shaped by those forces. Behind the social and economic mechanisms at work in this small rural community, one encounters cases of human suffering, which Duff Wilson conveys with adroitness and a sense of implicit solidarity. This is what makes his book especially poignant, and capable of exploring the various nuances of social fragility.

AB  - Tobacco shops, medical marijuana dispensaries (MMD), and off-sale alcohol outlets are legal and prevalent in South Los Angeles, California-a high-crime, low-income urban community of color. This research is the first to explore the geographic associations between these three legal drug outlets with surrounding crime and violence in a large low-income urban community of color. First, spatial buffer analyses were performed using point-location and publically accessible January-December 2014 crime data to examine the geography of all felony property and violent crimes occurring within 100, 200, 500, and 1000-foot buffers of these three legal drug outlet types across South Los Angeles. Next, spatial regression analyses explored the geographic associations between density of these outlets and property and violent crimes at the census tract level. Results indicated that mean property and violent crime rates within 100-foot buffers of tobacco shops and alcohol outlets-but not MMDs-substantially exceeded community-wide mean crime rates and rates around grocery/convenience stores (i.e., comparison properties licensed to sell both alcohol and tobacco). Spatial regression analyses confirmed that tobacco shops significantly positively associated with property and violent crimes after controlling for key neighborhood factors (poverty, renters, resident mobility, ethnic/racial heterogeneity). Thus, study findings provide the first empirical evidence that tobacco shops may constitute public health threats that associate with crime and violence in U.S. low-income urban communities of color. Implementing and enforcing control policies that regulate and monitor tobacco shops in these communities may promote community health by improving public safety.

AB  - This chapter describes the evolution of justice considerations in environmental planning. The rise of the public involvement movement in the 1970s led to a series of guidelines as to how government and industry sponsored public programs should be ethically conducted. In parallel, the environmental justice movement created a literature that clearly demonstrated that the negative effects of environmental degradation fell unequally on particular groups in society, such as the poor or those in an ethnic minority. The chapter explores the concepts of justice that have been used as the two interests merged. Through examples of the application of justice principles in environmental decision making, the dynamics of justice arguments are explored. These include: the issues of relative deprivation, deservingness and entitlement; evidence-based decision making; the issues relating to group interest; and the scales and levels of justice rhetoric. It concludes that the influence of justice research on decision making has been limited to this stage. Nevertheless, if opportunities relating to the creation of a common language, avoidance of the use of public discourse to reach a pre-determined outcome, and creating defensible evaluation programs within the political process are improved substantially, more influence will be achieved.

AB  - This study examines local news reporting about the Flint water crisis. The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with local reporters to explore journalistic practices and perceptions of the crisis. The study utilised a framework grounded in concepts from community journalism and crisis reporting, as well as environmental justice and racism scholarship. The qualitative thematic analysis centres around four themes: coverage practices and professionalism, resources and challenges, connections to place, and environmental justice and racism. The results reveal that the crisis served as a catalyst for some news organisations to make substantial investments in their newsrooms; but this was not the case for small organisations that depend mostly on grant-funding. Local reporters generally claimed that despite their attachment to the Flint community, they maintained their normal journalistic standards. However, some reporters struggled to separate their personal experiences from their professional practices, evidence consistent with prior studies on crisis reporting. Reporters demonstrated empathy towards victims impacted by the water crisis, and this heightened their distrust towards official sources and motivated their outreach efforts. Finally, for those reporters, their ideologies were largely consistent with both historical and emerging claims on environmental justice and environmental racism, that persons of colour, minority populations, and poor neighbourhoods in cities are more likely to suffer from environmental hazards compared to white and more affluent communities. Suggestions for crisis reporting in environmental justice contexts are discussed.

AB  - Urban parks can provide many physical and psychological health benefits, but these may not be shared equitably among visitors. The purpose of this study was to explore park visitor demographics and activities, as well as their in-depth narratives regarding experiences, perceptions of accessibility, and desired improvements in a range of urban park types, using Portland, Oregon as a case study. We used a mixed-methods approach to interview and observe visitors in 15 urban parks of three general park types: recreational-active use, natural-passive use, and multi-use parks. The most common activities were physical recreation, interactions between adults, and adult child interactions, which all support physical and mental well-being. Ninety-four percent of observed children were engaged in physical recreation and three-fourths were interacting with other children. Our non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations with joint plots indicated some trends in visitor demographics and activities across park types, but we found no significant differences in the total number of observed visitors, females and males, racial-ethnic groups, or adults and children across park types. Our complementary in-depth, semi structured interviews with participants revealed specific motivations for park visitation, access concerns, and desired improvements. Visitation was primarily motivated by physical recreation opportunities, accessibility, and children, whereas the main access concerns were park proximity, trails and paths, and maintenance. Feelings of safety were particularly important for female visitors, while a sense of community helped to create a welcoming atmosphere for visitors with underrepresented racial-ethnic backgrounds. Participants across demographics groups discussed preferences for improvements, which focused on enhancing various park amenities and social atmosphere. Only 19 % of participants indicated that no changes were needed in the parks. We provide strategies for urban park planners, governmental agencies, and community groups to continue enhancing urban park experiences and accessibility for diverse visitors.

AB  - Urban parks are widely-recognized to provide multiple social and ecological benefits, but an increasingly number of studies show that such benefits are often inequitably distributed across socio-economic and ethnic groups. This has led to a growing interest in assessing the spatial distribution and access to parks and other green spaces as an aspect of environmental justice. Even though such spatial studies require assessment at multiple scales, how results may be influenced by scale has not received adequate attention. This study assessed the effects of scale on park provision and spatial equity in Singapore. A range of park provision indicators were used to evaluate how they are affected by scale and to explore their correlations with wealth, income and ethnicity. Scale effects were assessed using planning units adopted for national land use planning, namely, region, planning area and subzone. Scale significantly affected park provision indicators, particularly for indicators that incorporate population. Correlations at larger scale tend to be stronger than at smaller scales. There were higher park provision and lower potential for park congestion in planning units with higher wealth and income. Inequity also appears stronger when studied at smaller spatial scales. Results also showed that park provision indicators are prone to skewed frequency distributions, especially at smaller scales. The implications of the results were discussed in relation to spatial equity assessment and possible causes of the disparities. We also highlight the need to direct park planning at smaller scale of neighbourhoods rather than at the town or regions levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluates the underlying logic of urban planning behind the inequitable geographical distribution of public open space in Hong Kong. Existing open spaces and areas zoned as open spaces are found to have distinct patterns of distribution. Fewer than half of Hong Kong's 1737 public parks and recreation grounds were zoned as 'Open Space' in town plans. Three typical land-use zoning configurations adjoining the 1177 'Open Space' zones are identified. A large proportion of Hong Kong's 'Open Space' zones, particularly those with waterfront access, were located close to upmarket, low-density housing areas and mixed commercial-business zones, rather than to high-density mass housing zones. An historical review elucidates the influence of colonial politics, racial harmony, public hygiene and democratisation on open space planning and development in Hong Kong. Recreation is not the only social function of open space. The government's latest planning and development strategies expanding a network of new open spaces at strategic waterfront locations and near commercial/business zones, and encouraging private-sector participation in place promotion and urban marketing may exacerbate the inequitable distribution of open space, encourage its commodification and deprive underprivileged communities of the right to conveniently access public space.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS), as public services facilities that provide lots of outdoor space for people's activities and exercise, has a significant impact on urban residents' social, psychological, and physical benefits. The reasonable distribution of the urban green space is of great significance for enhancing the overall well-being of urban dwellers. In this study, we selected Wuhan City center as a research area, extracted the spatial distribution information of urban green space, roads networks from high-resolution remote sensing images in 2019. The urban green space service situation in different travel modes, travel times, and parks types are subsequently calculated with a network analysis model in GIS. The results showed that the services area of urban green space in the city center of Wuhan was within a driving distance of 30 min, accounting for 70.38% of the total study area, and the use of high-resolution remote images spatial data can measure equity on a more precise scale.

AB  - This study examines the spatial distribution of outdoor recreation sites and their proximity to census block groups (CBGs), in order to determine potential socioeconomic inequities. It is framed within the context of environmental justice. Information from the Southern Appalachian Assessment database was applied to a case study of the Chattahoochee National Forest in North Georgia. Outdoor recreation sites (campgrounds, wilderness areas, good/poor fisheries habitat, and overcrowded recreation sites) were mapped using geographic information systems. All CBGs (n = 200) contained by, and within 1500 meters (approximately one mile), of the Chattahoochee National Forest were identified and characterized by four socioeconomic variables (race, household income, heritage, and occupation). Logit analysis was conducted to determine the spatial relationships between outdoor recreation sites and CBG variables. Results show that household income was the only significant predictor (p < .05) of proximity to outdoor recreation sites. CBGs with a higher proportion of lower income households were significantly more likely to be situated within 1500 meters of a wilderness area, campground, and/or good fisheries habitat than CBGs with higher incomes. Implications for identifying recreation as a locally desirable or undesirable land-use, applying benefits-based management, and considering sustainable community development in national forest management are addressed.

AB  - Vehicle traffic is responsible for a significant portion of toxic air pollution in urban areas that has been linked to a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Most vehicle air quality analyses used for transportation planning and health effect studies estimate exposure from the measured or modeled concentration of an air pollutant at a person's home. This study evaluates exposure to fine particulate matter from vehicle traffic and the magnitude and cause of exposure misclassification that result from not accounting for population mobility during the day in a large, sprawling region. We develop a dynamic exposure model by integrating activity-based travel demand, vehicle emission, and air dispersion models to evaluate the magnitude, components and spatial patterns of vehicle exposure misclassification in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Overall, we find that population exposure estimates increase by 51% when population mobility is accounted for. Errors are much larger in suburban and rural areas where exposure is underestimated while exposure may be overestimated near high volume roadways and in the urban core. Exposure while at work and traveling account for much of the error. We find much larger errors than prior studies, all of which have focused on more compact urban regions. Since many people spend a large part of their day away from their homes and vehicle emissions are known to create "hotspots" along roadways, home-based exposure is unlikely to be a robust estimator of a person's actual exposure. Accounting for population mobility in vehicle emission exposure studies may reveal more effective mitigation strategies, important differences in exposure between population groups with different travel patterns, and reduce exposure misclassification in health studies.

In this article, we describe an environmental justice-focused intervention located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that aimed to increase community empowerment to address urban environmental injustices by training residents to reclaim vacant land. We use a case study approach to illustrate resident perceptions of the impact of vacant land and urban decay. The results suggest that these residents viewed vacancy as an important indicator of community well-being and social inequality. We use a social and environmental justice framework to describe results and implications for practitioners and researchers.

AB  - This paper explores the political processes that activists engaged in contesting land grabbing have triggered to connect claims across borders and to international institutions, regimes and processes. Through a review of cases of land-grab resistance that have led to project cancelation or suspension, I argue that contextual elements of the land grab and shifting geopolitics highlight the need for adaptation and refinement of models of transnational advocacy, historically structured in North-South patterns. For example, while some elements of the boomerang pattern of transnational advocacy are still relevant, changing realities call for new empirically enriched models. To this end, I outline two typologies of political contention that can help us conceptualize multi-scalar interactions between activists to demonstrate the impact of local resistances at larger scales - 'the catapult effect' and the 'minefield effect'. This paper contributes to calls for further theorization to understand how feedback processes between international discourses, meso-politics and conflicts and resistance at local sites of production impact the implementation of contested land deals.

AB  - This study investigates the implementation of U.S. environmental protection laws under American Indian tribal governance. The landmark laws of the 1970s that form the core of America's environmental policy regime made no mention of American Indian tribal lands, and the subsequent research literature on environmental policy has given them little attention. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has primary implementation responsibility for environmental protection laws on tribal lands, which offers a unique opportunity to study direct federal implementation apart from typical joint state-federal implementation. Further, because Indian reservations are homes to a disproportionately poor, historically subjugated racial group, analysis of environmental programs on tribal lands offers a unique perspective on environmental justice. We analyze enforcement of and compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to compare the implementation of environmental policy on tribal lands with nontribal facilities. Analysis reveals that, compared with nontribal facilities, tribal facilities experience less rigorous CWA and SDWA enforcement and are more likely to violate these laws.

AB  - Venezuela is well known for its century-old oil economy, which has significantly shaped its social fabrics, territories, and eco-systems. Since 1999, the Bolivarian Revolution has led to important transformations in the context of the 'Socialism of the 21st century' project, but the extractivist model has deepened. This situation has created or intensified several ecological distribution conflicts, which have been further exacerbated by an extraordinary national crisis unleashed in the period 2013-2016. In this paper, a geography of the 20 most emblematic and representative socio-environmental conflicts in the period of the Bolivarian Revolution is presented. From a comparative political ecology perspective, this article aims to understand how power relations are expressed through territorial configurations and spatial dynamics of resistance, and what are the implications for sustainability. It is argued that a remarkable new situation of environmental injustice is occurring in this period. Despite the 'eco-socialist' discourse raised, the current Petro-State has updated the traditional regime on eco-systems, territories, and human bodies primarily by resorting to the assimilation of socio-environmental conflicts through a strategic distribution policy of oil rents. However, it has maintained a pattern of ecological degradation and social marginalization as an outcome of its economic development model. The current context of crisis has fostered intense territorial disputes and conditions for the emergence of new social actors, practices, scenarios, and geographies linked to underground economies and criminal bands, which complicate an already concerning scenario of unsustainability. The current extractivist model is reaching a breaking point. New commodity frontiers have become a main area of dispute.

AB  - Wilderness has been constructed as White, in part through histories that marginalize African American attitudes and experiences. In response, we provide an overview of African Americans' relationships with nature during three historical periods: (a) Enslavement, (b) Reconstruction and Postreconstruction, and (c) 1936-1994. African Americans' relationships with nature were created through an ongoing dialectic of oppression and transgression throughout each historical period. Four types of transgression were identified: wilderness as a space free of White oppression, wilderness as a site to challenge White oppression, engagement with nature despite White oppression, and advocacy for more just relationships with wilderness. Transgression is discussed as a means to remember environmental history and envision new relationships between African Americans and wilderness in the present, bonds for which transgression may one day no longer be necessary.

AB  - Youth articulations of climate change injustice are experiencing an unprecedented moment in the spotlight as, inspired by Greta Thunberg, young people around the world take to the streets demanding justice for their generation in the face of climate emergency. Formal opportunities for youth voices to be heard in environmental governance are slim, although the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) offers a rare opportunity for youth to share their perspectives as one of nine civil society constituencies: YOUNGO. Recent research in Global Environmental Change has called for empirical exploration of justice claims-making by different stakeholders to develop understanding of how justice is conceptualised and negotiated in climate change governance spaces. To date, climate justice claims from youth have not been explored in the academic literature. This paper draws upon rich, ethnographic, longitudinal data on the evolution of justice claims made by a group of youth participants in the UNFCCC to contribute to this empirical gap. In our research, a UK-based case study organisation and long-established member of YOUNGO was studied between 2015 and 2018, including observation of their participation at the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Conferences of the Parties. We find that youth participants first articulated injustices based on perceived future risks to their generation but, over time, switched to solidarity claims about injustices experienced by other groups in the present. Whilst laudable, this impedes their mandate as representatives of younger generations. We also make three theoretical contributions to environmental justice theory. First we expand participation justice theory to both the visible structures of participation (procedural justice) and the informal rules and discourses shaping participation (representation justice). Second we demonstrate the importance of both external and self-recognition for the articulation of justice claims. Third we clarify the relationship between power and justice claim-making, proposing that we must look beneath what is articulated to shed light on the exercise of ideological power that shapes the framing and claiming of justice in environmental governance spaces.

AB  - This contribution examines how and with what effects the Movement of People Threatened by Dams (MOAB) in the Ribeira Valley, Brazil, works at various scales simultaneously. It is argued that MOAB was kicked off by mobilising Afro-descendants around livelihood issues, and that one of the first anti-dam strategies was to claim quilombola recognition and land rights at the state level. MOAB soon expanded its network and broadened its agenda to include procedural justice, targeting federal and international agencies for recourse. The paper concludes that MOAB has successfully used different scales for framing, mobilisation and action, which has contributed to the dam project being put on hold for almost three decades.

AB  - Urban trees are increasingly being used to help cities adapt to climate change, improve health and wellbeing, and promote biodiversity. Yet these benefits are distributed unequally, mirroring the uneven distribution of the urban forest in many cities. Contrasting theories have been proposed to explain these observed patterns that focus either on the economic wherewithal of individuals (the 'luxury effect'), or the outcome of structural factors such as municipal decision-making processes. Here, we explore patterns across 10 municipal authorities in greater Melbourne, Australia to compare the relative importance of these competing mechanisms. We show that both individual and structural processes are both major determinants of the density and diversity of trees in this large Australian city. Interestingly, education level was strongly related to tree density, while household income was negatively related to tree density and diversity in some municipalities. The luxury effect was not able to adequately explain the patterns observed in Melbourne. This finding has important implications for the planning and management of urban forests and the equitable distribution of the benefits they provide, in the context of the rapid expansion of urban populations across the globe. To counteract inequity, local municipalities must acknowledge and deliberately overcome internal biases that favour the provision of street trees to more advantaged sections of the community.

AB  - This study introduces risk theory of environmental science into human settlement science using 2004-2013 statistics, remote sensing data, and thematic maps. The entropy weight method and risk-index model are both used to study the characteristics of the time course and spatial pattern of human settlement risk in 31 provincial regions in China. In addition, influential mechanisms of vulnerability, functionality, stress, and adaptability on environmental risks are analyzed. Three primary results are obtained. First, for temporal characteristics, environmental risks of human settlements increased significantly from 2003 to 2012. The year 2006 marked both a sudden change and the cut-off point after which human settlements in China experienced qualitative changes and new risks. Second, for spatial characteristics, the risk index of human settlements decreased gradually from the southwestern to the northeastern, northwestern, and northern parts of China. The risk index of human settlement spaces differed significantly, with obvious block aggregation of spatial-distribution characteristics. Third, for relevant factor characteristics, between 2003 and 2012, the temporal change in vulnerability is relatively stable, with a slight increase in functionality and a slight decrease in adaptability. Spatially, Qinghai, Tibet, southwestern China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Beijing, and Tianjin had relatively high vulnerability in human settlements; Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had the best functionality; Hunan and Sichuan had relatively high stress; and Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had relatively stronger adaptability. Further consideration and discussion are required on the environmental risks for different social groups and at different geographical scales, as well as on the uncertainty and long-term features of environmental risks in addition to environmental justice issues.

AB  - Using a unique combination of datasets and estimation techniques, we test whether private lease negotiations to extract oil and natural gas exhibit features of Coasian efficiency. We demonstrate that measures of wealth (including income, house square footage, and land acreage), typically determinants of willingness to pay for environmental quality, do affect bargaining outcomes. However, race, ethnicity, and language also play important roles after conditioning upon these variables, suggesting an environmental injustice and a breakdown of efficient Coasian bargaining. We further demonstrate that failure to negotiate protections in leases leads to increased risk of future drilling violations, and that weak lease restrictions are not generally offset by strong local ordinance restrictions.

AB  - This paper explores the context of environmental justice (EJ) in Scotland, and presents a case study whereby the main attributes for an indicator of EJ were identified, encompassing procedural and distributive aspects of justice. Through a participatory process, weights were assigned using a Multi-Criteria Analysis tool, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Results show that overall, environmental injustices are mostly associated by respondents to unequal distribution of health burdens due to pollution, yet greater weight is attached to procedural justice by community environmental activists. The paper suggests that AHP may be applied to many situations and could form a basis for the development of tools to address and deliver EJ in Scotland.

AB  - Toxic chemicals are released into land, air, and waterways daily. Exposure to such chemicals, however, is not equally distributed across the U.S. It is well documented that communities without agency and capital, typically economically and socially disadvantaged, are those that suffer the brunt of the impacts of a polluted environment. These impacts can have both acute and chronic health consequences, leading to lower life expectancy, higher cancer rates, and compromised immune systems. Emerging qualitative work indicates that incarcerated persons - individuals who have no agency to leave their environment - are disproportionately affected by our polluting practices. This study argues that environmental regulations across the country allow polluting industries to poison confined populations. Nationwide data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory is used to examine if industries geographically closer to correctional facilities emit greater amounts of toxic chemicals. Regional differences are examined as well. Results identify a pattern of harm - incarcerated persons who already have compromised health are also exposed to high levels of toxic chemicals.

AB  - What is the relationship between social movements and polycentric governance? The concept of polycentricity has been at the center of recent debates in environmental governance. While most of this work has analyzed polycentric arrangements in relation to collaborative and adaptive governance, some have recently focused on how political conflicts shape these arrangements. In this paper we build on this work through Luther Gerlach's forgotten framework of polycentric social movements to undertake the task of politicizing polycentricity. This task entails expanding the analytical focus of institutional analyses of polycentricity and examining the social group politics of social movements. To this end, we present a case study of the climate justice movement and its relation to climate change governance. We analyze whether and to what extent the movement has embodied polycentric arrangements throughout its history, and to what effects. We show that show that, in seeking to address the multiscalar nature of environmental problems and the limits of existing institutional arrangements, climate justice groups are increasingly organized in a polycentric fashion. Climate justice groups mobilize multiple strands of environmental justice movements from the global North and South, as well as from indigenous and peasant rights movements, and it is organized as a decentralized network of semiautonomous, coordinated units. We find that this strategy generates new opportunities and challenges for the movement, and thus has important implications for its effectiveness in achieving these transformations. Lastly, we find that through these polycentric arrangements, movements such as that for climate justice are able to exert simultaneous influence on multiple sites of environmental governance, from the local to the global, furthering increased polycentricity in formal institutional arrangements.

AB  - This article tracks the key events that set the stage for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris, particularly as they relate to politics of convergence. One side of this coming together is an intersection of issues, where new terrestrial and aquatic carbon sequestration programs have blurred the margins of climate change mitigation and resource grabbing. These programs, enclosing forests, farmlands, and oceans, are likewise fused together in what can be described as an emerging carbon complex' that is part of the wider blue/green economy. On the reverse side, the clear intersection of issues as witnessed by radical, and historically sectoral, agrarian/social justice movements is causing them to intertwine in resistance. The realm of climate change has proven to be an exceptional space of struggle and countermovement building. Political interactions between movements have become increasingly sophisticatedrequiring frameworks that address environmental, agrarian, and oceanic issues at once, as the issues have become ever more complex. Agrarian/social justice movements maintain that their agendas for food sovereignty and climate justice hinge upon exposing fault lines in the system and advocate overall system change. COP21 and its parallel side events were together a landmark moment, but part of a much more involved process, the road through Paris', along which movements had carved out transnational and local spaces of convergence against the backdrop of a global carbon complex.

AB  - This paper explores the challenges for democratizing land and natural resource control in Guatemala through use of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests (Tenure Guidelines). This international human rights instrument comes at a critical moment, in which the current global land rush has shaped contemporary agrarian transformation with serious implications for the right to food and control of natural resources. The Tenure Guidelines provide us with a unique opportunity to put land and natural resource tenure squarely under the prescriptions of international human rights law, rather than allowing tenure to be subsumed by a narrow understanding of property rights based on civil and merchant law. In Guatemala, we are witnessing a political opening, where the government has incorporated the language of the Tenure Guidelines into its regulatory framework unlike any other country in Latin America. At the same time, the world watches on while a slow-motion coup engulfs the Central American country, reflecting a global trend of gutting democracies and coopting the language and legislation meant to protect them. Thus, the implementation of the Tenure Guidelines is strongly contested by state and corporate actors seeking to use the instrument in order to gain political legitimacy for the expansion of agribusiness like oil palm and sugarcane, and other forms of extractive industry. This paper's findings indicate that when applied together with a rights-based approach, the Tenure Guidelines are a powerful social and political tool. Such is especially true of the most marginalized populations who require protection and respect for their existing tenure rights, promotion of reforms for better access to and control over land and resources, and restoration of tenure rights resulting from displacement or dispossession.

AB  - This research advances knowledge on the understudied topics of violence against women and their contributions to ecological movements through a multiple case study analysis of 25 women defenders listed in the EJAtlas, an environmental conflict database. Women's mobilization is often constrained within cultural contexts limiting them to gendered spaces and roles and punishing them with multiple violences. Women defenders' distinctly gendered violent experiences thus inform their perspectives, narratives, and advocacy. Women defenders assert authority and achieve movement success by emphasizing aspects of identity within and despite unevenly faced barriers, brutality, and burdens. These multi-faceted tactics contribute to emancipation beyond just women and their communities by dismantling violent hegemonies while promoting alternative, inclusive, and antiviolent visions of environmental justice.

AB  - Two worldviews are now contending for cultural dominance: the open-system model long promoted by economists, here called the "image of unlimited good," and a more traditional closed-system view, Foster's " image of limited good," still widely found among peasant societies today. The former rests on the assumption that people "create" wealth, an illusion that conflates the properties of wealth's real and virtual forms while ignoring the economy's extreme reliance on fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources. The laws of thermodynamics dictate that as "growth" occurs in such a system, it fundamentally destroys; thus the net sum cannot be positive, and the system is not expanding but steadily running down. The latter rests on the assumption that most of the "goods" valued by people in life are scarce, being derived from finite raw materials through the expenditure of human labor and extrasomatic energy. Such goods are therefore "subtractable," their limited supply forming a commons that must somehow be shared. Based on an ethnological argument centering on the successful management of scarce water for irrigation, a shift toward the closed-system worldview is shown to be necessary if people are to act collectively to limit their expanding consumption, a change already widely underway, particularly in the global South.

AB  - This research presents and applies a new procedure to elaborate a spatial hierarchy of poverty. The proposed method simultaneously combines variables of magnitude and intensity based. on recent (bootstrapping & spatial autocorrelation) and traditional statistical techniques, and overlay routines of Geographical Information Systems. While magnitude and intensity refer to absolute and relative data, respectively, each variable may be concentrated or agglomerated in space. In this study, concentration is the presence of high global values, regardless of their location, and agglomeration is the concentration of spatially contiguous high local values. Both agglomeration and concentration are merged through a geographical overlay procedure to create conglomerates of magnitude or intensity of poverty. Cases inside these conglomerates are classified by gaussian (natural breaks) or paretian (heads and tails) procedures to set up a spatial hierarchy. For the first time in the study of the spatial pattern of poverty, the resulting spatial hierarchy is based on the simultaneous combination of the concentration and agglomeration processes measured in relative and absolute terms. The benefits of the procedure for an area-based public policy are illustrated by assessing the spatial targeting of poverty in the 2,456 Mexican municipios in 2010. The suggested methodology in this research may be easily extended to identify other spatial patterns, such as crime, industry, diseases, pollution or environmental justice in different areas or countries.

AB  - With the challenge of communicating climate science in the United States and making progress in international negotiations on climate change there is a need for other approaches. The moral issues of ecological degradation and climate justice need to be integrated into social consciousness, political legislation, and climate treaties. Both science and religion can contribute to this integration with differentiated language but shared purpose. Recognizing the limits of both science and religion is critical to finding a way forward for addressing the critical challenges of climate change. How we value nature and human-Earth relations is crucial to this. We need a broader environmental ethics in dialogue with the science of climate change.

AB  - This paper analyzes whether regulating "hot spots" of toxic air pollution by increasing the spatial resolution of regulation could address environmental justice (EJ) concerns. To examine this question, this paper develops a decision model of a regulator choosing emission controls within a net cost minimizing framework. An empirical application of the model using air toxic emission data for Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties in Florida estimates the emission standards and spatial distribution of risks at a coarse and a finer spatial resolutions. Implications for EJ are analyzed by combining the simulated spatial risk distributions at the two resolutions with the demographic data. Results indicate that different measures of EJ point to different conclusions regarding the question of whether finer resolution regulation alleviates EJ concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for EJ policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper analyzes the potential implications, in terms of net social costs and distribution of risks and abatement costs, of a policy to address the problem of air toxics hot spots. The policy we analyze involves regulation of air toxics sources at increasingly finer spatial resolutions. We develop a model of a decisionmaker choosing emission standards within a net cost minimization framework. Empirical application of the model to two counties in Florida demonstrates that regulation at finer resolutions could involve trade-offs between net social costs and equitable distribution of risks and, in some settings, between individual and population risks.

AB  - This study examines altitudinal residential segregation by race in 146 cities in the U.S. South. It begins by embedding the topic in recent theorizations of the social construction of nature, the geography of race, and environmental justice. Second, it focuses on how housing markets, particularly in the South, tend to segregate minorities in low-lying, flood-prone, and amenity-poor segments of urban areas. It tests empirically the hypothesis that blacks are disproportionately concentrated in lower-altitude areas using GIs to correlate race and elevation by digital elevation-model block group within each city in 1990 and 2000. The statistical results confirm the suspected trend. A map of coefficients indicates strong positive associations in cities in the interior South-where the hypothesis is confirmed-and an inverse relationship near the coast, where whites dominate higher-valued coastal properties. Selected city case studies demonstrate these relationships connecting the broad dynamics of racial segregation to the particularities of individual places.

AB  - With the emergence of global mechanism for toxic harm accountability, a transnational environmental justice regime is slowly rising. One of the ways in which its taking form is through transnational litigation schemes where corporations are being locally sued by the alleged victims of their overseas misbehaviours. Using a science and technology studies approach, this article deals with one of the most central components of those schemes: victimization devices. Such concept refers to the highly varied sociotechnical assemblages through which claims about toxic victimhood are mobilized in litigation-based schemes, usually including components such as toxicological evidence and testimonies from the affected people. In order to explore the complexities involved in transnationally mobilizing these devices, this article analyses the lawsuit presented in Sweden by inhabitants of Arica, Chile, against the local mining corporation Boliden for its alleged responsibility in dumping toxic waste near their homes in the late 1980s.

AB  - This study examines the intersection of individual life-histories, organisational histories and societal histories and reveals how religion, in several different expressions, serves to provide a connection between justice for workers and justice for the environment in the work of trade unionists. The trade union movement is generally seen as secular. and thus in our life-history interviews finding religion as a backdrop to labour activists' formation was unexpected. Religion becomes manifest in various ways, partly through experiences in the present or at formative periods in unionists' lives, but also through its cultural embeddedness in language and collective memory. In this way it serves to provide subtle influences on beliefs, concepts of social justice and daily action.

AB  - This study applies a Foucauldian discourse analysis in a study of forest owners' descriptions of power relations in Finnish forest and nature conservation policy, in the context of the recent implementation of cooperative National Forest Programme. Twenty-five forest owners in southern Finland were interviewed using a semi-structured "qualitative attitude approach." Three discursive strategies were found: (1) "submitting to others' power," (2) "questioning others' power" and (3) "taking power." As discursive resources for these strategies, forest owners used two identities, "forestry identity" and "conservation identity," as well as expressions of justice, in order to create tension or alignment between policy actors. The first two strategies emphasized non-cooperation and non-communication between stakeholders and were dominant in the interviews. As a contrast, the third strategy emphasized cooperation and communication; however, it was used rarely. The results of the study can help policy stakeholders to become aware of the discursive construction of policy processes and the presence of power in all social interaction between policy stakeholders.

AB  - This article uses a political ecology approach to examine how urban residents of the refinery city of Esmeraldas "wager life" under conditions of social and chemical toxicity associated with oil capitalism. The article draws on the scholarship on affective economies and critical oil geographies to trace the knotting of social reproduction and oil capital in Esmeraldas and to illustrate how "cruel optimisms" (Berlant 2011) allow city-dwellers to make sense of everyday life amidst frontier-style petro-capitalism. Focusing on personal narratives of social reproduction, affect, and hope in the city, the article first argues that "justice" can be contradictory and politically ambivalent and, second, challenges fixed readings of resistance, refusal, or submission in resource extraction-dominated sites. Rather than presupposing resistance to petro-capitalism or submission to its workings, the article illustrates the liveliness of urban justice struggles and how attention to embodied ecologies and affective oil economies deepens scholarship on social justice.

AB  - We propose and implement a new emplacement framework through exploration of the socio-spatial landscape of the Fox River Watershed (FRW) in Northeastern Wisconsin from a particular cultural perspective. Based primarily upon interviews conducted with 16 Hmong people to better understand and learn from the experiences of an important but overlooked FRW stakeholder group, we present our findings through the components of this framework: displacement, misplacement, replacement, and emplacement. Our research reveals that the strength of Hmong culture has persisted through tremendous loss and displacement, to survive and evolve in a new setting. The resettlement of Hmong people in the FRW has afforded relatively widespread access to landscapes that facilitate recreation, social interaction, and food production, enhancing physical and mental health and augmenting household incomes. It has also led to empowerment of women and the emergence of a generation of group members with formal ecological knowledge to add to their existing ethnobiological understanding and cultural foundation of ecological conscience. For such reasons, conservation organizations, policy makers, and departments of natural resources should look to build linking social capital between those in power and marginalized groups such as the Hmong.

AB  - We hypothesised that neighbourhood inequalities in health and health-related behaviour are due to selective migration between neighbourhoods. Ten-year follow-up data of 25-74-year-old participants in a Dutch city (Eindhoven) showed an increased probability of both upward and downward migration in 25-34-year-old participants, and in single and divorced participants. Women and those highly educated showed an increased probability of upward migration from the most deprived neighbourhoods; lower educated showed an increased probability of moving downwards. Adjusted for these factors, health and health-related behaviour were weakly associated with migration. Over 10 years of follow-up, selective migration will hardly contribute to neighbourbood inequalities in health and health-related behaviour. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper articulates a paradigm shift in the adoption of a critical ecopedagogy focused on substantive and systemic change within nature sports. In analyzing the unifying concept of nature sports, we propose an ontological shift towards genuine sustainability, a communion among people and with nature. These activities comprise a group of physical practices that have the potential to challenge participants in novel ways that provide an alternative to traditional sports and the ideological values associated with these dominant sports, such as competition and personal gain. Nature sports inscribe meaning on bodies in motion, with a blurring or erasure of boundaries, as participants become one with nature rather than seeking to exploit or conquer it. These novel and countercultural practices promise the possibility of systemic sustainability, as participants redefine sport in terms of relational equity and ecoliteracy. As a utopian project, this systems approach recognizes the nature-sport nexus as a living framework to honor culturally appropriate practices and traditions in building an ecological movement centered on environmental justice. In this way, nature sports offer an opportunity to reimagine sustainable development through the promotion of a circular, rather than linear, economy-an economy based on re-creation rather than exploitation and waste.

In particular, highly contested aggregate mineral developments are examined to demonstrate how legal and policy conceptions of the rural shape people-place relations to construct rurality as residual. In this context, rurality is considered as a dimension of a broadened and relational politics of environmental justice that extends to the more-than-human world. At the same time, this paper explores how environmental justice perspectives are critical to deepening and strengthening the transformative potential of rural land use and environmental activism. Land use conflicts are considered as one strategic opening for an ecologically just rural politics of place that can shift the way law structures relationships of rurality in particular places.

AB  - This paper reflects on a collaborative project by the co-authors, investigating how filmmaking may intervene into the racialised politics of place and the practices of memory. Warren County, North Carolina is credited as the birthplace of the US environmental justice movement for 1982 landmark protests linking environmental concerns with civil rights organising. Our 2012 short film, Remembering Kearneytown, looks at this significant environmental history through the perspective of co-author Rev. Kearney, assistant pastor at a church nearbyWarren County's iconic former toxic landfill. In the film, Rev. Kearney calls for his community to reclaim their legacy of environmental justice and re-imagine Warren County as a model of health rather than waste. This article proposes that collaborative filmmaking can serve as a technology of liberatory praxis, to intervene in dominant racial narratives. Our approach conceives of filmmaking geographically, using visual methodologies to engage with the meanings and transformative capacities of place.

AB  - This paper aims to extend the energy justice framework by using the capability approach to understand factors affecting community acceptance of energy technologies. The capability approach is a normative framework for assessing people's well-being and devising interventions for social justice. Whilst recognising that opposition to energy technologies is fundamentally a problem of distributive, recognition and procedural injustices, the paper operationalises the capability approach to unveil what these justice tenets mean to indigenous people living in three communities neighbouring wind installations located in Southern Mexico. Findings conclude that building a bottom-up approach to understand complex conceptions of energy justice within a community can lead to an improved awareness of justice implications relevant to community acceptance of energy technologies. In the Mexican case, these factors relate to inclusive community engagement that pays particular attention to valued ways of being and doing of the local population, such as equal access to employment, higher education and professional training, diversified sources of income, and recognition of the local indigenous everyday life and communal identity. The results also highlight a nested structure of justice concerns, with the three tenets being embedded into one another and presenting different levels of visibility.

AB  - While the critique to economic growth is quintessential in the degrowth scholarship, one may observe a similar focus in various environmental justice movements around the world. This is particularly visible when it comes to the increasing perception that mega-development projects are both unjust and unsustainable, threatening the survival of people and environments. In this paper, we illustrate this focus by looking at two anti-mining movements in Eastern Europe (EE): Save Rosia Montana (Romania) and Krumovgrad (Bulgaria). The local movements describe open cast mining (even in the prospective phase) as potential destruction of basic sources of life (material commons such as water or crops, and community relations). The paper emphasizes a dynamic involved in doing environmental justice, or 'de-growing EJ': affected communities organize themselves by 'staying in place', producing alternative economies, organizing local democratic institutions. What potentially "grows" here, is a societal imaginary of justice on how to reproduce the socio-ecological conditions of life by protecting and re-defining traditional means of production and grassroots practices, knowledge, wealth, and values.

AB  - This paper explores a fruitful convergence between the distributive and procedural dimensions of environmental justice theory and current debates in the field of development studies over capitals and capabilities, institutions, and discourse formation to shed new light on natural resource management projects in the developing world. Specifically, we document the planning and implementation of two types of water interventions in two contrasting regions: watershed development programmes in northeast India and small reservoirs in sub-Saharan West Africa. We find that there is a contradiction between the inherently political nature of water interventions and the fact that such projects remain grounded in apolitical, technical and managerial narratives. In contrast to the new semantic of development, this depoliticization results in the near absence of attention paid to procedural (participation and empowerment) and distributive (equity) justice concerns and in local actors having to revert to covert ways to achieve their ends. A constructive dialogue between development studies and environmental justice scholars can offer a fresh look on the society-environment nexus in the developing world.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure provides ecosystem services that are essential to human wellbeing. A dearth of national-scale assessments in the Global South has precluded the ability to explore how political regimes, such as the forced racial segregation in South Africa during and after Apartheid, have influenced the extent of and access to green infrastructure over time. We investigate whether there are disparities in green infrastructure distributions across race and income geographies in urban South Africa. Using open-source satellite imagery and geographic information, along with national census statistics, we find that public and private green infrastructure is more abundant, accessible, greener and more treed in high-income relative to low-income areas, and in areas where previously advantaged racial groups (i.e. White citizens) reside. Areas with White residents report 6-fold higher income, have 11.7% greater tree cover, 8.9% higher vegetation greenness and live 700 m closer to a public park than areas with predominantly Black African, Indian, and Coloured residents. The inequity in neighborhood greenness levels has been maintained (for Indian and Coloured areas) and further entrenched (for Black African areas) since the end of Apartheid in 1994 across the country. We also find that these spatial inequities are mirrored in both private (gardens) and public (street verges, parks, green belts) spaces, hinting at the failure of governance structures to plan for and implement urban greening initiatives. By leveraging open-access satellite data and methods presented here, there is scope for civil society to monitor urban green infrastructure over time and thereby hold governments accountable to addressing environmental justice imperatives in the future. Interact with the data here: green-apartheid.zsv.co.za.

Unique political and cultural dynamics shape the study and pursuit of environmental justice (EJ) in Native American communities. This review summarizes Native American EJ issues based on a cross-disciplinary search of more than 60 publications. In so doing, we discuss the unique nature of Native American EJ in terms of conducting research and working toward reducing the continuation of historical trauma associated with environmental ills, the types of strategies used in Native American EJ research, and issues of Native American climate justice. We conclude with discussion of remaining knowledge gaps and future research needs.

AB  - Urbanising cities of India are engulfing the peri-urban land and water resources. Informal water sellers, who transfer water from peri-urban to urban areas, meet the growing water demand in Hyderabad, one of the fastest growing cities in India. This article qualitatively explores how informal water tankers are changing the flows of water, posing challenges to water access for peri-urban residents. We conclude that apart from the state's infrastructural and capacity challenges to provide piped water, power interplay between actors is responsible for the mushrooming of informal water markets. The transfer of water has contributed to groundwater depletion as well as to the water insecurity of peri-urban residents.

AB  - This editorial introduces the Special Section "Commons and Social Movements", which centers on how social movements and commons initiatives shape each other. The Section responds to the recent momentum gained by the "commons movement" in Europe and across the world, as well as the consolidation of a critical scholarship that expands the frontiers of institutional ecological economics for the study of the commons. The diversity of contributions included in the Section illustrates the novelty of the topic. Still, some transversal themes emerge, including the coevolution of movements and commons, the role of heterogeneities, and cross-scalar dynamics. Also promising are the authors' efforts to put the commons and social movement theories in dialogue via con-cepts like water rooted collectives, management opportunity structures, collective reactions to commons grab-bing or liminal commons. Also important is the common understanding across all contributions about the potential of commons movements as sustainability transformation actors. Commons movements can break policy status quos but also prefigure, perform and scale up-and-out alternatives. This is probably the main take home message of this Section and we hope also a motivation to further a research agenda around it.

AB  - This paper shows that a fuller integration of the economic theory of well-being into strategies adopted to reduce the impact of climate change could help to avoid potential conflicts between the mitigation measures applied and the consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels. The paper moves along the path traced by Wood and Roelich (2019) with their Tensions Triangle Theory, but aims to develop it further from an operational point of view, showing how contemporary ecological tax reforms, if inspired by the Capabilities Approach, could more effectively contribute to achieving an inclusive, sustainable, accessible and secure global energy system, that provides solutions to energy challenges and, at the same time, creates value for business and civil society as a whole, without compromising the balance between the three fundamental elements of the tensions triangle described by Wood and Roelich. In particular, this chapter aims to show how the enlargement of the tax area according to new criteria of distributive justice inspired by the Capabilities Approach could serve to increase the mobility of social assets and to develop strategies to adapt public finance systems to the changes produced not only by environmental emergencies, but also by other sudden and adverse phenomena, such as economic crises and significant revenue losses caused by the adoption of non-transparent or harmful tax practices. Finally, the paper considers the proposal to establish taxes on so-called global commons-such as the atmosphere, climate, healthy environment, oceans-and to redistribute their revenue to reduce economic inequalities and poverty.

AB  - This paper describes a project initiated by non-literate indigenous people to equip their own "citizen scientists" with rugged smartphones running adapted software that enable them to share some of their detailed environmental knowledge in ways that improve the sustainable management of their forest. Supporting local people to share their environmental knowledge in scientifically valid and strategically targeted ways can lead to improvement in environmental governance, environmental justice and management practices. Mbendjele huntergatherers in the rainforests of Congo are working together with the ExCiteS Research Group at University College London to make their local knowledge about commercial hunters' activities improve the control of commercial hunters and diminish the harassment they often experience at the hands of "eco-guards" who enforce hunting regulations. Developing and deploying a system for non-literate users introduces a range of challenges that we have tried to solve. Our Anti-Poaching data collection platform, running on Android smartphones, is based on a decision tree of pictorial icons and employs various smartphone sensors to augment observations. We describe its development here.

AB  - This paper presents an analytical framework to identify and understand grassroots water governance practices, which we call 'rooted water collectives' (RWC). RWCs can be multi-scalar organizations that engage in common property resources management or multi-scalar social movements that advocate for common property resources governance. The framework, which we open for discussion, scrutinizes (1) the extent to which 'rooted water collectives' are 'grounded' in the sense they address locally perceived water control problems and resort to water-context embedded meaning, values, identities, belonging and vernacular knowledge; (2) their internal decision-making dynamics; and (3) their effectiveness in achieving impact at multiple scales. It also considers five contextual factors that enable and constrain RWC development. RWC can be deployed as a conceptual lens, but also as an empirical manifestation constituting the object and subject of research. It differs from wide-spread top-down-implemented participatory water management approaches and common property resources management research, in the importance it gives to politics, advocacy and multi-scale social movements. The framework is illustrated with a cursory analysis of four cases: irrigators' federations in Peru; the 'new water culture' movement in Spain; collective irrigation in oases in North Africa; and loosely structured networks of irrigation water users in Cambodia.

AB  - This paper elucidates different forms and modes by which the two State agencies in Mumbai, India-the High Court and the municipal government-appropriated the human rights to water of an estimated two million slum-dwellers in the city. While the order of the High Court made inadequate and narrow interpretations of human rights to water, the municipal policy and functionaries indulged in delayed, selective, cosmetic, distorted, or rhetorical acceptance of these rights. These interpretations and actions led to many limitations and risks for the realization of human rights to water for slum-dwellers including penal tariffs, sub-par infrastructure, and new barriers to water access. Yet, the court order also removed a stiff legal barrier and empowered slum dwellers by lending legitimacy to their claims to water access. This paper responds to concerns in the literature over the appropriation of human rights to water by capitalist States especially in the Global South and its adverse im-plications for the realization of these rights. It also substantiates previous researchers' claims that there is a potential for positive outcomes of struggles for these rights. Finally, I indicate that, while countering such institutional appropriation, struggles for human rights to water need to undertake political action to enforce these rights.

AB  - This paper contributes to geographical perspectives on energy justice by arguing for the concept of "spaces of energy well-being." We build on the concepts of capabilities, home, and emotional embodiment to offer an understanding of the spatiality of well-being. The paper draws on empirical material from a study conducted with social housing tenants in Port Kembla, Australia, following recent energy price increases. Interviews illustrate that social housing tenants engaged in reducing domestic energy consumption occupy a paradoxical space of well-being. We argue that energy bills are lived and felt daily through bodies as anxiety, given that participants experience social housing as a therapeutic and safe place that allows possibilities to refashion the self. We better understand the dynamics of pride and shame from limiting energy use. Our analysis suggests that essential to understanding the ways social housing tenants relate to uneven access to fuel is as an emotionally embodied home making and unmaking practice.

AB  - This paper explores an intriguing case of environmental mobilisation in the world, Argentina's anti-mining movement. This movement has contributed to the cancelation or suspension of about half of the contentious projects they have opposed and has led to the approval of regulations and laws restricting large-scale mining activities in 9 out of 23 national provinces. This process of mobilisation and institutional change is quite unique when compared to other Latin American and worldwide environmental mobilisation processes. This paper studies how the actors and the strategies mobilised in Argentinean mining conflicts have led to these and other mobilisation outcomes. With this aim we have developed, in collaboration with the Environmental Justice Atlas (www.ejaltas.org), a systematic identification and analysis of all public large-scale mining conflicts in the country from 1997 (when large scale mining began) to 2018. We conclude signalling three key interrelated features of anti-mining contention in Argentina: the diversity of actors and their strategies, some political opportunity structures (i.e. decentralised mining governance to provinces, mobilisation at early stages of projects) and the role of multi-scalar environmental justice networks acting on local, provincial and national scales.

AB  - Trust can be understood as a mechanism to reduce social complexity. Trust is located in the relations between people, making it a property of social systems. Trust is a prerequisite for the functioning of society, providing a foundation upon which sustainable development, environmental justice, etc. are only possible. Consequently, there is a great interest to maintain or strengthen trust in systems and institutions, e.g., in money as an exchange medium. The requirement of trust for environmental governance sets the boundaries for social change and reduces the probability of implementing measures that might undermine trust and social cohesion, e.g., environmental policies that threaten investments in the economy. Contemporary socio-economic trends, including the acceleration of market processes, globalization, and the consequential growing complexity in society make it more difficult to maintain trust. Thus, it is questioned whether efforts that potentially improve the society-environment relationship are actually desirable in society.

AB  - Urban parks are essential components of urban ecosystems, providing recreation and relaxation places to residents. Measuring the spatial accessibility to urban parks serves as an initial step in urban planning and developing urban development strategies to improve social and environmental justice. This study aims to evaluate measures of spatial accessibility to urban parks by comparing three geographic information systems (GIS)-based approaches, accounting for network complexity, transport modes, distance thresholds, and destination choices. Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures. The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate accessibility measure for use in different contexts.

AB  - Urban cultural space (UCS) has been of great social and economic value for sustainable development, and the existing researches about it mainly focus on some specific aspects, such as historical heritage or cultural service facility. However, UCS hasn't been quantitatively assessed as an independent system with clear definition and comprehensive classification. Thus, we present a quantitative analysis based on the statistic of UCS provision in different categories between 44 sub-districts in Xi'an and find its inequalities. Xi'an urban land use data and population data of sub-district level are introduced in the analysis process with GIS, SPSS and MATLAB. Our results indicate that inequalities of UCS in Xi'an are mainly reflected in three aspects, including categories, geospatial and population. Among the four categories of UCS, historical heritage and cultural park account for higher percentage, while cultural service facility and religious space are lower. The inequalities in geospatial could be estimated from two indicators. The first indicator named cultural space rate ranges from 0 to 66.88%, while the other named distance between residential and cultural space varies from 100.47 m to 2004.75 m. The inequalities in population could be assessed by cultural space per capita and Gini coefficient. The results indicate that per capita ranges from 0 m(2) to 214.79 m(2). The Gini coefficient of Xi'an is 0.86, which means that the UCS distribution in population is extremely inequitable. Our studies would further the research on UCS and provide constructive suggestions in urban planning and policy formulation to ensure adequate UCS provision and improve its distributional order in Xi'an.

AB  - Within research on late liberal biopolitics, scholars have examined the individualization of public or collective dangers, such as the obesity epidemic, natural disasters, and climate change. Yet few have scrutinized the most audacious of cases: when the government participated in and benefited from the destruction of its land and poisoning of its people, and then, rather than admit culpability, turns around to blame their citizens' ill health on their individual behavior. In this article, I investigate lead contamination in Kabwe, Zambia a former lead mining town and one of the 10 most polluted cities in the world. I argue ignorance, not just knowledge, can be a technology of governing: a strategic way for the government to manage their population and "let die." Drawing upon 48 qualitative interviews with mine, government, and civil society insiders along with eight resident focus groups, this article scrutinizes how government secrecy gave way to three talking points that frame conversations about the environment in Kabwe-that lead contamination is natural, that lead poisoning is easily preventable, and that it is treatable. With this narrative, education campaigns actively produce ignorance about the causes and consequences of widespread lead poisoning, continually turning poisoning events and happenings into quasi-events, or states of being residents are left to endure.

AB  - This paper investigates the introduction of unit-pricing (UP) schemes in waste management with regard to grassroots initiatives promoting bottom-up participatory processes in local communities, addressing several issues concerning environmental justice and degrowth. As waste service charges and fees increase in proportion of waste generated in presence of UP schemes, the paper explores and evaluates the socio-economic impact of these schemes at a local level, analysing data and information gathered from four municipalities in Spain. Findings indicate that UP schemes can provide a more balanced payment system for local residents, and help reducing free-rider behaviours associated with illegal and improper disposal practices. In addition, findings provide empirical evidence of the importance of grassroots initiatives in relation to increasing awareness regarding environmental issues among the public, and in view of facilitating change towards more sustainable practices within local communities. Conclusions gathered from this study offer valuable insights to local and national policymakers with regard to the design and delivery of UP schemes in waste management services.

AB  - This paper explores and examines the distribution of environmental conflicts in Germany between 1985 and 2015, analysing the main causes for environmental conflicts related to privatisation and deprivatisation processes of urban services in 80 German cities. Using information collected via means of a Delphi Method based on focus groups with experts, we identify 90 cases of large-scale privatisation initiatives involving urban services occurred in different fields within the period considered. In 38 cases, privatisation was reversed due to initiatives undertaken by environmental justice organisations and other local grassroots groups promoting de-privatisation and re-municipalisation. In another 30 cases, privatisation was prevented as a result of these initiatives. Findings from our analysis indicate that deprivatisation initiatives and potential conflicts related to them are frequently driven by grassroots organisations promoting the provision of commons-based urban services. Our findings also suggest that privatising services in the energy, water supply and waste management sectors is likely to negatively affect the quality of service supply and increasing prices for urban residents.

AB  - This essay examines W. E. B. Du Bois's call for the "conservation of races" as an instance of an ecological legacy in African American thought that challenged traditional divisions between humans and nonhumans. Evoking contemporary models of rhetoric, I show that Du Bois implicitly figured blackness as an inventive rhetorical ecology that was distributed through material things and environments. Promoting the conservation of that ecology, his sociological work gestured toward a worldly, more-than-human ideal of justice. I explore how his ecological articulation of conservation resonated with Progressive Era environmental conservation in its rejection of ideals of purity but pressed beyond its economic materialism and human essentialism. Ultimately, I argue, Du Bois leaves us with a unique picture of conservation as a cooperative practice of identification in which both human and nonhuman participants come to articulate as interdependent parts of a larger ecology, a process that involves memory at a lived, material level.

AB  - Urban green space and water features provide numerous social, environmental, and economic benefits, yet disparities often exist in their distribution and accessibility. This study examines the link between issues of environmental justice and urban water management to evaluate potential improvements in green space and surface water access through the revitalization of existing engineered water infrastructures, namely stormwater ponds. First, relative access to green space and water features were compared for residents of Tampa, Florida, and an inner-city community of Tampa (East Tampa). Although disparities were not found in overall accessibility between Tampa and East Tampa, inequalities were apparent when quality, diversity, and size of green spaces were considered. East Tampa residents had significantly less access to larger, more desirable spaces and water features. Second, this research explored approaches for improving accessibility to green space and natural water using three integrated stormwater management development scenarios. These scenarios highlighted the ability of enhanced water infrastructures to increase access equality at a variety of spatial scales. Ultimately, the "greening" of gray urban water infrastructures is advocated as a way to address environmental justice issues while also reconnecting residents with issues of urban water management.

AB  - This contribution explores how climate-vulnerable states can effectively use the law to force action in order to address loss and damage from climate change, taking the Pacific Island state of Vanuatu as an example. Vanuatu made headlines when its Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and External Trade, the Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, announced his government's intention to explore legal action as a tool to address climate loss and damage suffered in Vanuatu. Our contribution places this announcement in the context of Vanuatu's own experience with climate loss and damage, and the state's ongoing efforts to secure compensation for loss and damage through the multilateral climate change regime. We then discuss the possibilities for legal action to seek redress for climate loss and damage, focusing on two types of action highlighted in Minister Regenvanu's statement: action against states under international law, and action against fossil fuel companies under domestic law. After concluding that the issue of compensation for climate loss and damage is best addressed at the multilateral level, we offer proposals on how the two processes of litigation and negotiation could interact with each other and inspire more far-reaching action to address loss and damage from climate change. Key policy insights The review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage offers an opportunity to start putting in place a facility for loss and damage finance under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A climate damages tax (CDT) on fossil fuel companies seems a particularly promising option for mobilizing loss and damage finance. Such a CDT could be one revenue stream for a relevant loss and damage facility. Legal action - including cases against foreign states or fossil fuel companies - could bolster the position of climate-vulnerable states in multilateral negotiations on loss and damage finance.

AB  - Wheeler S. Regions, megaregions, and sustainability, Regional Studies. The rapid expansion of urbanized regions is problematic for sustainable development. Urbanization at large scales has inherent sustainability problems, and planning institutions and governance mechanisms have had limited success at the metropolitan scale, let alone at a megaregional one. A vision of more sustainable regional development includes an emphasis on balanced local communities to reduce regional mobility demands; the management of land, resources, and population to live within regional limits; efforts to improve equity and build social capital; and on economic development that strengthens the quality of the region's social and ecological systems rather than the quantity of production and consumption.

AB  - Urban development can have negative impacts on the environment through various mechanisms. While many air quality studies have been carried out in more developed nations, Eastern Caribbean (EC) countries remain understudied. This study aims to estimate the concentrations of air pollutants in the EC nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Transport, recreation and construction sites were selected randomly using local land use records. Pollutant levels were measured repeatedly for numerous 1-hour intervals in each location between October 2015 and November 2018. Weather trends and land use characteristics were collected concurrent to sampling. Across 27 sites, mean NO2, O-3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 levels were 26.61 ppb (range: 0-306 ppb), 11.94 ppb (0-230 ppb), 27.9 ppb (0-700 ppb), 52.9 mu g m(-3) (0-10,400 mu g m(-3)) and 29.8 mu g m(-3) (0-1556 mu g m(-3)), respectively. Pollutants were elevated in high urban areas and generally significantly positively correlated with each other, with the exception of PM10. NO2 levels in construction areas were generally comparable to those in transportation areas and higher than in recreation areas. O-3 levels were lower in construction than recreation and transport areas. SO2 concentrations were lower in construction and recreation compared to transport sites. Construction and recreation PM10 levels exceeded transport sites, while PM2.5 was highest in construction areas. Additional bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to assess whether various meteorological, temporal and land use factors including rain, tour season and urban features explained variability in air pollutant concentrations. Tourist season and specific months, more than any other factors, contributed most to variability in pollutant concentrations. These new measurements of air pollution concentrations in an understudied nation may have important implications for health outcomes among exposed EC residents, and provide critical data for future exposure and epidemiologic research and environmental policy.

AB  - To date, scholars have examined two common effects of zoning that disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities in the United States: (1) exclusionary effects, resulting from zoning's erection of direct, discriminatory barriers or indirect, economic barriers to geographic mobility; and (2) intensive and expulsive effects, resulting from zoning's disproportionate targeting of minority residential neighborhoods for commercial and industrial development. In light of recent legal and federal policy developments, continued research is needed to better understand the scale of the gap between the treatment of white and minority communities and to better understand how zoning can reverse past injustices.

AB  - Through an examination of four sites of contention in Ecuador, this study explores the impacts of transnational campaigns on domestic organizations and community groups while holding constant the focus of conflict, the construction of an oil pipeline. The international organizations verified local claims, enabled access to international venues such as conferences and investor meetings, and influenced the financing of future large-scale projects. Yet, the transnational campaigns unintentionally emphasized environmental conservation at the expense of local dignity-in-life claims, resonated only with select groups, and potentially undermined domestic networking building. The Northern campaigns emphasized World Bank standards that were arguably weak on environmental protection, especially when compared to the environmental justice demands arising in the oil hubs. Indeed, community participation, environmental health regulation, and economic redistribution may be better achieved through grassroots efforts that target the state, rather than through transnational engagement dependent on international bodies and concerns.

AB  - Using critical race structuralism (CRS), a new contribution, as well as primary and secondary data, this article explores the role of science in teaching social justice issues in urban education. In the United States, a teaching workforce, which is predominately White, middle class, and female, intersects with an increasingly diverse student population, creating a need for culturally responsive teaching practices, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) classes. An investigation of existing literature reveals the need for greater emphasis on environmental racism and social justice as they pertain to students living in low-income and urban communities. Our findings reveal that CRS can be utilized in a collective effort to transform teacher education programs and teacher pedagogy, to effectively address environmental racism and other social justice issues in urban schools and communities.

AB  - Through the critical lens of Julia Kristeva's concept of abjection, this essay analyzes representations of the body in Indra Sinha's 2007 novel Animal's People, arguing that such representations encode the author's conceptions of and responses to the marginalization of environmental justice communities in modern India and the Global South. Reading Sinha's depictions of the bodies of disaster victims and their allies, I contend Sinha mobilizes the abject as an oppositional mode that offers a possible ground of resistance to neo-colonial configurations of power, configurations produced in part by the pervasive and increasing encroachment of multinational corporations on national sovereignty and individual rights. I also maintain that the bodies of the victims do not tell the whole story of Sinha's complex response to the plight of these communities. Rather, Sinha also articulates important connections between bodily materiality, corporate personhood, and corporate guilt. Ultimately, I argue, Sinha's effort to seek redress for environmental justice communities involves the reintroduction of the bodies of victim and perpetrator into narrative in order to foreground the body as a crucial rhetorical element in a contest between marginalized people and the gargantuan powers that oppose and oppress them.

AB  - Urban planning for health equity should be guided by an intersectional approach. Intersectionality is an essential framework for understanding the multiple overlapping factors, such as social and economic inequalities, that produce health disparities. We offer four strategies that planning researchers and practitioners can use to develop and integrate an intersectional approach into planning for health equity: challenging implicit and explicit assumptions, building cross-sectoral coalitions united by a shared vision for social and environmental justice, applying transdisciplinary and co-designing approaches throughout the planning process, and using existing tools to evaluate the impact of programs and policies on advancing health equity.

AB  - This paper argues that transitions research more broadly needs to take more account of justice in its analysis. This paper draws primarily from environmental and energy justice literature to engage with the concept of justice in transitions research, as it seeks justice for people, communities, and the non-human environment from negative environmental impacts. This is achieved through different forms of justice: distributive, procedural, and recognition. Our paper concludes with reflections upon the application of a justice approach to sustainability transitions research and offer insights into a potentially new research agenda.

AB  - While the concept of 'just transitions' has become more and more prominent in academic and popular discussions of sustainability transition, these conceptions are often framed in purely economic terms, and focus on the economic impact on communities, regions, and nation-states. We argue that a broader conception of justice in transitions, and in particular energy transitions, is required. Questions such as who will win and who will lose as society transitions to more sustainable future, who decides what the transition will look like, how are those historically excluded from decision making recognized, and how are the interests of non-humans and future generations included are important to answer in order to ensure that concepts of justice are included in transitions processes. Answering these questions is critical in "ensuring that system transitions are not only more sustainable, but also more just" (Williams and Doyon, 2019, p. 144). In this paper, we apply the justice and system transition framework (Williams and Doyon, 2019) to the Energy Futures Lab (EFL). We find that while the EFL has made great strides towards justice in transition, the EFL is also a demonstration of the challenges of incorporating justice such as addressing issues of power dynamics and conceptions of diversity and inclusion. We also find that the justice and system transitions framework proves to be a valuable tool in assessing justice in transitions projects. Going beyond the common 'just transition' approach that focuses on distributive justice gives a richer conception of justice and ensures that procedural and recognition approaches are included.

AB  - Within an environmental justice frame, capacity-building has been an important component of efforts to address health disparities at the policy, system, and environment levels. While the literature is replete with studies that discuss the necessity of collective action as a means to generate power to overcome inequities, limited attention has been given to the structure of these efforts to build capacity and challenge environmental injustices. This study applies the community engagement continuum as a framework for understanding the scope of capacity-building strategies and the manner in which research investigators engage with their intended target community. Paired teams of independent analysts screened articles for relevance (n = 8452), identified records for content abstraction (n = 163), and characterized relevant studies (n = 58). Many articles discussed community engagement as being either collaborative or shared leadership (n = 32, 55.2%). While the most commonly used capacity-building strategies were organizing/social action (58.6%) and CBPR (50%), few studies were able to make an environmental impact (n = 23; 39.7%), and fewer had a direct legislative policy-related outcome (n = 13; 22.4%). This review identifies levels of collaborative involvement and strategic approaches used for strengthening community capacity in efforts of making transformative policy, systems, and environmental change.

AB  - With the ongoing failure of governments to protect their citizens from impacts of the neoliberal global agenda, civil society groups worldwide have moved into the breach. Social workers, as allies of these groups, are uniquely positioned to help maximise their effectiveness in confronting the threats of corporate globalisation to democracy, economic justice, the environment and protection of the commons. How do activist groups know when they're making a difference? This chapter builds on a four-year collaboration with nine diverse activist groups to see what we could learn together about effective practice in social/environmental justice work. We report on what activists told us about what 'success' means in their work, and what facilitates those successes. Reflecting on the implications of these findings in relation to social work skills and capacities, we suggest how social work educators might enhance our capabilities to contribute to the critical work of challenging and replacing the global neoliberal project.

AB  - This paper adopts a processual understanding of mapping to empirically explore the workings of satellite-based forest visualisations and maps within the REDD+ process in DR Congo. Our analysis approaches maps as ongoing contingent practices and highlights the recursive interplay between maps and the socio-natural world. We first show how REDD+ (mapping) assemblages enact a uniform portrayal of community-induced threats to nature, which in turn legitimises a monoculture of abstract space often to the detriment of communities' authority over land and their particular socio-ecological relationships. However, these mapping attempts at reordering forest landscapes are locally met with and reshaped by ever-emergent socio-spatial practices, ways of seeing and appropriating landscape. Complexity, fluidity, and ambiguity are indeed rendered absent by these seemingly immutable and complete representations although they are essential for understanding struggles over resources. We conclude that adopting a processual understanding of maps opens up ways of enacting socio-environmental justice.

AB  - Thousands of confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) have been constructed in eastern North Carolina. The fecal waste pit and spray Field waste management systems used by these operations are susceptible to flooding in this low-lying region. To investigate the potential that flood events can lead to environmental dispersion of animal wastes containing numerous biologic and chemical hazards, we compared the geographic coordinates of 2,287 CAFOs permitted by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality (DWQ) with estimates of flooding derived from digital satellite images of eastern North Carolina taken approximately I week after Hurricane Floyd dropped as much as 15-20 inches of rain in September 1999. Three cattle, one poultry, and 237 swine operations had geographic coordinates within the satellite-based flooded area. DWQ confirmed 46 operations with breached or flooded fecal waste pits in the same area. Only 20 of these 46 CAFOs were within the satellite-based estimate of the inundated area. CAFOs within the satellite-based flood area were located in 132 census block groups with a population of 171,498 persons in the 2000 census. African Americans were more likely than whites to live in areas with flooded CAFOs according to satellite estimates, but not according to DWQ reports. These areas have high poverty rates and dependence on wells for drinking water. Our analysis suggests that flood events have a significant potential to degrade environmental health because of dispersion of wastes from industrial animal operations in areas with vulnerable populations.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) and the ecosystem services they provide are essential for the health and wellbeing of city dwellers. UGS are increasingly seen as a potential solution for sustainable urban planning and development. Informal green spaces (IGS), even though they may make up a large share of UGS, are often overlooked in this regard. This study examines residents' awareness of the ecosystem services provided by IGS and their need for redevelopment. The data were collected through structured interviews in the immediate vicinity of selected IGS in the Polish city of Lodz. Lodz is typical of post-industrial European cities struggling with environmental (heatwaves, cloudbursts), social (aging, depopulation) and spatial (a neglected and dense city center) issues. Our results show that residents saw IGS as places able to provide a range of services, mostly of the regulating type, and even minor design interventions can improve the attractiveness of IGS. Taking this into account, we conclude that IGS are important vegetated areas in the city, which can be complementary to formal greenery.

AB  - Urban green space, such as parks, forests, green roofs, streams, and community gardens, provides critical ecosystem services. Green space also promotes physical activity, psychological well-being, and the general public health of urban residents. This paper reviews the Anglo-American literature on urban green space, especially parks, and compares efforts to green US and Chinese cities. Most studies reveal that the distribution of such space often disproportionately benefits predominantly White and more affluent communities. Access to green space is therefore increasingly recognized as an environmental justice issue. Many US cities have implemented strategies to increase the supply of urban green space, especially in park-poor neighborhoods. Strategies include greening of remnant urban land and reuse of obsolete or underutilized transportation infrastructure. Similar strategies are being employed in Chinese cities where there is more state control of land supply but similar market incentives for urban greening. In both contexts, however, urban green space strategies may be paradoxical: while the creation of new green space to address environmental justice problems can make neighborhoods healthier and more esthetically attractive, it also can increase housing costs and property values. Ultimately, this can lead to gentrification and a displacement of the very residents the green space strategies were designed to benefit. Urban planners, designers, and ecologists, therefore, need to focus on urban green space strategies that are 'just green enough' and that explicitly protect social as well as ecological sustainability.

AB  - While the literature clearly acknowledges that individuals may experience different levels of segregation across their various socio-geographical spaces, most measures of segregation are intended to be used in the residential space. Using spatially aggregated data to evaluate segregation in the residential space has been the norm and thus individual's segregation experiences in other socio-geographical spaces are often de-emphasized or ignored. This paper attempts to provide a more comprehensive approach in evaluating segregation beyond the residential space. The entire activity spaces of individuals are taken into account with individuals serving as the building blocks of the analysis. The measurement principle is based upon the exposure dimension of segregation. The proposed measure reflects the exposure of individuals of a referenced group in a neighborhood to the populations of other groups that are found within the activity spaces of individuals in the referenced group. Using the travel diary data collected from the tri-county area in southeast Florida and the imputed racial-ethnic data, this paper demonstrates how the proposed segregation measurement approach goes beyond just measuring population distribution patterns in the residential space and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of segregation by considering various socio-geographical spaces.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of brownfield redevelopments on neighboring housing prices in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. We examine the levels and trends in housing prices before and after the remediation of brownfields in neighborhoods based on parcel-level housing sales data from 1996 to 2007. We use the Adjusted Interrupted Time Series-Difference in Differences model to explain the causal direction of impacts of brownfield redevelopments. We explore impacts on nearby property values from the remediation of brownfield sites countywide and in neighborhoods stratified by family income. This paper also specifies how the impact of brownfield redevelopments varies under different land use upon completion of remediation. Our countywide model shows that brownfield sites have a negative impact on surrounding housing prices. However, after brownfields are redeveloped, the negative impacts of contaminated sites on neighboring housing prices are removed. It is notable that brownfield redevelopment in commercial and recreational land use has positive impacts on nearby property values. Our findings also show that there are significant positive impacts on surrounding housing prices in low- and middle-income neighborhoods. These results will help policymakers better understand how the remediation of brownfields affects neighborhoods and develop policies to reap the maximum economic benefit from brownfield redevelopments.

AB  - This paper explores the relationships between the moral philosophical foundations and strategic goals of two conceptions of energy justice: the "triumvirate conception" and the "principled approach". We explore the extent to which the goals of these approaches align with their core aims and strategies. Having initially been developed to capture and reflect the values of activist-led environmental justice movements, we find that the triumvirate approach's adoption of a trivalent conception of justice currently lies in tension with its overarching top-down approach. We note that the principled approach does not face the same tensions as the triumvirate conception of energy justice, but would benefit from illustrating the consequences of framing the same energy dilemma with conflicting moral theories. Aiming to ameliorate these limitations and further develop conceptions of energy justice, we outline a case study of hydro power in Hirakud, India and propose a framework which illustrates how using differing theories of justice to conceptualise the same energy dilemmas can result in substantially different normative framings and guidance. We illustrate how this framework, combined with a pluralistic appeal to moral theory, can enable both approaches to draw on a wider range of moral theory to assess energy dilemmas. This in turn provides a broader socio-political backdrop in which to view energy dilemmas. We outline how this backdrop contributes to the creation of a space in which the grievances of those who suffer in relation to energy systems can be heard and better understood.

AB  - This paper addresses climate change through collaborative work with social movement organisations in the Philippines. We contend that the tendency of work on climate change, social resilience and climate justice to ignore epistemological questions and proceed through technocentric dominant frames can lead to partial responses that support the status quo, contribute to slow (or fast) violence, and enhance ongoing processes of marginalisation. Instead, we argue, there is a need to co-develop analyses with those most affected. The experiences shared in this paper speak to complex knowings of climate and the intimate hurts of disaster, and provide rich scope for resistance and change. We find knowledges to be affective, emotional and relational, and deeply imbued with power relations. These insights lead us to theorise a topological angle on the knowings and beings of climate: to turn to emotional topologies. In seeking to elaborate on emotional topologies of climate, we draw on the concept of knowledge spaces to better understand meanings and practices of climate as emergent motleys of linked people, sites, affective process, activities and technologies. In the emergent nature of these spaces, there is scope for disruption, re-ordering and resistance.

AB  - Urban green spaces can promote physical activity, well-being, and public health, but disparities in the distribution of such spaces predominantly benefit affluent communities. Therefore, green justice issues have become a focus of academic research. In this paper, we develop a new model, the comprehensive floating catchment area (CFCA), to measure the accessibility of urban green space. The CFCA models urban green space attractiveness as a function of park size and of street green views from residential zones to parks. Three transportation modes (walking, biking, and driving a car) are compared. We take the central urban area of Beijing as the research area and measure green justice across different economic residential zones using the ordinary least squares model. The results suggest that the spatial disparities of urban green space are significant when only polygon urban green spaces are considered, regardless of the transportation mode. However, green injustice is mitigated when we consider both urban green spaces and street greening. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to study green justice by taking a street green view, and the results of this study can provide guidance on urban green space development for government leaders and researchers in the future.

AB  - This research quantifies the distribution of toxic releases in Puerto Rico to determine whether environmental inequality exists. We calculate an environmental Gini coefficient using Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data from 2000 to 2008. Our findings suggest Puerto Rico has a relatively constant and unequal distribution of releases over this time period. Based on this result, we investigate linkages between toxic releases and several socioeconomic and demographic indicators. We apply a quantile regression model using TRI data and American Community Survey data from 2005 to 2008 to identify important indicators across the distribution of releases. We find municipios (legal division equivalent to US counties) that have a higher percent of non-Puerto Rican Hispanic origin or high school educated population experience higher releases to all media. This also is true for unemployment, but only for municipios with the largest releases (i.e., highest quintile). The results also reveal municipios that are more densely populated or that have a higher percent of college degrees experience lower releases to all media. Higher proportions of certain age groups also suggest lower releases. These results are not constant across the distribution of releases; they are most significant in those municipios with the largest releases. This is even more obvious when we only examine releases to air.

AB  - This paper examines the perceived spill-over effects of proximity to golf courses on life satisfaction based on a large-scale individual survey conducted in Beijing in 2013. We find a positive association between residential proximity to golf courses and life satisfaction. This association is more pronounced for residents living at the closest distance margins and tends to vary by housing and golf landscape characteristics. Additional results quantify the evidence on potential complementary effects of public green spaces and golf courses. Findings of this study suggest that club-based green amenities should be considered in land use policies aiming to improve urban greenness and landscape.

AB  - To address disparities in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for racial/ethnic minority groups, this study characterized personal and ambient concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a suspected hot spot of air pollution - the Village of Waterfront South (WFS), and an urban reference community - the Copewood/Davis Streets (CDS) neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey. Both are minority-dominant, impoverished communities. We collected 24-h integrated personal air samples from 54 WFS residents and 53 CDS residents, with one sample on a weekday and one on a weekend day during the summer and winter seasons of 2004-2006. Ambient air samples from the center of each community were also collected simultaneously during personal air sampling. Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) presented higher (p < 0.05) ambient levels in WFS than in CDS, particularly during weekdays. A stronger association between personal and ambient concentrations of MTBE and TEX was found in WFS than in CDS. Fourteen to forty-two percent of the variation in personal MTBE, hexane, benzene, and TEX was explained by local outdoor air pollution. These observations indicated that local sources impacted the community air pollution and personal exposure in WFS. The estimated cancer risks resulting from two locally emitted VOCs, benzene and ethylbenzene, and non-cancer neurological and respiratory effects resulting from hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylenes exceeded the US EPA risk benchmarks in both communities. These findings emphasized the need to address disparity in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for the socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This study also demonstrated that air pollution hot spots similar to WFS can provide robust setting to investigate health effects of ambient air pollution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to apply an intersectional environmentalist lens to the circular economy (CE) transition in Flanders. CE discourse often takes a deterritorialised approach, that is, a focus on innovation and growth. This approach tends to neglect local knowledge and background skills that can inhabit and work with landscapes in balanced ways to enable a fully circular society. This knowledge is partly embodied by "nobodied" actors. After introducing relevant terminology, this article draws upon a collaborative autoethnography which integrates autobiographies of authors' experiences of circularity in projects with "nobodied" CE actors, and ethnographic notes on the Flemish context in which the CE discourse developed. The reflections unearth how a lack of an intersectional environmentalist lens in the CE rhetoric "nobodies" informal CE actors and practices. We show how they do not matter in a circular economy in a deterritorialised approach, but how they matter in a circular landscape view.

AB  - With increasing focus on the associations between green space and the health of disadvantaged groups such as the elderly, children, and low-income people, there is still inconsistent evidence in the literature from the perspective of environmental justice in China. Thus, this study re-examines the impact of green space on self rated health, mental health and physical capability based on a comprehensive survey of Lilong communities in Shanghai in 2016. We employed several types of greenness indicator at the community level, including park accessibility, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), eye-level green visibility, and satisfaction with neighborhood green-space provision. Our results show that there is no significant relationship between neighborhood greenness and Lilong residents' general health, with neighborhood greenness more strongly associated with Lilong residents' mental than physical health. For vulnerable neighborhoods, of the various greenness assessment metrics studied, self-reported satisfaction with the level of greenness is shown to have the most consistent positive effect on people's health outcomes.

AB  - White-collar workers, with tremendous work pressure, excessive working hours, and poor physical condition, need green spaces not only to have physical exercise and social gatherings, but also to become closer to nature and to relieve stress for their mental health. In China, the 996 office schedule, working from 09:00 to 17:00 six days a week, has become popular in the workplace; under such high-intensity work and pressure, white-collar workers have limited time to access green space for leisure, and their use of green space for health benefits is compromised. This study selected Shenzhen Futian Central Business District to find out the green space use patterns and preferences of white-collar workers based on GPS data and questionnaire surveys. In addition, the value of green exposure in the time dimension was calculated according to individuals' actual behaviors. Based on cluster analysis, this study summarized the typical green space use patterns of three groups of white-collar workers, which reflects the hidden inequity of white-collar groups who are subjected to varying degrees of spatiotemporal constraints in using green space. This paper puts forward three directions for the optimization of green space allocation, functional facilities, and improved walkability in employment-intensive urban areas. The results provide certain guiding significance for alleviating the mismatch of time and space in green space enjoyment and for improving the spatiotemporal inclusiveness of green spaces in urban central business districts.

AB  - Urban public space is indispensable in a metropolitan environment. In recent years, green space, as an important part of that public space, has been studied in terms of its pattern and equity of accessibility. However, the pattern of urban public space, including streets, has not yet been studied, nor has it been studied among different countries. To resolve this gap in information, this study conducted a quantitative comparison on the general pattern, type pattern, and scale pattern of urban public space between Zurich in Switzerland and the old city of Nanjing in China. This study also explored using the location quotient method to quantify the pattern of urban public space and its physical structure characteristics. The results show the difference between urban public space in China and Europe exists not only in quantity, scale or type, but also in the pattern of the urban public space system, including the choice of location, distribution status, and service level of that public space. The maximum location quotient of Zurich's public space is 9.5 for the areas located in the urban core area. Meanwhile, it is 8.5 for Nanjing for areas located in the periphery of the old city. Areas with a location quotient of greater than one cover 63.3% of the urban construction land in Zurich, while only 30.8% of the corresponding urban construction land is covered in Nanjing. The area and quantity of streets are quite different as well. The street areas of Zurich account for 51.5% of the total area of public space and the number of streets account for 51.2% of the total number of public space sites, while those numbers are only 22.6% and 17.5% for Nanjing, respectively. In addition, the scale gradient of public space is polarized. Both the area ratio and quantity ratio of medium, medium-large, and large public space in Zurich exceed 92%, while the area ratio and quantity ratio of Nanjing are less than 77% and 68%, respectively. This study provides important insights for revealing urban public space patterns to facilitate the sustainability development of urban public space.

AB  - Urban parks play a key role in urban sustainable development. This paper proposes a method for the evaluation of public parks from the perspective of accessibility and quality. The method includes the data extraction of urban park locations and the delineation of urban built-up areas. The processing of urban park data not only involves the extraction from digital maps, but also the classification of urban parks using a semi-automated model in ArcGIS. The urban area is identified using the Point of Interest (POI) data in digital maps, taking economic and human activities into consideration. The service area and its overlapped time is included in the evaluation indicators. With a clear definition of park and urban built-up area, the evaluation result of urban parks is of great comparability. Taking China as an example, the quality of urban parks in 273 prefecture-level cities has been evaluated. The results show that the average service coverage of urban parks in Chinese cities is 64.8%, and that there are significant disparities between cities with different population sizes and locations. The results suggest the necessity to improve public parks in small-and-medium sized cities and inland areas to strengthen the coordination of urbanization and regional development.

AB  - Understanding the complex impact of air pollution is crucial to assessing exposure risk and defining public health policies in China. However, the evidence and hence knowledge of how urban activity responds to air pollution are limited. In this paper, we propose to use geotagged check-in records on Weibo, a Tweeter-like platform, to systematically investigate the effect of air pollution on urban activity. Based on panel models, we found clear evidence that such effect exists and varies between pollutants, visitors and residents, and different activity types. Typically, SO2 has the largest impact, followed by PM2.5, NO2, and PM10; local citizens' activities are more susceptible than visitors; leisure-related activity has a sensitivity at least twofold higher than work-related activities. Additionally, we tested hypotheses about the heterogeneous effect. We confirmed the role of Income and air quality, showing that people who live in richer and more polluted cities are more likely to experience the effects of air pollution. Specifically, people who live in a more polluted city with 100 unit increments in AvgAQI show on average the same sensitivity as those who live in a less polluted city and earn about 20.3 thousand yuan more in average Income. This reveals new insights about environmental injustice in China. By presenting a portrait of the spatial heterogeneity, we argued that environmental injustice in terms of air pollution is not just about the difference in exposure risk measured based on population distribution, rather the measurement should also consider the disparity derived from urban activity. Secondly, new injustice may arise in underdeveloped areas where manufacture industry is transferred to but people barely take avoidance behavior. Finally, the map also reveals the general neglect of the detrimental effect of light air pollution, which we speculate is partly due to China's comparatively low standard in governmental regulations. We believe our finding contributes significantly to exposure risk assessment and environmental justice debates. Hence it highlights the necessity and urgency of public healthy polices that spread the health consequence of air pollution, especially in the underdeveloped region.

AB  - Urban greenery is essential to the living environment of humans. Objectively assessing the rationality of the spatial distribution of green space resources will contribute to regional greening plans, thereby reducing social injustice. However, it is difficult to propose a reasonable greening policy aimed at the coordinated development of an urban agglomeration due to a lack of baseline information. This study investigated the changes in spatial fairness of the greenery surrounding residents in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay by examining time-series remote sensing images from 1997 to 2017. With the substitution of impervious, artificial surfaces for universal areas of human activities, we quantified the amount of surrounding greenery from the perspective of human activities at the pixel level by utilizing a nested buffer. The Gini coefficient was further calculated for each city to quantify the spatial fairness of the surrounding greenery to people. The results indicated that areas with less greenery surrounding them decreased during 1997 and 2017 in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay. The spatial fairness did not tend to increase with the improvements in the overall greening level. The spatial fairness of 4 cities had an increasing trend, and the Gini coefficients of 5 cities were still over 0.6 in 2017. We further proposed different greening policy suggestions for different cities based on the amount of greenery surrounding people and the trend in fairness. The results and the conclusion of this research will help to improve future regional greening policies and to reduce environmental injustice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the transition to carbon-free economy, concerns have grown about the ?green divide? ? the separation of society into different social groups whose socioeconomic status determines one?s well-being from climate change impacts. Studies in environmental justice concur that the adverse effects of urban climate change are disproportionately greater for the demographically vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, the children, and the socially marginalized. Yet, little is known about how these social groups contribute to urban climate change policies. Accounting for local climate risks and the presence of national adaptation schemes, this study examines whether the implementation of adaptation policies in the 902 European cities is influenced by the proportion of these vulnerable groups. Our results show a positive and significant association between the proportion of elderly citizens and adaptation policies among these European cities. The result of this study offers local level empirical evidence to the climate justice discussion and suggests that the adaptation policies adopted by these European cities are working to ameliorate environmental injustice faced by the older and weaker social groups.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) plays an essential role in sustainable urban development and is closely related to public health and human well-being. The inequity of UGS violates environmental justice and threatens the life quality of residents. Although previous studies have examined UGS distribution and the disparity between social groups, they seldom consider the spatial heterogeneity of the UGS inequity for the vulnerable. To find out which vulnerable groups are suffering the insufficiency of UGS resources and to identify the specific spaces with severe UGS inequity in the context of high-density cities, this study employed a geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to investigate the spatial relationship between UGS availability and neighborhood vulnerable socio-economic variables in Guangzhou, China. Results showed that the older adults, less-educated population, immigrants, and households with a living area below 50m2 in more than half of the neighborhoods in Guangzhou were suffering UGS inequity. These neighborhoods were detected spatially and had different spatial agglomeration characteristics. Based on this, the UGS inequity level of each neighborhood was comprehensively evaluated so that we can identify the spaces facing serious UGS inequity issues that should be paid attention to in future UGS system planning and policymaking.

AB  - This paper theorises the spatialisation of White supremacy through the siting and expansion of a US immigrant detention centre, the Northwest Detention Center (NWDC). This case reveals the spatial relationship between the detention centre's displacement with the Seattle-Tacoma region's increasing wealth, highlighting the role of detention and incarceration in the spatialisation of White supremacy. If White advantage maps onto whiteness as property, then White supremacy maps onto interlocking systems of settler colonialism and racial capitalism that dispossess people of colour of land and turns their bodies into devalued pollution sinks, where the less-than-citizen is forced to live on Tar Pits that they cannot even call "home". Since 2014, detained immigrants' activism has fuelled conversations about the punitive nature of administrative immigrant detention, racial profiling, and the city's responsibility to enforce health, safety and environmental regulations for all residents. Through the stories of detainees, deportees and their co-conspirators, this site fight illustrates how abolition ecologies call for tearing down toxic detention centres. Beyond rejecting White supremacist logics in immigration enforcement, abolitionists make freedom as a place together.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGSs) are important for urban residents' well-being, especially in dense urban areas. This study uses Macau, a high-density city in Asia, as a case study area and tracks changes in the distribution of UGS accessibility across space and across population groups from 2010 to 2015. Based on the two-step floating catchment area model (2SFCA), the results indicate that UGS accessibility is distributed unevenly across space and population groups in Macau. Over time, however, UGS accessibility became more evenly distributed, despite the decline in overall UGS accessibility. These changes are attributable to the policies of upgrading UGSs and building micro-scale UGSs. These results shed light on how future policies can enhance UGS equity in high density urban areas.

AB  - Young people are both among the generations to be most affected by climate change and critical-advocates for climate action. In the face of growing urgency surrounding the climate crisis, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has become an important institutional framework for political progress. We developed a community-based participatory action research project centered on youth involved in the COP climate negotiations. A "leverage points" approach guided our research; this paper is the first time the framework has been applied in an international negotiations context. Our-findings point to the structural power, networks, and paradigms that youth might engage with for international climate justice work. We identify actionable leverage points through which youth-organizers might increase their social power in the COP process to bring about climate action. Many of these -leverage points are rooted in dynamics of power, which we expand upon and connect to broader literature. Moving forward, these findings can benefit and inform the strategies of youth as they participate in the COP process.

AB  - This Note seeks to paint a picture of what working toward environmental justice should look like. Focusing on the demands that environmental justice communities voiced through the Principles of Environmental Justice, it posits that three key components are necessary to comprehensively achieve environmental justice: distributive justice, recognitional justice, and procedural justice. Common understandings of environmental justice often miss either one or both of the latter two components. This Note puts a name on work that simultaneously addresses all three: comprehensive environmental justice work. By developing a common understanding of comprehensive environmental justice, this Note aims to ensure that those who care about achieving environmental justice understand the need to address each component. For environmental justice supporters and partners who are eager to contribute to the movement in the most efficient and effective way, a common understanding of comprehensive environmental justice work can aid in identifying which organizations deserve their resources. For lawyers who aim to aid the movement, a common understanding will contextualize their role in the movement and the components they are addressing. Part I recounts the events leading up to the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit and adoption of the Principles of Environmental Justice. Part II traces the government's attempts to implement environmental justice. Part III evaluates the role of the lawyer in actualizing this understanding of comprehensive environmental justice. Part IV assesses an Earthjustice-led coalition's role in alleviating blood-lead-level disparities in environmental justice communities in a recent Ninth Circuit case. Part V briefs policy implications of a fragmented understanding of environmental justice. Finally, by identifying good practices that large organizations are currently employing, I conclude with some guideposts for empowering rather than usurping the communities who founded the environmental justice movement.

AB  - With the rapid spatial expansion of the warehousing industry in major metropolitan areas, environmental impacts associated with warehousing activities have been growing in the recent decades. This study focuses on the disproportionate distribution of warehousing facilities in disadvantaged neighborhoods and discusses how the disparities result from the interactions between various socioeconomic processes. From the perspective of environmental justice, warehousing-related environmental hazards affect the spatial relationship between warehouses and local communities. The changing factors in the firm location choice of warehousing facilities and the housing location choice of disadvantaged population jointly lead to the environmental justice problem in warehousing location.

AB  - Warehousing activities generate substantial externalities that affect surrounding neighborhoods. Using data for four major metropolitan areas in California, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, this study tests the relationship between the spatial distribution of warehouses and disadvantaged neighborhoods. The results based on spatial presentation and statistical models show that warehouses are disproportionately located in minority neighborhoods, regardless of the differences in urban contexts. In specific, medium-income and low-income minority neighborhoods are more likely to have higher concentration of warehouses than medium-or low-income white ones. The four metros are diversified in the roles of global trade, land availability, and the size of the warehousing industry. However, the spatial patterns are found consistent across these metros, suggesting that the environmental justice problem in warehousing location is a common concern. Local governments should monitor and evaluate the rapid spatial expansion of warehousing facilities and make efforts to mitigate subsequent environmental impacts that are disproportionately located in disadvantaged communities.

AB  - Warehousing activities generate substantial environmental externalities that affect surrounding neighborhoods. Using data from the Los Angeles region, this study tests the relationship between the spatial distribution of warehouses and neighborhoods with different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The results show that warehouses are disproportionately located in both low-income and medium-income minority neighborhoods. The distribution of warehousing facilities and activities is highly related to the percentage of minorities as expected, but its relationship with household income is nonetheless mixed. In the Los Angeles region, low-income neighborhoods are not always attractive to warehouse developers because they are not convenient for warehousing development.

AB  - This study examines the distribution of commercial treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) of hazardous waste in the southeast. Four hypotheses are tested: (1) economic rationality, (2) social inequity, (3) civic capital, and (4) scientific rationality. The data set is a match of records on operational TSDFs and large quantity generators (LQGs) of hazardous waste from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, nonprofit organization data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics, and seismic hazard and hydrologic data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Logistic regression results indicate that location outcomes are predictable by the distribution of civic capital assets, the racial composition of a community, the hydrologic suitability of a land use, and TSDF proximity to LQGs. The concentration of LQG activity and the percentage of African Americans in a neighborhood are the most consistent predictors of TSDF location outcomes across spatial measures of risk.

AB  - This chapter engages with biocultural approaches to conservation to affirm the growing need and application of frameworks to address power, rights, and indigenous perspectives in local to global environmental problems. Through a case study that focuses on M.bengokre-Kayapo peoples' projects for water sovereignty, I describe the sociopolitical and institutional contexts and cultural perspectives that shape Kayapo engagements with aquatic environment. While river and riparian habitats are central to Kayapo livelihoods and political goals, Kayapo understandings of aquatic landscapes are not central to national and international visions of sustainable Amazonian futures. These visions fashion the Amazon as a conservation-development mosaic instead of a bioculturally diverse homeland. I argue that bicultural approaches are particularly well-suited to highlight these different perspectives on policy and practice and to shift conversation paradigms in a way that can accommodate Kayapo Peoples' and other Indigenous Peoples' strategies to retain a good or mejkumrej life.

AB  - This paper explores the extent to which global environmental justice can serve to serve to interpret negotiations over international transboundary waters. Trade-offs are considered in terms of their spatial and temporal features, while the biophysical traits of water are found to shape the cast and behaviour of actors and institutions suffering injustices, or ignoring or opposing justice claims. Applications of the frame to recent negotiations along the Nile and Jordan rivers show that inequitable outcomes can be entrenched by apparently fair processes. The negotiations procedures do not recognize the power asymmetry that exists between the actors, and thus fail on Rawls' precondition of equality for justice, suggesting that while distribution may be a necessary condition for justice, process alone is not necessarily so. The analysis also finds that focus on the international can obscure injustices at the sub-national level, and that environmental issues must be considered within the social justice context they derive from. One practical implication is that evaluations of negotiations over international transboundary waters should consider their outcome first, followed by investigation of the asymmetry in power that undermines the processes.

AB  - This paper applies a "justice" lens to the struggle of the people displaced by the Merowe Dam in northern Sudan. Application of distributive, procedural, and representational aspects of justice exposes the dissatisfaction of the affected people with the government's offer and execution of compensation. Consideration of social justice and the utility of norms in trans-national activism brings into sharp focus the difference in interests, and abilities of the many actors involved, and highlights the government's tactics to divide the communities, and the social divisions sown. As the struggle develops, justice claims are seen to change towards less material issues, suggesting that an expanded and dynamic conception of justice is more helpful than narrow or time-bound conceptions. The findings are of relevance to communities facing possible displacement from dams planned nearby, not least of all for the insight provided on the effectiveness of different tactics in the struggle.

AB  - This contribution looks at those Small Island Developing States that are doomed to disappear due to anthropogenic climate change. The citizens of these states will not only lose their physical homeland but also their social structure and cultural community. The focus here is on cultural loss. While its subjective importance is easy to grasp, it is harder to see cultural loss as a matter of justice. This paper first presents an account of why cultural loss is often seen as merely unfortunate but not unjust. Against these worries, the paper argues that we have a right that no one threatens our social bases of self-respect and that societal cultures are one important base of self-respect. The discussion concludes that anthropogenic climate change affects peoples' rights with regard to the cultural dimension and that therefore adaptation efforts ought to protect the social bases of self-respect of those climate refugees whose physical, political, and cultural existence is threatened by our inability to keep emissions below safe levels.

The essay aims to demonstrate one avenue for integrating Life Death within the greater landscape of new materialist rhetorical theory as well as within the rhetoric of science. To do so, it examines the genetic impacts of lead poisoning in marginalized communities to posit how rhetoric links together research in the life sciences and humanities to explain the relationship between genetic alterations and structural discrimination.

AB  - This essay is an impassioned epitaph conveying the teachings of Joti wise persons from the Venezuelan Amazon who passed away recently. It honors their wish to spread the philosophy of jkyo jkwaini, which holds that loving-caring for everyone and everything around us is an essential human trait that holds the key to sustaining all life. If this innate faculty is nurtured, it gives people the power to maintain or even enhance the living world; if suppressed, its absence will inevitably lead to the degeneration and demise of the world. Their essential message urges everyone to use the dynamism of love already present within us to reverse the dominant trend of exploiting nature selfishly. An environmental ethic of loving-caring can actually be found in disparate cultural traditions, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. (Re)establishing loving-caring as a central guiding principle for organizing human ecological dynamics is already taking place in different urban and rural settings globally. Vital connections between ancient eco-philosophies and contemporary ecosocial movements are highlighted in order to show that real possibilities exist for building ecotopias moving forward. These arguments are attuned to postulates for biocultural conservation endorsed by ethnobiologists, Indigenous rights advocates, and environmental activists. Case studies are mentioned to stress the common ground shared by a diverse assortment of stakeholders.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is an important component of urban resources which contributes to human physical and mental health. Studies on the accessibility of UGS under the two-step floating catchment (2SFCA) framework have recently received much attention. However, the effects of people's actual mobility patterns have not been fully considered in current studies. Proposed in this study is an improved accessibility model called AM-Ga2SFCA, which refines the traditional Gaussian 2SFCA method with the actual mobility information extrac-ted from mobile phone big data and online map. A new attractiveness index of UGS is implemented by combining the popularity evaluated by the PageRank algorithm and the actual utilisation based on buffer analysis. In addition, realistic travel time between each demand point and UGS is retrieved from the online map, which is further introduced into AM-Ga2SFCA as the travel cost. A case study is conducted in Shenzhen, China to validate the proposed model. Results show that the accessibility of UGS is strongly correlated with regional urbanization level, for example, higher accessibility generally occurred in the region with developed transportation and rich green resources. From the perspective of age groups and travel modes, we found that the environmental justice issue had already occurred in Shenzhen especially for the non-elderly: under the walk mode, nearly 80% of the non-elderly only shared 20% of UGS whilst approximately 80% of the elderly shared 30% of UGS. However, taxi or private vehicles can effectively alleviate the aforementioned phenomenon by reducing the Gini index to less than 0.5. The proposed model is expected to advance the understanding of UGS accessibility and facilitate effective planning to reduce environmental justice.

AB  - This paper evaluates the real effects of environmental justice reform on environmental governance at the firm level. Using the establishment of environmental courts in China as a quasi-natural experiment, our difference-in-differences estimation shows that: (1) environmental courts significantly enhance environmental investment by firms, and this relationship is robust to different specifications and alternative measures; (2) three possible channels are the improved levels of justice and enforcement of environmental protection, and the mitigation of local government intervention; (3) our findings are particularly pronounced in subsamples with severe local protectionism, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and non-SOEs with political connections; (4) at the city-level, environmental courts significantly increase air quality and promote cities to cross the inflection point of the environmental Kuznets curve earlier. Overall, this paper reveals the micro-mechanisms behind the real effects of environmental justice on firm environmental investment, thus providing timely implications for regulators concerned with environmental protection.

AB  - This study examines residents' housing decisions in a multihazard environment (flood, hurricane, and toxic chemicals). The combination of a hedonic price model and a household survey conducted in Harris County, Texas, indicates that flood hazard was an important factor in households' housing decisions, but not hurricane and toxic materials hazards. The results have further suggested that home buyers were poorly informed about hurricane and toxic materials hazards when housing decisions were made and came to understand their vulnerability only while living in hazard-prone neighborhoods. Moreover, it appears that low-income households and minorities were the least-informed group in the housing market. These findings provide implications for using hazard information programs to promote community resilience to natural hazards and community environmental justice.

AB  - Urban parks improve the quality of urban ecological environment and residents' physical and mental health. Existing studies have measured their spatial distribution in terms of accessibility or quality, however, this is not effective. Here, this study developed a spatial distribution assessment framework for urban parks, which included four dimensions: convenient degree (D-1), crowded degree (D-2), diversity of choices (D-3), and service quality (D-4). Taking Beijing as an example, we analyzed the difference in park distribution and found that park distribution is relatively equitable except for convenient degree. However, there are significant differences from the city center to the periphery. The inner-city area has better convenience, while the middle areas have more choices, and the outer ring performs better in terms of D-2 and D-4. There are significant gaps among communities with different housing prices. We found a gentrification trend within the Low, Middle-Low, and High price groups when analyzing the intra-group differences. This study can help urban planners and policymakers to better identify the gaps in park distribution and provide directions for optimizing the layout.

AB  - Urban public green space (UPGS) plays an important role in sustainable development. In China, the planning, classification, and management of green spaces are based on the Standard for Classification of Urban Green Space (SCUGS). However, limitations to the UPGS exist due to the over-emphasis on quantitative standards and insufficient consideration of the actual access mode of residents. Though the taxi trajectory data are widely selected to study public service facilities, its adoption in UPGSs research remains limited. Based on the case of UPGSs in the three districts of Shenzhen, we used the taxi (including cruise taxis and Didi cars, which are like Uber) trajectory data to investigate the spatial layout and the allocation of management resource of the UPGSs from the spatial interaction perspective. By rasterizing and visualizing the percentage of pick-up and drop-off points in the UPGSs' buffer, the service scope of UPGSs was defined, which reflected the spatial distribution and activity intensity of the visitors. Then, an unsupervised classification method was introduced to reclassify the twenty two municipal parks in the three districts. Compared to the traditional planning method, the results show that the service scope of the same type of UPGS in the traditional classification is not the same as the one obtained by the study. Visitors to all UPGSs are distributed as a quadratic function and decay as the distance increases. In addition, the attenuation rates of the same type of UPGSs are similar. The findings of this study are expected to assist planners in improving the spatial layout of UPGSs and optimizing the allocation of UPGS management resources based on new classifications.

AB  - This paper offers both theoretical and empirical analyses to explore energy justice from a policy perspective. We first propose a framework that explicitly connects core functions of clean energy policy instruments (i.e., regulation, financial incentive, government provision, information, and education program) to philosophical groundings of energy justicedistributive, procedural, and recognition justice. To empirically explore distributive energy justice, we examine the racial and socioeconomic disparities in three government-driven clean energy programs in the United States, including (1) the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) smart-grid investment grant (SGIG); (2) utility smart-meter roll out programs; and (3) city government adoption of green buildings. Results showed that the amount of ARRA funding awarded to utilities was closely related to racial composition. Inequalities were also found in utility smart-meter programs. Utilities operating in communities with a larger Hispanic population were less likely to initiate smart-meter roll out. The intensity of smart-meter technology implementation was positively correlated with education levels. Our third empirical case showed that government procurement policy can improve distributive equity for energy-efficient buildings. However, its spillover effects on the private sector can result in more adoptions in areas with fewer minorities and more highly-educated residents.

AB  - Trauma is considered a modern civilized sickness, and its occurrence substantially affects all of society, as well as individuals. The implementation of trauma emergency systems in cities with young, prosperous, and highly mobile populations is necessary and significant. A complete trauma emergency system includes both low-level trauma centers that offer basic emergency services and high-level trauma centers that offer comprehensive services. GIS and operational research methods were used to solve the location problem associated with these centers. This study analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of trauma demands and the candidate locations of trauma centers based on a spatial analysis and presented a hierarchical location-allocation model for low- and high-level trauma centers in Shenzhen. The response, coverage, treatment and cost capacities of the trauma center locations were considered, and an ant colony optimization was used to calculate the optimal solution. The objectives of this study were to optimize trauma center locations, improve the allocation of medical trauma resources and reduce the rate of deaths and disabilities due to trauma.

AB  - This research addresses recent environmental governance in Bolivia through its relations to indigeneity and respatializations. It introduces and develops the concept of "speaking like an indigenous state" to examine the Bolivian state's recent use of a pair of indigenous linguistic concepts, Living Well and Earth Mother, representing the identities of citizens and their rights to resources and livelihoods. State relations to indigenous social movements highlight the use of Living Well and Earth Mother concepts through accommodation, resistance, and protaganism. Six active issues of environmental governance are examined: (1) climate change and justice movement; (2) agrarian reform, agrobiodiversity, and food justice; (3) water resources; (4) indigenous territories; (5) Protected Areas; and (6) extractive industries (mining, hydrocarbons). The usages of Living Well and Earth Mother show versatility as they have been mobilized in the respatializing of the politics and social-power dynamics of environmental issues at scales of the state, global and international institutions, and community and local levels. Analysis also reveals deployment of Living Well and Earth Mother that is discursively influential and yet conceptually reduced and unevenly applied, thus suggesting a characteristic of verisimilitude. My analysis determines that respatialization at various levels, including territorial transitions of sub-national regional spaces, are associated with the heightened articulation of environmental governance through indigeneity and "speaking like an indigenous state" amid resource nationalism. Linkages and logics operating within this conjuncture differ from the prevailing interpretation of the Bolivian state's use of Living Well and Earth Mother as solely an unwitting contradiction or instrumentalist camouflage.

AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of the Kriging interpolation model and the Emission Weighted Proximity Model (EWPM) in assessing relative exposure risk of air pollution using results from the American Meteorological Society/EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD) as benchmarks. We used simulated exposure risk to SO2 in the Dallas area in Texas in this evaluation. Results suggest that the relative exposure risks to SO2 at different locations in the study area as estimated by EWMP are closer to estimated risks from AERMOD when compared with the results calculated by Kriging. In addition, study results also indicate that the relative exposure risks calculated by Kriging are similar to those from AERMOD when the density of emission sources in the area in question is high. It is therefore concluded that relative exposure risks determined by both the Kriging interpolation method and the EWPM are acceptable when it is not possible to use AERMOD. In situations when the density of emission sources is low in the study area, EWPM is a better choice than Kriging.

AB  - Tidal marshes are one of the world's most economically valuable habitats; yet, they have experienced large and persistent declines globally. Increased knowledge of the ecosystem services delivered by marshes has become a powerful tool to conserve and restore them. But hesitancies regarding valuations and their application in decision-making remain. Here we draw on the literature and collective experience of participants in the "Concepts and controversies in tidal Marsh ecology revisited" workshop, November 2 and 3, 2019, Mobile, AL, to provide a concise snapshot of the current field of salt marsh ecosystem service valuation, discuss the possible risks in salt marsh valuation, and the importance of stakeholder engagement to mitigate them. We provide examples of the application of valuation in conservation-related decision-making, illustrating the growing operationalization of ecosystem services in incentivizing salt marsh conservation and restoration. Ecosystem service quantification and valuation is already playing an important role in decision-making by coastal risk managers, insurers, engineers, and policy makers. While there are legitimate criticisms of valuation techniques and remaining uncertainties in ecosystem service delivery that arise both through natural variability across space and time and through differing and shifting cultural values, our perspective is that the rise of big data, the development of valuation techniques, a growing understanding and application of environmental justice practices, and increasing interdisciplinarity to tackle these complex issues are paving the way for valuation to play a critical role in decision-making around salt marshes.

AB  - Using data on the geographic location of fracking wells in four U.S. states with mandatory disclosure between 2011 and 2013 Colorado, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas this paper analyzes the socio-demographic characteristics of people living close to fracking activity. Geo-coded well data from the FracFocus registry are merged to blockgroup-level socio-demographic data from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey and population density and land use data from EPA's Smart Location Database 2010. Different buffer zones around fracking wells are applied to capture effects at different spatial scales and to compare only areas with similar geological properties. We explain the distance to the nearest well within a county with fracking activity or within a buffer zone by race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, various land-use control variables, and county fixed-effects. We find robust evidence that minorities, especially African Americans, disproportionately live near fracking wells, but less consistent evidence for environmental injustice by income or educational attainment. Strong heterogeneity across states can be observed, suggesting that an improvement in disclosure laws in other states, that would make similar analyses possible, is of great importance.

AB  - This paper analyzes how racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to industrial air toxics in U.S. cities vary with neighborhood income, and how these disparities vary regionally across the country. Exposure is estimated at the census block-group level using geographic microdata from the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We find that racial and ethnic disparities in pollution exposure are strongest among neighborhoods with median incomes below $25,000, while income-based disparities are stronger among neighborhoods with median incomes above that level. We also find considerable differences in the patterns of disparity across the ten EPA regions. In the two regions with the highest median exposure (the Midwest and South Central regions), for example, African-Americans and Hispanics face significantly higher exposures than whites, whereas in the region with the next highest exposure (the Mid-Atlantic), the reverse is true. We show that the latter result is attributable to intercity variations - minorities tend to live in the less polluted cities in the region - rather than to within-city variations.
