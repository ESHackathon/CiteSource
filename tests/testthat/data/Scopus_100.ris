AB  - The applicability of an in situ incubation method in monitoring the effects of metal mining on early life stages of fish was evaluated by investigating the impacts of a biomining technology utilizing mine on the mortality, growth, and yolk consumption of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) embryos. Newly fertilized eggs were incubated from autumn 2014 to spring 2015 in six streams under the influence of the mine located in North-Eastern Finland and in six reference streams. Although the impacted streams clearly had elevated concentrations of several metals and sulfate, the embryonic mortality of the two species did not differ between the impacted and the reference streams. Instead, particle accumulation to some cylinders had a significant impact on the embryonic mortality of both species. In clean cylinders, mortality was higher in streams with lower minimum pH. However, low pH levels were evident in both the reference and the mine-impacted groups. The embryonic growth of neither species was impacted by the mining activities, and the growth and yolk consumption of the embryos was mainly regulated by water temperature. Surprisingly, whitefish embryos incubated in streams with lower minimum pH had larger body size. In general, the applied in situ method is applicable in boreal streams for environmental assessment and monitoring, although in our study, we did not observe a specific mining impact differing from the effects of other environmental factors related to catchment characteristics.

T2  - Ambio
AB  - This paper examines the water quality legacies of historic and current iron mining in the Mesabi Range, the most productive iron range in the history of North America, producing more than 42% of the world's iron ore in the 1950s. Between 1893 and 2016, 3.5 x 10(9) t of iron ore were shipped from the Mesabi Range to steel plants throughout the world. We map historic sites and quantities of iron mining, ore processing, water use, and tailings deposition within subwatershed boundaries. We then map the locations of impaired lakes within HUC-12 subwatershed boundaries within the Mesabi Range, using government datasets created for US federal Clean Water Act reporting. Comparing watersheds with and without historic mining activity, watersheds with historic mining activity currently contain a greater percentage of impaired lakes than control watersheds within the same range. These results suggest that historic iron ore mining and processing in the Mesabi Range affected water quality on a landscape scale, and these legacies persist long after the mines have closed. This paper outlines a novel spatial approach that land managers and policy makers can apply to other landscapes to assess the effects of past mining activity on watershed health.

AB  - Adoption of microalgae-sourced products depends on the economic feasibility. In the case of fatty acids, it is crucial to obtain high lipid yield, especially in the form of storage lipids (TAGs). However, the production of these lipids often comes into competition with the microalgae biomass, resulting in a decrease in growth. A microalgae culture integration project was conducted in an industrial park in Canada in order to cultivate microalgae from park's wastewaters and then obtain products from the biomass. Different deficiencies and stresses were tested to evaluate what condition allowed the induction of the highest lipids accumulation without compromising the growth of microalgae. The results showed that the medium controlled to pH 7.0 allowed reaching the largest amount of extracted lipids (28+/-4.3%). Companies involved in this project could be able to make significant savings by the reduced wastewater treatment costs and by not adding expensive nutrients in culture.

T2  - Arch Environ Contam Toxicol
AB  - Iron is a common pollutant in waters near coal and hard rock mine disturbances. The current 1000 microg/L total recoverable chronic criterion for iron (Fe) for protection of aquatic life in the United States was developed using very limited data in 1976 and has not been revised since. To develop a more scientifically based criterion, several chronic laboratory toxicity experiments (> 30 days) were conducted with ferric Fe at circumneutral pH on a taxonomically diverse group of organisms including brown trout (Salmo trutta), mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), boreal toad tadpoles (Bufo boreas), the oligochaete worm Lumbriculus variegatus, the mayfly Hexagenia limbata, and the planarian Dugesia dorotocephala. Results of these tests and those of previously published toxicity data were used to derive a Final Chronic Value (FCV) of 499 microg/L by using the US Environmental Protection Agency's recommended methods based on single species toxicity tests. In addition to single species toxicity tests, ferric Fe toxicity experiments (10 days) were performed on mesocosms containing naturally colonized communities of benthic macroinvertebrates. Fourteen genera in the mesocosms occurred at sufficient densities to estimate an iron concentration resulting in 20% reduction in abundance (EC20). Three of these taxa had EC20s less than the FCV of 499 microg/L derived from single species tests: the mayfly Epeorus sp. (335 microg/L), the caddisfly Micrasema sp. (356 microg/L), and midge Tanytarsini (234 microg/L). When mesocosm results were included, the FCV was lowered to 251 microg/L. These findings support the suggestion that modernization of water quality criteria should include data generated from mesocosm experiments and other lines of evidence.

AU  - Clifford, M. J.

T2  - Ambio
AB  - In this empirically grounded perspective, we explore how, if managed correctly, mining might go beyond a straight conversion of finite natural capital to financial resources. We suggest a process where mineral extraction could act as a catalyst for more diversified growth and even serve as a basis to restore forms of 'natural capital' it had previously diminished. The case in point-small in scale but significant in consequence-is the particularly challenging instance of the small-island state of Nauru, which has a very negative history of socio-ecological impacts of phosphate mining. Yet, the degraded landscape requires capital investment which could be reaped from restoration of the land using revenues generated from exporting the waste rock pinnacles as branded household counter-tops and pavement stone products with an "island provenance premium". Furthermore, we use an industrial ecology method to show that Nauru's secondary phosphate can be shown to be less environmentally impactful than comparable phosphate from other sources. This has potential for further "green branding" of the Island's products. We contend that implementing such a restoration approach that harnesses the remaining mineral capital with care has the potential, to diversify the island's economy from one dependent on extractive industries and donors to agroforestry, fishing and tourism. A holistic approach is offered that considers prudent use of Nauru's remaining mineral resources towards an agenda of ecological restoration and economic diversification that will allow the island to prosper after the phosphates it has traditionally relied upon are depleted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A strong focus of the post-genomic era is mining of the non-coding regulatory genome in order to unravel the function of regulatory elements that coordinate gene expression (Nat 489:57-74, 2012; Nat 507:462-70, 2014; Nat 507:455-61, 2014; Nat 518:317-30, 2015). Whole-genome approaches based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) have provided insight into the genomic location of regulatory elements throughout different cell types, organs and organisms. These technologies are now widespread and commonly used in laboratories from various fields of research. This highlights the need for fast and user-friendly software tools dedicated to extracting cis-regulatory information contained in these regulatory regions; for instance transcription factor binding site (TFBS) composition. Ideally, such tools should not require prior programming knowledge to ensure they are accessible for all users. RESULTS: We present TrawlerWeb, a web-based version of the Trawler_standalone tool (Nat Methods 4:563-5, 2007; Nat Protoc 5:323-34, 2010), to allow for the identification of enriched motifs in DNA sequences obtained from next-generation sequencing experiments in order to predict their TFBS composition. TrawlerWeb is designed for online queries with standard options common to web-based motif discovery tools. In addition, TrawlerWeb provides three unique new features: 1) TrawlerWeb allows the input of BED files directly generated from NGS experiments, 2) it automatically generates an input-matched biologically relevant background, and 3) it displays resulting conservation scores for each instance of the motif found in the input sequences, which assists the researcher in prioritising the motifs to validate experimentally. Finally, to date, this web-based version of Trawler_standalone remains the fastest online de novo motif discovery tool compared to other popular web-based software, while generating predictions with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: TrawlerWeb provides users with a fast, simple and easy-to-use web interface for de novo motif discovery. This will assist in rapidly analysing NGS datasets that are now being routinely generated. TrawlerWeb is freely available and accessible at: http://trawler.erc.monash.edu.au .

AB  - Although many studies have reported mechanisms of resistance to metals in herbaceous species, there is very little information on metal coping strategy in hardwood species such as Quercus rubra. The main objective of this study was to determine the expression of genes associated with nickel resistance in red oak (Q. rubra) populations from metal contaminated and uncontaminated sites in the Northern Ontario. Six genes associated with nickel resistances in model and non-model plants were targeted. Differential expressions of these genes were observed in Q. rubra from all the sites, but association between metal contamination and gene expression was not established. This suggests that the bioavailable amounts of metals found in metal contaminated soils in mining sites in northern Ontario and likely in many mining regions around the world cannot trigger a genetic response in higher plant species.

AU  - Lin, Q.

AB  - Intermetallic compounds represent an extensive pool of candidates for energy related applications stemming from magnetic, electric, optic, caloric, and catalytic properties. The discovery of novel intermetallic compounds can enhance understanding of the chemical principles that govern structural stability and chemical bonding as well as finding new applications. Valence electron-poor polar intermetallics with valence electron concentrations (VECs) between 2.0 and 3.0 e(-)/atom show a plethora of unprecedented and fascinating structural motifs and bonding features. Therefore, establishing simple structure-bonding-property relationships is especially challenging for this compound class because commonly accepted valence electron counting rules are inappropriate. During our efforts to find quasicrystals and crystalline approximants by valence electron tuning near 2.0 e(-)/atom, we observed that compositions close to those of quasicrystals are exceptional sources for unprecedented valence electron-poor polar intermetallics, e.g., Ca4Au10In3 containing (Au10In3) wavy layers, Li14.7Mg36.8Cu21.5Ga66 adopting a type IV clathrate framework, and Sc4MgxCu15-xGa7.5 that is incommensurately modulated. In particular, exploratory syntheses of AAu3T (A = Ca, Sr, Ba and T = Ge, Sn) phases led to interesting bonding features for Au, such as columns, layers, and lonsdaleite-type tetrahedral frameworks. Overall, the breadth of Au-rich polar intermetallics originates, in part, from significant relativistics effect on the valence electrons of Au, effects which result in greater 6s/5d orbital mixing, a small effective metallic radius, and an enhanced Mulliken electronegativity, all leading to ultimate enhanced binding with nearly all metals including itself. Two other successful strategies to mine electron-poor polar intermetallics include lithiation and "cation-rich" phases. Along these lines, we have studied lithiated Zn-rich compounds in which structural complexity can be realized by small amounts of Li replacing Zn atoms in the parent binary compounds CaZn2, CaZn3, and CaZn5; their phase formation and bonding schemes can be rationalized by Fermi surface-Brillouin zone interactions between nearly free-electron states. "Cation-rich", electron-poor polar intermetallics have emerged using rare earth metals as the electropositive ("cationic") component together metal/metalloid clusters that mimic the backbones of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, which give evidence of extensive electronic delocalization and multicenter bonding. Thus, we can identify three distinct, valence electron-poor, polar intermetallic systems that have yielded unprecedented phases adopting novel structures containing complex clusters and intriguing bonding characteristics. In this Account, we summarize our recent specific progress in the developments of novel Au-rich BaAl4-type related structures, shown in the "gold-rich grid", lithiation-modulated Ca-Li-Zn phases stabilized by different bonding characteristics, and rare earth-rich polar intermetallics containing unprecedented hydrocarbon-like planar Co-Ge metal clusters and pronounced delocalized multicenter bonding. We will focus mainly on novel structural motifs, bonding analyses, and the role of valence electrons for phase stability.

T2  - Biotechnol Biofuels
AB  - Background: Acetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) is a complex hemicellulose found in softwoods such as Norway spruce (Picea abies). AcGGM has a large potential as a biorefinery feedstock and source of oligosaccharides for high-value industrial applications. Steam explosion is an effective method for extraction of carbohydrates from plant biomass. Increasing the reaction pH reduces the combined severity ( R 0 ' ) of treatment, affecting yields and properties of extracted oligosaccharides. In this study, steam explosion was used to extract oligosaccharides from Norway spruce wood chips soaked with sodium citrate and potassium phosphate buffers with pH of 4.0-7.0. Yields, monosaccharide composition of released oligosaccharides and biomass residue, their acetate content and composition of their lignin fraction were examined to determine the impact of steam explosion buffering on the extraction of softwood hemicellulose. Results: Reducing the severity of steam explosion resulted in lower yields, although the extracted oligosaccharides had a higher degree of polymerization. Higher buffering pH also resulted in a higher fraction of xylan in the extracted oligos. Oligosaccharides extracted in buffers of pH > 5.0 were deacetylated. Buffering leads to a removal of acetylations from both the extracted oligosaccharides and the hemicellulose in the residual biomass. Treatment of the residual biomass with a GH5 family mannanase from Aspergillus nidulans was not able to improve the AcGGM yields. No hydroxymethylfurfural formation, a decomposition product from hexoses, was observed in samples soaked with buffers at pH higher than 4.0. Conclusions: Buffering the steam explosion reactions proved to be an effective way to reduce the combined severity ( R 0 ' ) and produce a wide range of products from the same feedstock at the same physical conditions. The results highlight the impact of chemical autohydrolysis of hemicellulose by acetic acid released from the biomass in hydrothermal pretreatments. Lower combined severity results in products with a lower degree of acetylation of both the extracted oligosaccharides and residual biomass. Decrease in severity appears not to be the result of reduced acetate release, but rather a result of inhibited autohydrolysis by the released acetate. Based on the results presented, the optimal soaking pH for fine-tuning properties of extracted AcGGM is below 5.0.

AB  - The microbial ecology and activity of serpentine deposits and associated hydrated minerals are largely unknown. Previous research has largely focused on microbial communities in active serpentinizing systems, whereas relatively little research has demonstrated the ability of serpentine deposits to host microbial communities after the cessation of serpentinization. Given the potential role of serpentinization reactions fueling primitive microbial metabolisms on early Earth and the identification of serpentine deposits on Mars, knowledge of these geobiological relationships and potential for serpentine to host extant microbial communities and preserve biosignatures is increasingly important for planetary exploration seeking signs of life. The selection of habitable sites most likely to yield putative biosignatures is crucial to mission success. In this study, we aimed to characterize, on the basis of both metabolic activity and taxonomic composition, the microbial communities hosted in two naturally co-occurring and mineralogically distinct substrates within the serpentine-rich Jeffrey Mine pit-igneous quartzofeldspathic intrusives and serpentinite. Detection of heterotrophic activity in both lithologies at 24 degrees C, and in serpentinite at -5 degrees C, demonstrated that each substrate had the ability to host a viable microbial community, at Mars-relevant temperatures. Targeted amplicon sequencing subsequently showed the presence of bacterial, fungal, and photosynthetic microbial communities in both substrates. Here, we have demonstrated the presence of a viable lithic microbial community within two rock types in the Jeffrey Mine and provided evidence that lithologies associated with serpentine deposits and proximal hydrated minerals have the ability to support diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial colonization.

AB  - Relevance. The analysis of changes in chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils is the important stage of searches ofminerals, development of corresponding methodology, and methodology of ecological monitoring as well.
The aim of the research is to reveal the changes in chemical composition of peat and soil acid extracts in east part of the Vasyugan mire.
Methods: landscape-geochemical and statistical methods, methods of definition of chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils, imitating mathematical modelling.
Results and conclusions. According to approbation of peats and mineral soils in March 2017 and 2018 in east part of the Vasyugan mire (Western Siberia, the Ob river basin, the Russian Federation) the authors have analyzed: chemical composition of acid extracts from peats and soils using 1CP MS; composition of mineral inclusions in peat and soils using the method of scanning electronic microscopy and XRD-analysis. Concentration of 73 chemical elements was determined and three groups of elements were allocated: 1) with rather steady increase from a surface to bottom soils and/or a strongly pronounced maximum in bottom soils; 2) with well expressed maxima in the top and bottom parts of peat deposits; 3) with other types of distribution. The major factors of spatial changes in chemical composition of peat and soils are mainly natural biogeochetnical conditions, water exchange intensity, ratio of the atmospheric and ground water and mineral feed which determine the common availability of water and nutrients for bog vegetation, removal of toxic substances for this vegetation.

AB  - Arsenic (As) concentrations in lake sediments in the Yellowknife region, Northwest Territories, Canada, are elevated from the weathering of mineralized bedrock and/or from the aerial deposition of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) generated via the roasting of arsenical gold ores at the now-defunct Giant Mine and other historical roasting operations in the area. Sediment cores were collected from shallow-and deep-water sites in two lakes located downwind of Giant Mine to determine the origin of As in sediments and understand how As concentrations and solid-phase speciation vary with sediment depth and spatially with changes in water depth and sediment texture. Deep-water cores were dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods. Select sediment intervals were chosen for polished section preparation and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-based automated mineralogy, electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), and synchrotron-based microanalyses to characterize As-hosting solid phases. Sediment redox conditions and the post-depositional mobility of As at the shallow-water sites were assessed by sampling sediment porewaters using dialysis arrays (peepers). At the shallow-water sites, maximum sediment As concentrations occur at the sediment-water interface. In contrast, maximum As concentrations in the deep-water cores occur at sediment depths> 15 cm. Dating using Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods indicates that the As-rich horizons at both deep-water sites are coincident with the period of maximum emissions from the Giant Mine roaster. Four predominant As-hosting solid phases were identified: anthropogenic As2O3 from stack emissions, and authigenic realgar, As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxide, and As-bearing framboidal pyrite. The contribution of arsenopyrite to total sediment As concentrations was negligible, suggesting that elevated As concentrations are largely derived from ore roasting. In near-surface sediments at the shallow-water sites, the dominant host of As is Fe-oxyhydroxide. Congruent porewater profiles for As and Fe indicate that the post-depositional mobilization of As is governed by the reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxide. Deep-water sediments are enriched in As2O3 that has persisted for more than 60 years. The presence of authigenic As-bearing sulphides suggests that the partial dissolution of As2O3 leads to the formation of less bioaccessible phases where reduced sulphur (S) is available. The distributions of As-hosting solid phases at the shallow-and deep-water sites are interpreted to be both directly and indirectly influenced by water depth. Fine-grained As2O3 particles are less likely to persist in shallow-water areas and typically accumulate in deep-water zones as a result of sediment-focusing processes. Fine-grained organic matter also preferentially accumulates in deeper areas, which influences redox gradients in porewater, the stability field for As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxide, and the depth of authigenic As-bearing sulphide precipitation.

T2  - Canadian Metallurgical Quarterly
AB  - Model dual-phase steel microstructural variants having fine ferrite grain size and a range of martensite particle sizes and spatial distributions were produced by varying the starting microstructure prior to the intercritical annealing treatment. Superior tensile properties were obtained for the microstructural variant having the smallest (similar to 1 mu m) uniform ferrite grain structure and a corresponding uniform distribution of small (similar to 0.5 mu m) martensite particles. This microstructural variant also exhibited superior work hardening properties, as determined from a Crussard-Jaoul analysis and plots of instantaneous work hardening exponent vs. strain. The true work hardening rate had a positive dependence on (f/d)(1/2) at low strain (epsilon < 2%) for all three microstructural variants, consistent with the geometrically necessary dislocation mechanism. At higher strains, Stage III work hardening is operative and the dislocation annihilation factor exhibited a positive dependence on (f/d)(1/2).

AB  - Relevance. Modernization of infrastructure of the oil and gas complex of Western Siberia and development of the northern territories require the widespread use of local non-metallic raw materials, in areas that are almost directly adjacent to the main industrial sites in 1970-1980-s the colossal reserves of opal-cristobalite rocks diatomites and opoka, were explored. They have a near-surface occurrence and industrial practice of their use in dozens of industries. Deficiency of natural raw materials in industrial sector of the north of the Tyumen region amounts to 50-70 %. This creates an economic basis for development of deposits of opal-cristobalite rocks. The Syagoy site the largest in the near-Arctic zone Arka-Tabyakha deposit, due to its geological structure and confinement to the parallel-ridge relief, can be considered as a representative of other deposits of opal-cristobalite rocks in the north of Western Siberia.
The main aim is the study of lithology of clayey diatomite of Syagoy site and analysis of engineering-geological conditions of Syagoy site, with a view to assess the economic feasibility of developing the field.
The methods: field studies, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence analysis, differential thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, lithological and petrographic analysis.
The results. The Syagoy site has huge forecast resources and relatively high quality of raw materials, however, the main limiting factors for development of deposit are economic and geological factors. The geomorphological and geocryological conditions of the territory of the parallel-ridge relief along with the total ice content of 50-60 % will have a critical impact on the cost of technological operations related to field development, transportation, storage and processing of raw materials, making the development of such deposits unprofitable. Real prospects for development of opal-cristobalite rocks in the Far North of Western Siberia exist for deposits that combine proximity to potential consumers of raw materials and do not form cryogenic hillocks and ridges.

AB  - The present study valorized Finnish mining tailings waste to identify opportunities for the use of ceramics technologies. On the basis of their mineralogical and chemical contents, the five selected tailings wastes represented felsic mining tailings (FMT) rich in quartz and alkali feldspars, mining tailings dominated by Mg- and Fe-bearing minerals (MgFeMT), and mining tailings rich in carbonate minerals (CMT). Preliminary pilot studies indicated that the FMT materials are potential secondary raw materials for mull ite-type ceramics. An Al additive was needed, since the Al2O3 content of the studied tailings was too low for mullitization. In addition, carbonate-bearing tailings with Ca silicates can be applicable for chemically bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC) synthesis. Based on a literature review, FMT are viable source materials for the production of geopolymers, but a high initial Si:Al ratio (in quartz-rich FMT) may lead to partial geopolymerization. Preliminary results from the geopolymerization of pre-heated phlogopite mica mixed with metakaolin gave promising findings, with the formation of a geopolymer having good compressive strength. The findings support the viability of MgFeMT materials rich in phlogopite mica for the production of alkali-activated ceramics.

AB  - Molecular dynamics simulations using an embedded-atom method potential for pure iron (Fe) were performed to investigate the solid-state transformation of a body-centred-cubic phase from a polycrystalline face-centred-cubic matrix. A Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship accompanied with a step-ledge disconnection structure was detected in high mobility phase boundaries of a full 3D classical and barrier-free nucleation specimen. The results imply that interface coherency is an important factor for both nucleation and growth processes, which may significantly affect the transition rate of the austenite-ferrite transformation.

AB  - The Arctic is experiencing substantial increases in human activity in areas ranging from fossil fuel and mineral extraction to transport along Arctic waterways. Such actions may yield new sources of economic benefits and further objectives to promote national defense, yet they may also generate potential risks to the Arctic environment. As such, concerns from various stakeholders have been raised regarding how to make Arctic operations better meet sustainability goals and balance defense and economic objectives with environmental degradation. This article describes how decision analytical tools, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), may help identify policies and project proposals that minimize the potential for environmental degradation within a framework of maximizing economic, industrial, and defense objectives. Specifically, MCDA conducts value tradeoffs to assess the utility of various decision alternatives against disparate criteria; for this case, this includes the evaluation of Arctic operation sustainability. This article demonstrates through an example of industrial mining in Greenland how MCDA might serve as a tool to guide uncertain decisions for various Arctic projects, and potentially indicate opportunities to structure such projects to provide greater sustainability for their longer-term operations.

AB  - Centers of ore-mining technogenesis and their specific landscapes have been identified within the Karachai-Cherkess Republic and the Republic of Dagestan. Elements of the technogenic ore-mining landscape have been revealed to have a negative impact on the environment within the identified centers. It is shown that mining works are one of the main sources of ecological tension and potable fresh water pollution in highly hazardous copper-pyrite deposits. A range of mine engineering, geoecological, and social problems of the mining republics of the northern Caucasus are evaluated.

AB  - A large number of economically disadvantaged people live around protected areas. Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: 6-98) want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: 87-96) want to retain or own more livestock over the next 5-10 years. Understanding current and future resource use will help plan context-specific conservation efforts that are better aligned with reducing specific pressures around protected areas.

AB  - The Diavik Waste Rock Project, located in a region of continuous permafrost in northern Canada, includes complementary field and laboratory experiments with the purpose of investigating scale-up techniques for the assessment of the geochemical evolution of mine waste rock at a large scale. As part of the Diavik project, medium-scale field experiments ( similar to 1.5 m high active zone lysimeters) were conducted to assess the long term geochemical evolution and drainage of a low-sulfide waste rock under a relatively simple (i.e. constrained by the container) flow regime while exposed to atmospheric conditions. A conceptual model, including the most significant processes controlling the sulfide-mineral oxidation and weathering of the associated host minerals as observed in a laboratory humidity cell experiment, was developed as part of a previous modelling study. The current study investigated the efficacy of scaling the calibrated humidity cell model to simulate the geochemical evolution of the active zone lysimeter experiments. The humidity cell model was used to simulate the geochemical evolution of low-sulfide waste rock with S content of 0.053 wt.% and 0.035 wt.% (primarily pyrrhotite) in the active zone lysimeter experiments using the reactive transport code MIN3P. Water flow through the lysimeters was simulated using temporally variable infiltration estimated from precipitation measurements made within 200 m of the lysimeters. Flow parameters and physical properties determined during previous studies at Diavik were incorporated into the simulations to reproduce the flow regime. The geochemical evolution of the waste-rock system was simulated by adjustment of the sulfide-mineral content to reflect the values measured at the lysimeters. The temperature dependence of the geochemical system was considered using temperature measurements taken daily, adjacent to the lysimeters, to correct weathering rates according to the Arrhenius equation. The lysimeter simulations indicated that a model developed from simulations of laboratory humidity cell experiments, incorporating detailed representations of temporally variable temperature and water infiltration, can be scaled to provide a reasonable assessment of geochemical evolution of the medium-scale field experiments.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss and among reptiles has been attributed as a cause of species decline. The negative effect of habitat fragmentation has also been shown to be worse for species that are habitat specialists. The Dunes Sagebrush Lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus Degenhardt and Jones, 1972) is a species that specializes on the shinnery oak (Quercus havardii Rydb.) sand-dune landform of the Mescalero-Monahans Sandhills ecosystem in western Texas and eastern New Mexico, USA. This landform has been fragmented by roads and well pads used for the extraction of oil and gas resources. The effects of fragmentation on the home range and movements of this species can lead to the effective isolation of populations and increased risk of localized extirpations. We showed that home-range size was larger in an unfragmented area and that the mean distance of movements was greater. We also observed that roads in the fragmented areas restricted movements of S. arenicolus. We concluded that roads can be barriers to movements even though only narrow strips of habitat are altered.

AB  - It is difficult to obtain high-grade concentrates for layered minerals, such as graphite, by mineral processing due to the existence of impurities between interlayers. Conventional grinding mills are inefficient in liberating the mineral layers. Upgrading a graphite concentrate by re-grinding with a designed stirred mill is investigated in this paper. Better liberation of mineral layers was achieved, compared with a ball mill and a rod mill. Through re-grinding with the stirred mill followed by a two-stage cleaning flotation process, a low-grade graphite concentrate containing 84.59% fixed carbon could be refined to a high-quality concentrate containing 98.62% fixed carbon with a graphite recovery of 94.15%. It is demonstrated that the stirred mill is more suitable for selective grinding, mineral flake protection and upgrading of layered minerals.
