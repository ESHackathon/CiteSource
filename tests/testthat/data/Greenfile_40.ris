AB  - Potential seepage of naphthenic acids (NAs) from tailings ponds into surface water and groundwater is one of the main environmental concerns associated with the Canadian Athabasca oil sands mining operations. Here we report the application of 13C-labelled NA surrogate compounds to evaluate intrinsic biodegradation along groundwater flow-paths originating from oil sands tailings ponds at two different sites: a glacio-fluvial aquifer (Site 1) and a low-lying wetland (Site 2). Microcosms containing the carboxyl group labelled (99%) NA surrogates (cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, CHCA; 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, CHDCA; 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, ACA) were lowered into monitoring wells for several months to allow sufficient time for substrate degradation and formation of a biofilm in conditions characteristic of the local aquifer. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), biomarkers for the active microbial population, were extracted from the biofilms for stable carbon isotope (δ13C) analysis. At Site 1, highly 13C-enriched δ13C values (up to ~+7100‰) confirmed the in situ microbial breakdown of CHCA and CHDCA. At Site 2, δ13C-PLFA values from −60.6 to −24.5‰ indicated uptake of a 13C-depleted substrate such as biogenic methane and not 13C-labelled ACA. Determination of the microbial community using 16s RNA sequencing confirmed the presence of methane-oxidizing bacteria in the subsurface at Site 2. The in situ biodegradation of NAs at Site 1 demonstrates that the indigenous microbial population in the shallow subsurface near tailings ponds can readily break down some of these compounds prior to surface water discharge. The lack of evidence for microbial uptake of 13C-labelled ACA at Site 2 demonstrates that other NAs, in particular tricyclic diamondoid acids, may persist in the environment following seepage from tailings ponds or natural sources. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Highlights • In situ biodegradation of NAs in groundwater assessed using 13C-labelled surrogates • Highly 13C-enriched PLFAs at one site unambiguously confirm microbial uptake. • Direct real world proof of NA biodegradation as previously seen in lab experiments • No evidence for biodegradation of 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid at another site • Certain types of NAs (tricyclic diamondoid acids) may persist in the subsurface.

AB  - Various bone abnormalities, including osteoporosis, have been associated with chronic arsenic and cadmium exposure in experimental animal models, but information regarding the bone pathology of wild population of small mammals breeding in contaminated environment is limited. This present study was conducted to comparatively assess the prevalence and pattern of skeletal abnormalities in free ranging snowshoe hares inhabiting an area heavily contaminated by arsenic and other trace metals, near the vicinity of the abandoned Giant mine, and in a reference location approximately 20 km from the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. The femur and vertebrae of snowshoe hares from the mine area and reference location were subjected to bone densitometry examination and biomechanical testing using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 3-point bending test. t -test results indicated that femoral densitometry parameters such as bone mineral density (BMD) ( p = 0.5), bone mineral content (BMC) ( p = 0.675), bone area (BA) ( p = 0.978) and tissue area (TA) ( p = 0.549) were not significantly different between locations. All densitometry parameters of the vertebrae (BMD, BA and TA) differed between locations ( p < 0.05), except for BMC ( p = 0.951) which showed no significant difference between the two locations. Vertebrae from the mine area also showed relatively lower BA and TA compared to the reference location. A constellation of skeletal abnormalities were also observed along the axial and appendicular bones respectively. Specifically, growth defects, osteoporosis, cortical fractures, sclerosis, and cyst like changes were commonly observed in the femurs and vertebrae of hares from both locations. With respect to biomechanical properties, only bone stiffness and peak load tended to be relatively reduced in specimens from the mine area, whereas work to failure was notably increased in specimens from the reference site compared to those from the mine area. Taken together, the results of this preliminary study suggest that chronic concomitant exposure to arsenic and cadmium may be involved in the etiology of various bone abnormalities, including osteoporosis in wild population of snowshoe hares from the Yellowknife area. The result presented in this study represent the first evaluation of osteological effects in free-ranging furbearers (snowshoe hares) diagnosed with arsenicosis, and concomitantly exposed to environmental levels of cadmium.

T2  - Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (Taylor & Francis Ltd)
AB  - Air quality in the mining sector is a serious environmental concern and associated with many health issues. Air quality management in mining regions has been facing many challenges due to lack of understanding of atmospheric factors and physical removal mechanisms. A modeling approach called the mining air dispersion model (MADM) is developed to predict air pollutants concentration in the mining region while considering the deposition effect. The model takes into account the planet’s boundary conditions and assumes that the eddy diffusivity depends on the downwind distance. The developed MADM is applied to a mining site in Canada. The model provides values for the predicted concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, TSP, NO2, and six heavy metals (As, Pb, Hg, Cd, Zn, Cr) at various receptor locations. The model shows that neutral stability conditions are dominant for the study site. The maximum mixing height is achieved (1280 m) during the evening in summer, and the minimum mixing height (380 m) is attained during the evening in winter. The dust fall (PM coarse) deposition flux is maximum during February and March with a deposition velocity of 4.67 cm/sec. The results are evaluated with the monitoring field values, revealing a good agreement for the target air pollutants with R-squared ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 for PM2.5, from 0.71 to 0.82 for PM10, and from 0.71 to 0.89 for NO2. The analyses illustrate that the presented algorithm in this model can be used to assess air quality for the mining site in a systematic way. Comparisons of MADM and CALPUFF modeling values are made for four different pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, TSP, and NO2) under three different atmospheric stability classes (stable, neutral, and unstable). Further, MADM results are statistically tested against CALPUFF for the air pollutants and model performance is found satisfactory. Implications: The mathematical model (MADM) is developed by extending the Gaussian equation particularly when examining the settling process of important pollutants for the industrial region. Physical removal effects of air pollutants with field data have been considerred for the MADM development and for an extensive field case study. The model is well validated in the field of an open pit mine to assess the regional air quality. The MADA model helps to facilitate the management of the mining industry in doing estimation of emission rate around mining activities and predicting the resulted concentration of air pollutants together in one integrated approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Minamata Convention on Mercury provided a mandate for action against global mercury pollution. However, our knowledge of mercury exposures is limited because there are many regions and subpopulations with little or no data. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to increase worldwide understanding of human exposures to mercury by collecting, collating, and analyzing mercury concentrations in biomarker samples reported in the published scientific literature. METHOD: A systematic search of the peer-reviewed scientific literature was performed using three databases. A priori search strategy, eligibility criteria, and data extraction steps were used to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: We collected 424,858 mercury biomarker measurements from 335,991 individuals represented in 312 articles from 75 countries. General background populations with insignificant exposures have blood, hair, and urine mercury levels that generally fall under 5 lg=L, 2 lg=g, and 3 lg=L, respectively. We identified four populations of concern: a) Arctic populations who consume fish and marine mammals; b) tropical riverine communities (especially Amazonian) who consume fish and in some cases may be exposed to mining; c) coastal and/or small-island communities who substantially depend on seafood; and d) individuals who either work or reside among artisanal and small-scale gold mining sites. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that all populations worldwide are exposed to some amount of mercury and that there is great variability in exposures within and across countries and regions. There remain many geographic regions and subpopulations with limited data, thus hindering evidencebased decision making. This type of information is critical in helping understand exposures, particularly in light of certain stipulations in the Minamata Convention on Mercury. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - Natural resource (NR) exploitation often gives rise to conflict. While most actors intend to manage collectively used places and their NRs sustainably, they may disagree about what this entails. This article accordingly explores the origin of NR conflicts by analysing them in terms of competing pathways to sustainability. By comparing conflicts over mine establishments in three places in northern Sweden, we specifically explore the role of place-based perceptions and experiences. The results indicate that the investigated conflicts go far beyond the question of metals and mines. The differences between pathways supporting mine establishment and those opposing it refer to fundamental ideas about human–nature relationships and sustainable development (SD). The study suggests that place-related parameters affect local interpretations of SD and mobilisation in ways that explain why resistance and conflict exist in some places but not others. A broader understanding of a particular conflict and its specific place-based trajectory may help uncover complex underlying reasons. However, our comparative analysis also demonstrates that mining conflicts in different places share certain characteristics. Consequently, a site-specific focus ought to be combined with attempts to compare, or map, conflicts at a larger scale to improve our understanding of when and how conflicts evolve. By addressing the underlying causes and origins of contestation, this study generates knowledge needed to address NR management conflicts effectively and legitimately. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Isotopic signature of atmospheric phosphate in airborne tree pollen
AU  - Bigio, Laura
AU  - Angert, Alon
T2  - Atmospheric Environment
AB  - In non-desert areas primary biological aerosol particles, including pollen, are an important source of phosphorus (P). During the flowering season large quantities of pollen from wind pollinated trees, are observed in boreal and temperate lakes and forest, which contain high P concentrations. However, there are different estimations for the contribution of pollen to the atmospheric P cycle, and there is no accepted method for the identification of phosphate from pollen origin. In this study we measured the P concentrations in pollen from various locations. In addition, the oxygen stable isotopes ratio in phosphate (δ18O P) was measured for the first time for both the bioavailable pool (P extractable by anion-exchange resin), and for the HCl-extractable pool. The resin and HCl-extractable δ18O P values were on average (±SE) 25.6 ± 3.4‰, and 25.8 ± 2.9‰, which are distinctively higher than mineral dust δ18O P values (average 22.1 ± 0.7‰). Pollen unique isotopic signature in phosphate can be used as a tool to identify P in aerosols from pollen origin, and hence to better understand the atmospheric P cycle. The high P concentrations found in this study (average (±SE) resin-P and HCl-P values were 0.67 ± 0.10 and 0.75 ± 0.9 mg P g−1), confirm that pollen is important to the atmospheric P budget, and can help to solve the uncertainties regarding its role in the global P cycle. Highlights • Tree pollen P phosphate oxygen isotopes (δ18O P) was measured for the first time. • Pollen has high P contents, and it is a major source of P. • Pollen δ18O P values are unique and within a narrow range. • δ18O P can be used as a tool to identify airborne P originating from pollen.

TI  - Evaluation of surface water quality by using Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) method and discriminant analysis method: a case study Coruh River Basin
AU  - Bilgin, Ayla
T2  - Environmental Monitoring & Assessment
AB  - In this study, the water quality of the Coruh River Basin, which is located in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey, was evaluated. The water quality data measurement results obtained by the State Hydraulic Works 26th Regional Directorate from four different sites over a course of 4 years between the years 2011 and 2014 in the Coruh River Basin were used as the data. In this study, the water quality was evaluated by using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environmental Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) method and discriminant analysis (DA). The water quality of the Coruh River Basin was calculated as 30.4 and 71.35 by using the CCME WQI and classified as “poor,” “marginal,” and “fair”. These values show that the water of the Coruh River Basin is degraded and under threat and its overall quality is not close to natural or desired levels. The monitoring sites were divided into two groups by the cluster analysis (CA). DA is a multivariate analysis technique used to divide individuals or objects into different groups and assign them into predetermined groups. As a result of DA, calcium (Ca) and sulfate (SO4) were determined to be significant parameters in the determination of the water quality of the Coruh River Basin. The success of DA depends on the percentage of correct classification. As a result of the analysis, 23% of the parameters in the first measurement point, 69.2% of the parameters in the second and third measurement points, and 76.9% of the parameters in the fourth measurement point were classified correctly. Since the second measurement point is the discharge point of a copper mine, it can be said that the water quality parameters measured may provide accurate results in detecting pollution at this point.

T2  - Environment, Development & Sustainability
AB  - This paper examines patterns in recently published research addressing Indigenous capacity for collaborative natural resource development in Canada’s forestry, energy, and mining sectors. As Indigenous involvement in natural resource development increases, so too does the body of associated scholarship. We gathered information on several core metrics (year of publication, authorship, and gender, author affiliation, journal titles, citation counts and impacts factors, and keywords) to analyze research output, trends, and gaps. Our bibliometric analysis of 49 articles from peer-reviewed journals confirms that Indigenous natural resource development and capacity research has steadily increased over the past decade in terms of the number and range of papers, authors, institutions, and cases examined. Research output peaked in 2013 and 2015. Authorship is distributed evenly between male and female lead researchers, with teams located across southern Canada, with highest concentrations in urban population centers of British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. In contrast, the research sites are located in more northern, rural, and remote locations. That communities and projects under study are not currently matched with sites of research capacity raises questions about capacity building and the nature of research “on” versus “with” Indigenous peoples. Policies and programs designed to enhance Indigenous involvement and capacity must address these asymmetries in order to be representative, effective, and responsive to current Indigenous priorities.

T2  - Archives of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology
AB  - Iron is a common pollutant in waters near coal and hard rock mine disturbances. The current 1000 µg/L total recoverable chronic criterion for iron (Fe) for protection of aquatic life in the United States was developed using very limited data in 1976 and has not been revised since. To develop a more scientifically based criterion, several chronic laboratory toxicity experiments (> 30 days) were conducted with ferric Fe at circumneutral pH on a taxonomically diverse group of organisms including brown trout (<italic>Salmo trutta</italic>), mountain whitefish (<italic>Prosopium williamsoni</italic>), boreal toad tadpoles (<italic>Bufo boreas</italic>), the oligochaete worm <italic>Lumbriculus variegatus</italic>, the mayfly <italic>Hexagenia limbata</italic>, and the planarian <italic>Dugesia dorotocephala.</italic> Results of these tests and those of previously published toxicity data were used to derive a Final Chronic Value (FCV) of 499 µg/L by using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s recommended methods based on single species toxicity tests. In addition to single species toxicity tests, ferric Fe toxicity experiments (10 days) were performed on mesocosms containing naturally colonized communities of benthic macroinvertebrates. Fourteen genera in the mesocosms occurred at sufficient densities to estimate an iron concentration resulting in 20% reduction in abundance (EC20). Three of these taxa had EC20s less than the FCV of 499 µg/L derived from single species tests: the mayfly <italic>Epeorus</italic> sp. (335 µg/L), the caddisfly <italic>Micrasema</italic> sp. (356 µg/L), and midge Tanytarsini (234 µg/L). When mesocosm results were included, the FCV was lowered to 251 µg/L. These findings support the suggestion that modernization of water quality criteria should include data generated from mesocosm experiments and other lines of evidence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Economic activities such as logging and mineral extraction can result in the creation of new anthropogenic habitats that host specific biodiversity, including protected species. However, the legislation in many Western European countries requires the rehabilitation of “damaged” areas following logging and mining operations, which can eliminate these early successional habitats. Conservation managers face a dilemma in these situations, but often lack knowledge about the impacts of environmental rehabilitation on the population dynamics of pioneer species and so are unable to take this into account in their actions. We investigated the demography of a spatially structured population of an endangered amphibian (Bombina variegata) that uses waterbodies created by logging activities as breeding sites. Using capture–recapture (CR) data collected during a 9‐year study period, we examined how the destruction of breeding patches due to environmental rehabilitation affected adult survival and the long‐term population growth rate. For this purpose, we used recently developed capture–recapture multievent models to estimate survival and dispersal rates in the spatially structured population. We then used these estimates to simulate population trajectories and viability depending on differing frequency of breeding patch destruction. The multievent models revealed that dispersal not resulting from patch loss was relatively high and was sex biased. They also highlighted that patch destruction had a negative impact on adult survival. Moreover, simulations showed that the increase in patch destruction frequency had a strong negative influence on the population growth rate, even when the number of patches remained constant over time. This impact was intensified if female fecundity was also affected. Synthesis and applications. Our study quantifies for the first time the detrimental effect of habitat rehabilitation on the population dynamics of an endangered, pioneer species. Our results show that this deleterious impact of patch destruction could be reduced by certain management practices, such as avoiding the systematic rehabilitation of the breeding patches and compensating for patch destruction by creating substitute breeding patches.

Foreign Language Abstract: Problématique. Les activités économiques telles que l'exploitation forestière et l'extraction de minerai conduisent souvent à la création d'habitats pionniers hébergeant une biodiversité particulière, incluant des espèces protégées. Actuellement, la législation de nombreux pays européens oblige la réhabilitation des zones «dégradées» au terme des opérations forestières et minières, ce qui conduit à l’élimination d'habitats pionniers. Dans cette situation, les gestionnaires de milieux naturels se retrouvent face à un dilemme et manquent souvent de connaissances à propos de l'impact des réhabilitations sur la dynamique des populations des espèces pionnières. Objectifs de l’étude. Dans cet article, nous avons examiné la démographie d'une population spatialement structurée d'un amphibien en déclin, le sonneur à ventre jaune (Bombina variegata). Cette espèce utilise comme sites de reproduction des pièces d'eau créées par les engins de travaux lors d'exploitations forestières. A l'aide de données de capture‐recapture collectées durant une période de 9 ans, nous avons étudié l'effet de la destruction des patchs de reproduction (groupes d'ornières) causée par la réhabilitation des voies d'extraction de bois sur la survie des adultes et le taux d'accroissement démographique à long‐terme. Pour ce faire, nous avons utilisé de récents modèles de capture‐recapture afin d'estimer des taux de survie et de dispersion conditionnels à la destruction des patchs. Ces estimations ont ensuite été utilisées pour simuler des trajectoires démographiques et la viabilité à long‐terme de la population en fonction de différentes fréquences de destruction des patchs. Résultats. Les modèles de capture‐recapture ont révélé que la dispersion non‐obligatoire (c'est‐à‐dire ne résultant pas de la destruction d'un patch) est forte et sexe‐biaisée dans la population étudiée. Ils ont aussi montré que la destruction des patchs de reproduction a un impact négatif sur la survie des adultes. Par ailleurs, les simulations ont mis en évidence qu'une augmentation de la fréquence de destruction des patchs a un effet très délétère sur le taux d'accroissement démographique, même lorsque le nombre de patchs est maintenu constant dans le temps (c'est‐à‐dire sans perte nette d'habitat). Cet effet est aggravé lorsque la fécondité des femelles est aussi impactée. Synthèse et applications. Notre étude montre et quantifie pour la première fois les effets négatifs de la réhabilitation d'habitat chez une espèce protégée. Nos résultats suggèrent aussi que ces impacts peuvent être réduits au travers de certaines mesures de gestion, telles que l’évitement d'une réhabilitation systématique des patchs et une compensation des destructions par la création de nouveau patch.

AB  - Abstract: Understorey vegetation accounts for the majority of plant diversity in boreal forest ecosystems and contributes to ecosystem functioning. In restoration of degraded forested ecosystems, however, understorey vegetation is often restored passively, contrasting to clear strategies such as informed species choice and site improvement intervention for overstorey vegetation. The choice of overstorey‐centred restoration strategy may have important consequences for understorey vegetation. We examined the effects of substrate material, overstorey type and time since reclamation (age) on understorey vegetation following reclamation of oil sands mining in Alberta, Canada. We sampled cover, richness, evenness and composition of understorey vegetation at 94 sites of conifer, mixedwood and broadleaf overstorey types on three reclamation substrates (overburden, secondary overburden and tailings sand), with age ranging from 4 to 30 years. Total, woody and non‐woody understorey cover and species richness were the highest on secondary overburden and the lowest on tailings sand, and total cover also decreased with age. Woody cover and richness were the highest under broadleaf overstorey, while non‐woody cover and richness were the lowest under conifer overstorey. Overall species evenness was not significantly affected by substrate type, overstorey type or age, but woody evenness was the highest on secondary overburden and the lowest on tailings sand, and non‐woody evenness showed overstorey‐dependent responses to age. Species composition varied with substrate type, overstorey type and age. Indicator species analysis revealed that tailings sand with conifer overstorey favoured grasses, while overburden and secondary overburden supported a mix of grasses, forbs and shrubs. <italic>Synthesis and applications</italic>. Our study demonstrates that overstorey‐centred reclamation strategies impact the abundance, diversity and composition of understorey plant communities following oil sands mining. Landforms constructed with secondary overburden substrates and revegetated with mixedwood or broadleaf tree species provide the most favourable habitats for understorey vegetation, while tailings sand provide a poor substrate for understorey species diversity and composition. We therefore recommend utilizing secondary overburden and overburden substrate material during landform construction, and employing revegetation prescriptions that target mixedwood and broadleaf overstorey types to promote productive and diverse understorey plant communities on the reclaimed landscape.

T2  - Bulletin of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology
AB  - Although many studies have reported mechanisms of resistance to metals in herbaceous species, there is very little information on metal coping strategy in hardwood species such as Quercus rubra. The main objective of this study was to determine the expression of genes associated with nickel resistance in red oak (Q. rubra) populations from metal contaminated and uncontaminated sites in the Northern Ontario. Six genes associated with nickel resistances in model and non-model plants were targeted. Differential expressions of these genes were observed in Q. rubra from all the sites, but association between metal contamination and gene expression was not established. This suggests that the bioavailable amounts of metals found in metal contaminated soils in mining sites in northern Ontario and likely in many mining regions around the world cannot trigger a genetic response in higher plant species.

AB  - An economical and technical feasibility method was developed to determine the best implementation opportunities for a novel energy storage system (ESS). The ESS considered is a Zinc-Air flow battery in which energy storage may be scaled independently of the power output, and it can provide continuous power output of 5 kW during 8 h. Although the application field is vast, we have chosen three applicable scenarios where the new technology can be used: mining deployment, telecommunication tower, and a remote island. All three cases differ in load variability and load size, and we also considered three locations with their specific solar and wind resource. Three different power sources were also considered for this study: Diesel generator (DG), solar photovoltaic (PV), and wind turbine (WT). The best business opportunity for the new technology implementation was found to be in the mining industry. Power delivery from the ESS replaces the operation of DG during low demand periods in the case of variable load, as opposed to constant load, where the DG is permanently running. Fuel consumption reductions up to 75% can be achieved if the ESS is combined with renewable sources. However, the novel system alone represents approximate savings up to 33% in fuel consumption, when added to a conventional power generation system (diesel generator). Furthermore, the presented method aims to identify the main factors that affect the implementation feasibility of the ESS, and to provide a general approach that can be extended to different storage capabilities and fields of application.

AB  - Epidemiological studies indicate that living in proximity to coal mines is correlated with numerous diseases including cancer, and that exposure to PM 10 and PM 2.5 components could be associated with this phenomenon. However, the understanding of the mechanisms by which PM exerts its adverse effects is still incomplete and comes mainly from studies in occupationally exposed populations. The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate DNA damage in lymphocytes assessing the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN-cyt) parameters; (2) identify aneugenic or clastogenic effects in lymphocytes of exposed populations using CREST immunostaining for micronuclei; (3) evaluate multi-elemental composition of atmospheric particulate matter; and (4) verify relation between the DNA damage and PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels around the mining area. Analysis revealed a significant increase in micronuclei frequency in binucleated (MNBN) and mononucleated (MNMONO) cells of individuals with residential proximity to open-pit coal mines compared to residents from non-mining areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated a highly significant association between PM 2.5 levels, MNBN frequencies and CREST+ micronuclei induction in exposed residents. These results suggest that PM 2.5 fraction generated in coal mining activities may induce whole chromosome loss (aneuploidy) preferentially, although there are also chromosome breaks. Analysis of the chemical composition of PM 2.5 by PIXE demonstrated that Si, S, K and Cr concentrations varied significantly between coal mining and reference areas. Enrichment factor values (EF) showed that S, Cr and Cu were highly enriched in the coal mining areas. Compared to reference area, mining regions had also higher concentrations of extractable organic matter (EOM) related to nonpolar and polar compounds. Our results demonstrate that PM 2.5 fraction represents the most important health risk for residents living near open-pit mines, underscoring the need for incorporation of ambient air standards based on PM 2.5 measures in coal mining areas.

AU  - Falandysz, Jerzy
T2  - Journal of Environmental Science & Health, Part B -- Pesticides, Food Contaminants, & Agricultural Wastes
AB  - Leccinum scabrum is an edible mushroom common in European regions in the northern hemisphere. Macro and trace mineral constituents such as Ag, Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, P, Rb, Sr and Zn were studied in L. scabrum and in the top soil collected from the same location underneath soil substratum. The "pseudo-total " and labile (extractable fraction of minerals) were measured to get insight into the levels, distribution between the morphological parts of fruiting bodies, potential for their bioconcentration by mushroom and evaluated for human exposure via consumption of the mushroom. The sampling sites include the Darżlubska Wilderness, Trójmiejski Landscape Park, Sobieszewo Island, Wdzydze Landscape Park and outskirts of the Kętrzyn town in Mazury from the norther part of Poland. Median values of K, Rb and P concentrations in dehydrated L. scabrum were for caps in range 27,000-44,000 mg kg, 90-320 mg kg and 6,200-9,100 mg kg, and followed by Mg at 880-1,000 mg kg, Ca at 48-210 mg kg and Al at 15-120 mg kg. The median concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in caps were in range 15-27 mg kg db 38-140 mg kg, 5.3-27 mg kg and 130-270 mg kg. For Ba and Sr, concentrations on the average were at »1 mg kg, and almost equally distributed between the caps and stipes of the fruiting bodies. L. scabrum mushrooms were low in toxic Ag, Cd, Hg and Pb, for which the median values in dried caps from five locations were, respectively, in range 0.48-0.98 mg kg (cap to stipe index, Q, was 2.5-4.1), 1.0-5.8 mg kg (Q 2.9-3.8), 0.36-0.59 mg kg (Q 1.6-2.7) and 0.20-0.91 mg kg (Q 1.2-1.9). Substantial variations in the concentrations of the "pseudo-total " fraction (extracted by aqua regia) or labile fraction (extracted by 20% solution of nitric acid) of the elements determined in forest topsoils were noted between some of the locations examined. The elements K, P, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Na, Rb and Zn can be considered as those which were bioconcentrated by L. scabrum in fruiting bodies, while the rates of accumulation varied with the sampling location.

AB  - This study investigated the sorption behaviour of natural (N peat) and HCl-acid-modified peat (HCl peat) for contaminants in water collected at a mine site in northern Finland. Batch sorption experiments were conducted at room temperature and at 5 °C. Characterization of the sorbents by FTIR and XPS revealed no substantial change in the peat’s functional groups due to the acid treatment. Generally, the N peat was a more efficient sorbent for the mine water, although the HCl peat exhibited better nickel uptake capacity (21 mg Ni/g) than the N peat (16 mg Ni/g) from synthetic water. This is attributed to the lower equilibrium pH in samples treated with the HCl peat as well as the water’s different chemical composition. At room temperature, the N peat removed As(V) (80%) and Ni (85%) at low dosage (1-2 g/L), whereas the HCl peat presented good removal of As(V) (80%) at low dosage (1 g/L) but did not achieve satisfactory removal of Ni, even at a higher dosage (4 g/L). The performance of both sorbents was significantly affected by contact time. Ni removal by N peat increased substantially with contact time whereas removals achieved by HCl peat increased slightly up to 60 min, but decreased significantly at 24 h. Unlike with HCl peat, the N peat was less efficient in the experiments conducted at 5 °C. Overall, for both sorbents, As(V) and Ni were the most efficiently removed contaminants from the mine water. HCl peat had slightly better settling properties, however, both products settled poorly, thus rendering the studied mixing and settling system unsuitable for the proposed application. Nevertheless, both peat products, and especially the N peat, exhibited high contaminant removal potential and could represent a cost-effective and sustainable option for mine water treatment.

AB  - The total concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, and As in mining‐impacted soils and pioneer plants from a semi‐permanent natural wetland was determined by X‐ray fluorescence. Results showed that the maximum values in soil were Fe > Zn > Pb > Mn > As > Cu and in plants were Zn > Pb > As > Cu, and Mn and Fe were found in variable concentrations. Bouteloa repens showed the highest translocation factor (TF) for all heavy metals, and the highest phytoavailability index (PI) for Fe, Cu, As, and Mn. However, Typha dominguensis was the plant species with the most elevated bioconcentration factor (BCF) for Mn and Fe and PI for Pb and Zn, while Cyperus manimae showed the maximum BCF for As, Pb, and Cu, and the highest PI for Mn. For Eleocharis ovata the maximum BCF and PI were for Zn and As, respectively. The PI indicates the availability of heavy metals and As in the environment and their bioaccumulation in plants. The plant species reported in this study are pioneer plants that can easily become established due to their environmental resilience and physiologic characteristics. This study shows that B. repens and T. dominguensis are species that translocate heavy metals and accumulate them in their various organs, and therefore, these plants are suggested as good candidates for phytostabilization in similar semi‐permanent natural wetlands. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 980–988, 2018 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Estimating bioaccessibility of trace elements in particles suspended in the Athabasca River using sequential extraction

T2  - Environmental Pollution
AB  - Employing protocols developed for polar snow and ice, water samples were collected upstream, midstream and downstream of open pit bitumen mines and upgraders along the Lower Athabasca River (AR). The purpose was to: i) estimate the bioaccessibility of trace elements associated with particulate matter in the AR using sequential extraction, and ii) determine whether their forms have been measurably impacted by industrial activities. Of the trace metals known to be enriched in bitumen (V, Ni, Mo and Re), a substantial proportion of V (78–93%) and Ni (35–81%) was found in the residual fraction representing stable minerals. In contrast, Mo and Re were partitioned mainly into more reactive forms (water soluble, acid extractable, reducible and oxidisable). Comparing the non-residual fractions in upstream versus downstream sites, only water soluble Re was significantly ( P  = 0.005) greater downstream of industry. In respect to the potentially toxic chalcophile elements (Cu, Pb and Tl), no measurable change was observed in Cu and Pb distribution in upstream versus downstream sites. Only residual Tl was found at upstream and midstream sites, whereas a significant proportion of Tl was also present in the reducible fraction in downstream sites. Overall, a greater proportion of trace metals in the residual fraction at midstream sites appears to be due to inputs of atmospheric dust, clearly evident in microscopic images: energy dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analyses showed that these particles were predominantly silicates, which are assumed to have limited bioaccessibility.

AB  - With 30 threatened species (14 categorized as Critically Endangered and 16 as Endangered, sensu IUCN), Coccothrinax (c. 54 species) is the flagship palm genus for conservation in the Caribbean Island Biodiversity Hotspot. Coccothrinax has its centre of taxonomic diversity in these islands, with c. 51 endemic species. We present a conservation framework for the 14 Critically Endangered species, found in Cuba, Haiti or the Dominican Republic. Only two species (C. jimenezii, C. montana) occur in more than one country (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Immediate threats include oil drilling and nickel mining, intrusion of saline water into soil, urban and agricultural development, low population recruitment, uncontrolled fires, interspecific hybridization, and unsustainable ethnobotanical practices. Coccothrinax bermudezii, C. borhidiana, C. crinita ssp. crinita, C. leonis and C. spissa are not conserved in protected areas. Coccothrinax bermudezii, C. jimenezii, C. leonis and C. nipensis are not part of ex situ collections. Based on results from a conservation project targeting C. jimenezii, we recommend international cooperation between the three range states to implement integrative conservation management plans, plant exploration initiatives, taxonomic revisions, outreach, and fundraising. The ultimate aim of this review is to provide baseline information that will develop conservation synergy among relevant parties working on Coccothrinax conservation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Such collaborations could also benefit through partnerships with botanists working in other countries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Oil sands mining activities in northern Alberta, Canada emit large amounts of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) oxides to the atmosphere, increasing N and S deposition. We studied the long-term (2006–2016) effect of elevated concentrations of simulated N and S deposition on soil properties and understory species composition in a mixedwood boreal forest in a two (0 and 30 kg N ha −1 year −1 , as ammonium nitrate) × two (0 and 30 kg S ha −1 year −1 , as sodium sulfate) factorial experiment. Soil (forest floor and 0–15 cm mineral soil) and understory vegetation samples were collected and the cover of understory vegetation was determined in August 2016. Eleven years of N deposition increased (p = .045) total N concentration and decreased (p < .10 unless otherwise indicated) carbon to N ratio by 11 and 7%, respectively, in the forest floor. Sulfur deposition decreased (p = .045) exchangeable calcium concentration by 36% in the mineral soil. Species evenness (by 7%) and the overall diversity (by 7%) were decreased and community composition was changed (p = .008) in the herb stratum by N but not by S deposition, due to species-specific responses to N deposition. However, elevated concentrations of N and S deposition did not change species diversity and composition in the shrub stratum. Decreased foliar phosphorus and potassium concentrations and increased N to phosphorus ratio in some species indicate a potential risk of nutrient imbalance by N deposition. Reducing N emission to minimize its negative effect on boreal forest ecosystems should be a priority in emissions management in the oil sands. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - To assess radium ( 226 Ra) as a potential indicator of impact in well waters, we investigated its behavior under natural conditions using a case study approach. 226 Ra geochemistry was investigated in 67 private wells of southeastern New Brunswick, Canada, a region targeted for potential shale gas exploitation. Objectives were to i) establish 226 Ra baseline in groundwater; ii) characterize 226 Ra spatial distribution and temporal variability; iii) characterize 226 Ra partitioning between dissolved phase and particulate forms in well waters; and iv) understand the mechanisms controlling 226 Ra mobility under natural environmental settings. 226 Ra levels were generally low (median = 0.061 pg L −1 , or 2.2 mBq L −1 ), stable over time, and randomly distributed. A principal component analysis revealed that concentrations of 226 Ra were controlled by key water geochemistry factors: the highest levels were observed in waters with high hardness, and/or high concentrations of individual alkaline earth elements (i.e. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), high concentrations of Mn and Fe, and low pH. As for partitioning, 226 Ra was essentially observed in the dissolved phase (106 ± 19%) suggesting that the geochemical conditions of groundwater in the studied regions are prone to limit 226 Ra sorption, enhancing its mobility. Overall, this study provided comprehensive knowledge on 226 Ra background distribution at local and regional scales. Moreover, it provided a framework to establish 226 Ra baselines and determine which geochemical conditions to monitor in well waters in order to use this radionuclide as an indicator of environmental impact caused by anthropogenic activities (e.g. unconventional shale gas exploitation, uranium mining, or nuclear generating power plants).

TI  - Adult dragonflies are indicators of environmental metallic elements
AU  - Lesch, Velesia

AB  - Adult dragonflies (Insecta; Odonata) are aerial predatory arthropods that occur globally except in the polar regions. However, we know of no research on adult dragonflies as potential indicators of metallic elements in the environment or metallic element concentrations and relative contribution patterns between sites, species, size classes, habitat types, and relation to possible pollution sources. There is also no information available about adult dragonflies and their responses to toxic metals. However, metallic elements are toxic in elevated concentrations to all organisms. We predict that adult dragonflies would be suitable indicators of elemental concentrations. We analysed 105 adult male dragonflies from 21 sites in South Africa for 33 metallic elements including Hg, As, Pb, Cr, Cu, Cd, Ni, Se, Al, and Au. The results indicated that all species of dragonflies, regardless of body size, are suitable indicators. Furthermore, different aquatic habitat types did not affect the metallic element concentrations at the scale of this study. Dragonflies collected near wastewater treatment plants showed concentrations of certain elements such as Au higher than from elsewhere. Elements such as As and Pb were found at elevated concentrations (relative to the other sites) in dragonflies collected near mines. Dragonflies from sampling sites near potential pollution sources, but had seemingly isolated water sources, showed lower metallic element concentrations when compared with other sites. We conclude that adult dragonflies would be good indicators of environmental metallic elements. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - An important problem in soil magnetometry is unraveling the soil contamination signal in areas with multiple emitters. Here, geophysical and geochemical measurements were performed at four sites on a north - south transect along the Pasvik River in the Barents Region (northern Norway). These sites are influenced by depositions from the Bjørnevatn iron mine and a Ni-Cu smelter in Nikel, Russia. To relate the degree and type of pollution from these sources to the corresponding magnetic signal, the topsoil concentrations of 12 Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Ti, Zn), were determined, magnetic hysteresis parameters and thermomagnetic properties were measured. In situ magnetic low-field susceptibility decreases from north to south with increasing distance from the iron mine. Relatively large magnetic multidomain grains of magnetite and/or titanomagnetite are responsible for the strong magnetic signal from the topsoil close to Bjørnevatn. These particles are related to increased enrichment factors of As, Mo and Cu, yielding high positive correlation coefficients with susceptibility values. At a site furthest away from the iron mine and located 7 km from the Ni-Cu smelter magnetic susceptibility values are much lower but significant positive correlations on the level of p < .1 with 8 PTEs (Ni, Cu, Co, Se, As, Zn, Cd, Cr) have been observed. The magnetic signal in this area is due to fine-grained primary sulphides and secondary fine-grained magnetite and/or maghemite. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Bitumen extraction via surface mining has affected nearly 1000 km 2 of boreal forest habitat in the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, pushing entire ecosystems back to the primary stages of forest and soil succession. Previous work in the Athabasca oil sands region has investigated the influence of vegetation, mineral reclamation material, and peat cover soil on microbial communities and the quality of soil carbon. No research has been conducted to assess the bioindicator potential of soil fauna, specifically oribatid mites, in these reclaimed soils. This study investigated the influence of time-since-reclamation (8–31 yrs.) and canopy type (white spruce ( Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), trembling aspen ( Populus tremuloides , Michx)) on the abundance and diversity of oribatid mite adults ≥300 μm in size after land reclamation in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region. Thickness of the forest floor accumulating on top of the peat cover soil at the reclaimed sites was the most powerful predictor of oribatid mite richness, and was a better predictor than time-since-reclamation. A forest floor with a thickness ≥2 cm strongly increased oribatid mite abundance to levels higher than those found in the forest floors of natural, undisturbed stands in the area. Species richness in the (≥2 cm thick) forest floor within reclaimed stands was slightly lower than within natural stands but was notably higher than in the peat cover soil. Assemblage diversity followed the same trend as species richness, and mite diversity in the forest floor with a thickness ≥2 cm in reclaimed stands was the most similar to natural stands. Four of the six reclaimed stands with a forest floor thickness ≥2 cm were aspen stands, and increased aspen density may aid in faster reestablishment of oribatid mite communities after oil sands mining.

T2  - Compost Science & Utilization
AB  - Feedlots in southern Alberta apply composted (CM) or stockpiled (SM) manure with straw (ST) or wood-chip (WD) bedding to cropland, but few studies have examined the effect of manure type and bedding material on carbon composition of these feedlot amendments prior to land application using solid-state 13C NMR-DPMAS (nuclear magnetic resonance-direct polarization, magic angle spinning). The particulate organic matter fraction was extracted from four amendment treatments (CM-ST, CM-WD, SM-ST, SM-WD) to avoid possible paramagnetic interference from considerable mineral soil in the manure from the unpaved feedlot. The hypothesis was that O-alkyl C of POM should be lower for more decomposed manure types (CM than SM) and bedding materials (ST than WD), and that alkyl C, aromatic C, carboxyl C, aromaticity, and alkyl:O-alkyl (A:O-A) ratio should be greater for the more decomposed amendments. The C composition of all feedlot amendments was dominated by aromatic C (8%-14%) and O-alkyl (7%-14%) C and had considerable less contribution from carboxyl (2%-4%) and alkyl C (1%-3%). The manure type hypothesis was supported for O-alkyl C (but not for the other three C groups), aromaticity, but not the A:O-A ratio. The bedding hypothesis was supported for O-alkyl C, aromaticity, and A:O-A ratio, but not for alkyl C, aromatic C, and carboxyl C. A decrease in O-alkyl C, increase in aromaticity, and increase in A:O-A ratio (bedding only) with more decomposed manure types or bedding materials suggested that these 13C NMR parameters may have potential to evaluate the maturity and stability of composted feedlot manures.

AB  - Several recent studies have reported evidence that surface mining operations of bitumen in northern Alberta's oil sands (OS) region contribute significantly to the atmospheric deposition of metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) within the vicinity of OS development. The present study examines the accumulation of PACs in boreal wetlands at varying distance from OS industrial activities with the use of semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles. SPMDs were deployed in shallow lentic waterbodies adjacent to wood frog egg masses and were retrieved, along with tadpoles, approximately 35–45 days later. The highest concentrations of PACs were detected in SPMDs deployed within a 25 km radius of surface mining activity, consistent with snow deposition studies of PACs in the region. In wetlands located within the vicinity of surface mining activity, PAC profiles of SPMDs and wood frog tadpoles were dominated by C1-C4 alkylated PACs, including alkylated dibenzothiophenes, which are strongly indicative of petrogenic sources. Contrary to differences seen in the SPMD PAC concentrations, there were no obvious differences in the ∑PACs in wood frog tissue between wetland study sites, although alkylated fluorenes were found to be higher in tadpoles collected from a wetland located within 10 km of two bitumen upgrading facilities. The use of SPMDs in tandem with wood frog tadpoles can help assess the potential exposure of aquatic organisms to PACs in boreal wetlands. Highlights • PACs were detected in SPMDs and wood frog tissues collected from boreal wetlands. • Alkyl PACs dominate PAC profiles in both matrices sampled in oil sands mining area. • PAC concentrations varied spatially in SPMDs and were highest near oil sands mines. • ∑PACs did not vary spatially in tissues, but some individual alkyl PACs did vary. • Together, SPMDs and tadpoles are useful tools to monitor PAC deposition in wetlands.

AB  - Speciated mercury gridded emissions inventories together with chemical transport models and concentration measurements are essential when investigating both the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the mercury cycle in the environment. Since different mercury species have contrasting behaviour in the atmosphere, their proportion in anthropogenic emissions could determine the spatial impacts. In this study, the time series from 1970 to 2012 of the EDGARv4.tox2 global mercury emissions inventory are described; the total global mercury emission in 2010 is 1772 tonnes. Global grid-maps with geospatial distribution of mercury emissions at a 0.1° × 0.1° resolution are provided for each year. Compared to the previous tox1 version, tox2 provides updates for more recent years and improved emissions in particular for agricultural waste burning, power generation and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors. We have also developed three retrospective emissions scenarios based on different hypotheses related to the proportion of mercury species in the total mercury emissions for each activity sector; improvements in emissions speciation are seen when using information primarily from field measurements. We evaluated them using the GEOS-Chem 3-D mercury model in order to explore the influence of speciation shifts, to reactive mercury forms in particular, on regional wet deposition patterns. The reference scenario S1 (EDGARv4.tox2_S1) uses speciation factors from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP); scenario S2 (“EPA_power”) uses factors from EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR); and scenario S3 (“Asia_filedM”) factors from recent scientific publications. In the reference scenario, the sum of reactive mercury emissions (Hg-P and Hg 2+ ) accounted for 25.3% of the total global emissions; the regions/countries that have shares of reactive mercury emissions higher than 6% in total global reactive mercury are China+ (30.9%), India+ (12.5%) and the United States (9.9%). In 2010, the variations of reactive mercury emissions amongst the different scenarios are in the range of −19.3 t/yr (China+) to 4.4 t/yr (OECD_Europe). However, at the sector level, the variation could be different, e.g., for the iron and steel industry in China reaches 15.4 t/yr. Model evaluation at the global level shows a variation of approximately ±10% in wet deposition for the three emissions scenarios. An evaluation of the impact of mercury speciation within nested grid sensitivity simulations is performed for the United States and modelled wet deposition fluxes are compared with measurements. These studies show that using the S2 and S3 emissions of reactive mercury, can improve wet deposition estimates near sources. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Integrated surface water and groundwater models are well suited for evaluating the long-term performance of oil sands mine closure landscapes to optimize reclamation designs that satisfy performance criteria. However, the scale of the problem makes it difficult to evaluate a large number of design alternatives using numerical models, while at the same time satisfying numerical criteria, such as the courant and peclet numbers. The problem becomes particularly challenging in the design of permeable sand tailings hummocks overlying relatively impermeable composite tailings, where vertical advective flushing of process-affected water through the tailings hummocks is coupled to lateral transport of diffusive release from the underlying composite tailings. We developed an analytical solution that rapidly estimates long-term mass loadings from the sand tailings without the challenges typically associated with numerical modelling. Advection and dispersion in the flushing zones, progressive diffusion into underlying low permeability layers, and purely diffusive release are all considered. A comparison of the analytical solutions to numerical simulations for a series of simple hypothetical cases demonstrated that the analytical solutions provide a reasonable simulation of the mass loadings from the reclaimed landscapes over the design life. Although the approach needs to be further verified and validated for more realistic complex mine reclamation conditions, the analytical framework provides a foundation for hydrologic analysis in mine reclamation and closure in the northern boreal environment.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - Sulfate removal from mine or process water is a key issue in the mining industry. In this paper, precipitation with lime (calcium oxide) was integrated with electrocoagulation for sulfate removal from Pyhäsalmi/Finland mine water. Sulfate precipitation with calcium oxide decreased the sulfate concentration from 13,000 mg/L to 1600 mg/L. Various current densities were applied to the pre-treated mine water with various electrodes and aluminium and iron anodes. It was found that 25 mA/cm2 was the best tested current density for both anode types. At the second stage, this current density was used for different iron and aluminium anodes in various monopolar and bipolar configurations. It was found that this hybridisation is effective for sulfate removal, and that a bipolar configuration showed better results than the monopolar configuration. The best result was gained from 25 mA/cm2 with a two aluminium and two stainless steel anode–cathode configuration and calcium oxide pre-treatment to reach pH 12. The removal efficiency reached 84.4% and 63.8% with aluminium anodes in bipolar and monopolar configurations, respectively. This setup was able to decrease sulfate concentrations from 13,000 mg/L to 250 mg/L, which meets mine water discharge limits. Kinetic studies showed that iron and aluminium anodes obey pseudo-second order kinetic. Finally, the energy consumption was calculated. Highlights • Enhancing electrocoagulation efficiency with hybridisation with precipitation, and various electrocoagulation configurations. • High removal efficiency of sulfate with this method. • Decreasing sulfate concentration from 13000 mg/L to 250 mg/L, which meets all existing regulations. • Study of various electrocoagulation configuration (bipolar and monopolar) on sulfate removal. • Study of various anodes material for sulfate removal.

AB  - The former lead-zinc mine at Mestersvig, Greenland, continues to contaminate the surrounding environment despite its operations ceasing over 50 years ago. Elevated concentrations of heavy metals are found in water, sediment and biota in the terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. To shed light on the present contamination and its potential effects on local fish we investigated gill and liver histology of sculpins ( Myoxocephalus spp.) around the former mining area. Two species of sculpins were caught; shorthorn sculpins ( M. scorpius ; n = 16) and fourhorn sculpins ( M. quadricornis ; n = 17) at a contaminated site, Nyhavn, and shorthorn sculpins ( M. scorpius ; n = 25) at the reference site. In a previous study we found histopathological changes in the tissues of the sculpins, and we suspected this to be related to elevated heavy metal tissue concentrations. Concentrations of Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, Se and Zn were significantly higher in sculpins at Nyhavn compared to the reference site. Reference NOED and LOEC thresholds for biochemistry, tissue lesions, growth, survival and reproduction for hepatic Hg, As, Cd and Pb from the ERED database were exceeded in both sculpin species. Histopathological investigations of the sculpins gills revealed significant increases in the prevalence of hyperplastic epithelium, inflammation, intensity of neutral and total mucus cells and chloride cells along with an increased infection of colonial Peritricha. At the contaminated Nyhavn site, fourhorn sculpins had a significantly higher prevalence of chondroplastic tissue and intensity of neutral, mixed and total mucus cells in the gills compared to the shorthorn sculpins. The data indicate that both sculpin species could be useful indicator species for environmental monitoring of metal pollution in Arctic areas. However, confounding effects of gender and species should be investigated further. Effects on other biomarkers as well as baseline measurements should be included in future environmental monitoring efforts around mining activities in Greenland. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We review recent progress in our understanding of the global cycling of mercury (Hg), including best estimates of Hg concentrations and pool sizes in major environmental compartments and exchange processes within and between these reservoirs. Recent advances include the availability of new global datasets covering areas of the world where environmental Hg data were previously lacking; integration of these data into global and regional models is continually improving estimates of global Hg cycling. New analytical techniques, such as Hg stable isotope characterization, provide novel constraints of sources and transformation processes. The major global Hg reservoirs that are, and continue to be, affected by anthropogenic activities include the atmosphere (4.4–5.3 Gt), terrestrial environments (particularly soils: 250–1000 Gg), and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., oceans: 270–450 Gg). Declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions between 1990 and 2010 have led to declines in atmospheric Hg0 concentrations and HgII wet deposition in Europe and the US (− 1.5 to − 2.2% per year). Smaller atmospheric Hg0 declines (− 0.2% per year) have been reported in high northern latitudes, but not in the southern hemisphere, while increasing atmospheric Hg loads are still reported in East Asia. New observations and updated models now suggest high concentrations of oxidized HgII in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere where deep convection can scavenge these HgII reservoirs. As a result, up to 50% of total global wet HgII deposition has been predicted to occur to tropical oceans. Ocean Hg0 evasion is a large source of present-day atmospheric Hg (approximately 2900 Mg/year; range 1900–4200 Mg/year). Enhanced seawater Hg0 levels suggest enhanced Hg0 ocean evasion in the intertropical convergence zone, which may be linked to high HgII deposition. Estimates of gaseous Hg0 emissions to the atmosphere over land, long considered a critical Hg source, have been revised downward, and most terrestrial environments now are considered net sinks of atmospheric Hg due to substantial Hg uptake by plants. Litterfall deposition by plants is now estimated at 1020–1230 Mg/year globally. Stable isotope analysis and direct flux measurements provide evidence that in many ecosystems Hg0 deposition via plant inputs dominates, accounting for 57–94% of Hg in soils. Of global aquatic Hg releases, around 50% are estimated to occur in China and India, where Hg drains into the West Pacific and North Indian Oceans. A first inventory of global freshwater Hg suggests that inland freshwater Hg releases may be dominated by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM; approximately 880 Mg/year), industrial and wastewater releases (220 Mg/year), and terrestrial mobilization (170–300 Mg/year). For pelagic ocean regions, the dominant source of Hg is atmospheric deposition; an exception is the Arctic Ocean, where riverine and coastal erosion is likely the dominant source. Ocean water Hg concentrations in the North Atlantic appear to have declined during the last several decades but have increased since the mid-1980s in the Pacific due to enhanced atmospheric deposition from the Asian continent. Finally, we provide examples of ongoing and anticipated changes in Hg cycling due to emission, climate, and land use changes. It is anticipated that future emissions changes will be strongly dependent on ASGM, as well as energy use scenarios and technology requirements implemented under the Minamata Convention. We predict that land use and climate change impacts on Hg cycling will be large and inherently linked to changes in ecosystem function and global atmospheric and ocean circulations. Our ability to predict multiple and simultaneous changes in future Hg global cycling and human exposure is rapidly developing but requires further enhancement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Repparfjorden in northern Norway has been partly designated for submarine mine tailings disposal when the adjacent Cu mine re-opens in 2019. In order to increase sedimentation, the flocculant, Magnafloc10 is planned to be added to the mine tailings prior to discharge into the fjord. This study investigated the feasibility of reducing the Cu concentrations (375 mg/kg) in the mine tailings by applying electrodialytic extraction, including potential optimisation by adding Magnafloc10. In the acidic electrodialytic treatment (pH < 2), Magnafloc10 increased the extraction of Cu from the mine tailings particles from 76 to 86%, and the flocs with adsorbed metals were separated from the tailings solids by the electric field (1 mA/cm 2 ). The electric energy consumption increased with the use of Magnafloc10 (from 17 to 30 kWh/g Cu extracted), due to lower conductivity in the liquid phase and clogging of the membrane by the flocs. In the alkaline electrodialytic treatment (pH > 12), Magnafloc10 reduced the extraction of Cu from 17% to 0.7%, due to the flocs remaining in the tailing slurries. The electric energy consumption per extracted Cu was similar in the acidic and alkaline electrodialytic treatments without the addition of Magnafloc10. In the alkaline electrodialytic treatment, the extraction of other metals was low (<2%), however longer treatment time is necessary to achieve similar Cu extraction as in the acidic electrodialysis. Depending on the target and timescale for treatment, acidic and alkaline electrodialysis can be employed to reduce the Cu concentration in the mine tailings thereby reducing the metal toxicity potential.

T2  - Environmental Monitoring & Assessment
AB  - Cover systems are commonly applied to mine waste rock piles (WRPs) to control acid mine drainage (AMD). Single-layer covers utilize the moisture “store-and-release” concept to first store and then release moisture back to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. Although more commonly used in semi-arid and arid climates, store-and-release covers remain an attractive option in humid climates due to the low cost and relative simplicity of installation. However, knowledge of their performance in these climates is limited. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of moisture store-and-release covers at full-scale WRPs located in humid climates. This cover type was installed at a WRP in Nova Scotia, Canada, alongside state-of-the-art monitoring instrumentation. Field monitoring was conducted over 5 years to assess key components such as meteorological conditions, cover material water dynamics, net percolation, surface runoff, pore-gas, environmental receptor water quality, landform stability and vegetation. Water balances indicate small reductions in water influx to the waste rock (i.e., 34 to 28% of precipitation) with the diminished AMD release also apparent by small improvements in groundwater quality (increase in pH, decrease in sulfate/metals). Surface water quality analysis and field observations of vegetative/aquatic life demonstrate significant improvements in the surface water receptor. The WRP landform is stable and the vegetative cover is thriving. This study has shown that while a simple store-and-release cover may not be a highly effective barrier to water infiltration in humid climates, it can be used to (i) eliminate contaminated surface water runoff, (ii) minimize AMD impacts to surface water receptor(s), (iii) maintain a stable landform, and (iv) provide a sustainable vegetative canopy.

AB  - Biochar has the potential to decrease the leaching of nutrients from agricultural systems to watercourses. We applied cattle slurry (0 or 40 t ha −1 ) and different amounts of spruce biochar (0, 10, 20 or 40 t ha −1 ) to the surface of a boreal grass field in autumn and analyzed the nutrient content in the soil and the regrowth of grass ( Phleum pratense ) in the autumn over three years. In addition, four grass mats from each treatment were lifted each autumn and stored for 2–3 months outdoors (between −36 °C and 12 °C) for simulated snowmelt experiments. In the following winter, 30 kg snow was added to the grass mats and slowly melted with infra-red heaters over a 7-day period. All surface runoff water was collected and the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved phosphate phosphorus (PO 4 -P), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved total potassium (K), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH were measured. Biochar temporarily improved growing conditions by increasing pH values and the content of plant available acid ammonium acetate extractable P (P Ac ) and K (K Ac ) in the soil, which also increased losses in surface runoff during the first snowmelt. In contrast, the biochar retained slurry- and mineral fertilizer-originated NO 3 -N on the soil during the three year experiment and prevented NO 3 -N losses in surface runoff during the first snowmelt after autumnal slurry addition. The biochar-induced increase in phosphorus (P) loss in surface runoff during the first snowmelt after slurry application was considerable (0.1–0.5 kg P ha −1 ) and the decrease in nitrogen (N) loss was moderate (0.2–0.6 kg N ha −1 ) compared to annual P and N losses in surface runoff in an adjacent field. The surface application of biochar can be recommended for the inhibition of nutrient losses to watercourses via surface runoff only if the capacity of used biochar to retain both N and P can be verified before application.

AB  - The controls on the mobility and fate of arsenic in lakes impacted by historical gold ore roasting in northern Canada have been examined. A detailed characterization of arsenic solid and aqueous phases in lake waters, lake sediments and sediment porewaters as well as surrounding soils was conducted in three small lakes (<200ha) downwind and within 5 km of the historic mining and roasting operations of Giant Mine (Northwest Territories). These lakes are marked by differing limnological characteristics such as area, depth and organic content. Radiometric age-dating shows that the occurrence of arsenic trioxide in lake sediments coincides with the regional onset of roasting activities. Quantification by advanced electron microscopy shows that arsenic trioxide accounts for up to 6 wt% of the total arsenic in sediments. The bulk (>80 wt%) of arsenic is contained in the form of secondary sulphide precipitates, with iron oxy-hydroxides hosting a minimal amount of arsenic (<1 wt%). Soluble arsenic trioxide particles act as the primary source of arsenic into sediment porewaters. Dissolved arsenic in reducing porewaters both precipitates in-situ as secondary sulphides, and diffuses upwards into the overlying lake waters. Geogenic arsenic phases are present in sediments in low concentrations and are not considered a significant source of arsenic to porewaters or lake waters. Sediment-water interface diffusive flux calculations suggest that the diffusion of dissolved arsenic from porewaters, combined with lake water residence time, are the predominant mechanisms controlling arsenic concentrations in lake waters.

TI  - Early chemical and toxicological risk characterization of inorganic constituents in surface water from the Canadian oil sands first large-scale end pit lake

AB  - End pit lakes (EPLs) have been proposed as a method for the long-term reclamation of process water and fluid fine tailings (FFT) produced from surface mining within the Canadian oil sands. These waste products contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organics, metals, and salts which reduce surface water quality and are toxic to aquatic organisms. This study measured the concentrations of inorganic constituents in surface water from the industry's first large-scale EPL over the course of a three-year period (2014–2016). The toxicological risk was subsequently assessed to identify constituents of concern that may impair surface water quality necessary for the development of a functional aquatic ecosystem or for release to the surrounding environment. Changes in surface water concentrations over the three-year period were strongly correlated with hydrological processes occurring within the lake: advective-diffusive chemical influx from FFT pore water to the overlying surface water was offset by efflux via continuous manual pumping (freshwater in, process water out). These processes resulted in a net dilution effect of approximately 5–10% per year, however, a significant chemical mass is expected to persist within the underlying FFT. Elevated salinity (as Na+, Cl-, HCO 3 -) and concentrations of boron and nickel were predicted to pose very high toxicological risk to aquatic organisms. Despite these risks, the discovery of wild Daphnia pulex in the August 2016 sample suggested that surface water quality was sufficient to support populations of certain salt-tolerant zooplankton and primary producers. However, the time required for development into a robust aquatic ecosystem remains unknown. Highlights • Surface water quality improved slightly over the three-year period (2014–2016). • Attributed to manual freshwater input and process water output resulting in dilution. • As of 2016, most metal concentrations pose negligible risk to aquatic organisms. • Salinity (as Na+, Cl–, and HCO 3 –) is expected to pose a persistent risk for decades. • 2016 surface water quality was able to support a wild Daphnia pulex population.

AB  - Topsoil and grass samples from 14 sites located in different distances from three copper mining factories and a copper smelter were collected in Srednogorie, Bulgaria. The paper discusses results of studies on the mobility of potentially toxic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) from contaminated soils to wild grass Cynodon dactylon in terms of transfer (TF: soil to plant) and phytoavailability (PF: EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)-soluble to plant) factors. Soils located close to mine and smelter factories were heavily contaminated by As and Cu reaching levels up to 500 mg/kg and 2400 mg/kg, respectively for As and Cu. At seven sites arsenic and copper in grass were over the normal levels (1 mg/kg As; 20 mg/kg Cu). The content of Cu in grass averaged 63 mg/kg exceeding the maximum allowable for sheep. Relationship between PF and TF values was found for As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn but not for Mn and Cr. To some extent the soil pH, TOM (total organic matter) and CaCO 3 content are related to the phytoavailability of As, Cd and Cu since for Zn and Pb this relation is attributed to Al- and Fe-content of soil. Statistically significant correlation coefficients were determined between the EDTA-soluble fraction of soil and content in grass in the case of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn and Pb indicating the suitability of the short procedure for phytoavailability studies of those elements. The application of hierarchical cluster analysis and self-organizing maps of Kohonen made it possible to reveal specific hidden relationships between the soil variables and transfer factors as well as between the sampling locations. This additional information helps in more detailed interpretation of phytoavailability and transfer processes in the region of interest. The novelty in this study is achieved by careful consideration of the possibility of using EDTA extracts of the toxic metals in investigating of the phytoavailability and transfer processes soil/plant. Additionally, chemometric expertise used makes it possible to differentiate the behavior of each toxic metal in the processes studied. The combination of easy option for rapid extraction and intelligent data analysis gives a new perspective for contributions in explanation of the complex interactions between soils and plants when assessing pollution events in a certain environment. Graphical abstract fx1 Highlights • Application of soil EDTA extracts in phytoavailability and transfer processes studies. • Chemometric assessment of the soil to grass mobility of potentially toxic elements. • Elucidation of the relationships between basic soil parameters and phytoavailability. • Assessment of the phytoavailable soil fraction of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn and Pb in an industry affected region.

AB  - Field evidence has been scarce about soil (or technosol) formation and direct phytostabilization of base metal mine tailings under field conditions. The present study evaluated key attributes of soil formation in weathered and neutral Cu-Pb-Zn tailings subject to organic amendment (WC: woodchips) and colonization of pioneer native plant species (mixed native woody and grass plant species) in a 2.5-year field trial under subtropical and semi-arid climatic conditions. Key soil indicators of engineered soil formation process were characterized, including organic carbon fractions, aggregation, microbial community and key enzymatic activities. The majority (64–87%) of the OC was stabilized in microaggregate or organo-mineral complexes in the amended tailings. The levels of OC and water soluble OC were elevated by 2–3 folds across the treatments, with the highest level in the treatment of WC and plant colonization (WC+P). Specifically, the WC+P treatment increased the proportion of water stable macroaggregates. Plants further contributed to the N rich organic matter in the tailings, favouring organo-mineral interactions and organic stabilization. Besides, the plants played a major role in boosting microbial biomass and activities in the treated tailings. WC and plants enhanced the contents of organic carbon (OC) associated with aggregates (e.g., physically protected OC), formation of water-stable aggregates (e.g., micro and macroaggregates), chemical buffering capacity (e.g., cation exchange capacity). Microbial community and enzymatic activities were also stimulated in the amended tailings. The present results showed that the formation of functional technosol was initiated in the eco-engineered and weathered Cu-Pb-Zn tailings under field conditions for direct phytostabilization.
