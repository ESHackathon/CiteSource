T2  - Aims Environmental Science
AB  - Energy and mineral resource extraction has fuelled economic development in the modern world but has caused unprecedented environmental destruction. Economically viable to extract resources are not evenly distributed but found in a few regions of the world due to unique geologic characteristics. Inequity in distribution of resource benefits and environmental costs predispose these regions to resource conflict and war. Traditional resource management has failed to address their complexity, with most models utilised lacking multi-disciplinary perspective. Understanding the complexity of these regions is a key prerequisite for their management to be effective and sustainable. Here, we investigate the potential of re-assessing mineral resource active regions from a systems perspective. Findings demonstrate that the application of systems thinking in resource management has the potential to deliver benefits to all stakeholders while maintaining ecological integrity. System tools offer an alternative to the reductionist end-of-pipe thinking of traditional resource management and policies. Rather than simply relying on competition, focusing on the interdependencies between the various players and sectors in these regions can deliver system improvements that should be further investigated because of their potential to deliver integrated and holistic solutions that could benefit all involved.

AB  - Two peat cores from two bogs were used to record changes in the atmospheric Pb accumulation rate (Pb AR) in Belgium during the Roman period. The two records were compared to assess the reliability of peat cores as archives of atmospheric Pb deposition and to establish histories of atmospheric emissions from anthropogenic sources. To address these issues we analyzed Pb concentration and its isotopes, using ICP-MS, LA-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS in two peat sections, spanning 1000 years each. Lead concentrations in the two cores range from 0.1 to 60 mu g g(-1), with the maxima between 15 and 60 mu g g(-1). The average natural background of Pb AR varies between 0.003 and 0.07 mg m(-2) yr(-1) and the maximum ranges from 0.7 to 1.2 mg m(-2) yr(-1) between 50 BC and AD 215. The highest Pb AR exceed the pre-Roman period values by a factor of 17-80. Pb isotopic composition indicates that mining and metallurgical activities were the predominant sources of pollution during the Roman period. The Pb AR and chronologies in the Belgian peat cores are consistent with those reported for other continental archives such as lake sediments, peat and ice cores.

AB  - Penguins are reliable sentinels for environmental assessments of mercury (Hg) due to their longevity, abundance, high trophic level, and relatively small foraging areas. We analyzed Hg concentrations from blood and feathers of adult Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and feathers of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) from different reproductive colonies with variable degrees of urbanization and industrialization along the Chilean and Antarctic coasts. We evaluated Hg concentration differences between species, sexes (Humboldt penguins), and localities. Our results showed significantly greater levels in Humboldt penguins than in chinstrap penguins and nonsignificant differences between sexes among Humboldts. Penguin Hg concentrations showed a latitudinal pattern, with greater values of the metal at lower latitudes, independent of the species. Both studied penguin species showed elevated Hg concentrations compared to their congeners, highlighting the necessity to investigate potential negative effects on their populations. Although differences between species are possibly due to variation in diet and trophic level, our results suggest an important effect of the degree of Hg pollution adjacent to foraging areas. Further research on Hg content in prey species and environmental samples, together with a larger overall sample size, and investigation on penguin's diet and trophic level are needed to elucidate Hg bioavailability in each location and the role of local Hg pollution levels. Likewise, it is important to monitor Hg and other heavy metals of ecotoxicological importance in penguin populations in vulnerable regions of Chile.

T2  - Advances in Water Resources
AB  - Mine waste rock dumps have highly variable flowpaths caused by contrasting textures and geometry of materials laid down during the 'plug dumping' process. Numerical experiments were conducted to investigate how these characteristics control unsaturated zone flow and transport. Hypothetical profiles of inner-lift structure were generated with multiple point statistics and populated with hydraulic parameters of a finer and coarser material. Early arrival of water and solutes at the bottom of the lifts was observed after spring snowmelt. The leaching efficiency, a measure of the proportion of a resident solute that is flushed out of the rock via infiltrating snowmelt or rainfall, was consistently high, but modified by the structure and texture of the lift. Under high rates of net percolation during snowmelt, preferential flow was generated in coarse textured part of the rock, and solutes in the fine textured parts of the rock remained stagnant. Under lower rates of net percolation during the summer and fall, finer materialswere flushed too, and the spatial variability of solute concentration in the lift was reduced. Layering of lifts leads to lower flow rates at depth, minimizing preferential flow and increased leaching of resident solutes. These findings highlight the limited role of large scale connected geometries on focusing flow and transport under dynamic surface net percolation conditions. As such, our findings agree with recent numerical results from soil studies with Gaussian connected geometries as well as recent experimental findings, emphasizing the dominant role of matrix flow and high leaching efficiency in large waste rock dumps.

T2  - Bjog-an International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology
AB  - Objective To assess the effect of mining pollution on birthweight. Design A retrospective before-and-after study with an untreated comparison group. Setting La Oroya, a mining town in the Peruvian Andes, considered the most contaminated town in the Andean region. Population All pregnant women who delivered in the social security healthcare system in years 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009. A total of 214 983 births records were used, 957 from La Oroya and 214 026 from the rest of the country. Methods A difference-in-difference estimation is used to assess the effect of mining pollution on birthweight before and after two business policy changes: a partial environmental improvement and a subsequent closure of smelter operations in La Oroya. Birthweight was compared with a group not affected by the environmental changes in La Oroya. Main outcome measures Birthweight in grams. Results A steep reduction in mining pollution due to the closure of smelter operations in La Oroya showed an increased birthweight of 71.6 g after controlling for socio-economic and medical characteristics. None of the environmental improvements prior to the closure had a statistically significant effect on birthweight. Conclusions Mining pollution in La Oroya had a negative impact on birthweight. Partial environmental improvements were not enough to improve birthweight. Only after the closure of all mining and smelter operations in La Oroya was a significant gain in birthweight shown.

TI  - An approach at estimating present day base cation weathering rates: a case study for the Hermine watershed, Canada
AU  - Augustin, F.
AU  - Houle, D.
AU  - Courchesne, F.
T2  - Biogeochemistry
AB  - A new methodological approach is described for estimating Ca, Mg and K fluxes from soil mineral weathering. This method combines Na flux in surface waters in the Hermine watershed with base cation (BC) concentrations to Na molar ratios from the soil weatherable pool obtained using sequential extraction method. Comparison of BC:Na molar ratios of the weatherable pool with those from other compartments of the watershed suggests possible accumulation of base cations in some areas of the watershed, while losses or minimal changes are observed in others. On average, present day Na weathering rates estimated using the watershed input-output budget method was 0.26 (range 0.16-0.36) kmol(c)ha(-1)yearr(-1), over the period of 1995-2006. For Ca, Mg and K, present day weathering rates estimated with the new methodological approach averaged 0.44 (range 0.27-0.60), 0.11 (range 0.07-0.15) and 0.02 (range 0.01-0.02) kmol(c)ha(-1)year(-1), respectively. These values are within the range of present day rates previously calculated for the same site and for forested soils from similar granitic environments using other methods. Candidate models for predicting BC weathering rates on individual annual observations were developed using Akaike's information criterion. The best model includes the number of frost days (inverse relationship) and explained 51% of the variation in total BC weathering rates. The newly developed method may be applicable to other watersheds, providing yearly estimates of nutrient BC at the watershed scale.

AB  - Objective To characterise the early diffusion of indirect comparison meta-analytic methods to study drugs. Design Systematic literature synthesis. Data sources Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Study selection English language papers that used indirect comparison meta-analytic methods to study the efficacy or safety of three or more interventions, where at least one was a drug. Data extraction The number of publications and authors was plotted by year and type: methodological contribution, review or empirical application. Author and methodological details were summarised for empirical applications, and animated coauthorship networks were created to visualise contributors by country and affiliation type (academia, industry, government or other) over time. Results We identified 477 papers (74 methodological contributions, 42 reviews and 361 empirical applications) by 1689 distinct authors from 1997 to 2013. Prior to 2002, only three applications were published, with contributions from the USA (n=2) and Canada (n=1). The number of applications gradually increased annually with rapid uptake between 2011 and 2013 (n=254, 71%). Early diffusion occurred primarily in Europe with the first application credited to the UK in 2003. Application spread to other European countries in 2005, and may have been supported by regulatory requirements for drug approval. By the end of 2013, contributions included 49% credited to Europe (22% UK, 27% other), 37% credited to North America (11% Canada, 26% USA) and 14% from other regions. Conclusion Indirect comparison meta-analytic methods are an important innovation for health research. Although Canada and the USA were the first to apply these methods, Europe led their diffusion. The increase in uptake of these methods may have been facilitated by acceptance by regulatory agencies, which are calling for more comparative drug effect data to assist in drug accessibility and reimbursement decisions.

AB  - Aircraft-based measurements of methane (CH4) and other air pollutants in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) were made during a summer intensive field campaign between 13 August and 7 September 2013 in support of the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring. Chemical signatures were used to identify CH4 sources from tailings ponds (BTEX VOCs), open pit surface mines (NOy and r BC) and elevated plumes from bitumen upgrading facilities (SO2 and NOy). Emission rates of CH4 were determined for the five primary surface mining facilities in the region using two mass-balance methods. Emission rates from source categories within each facility were estimated when plumes from the sources were spatially separable. Tailings ponds accounted for 45% of total CH4 emissions measured from the major surface mining facilities in the region, while emissions from operations in the open pit mines accounted for +/- 50 %. The average open pit surface mining emission rates ranged from 1.2 to 2.8 t of CH4 h(-1) for different facilities in the AOSR. Amongst the 19 tailings ponds, Mildred Lake Settling Basin, the oldest pond in the region, was found to be responsible for the majority of tailings ponds emissions of CH4 (> 70 %). The sum of measured emission rates of CH4 from the five major facilities, 19.2 +/- 1.1 tCH(4) h(-1), was similar to a single mass-balance determination of CH4 from all major sources in the AOSR determined from a single flight downwind of the facilities, 23.7 +/- 3.7 tCH(4) h(-1). The measured hourly CH4 emission rate from all facilities in the AOSR is 48 +/- 8% higher than that extracted for 2013 from the Canadian Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, a legislated facility-reported emissions inventory, converted to hourly units. The measured emissions correspond to an emissions rate of 0.17 +/- 0.01 TgCH(4) yr(-1) if the emissions are assumed as temporally constant, which is an uncertain assumption. The emission rates reported here are relevant for the summer season. In the future, effort should be devoted to measurements in different seasons to further our understanding of the seasonal parameters impacting fugitive emissions of CH4 and to allow for better estimates of annual emissions and year-to-year variability.

TI  - Online Differential Thermal Isotope Analysis of Hydration Water in Minerals by Cavity Ringdown Laser Spectroscopy
AU  - Bauska, T. K.

AU  - Gazquez, F.
AU  - Hodell, D. A.
T2  - Analytical Chemistry
AB  - We have developed a new method for measuring the isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta D) of different types of bonded water (e.g., molecular water, hydroxyl) contained in hydrated minerals by coupling a thermal gravimeter (TG) and a cavity ringdown laser spectrometer (CRDS). The method involves precisely step-heating a mineral sample, allowing the separation of the different types of waters that are released at different temperatures. Simultaneously, the water vapor evolved from the mineral sample is analyzed for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes by CRDS. Isotopic values for the separate peaks are calculated by integrating the product of the water amounts and its isotopic values, after correcting for background. We provide examples of the application of the differential thermal isotope analysis (DTIA) method to a variety of hydrous minerals and mineraloids including gypsum, clays, and amorphous silica (opal). The isotopic compositions of the total water evolved from a set of natural gypsum samples by DTIA are compared with the results of a conventional offline water extraction method followed by CRDS analysis. The results from both methods are in excellent agreement, and precisions (1 sigma) for delta O-18 (+/- 0.12 parts per thousand) and delta D (+/- 0.8 parts per thousand) of the total gypsum hydration water from the DTIA method are comparable to that obtained by the oufline method. A range of analytical challenges and solutions (e.g., spectroscopic interferences produced by VOCs in natural samples, isotopic exchange with structural oxygen, etc.) are discussed. The DTIA method has wide ranging applications for addressing fundamental problems across many disciplines in earth and planetary sciences, including paleoclimatology, sedimentology, volcanology, water exchange between the solid earth and hydrosphere, and water on Mars and other planetary bodies.

TI  - Isotopic signature of atmospheric phosphate in airborne tree pollen
AU  - Bigio, L.
AU  - Angert, A.
T2  - Atmospheric Environment
AB  - In non-desert areas primary biological aerosol particles, including pollen, are an important source of phosphorus (P). During the flowering season large quantities of pollen from wind pollinated trees, are observed in boreal and temperate lakes and forest, which contain high P concentrations. However, there are different estimations for the contribution of pollen to the atmospheric P cycle, and there is no accepted method for the identification of phosphate from pollen origin. In this study we measured the P concentrations in pollen from various locations. In addition, the oxygen stable isotopes ratio in phosphate (delta O-18(p)) was measured for the first time for both the bioavailable pool (P extractable by anion-exchange resin), and for the HCI-extractable pool. The resin and HCl-extractable delta O-18(p) values were on average (+/- SE) 25.6 +/- 3.4%o, and 25.8 +/- 2.9%o, which are distinctively higher than mineral dust delta O-18(p) values (average 22.1 +/- 0.7%o). Pollen unique isotopic signature in phosphate can be used as a tool to identify P in aerosols from pollen origin, and hence to better understand the atmospheric P cycle. The high P concentrations found in this study (average ( +/- SE) resin-P and HCl-P values were 0.67 +/- 0.10 and 0.75 +/- 0.9 mg P g(-1)), confirm that pollen is important to the atmospheric P budget, and can help to solve the uncertainties regarding its role in the global P cycle.

AB  - Geochemical and geophysical investigations were performed in the area of the Komsomolsk tailings impoundment. Gold ore tailings produced with cyanidation have been generated by the Komsomolsk Gold Extraction Plant. The relatively low sulfide content in the Komsomolsk tailings and the presence of carbonates result in a low acid production potential (AP) for these tailings. The tailings pond is characterized by neutral to slightly alkaline conditions and metal concentrations, except for those of As and Sb, below the maximum permissible concentration (MPC). The situation is complicated by the fact that the displaced Berikul tailings are stored in the southern part of the Komsomolsk tailings impoundment. Sulfide concentrate cyanidation tailings were produced by the former Berikul Gold Extraction Plant. In the Berikul tailings, the sulfide content is approximately 25%. This high content has resulted in a high AP and the formation of acidic and ultra-acidic surface ponds (pH similar to 2) with extremely high concentrations of metals and metalloids (As up to 4.1 g L-1). The estimated duration of acid drainage generated by the Berikul tailings is approximately 2400 years. Surface drainage from the tailings enters the Voskresenka River; as a result, the concentrations of As and Sb in the river water approach the MPCs established by the Russian Ministry of Health. Based on electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), the uncontrolled leakage of acidic and highly mineralized solutions through a natural geological fault into groundwater horizons was revealed. Groundwater contamination was confirmed via an analysis of drinking water from a well located near the fault.

TI  - Petrology, geochemistry and a probable late Cambrian age for harzburgites of the Coolac Serpentinite, New South Wales, Australia
AU  - Bruce, M. C.
T2  - Australian Journal of Earth Sciences
AB  - The Coolac Serpentinite, in the Tumut region of southeastern NSW, is one of many Alpine-type, linear ultramafic bodies exposed in the Lachlan Orogen of New South Wales. Despite the significance of such oceanic lithosphere throughout the orogen to tectonic models, few studies on the genesis of these bodies in the Lachlan Orogen have been documented. A significant proportion of the Coolac ultramafic rocks are only partially serpentinised, making them good candidates for detailed petrological and geochemical studies. The Coolac peridotites include harzburgites with mineral compositions and bulk-rock REE concentrations similar to abyssal peridotites. Assuming depleted mantle compositions, HREE concentrations are limited (0.2-0.3x primitive mantle) implying melt extraction of 15-20%. Conversely, some Cr-spinel data within the harzburgites (Cr# = 0.22-0.27) indicate partial melting of only 9-11%. Adsorbed mantle pyroxenes, excess olivine and LREE enrichment suggest melt-rock interactions led to the refertilisation of the harzburgites. Isotope characteristics of a ca 501 Ma allochthonous tonalite block derived from melting of altered oceanic crust and a ca 439 Ma oceanic granite intrusion indicate an identical source that separated from the fertile mantle at 660 Ma. This places chronological constraints on the harzburgites, which are the result of two-stage melting involving a lherzolite protolith formed during the break-up of Rodinia followed by harzburgite formation during a further melt extraction event within an extensional phase of the Delamerian Orogeny. The harzburgites were enriched via melt-rock interactions soon after formation as well as during phases of the Benambran Orogeny beginning at ca 439 Ma and ending around ca 427 Ma with the emplacement of the North Mooney Complex, a layered ultramafic-gabbro association that has characteristics of Alaskan-style intrusions similar to the Fifield complexes of the central Lachlan Orogen.

AB  - The Mount Polley mine tailings embankment breach on August 4th, 2014, in British Columbia, Canada, is the second largest mine waste spill on record. The mine operator responded swiftly by removing significant quantities of tailings from the primary receiving watercourse, stabilizing the river corridor and beginning construction of a new river channel. This presented a unique opportunity to study spatial patterns of element cycling in a partially-restored and alkaline river system. Overall, water quality impacts are considered low with Cu, and to a lesser extent V, being the only elements of concern. However, the spatial pattern of stream Cu loading suggested chemical (dominant at low flow) and physical (dominant at high flow) mobilization processes operating in different parts of the watershed. Chemical mobilization was hypothesized to be due to Cu sulfide (chalcopyrite) oxidation in riparian tailings and reductive dissolution of Cu-bearing Fe oxides in tailings and streambed sediments whereas physical mobilization was due to erosion and suspension of Cu-rich stream sediments further downstream. Although elevated aqueous Cu was evident in Hazeltine Creek, this is considered a relatively minor perturbation to a watershed with naturally elevated stream Cu concentrations. The alkaline nature of the tailings and the receiving watercourse ensures most aqueous Cu is rapidly complexed with dissolved organic matter or precipitates as secondary mineral phases. Our data highlights how swift removal of spilled tailings and river corridor stabilization can limit chemical impacts in affected watersheds but also how chemical mobilization (of Cu) can still occur when the spilled tailings and the receiving environment are alkaline. We present a conceptual model of Cu cycling in the Hazeltine Creek watershed.

TI  - Chronic Toxicity of Ferric Iron for North American Aquatic Organisms: Derivation of a Chronic Water Quality Criterion Using Single Species and Mesocosm Data
AU  - Cadmus, P.

AU  - May, M. K.
T2  - Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology
AB  - Iron is a common pollutant in waters near coal and hard rock mine disturbances. The current 1000 A mu g/L total recoverable chronic criterion for iron (Fe) for protection of aquatic life in the United States was developed using very limited data in 1976 and has not been revised since. To develop a more scientifically based criterion, several chronic laboratory toxicity experiments (> 30 days) were conducted with ferric Fe at circumneutral pH on a taxonomically diverse group of organisms including brown trout (Salmo trutta), mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), boreal toad tadpoles (Bufo boreas), the oligochaete worm Lumbriculus variegatus, the mayfly Hexagenia limbata, and the planarian Dugesia dorotocephala. Results of these tests and those of previously published toxicity data were used to derive a Final Chronic Value (FCV) of 499 A mu g/L by using the US Environmental Protection Agency's recommended methods based on single species toxicity tests. In addition to single species toxicity tests, ferric Fe toxicity experiments (10 days) were performed on mesocosms containing naturally colonized communities of benthic macroinvertebrates. Fourteen genera in the mesocosms occurred at sufficient densities to estimate an iron concentration resulting in 20% reduction in abundance (EC20). Three of these taxa had EC(20)s less than the FCV of 499 A mu g/L derived from single species tests: the mayfly Epeorus sp. (335 A mu g/L), the caddisfly Micrasema sp. (356 A mu g/L), and midge Tanytarsini (234 A mu g/L). When mesocosm results were included, the FCV was lowered to 251 A mu g/L. These findings support the suggestion that modernization of water quality criteria should include data generated from mesocosm experiments and other lines of evidence.

AB  - Time-composition relationships in eruptive sequences at composite volcanoes can show how the ongoing intrusion of magmas progressively affects the lithosphere at continental convergent margins. Here, new whole-rock and microanalytical major and trace element data from andesite-dacite lava flows are integrated with previous studies and existing isotopic data, and placed within the framework of a high-resolution chronostratigraphy for Ruapehu volcano (southern Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand). The geochemical evolution of lavas erupted over the similar to 200 kyr lifetime of the exposed edifice reflects variable degrees of fractionation and systematic changes in the type of crustal assimilation in the Ruapehu magma system. Lavas erupted from similar to 200-150 ka have previously been distinguished from those erupted <150 ka based on Sr-Nd isotopic characteristics, which indicate that the oldest lavas were sourced from magmas that assimilated oceanic crust. Such source rocks underlie the regionally wide-spread Mesozoic meta-sedimentary greywacke-argillite basement, which was conversely assimilated by <150 ka magmas. New results from this work reveal that since 150 ka, an upper limit of magma differentiation occurred from similar to 50-35 ka. High K2O (similar to 6 wt%) and Rb contents (similar to 270 ppm) in melt inclusions, interstitial glass, and glass from in situ quenched melts of partially fused crustal xenoliths are reported for andesite-dacite lavas erupted during this period. In addition to crystal fractionation, selective partial melting and assimilation of K-and Rb-rich mineral phases (e.g., biotite, K-feldspar) that are significant components of the meta-sedimentary basement rocks is inferred to explain these geochemical characteristics. These processes coincided also with the effusion of high-MgO andesite-dacite lavas that display petrological evidence for mixing between andesite-dacite and more mafic magmas. An influx of hotter mafic magma into the system explains why the extent of crustal assimilation recorded by Ruapehu lavas peaked during the similar to 50-35 ka eruptive period. From 26 ka to the present, andesite lavas have reverted to more mafic compositions with less potassic melt inclusion and whole-rock compositions when compared to the similar to 50-35 ka lavas. We suggest that the younger lavas assimilated less-enriched melts because fertile phases had been preferentially extracted from the crustal column during earlier magmatism. This scenario of bottom-up heating of the lithosphere and exhaustion of fertile phases due to the progressive intrusion of magma explains the geochemical evolution of Ruapehu lavas. This model may be applicable to other long-lived composite volcanoes of the circum-Pacific continental arcs.

AB  - Mineral weathering processes in soils are important controls on soil characteristics and on bio-and geochemical cycling. Elucidation of these processes and their mechanisms is crucial for understanding soil environments and their influence globally. An Umbric Podzol from the Falkland Islands was studied while investigating possible ways to counteract soil degradation and loss. The soil had lost the O, E, and Bs horizons through erosion, thus revealing the transitional B/C horizon, which grades into the underlying parent material. Samples were taken from the B/C surface and 5 cm below the surface, then analyzed with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, organic C and N analysis, analysis of extractable Fe and Al with the dithionitecitrate-bicarbonate and ammonium oxalate methods, and Fourier-transform infrared analysis. The soil fabric and mineralogy were compatible with derivation from sandstone rock. Clasts of heterogeneous mineral composition as well as loose material from disaggregated clasts were present. The soil had large proportions of quartz and albite, and minor amounts of muscovite, chlorite, plagioclase, feldspar, kaolinite, and non-diffracting Fe oxide (goethite and/or ferrihydrite). The most peculiar characteristic was a large component (similar to 7 wt% of the bulk soil) of an amorphous (non-X-ray diffracting) silicate phase of small particle size (<1 mu m), non-extractable, with heterogeneous composition. The average composition of this phase is similar to that of the bulk soil and approaches that of Al-Fe-rich smectite. The amorphous phase is not allophane or imogolite by any of the analyses carried out. The amorphous silicate phase is formed partly by the translocation of metals from O, E, and Bs horizons and partly by dissolution of the primary minerals of the B/C horizon, both of which precipitated in combination with low water mobility causing rapid saturation of the interstitial water. There are no reports of amorphous silicate phases with these characteristics or abundances from soils or other weathering environments. Thus, our observations indicate the existence of complex, successive weathering steps not yet identified that could be investigated in materials subjected to slow weathering such as the soil described here.

AB  - Small resource-dependent towns are particularly vulnerable to economic decline as they often have limited internal capacity to develop alternative economic functions. This paper presents the story of the development, decline and adaptation of a small resource-dependent town. Recognising that the processes informing the development trajectories of resource communities are diverse, temporally embedded and multi-scalar, this paper argues that the everyday activities of the residents inform the life of resource towns, and, moreover, lives within these places. The paper presents the story of WundowieWestern Australia's first iron ore town. This is interwoven with the story of the Kowalski familya migrant family whose history, typical of many of the town's original residents, made the town.

AB  - The US National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Natural Product Repository is one of the world's largest, most diverse collections of natural products containing over 230,000 unique extracts derived from plant, marine, and microbial organisms that have been collected from biodiverse regions throughout the world. Importantly, this national resource is available to the research community for the screening of extracts and the isolation of bioactive natural products. However, despite the success of natural products in drug discovery, compatibility issues that make extracts challenging for liquid handling systems, extended timelines that complicate natural product-based drug discovery efforts and the presence of panassay interfering compounds have reduced enthusiasm for the high-throughput screening (HTS) of crude natural product extract libraries in targeted assay systems. To address these limitations, the NCI Program for Natural Product Discovery (NPNPD), a newly launched, national program to advance natural product discovery technologies and facilitate the discovery of structurally defined, validated lead molecules ready for translation will create a prefractionated library from over 125,000 natural product extracts with the aim of producing a publicly-accessible, HTS-amenable library of >1,000,000 fractions. This library, representing perhaps the largest accumulation of natural-product based fractions in the world, will be made available free of charge in 384-well plates for screening against all disease states in an effort to re-invigorate natural product-based drug discovery.

AB  - In this study, we analyze samples of a black substance that was used for restoring a Tym-type vessel at Yasnoye-8, Central Sakhalin. On the basis of similar finds from the Japanese archipelago, it was initially assumed to be natural bitumen. However; science-based methods have not been previously used to test this assumption. In addition to the identification of natural bitumen, we sought to identify, its some. The study was carried out independently at two laboratories, using geochemical and petrographic methods, so the results can be considered reliable. For the first time in Russia, the method of pyrolysis gas chromatography - mass spectrometry was used, along with elemental and petrographic analysis, lo identify hydrocarbon from an archaeological site. The results confirm the use of natural bitumen during the Early Iron Age. It can be procured in sufficient amounts on Sakhalin Island. Identification of specific sources is complicated by the virtually complete lack of geological data (bitumen is not mined for industrial purposes). Available materials suggest that bitumen found at lasnoye-8 originates from the northern Sakhalin petroleum zone or from adjacent areas. No relationship to bitumen deposits in northeastern Honshu was found.Nor is it likely that the sample is related to superficial hydrocarbons of Hokkaido.

AB  - The gradual increase in the amount of land and water resources affected by salt in arid and semi-arid regions requires strategies to optimize the use of these marginal-quality resources. Recent field and greenhouse experiments have demonstrated the potential of growing certain 'pre-selected' varieties of alfalfa in highly saline conditions. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the impact of irrigation with saline groundwater on alfalfa growth and production in saline-sodic soils. The sustainability of the system in terms of forage yield and quality was also evaluated. The study included three varieties of alfalfa (Medicago sativa, vars. SW8421S, PGI908S and WL656HQ) planted in pots filled with saline-sodic soil (Calcic Haplosalids) collected on the island of Lanzarote (Spain) and irrigated for 18 months with increasingly saline water. Although the yield of the alfalfa varieties was reduced by an average of 7, 20, 31 and 46% as the salinity of the irrigation water increased from 0.4 dS m(-1) to 2.5,5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 dS m(-1), respectively, their relative salt tolerance, based on the average electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), was much higher than those established in the literature. Based on their nutritional quality, all alfalfa varieties are categorized as 'supreme' quality, with metabolizable energy (ME) values in excess of 10 MJ kg(-1). Moreover, no detriment to quality was observed at the higher levels of irrigation water salinity. Mineral composition analysis revealed S, K and B levels near or above the established maximum tolerable levels (MTLs) suggesting that this forage could only be safely consumed by ruminants over the long term if combined with other forages with lower mineral content.

T2  - Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology
AB  - Although many studies have reported mechanisms of resistance to metals in herbaceous species, there is very little information on metal coping strategy in hardwood species such as Quercus rubra. The main objective of this study was to determine the expression of genes associated with nickel resistance in red oak (Q. rubra) populations from metal contaminated and uncontaminated sites in the Northern Ontario. Six genes associated with nickel resistances in model and non-model plants were targeted. Differential expressions of these genes were observed in Q. rubra from all the sites, but association between metal contamination and gene expression was not established. This suggests that the bioavailable amounts of metals found in metal contaminated soils in mining sites in northern Ontario and likely in many mining regions around the world cannot trigger a genetic response in higher plant species.

The soils there, which have developed from long-term weathering, exhibit As levels as high as 1.87 wt% in the richest area; the 80-90 year old mining waste contains up to 0.87 wt% As. In the soils and mining waste, the primary As ore (arsenopyrite) has almost completely oxidized to secondary As minerals such as arseniosiderite, bariopharmacosiderite, yukonite, and Fe (hydr) oxides (ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite), with variable As2O5 and CaO concentrations (up to 27.5 and 3.8 wt%, respectively). Arsenic distribution and speciation were found to vary with depth and soil type. Whereas the presence of multiple Ashosting phases that occurred in the mining waste and cambisol developed over a granodiorite, bariopharmacosiderite was absent in the cambisol overlying gabbrodiorite. Poorly-crystalline phases such as yukonite and As-bearing ferrihydrite were not detected in the gleysol. These differences in the secondary As mineralogy were attributed to the different redox conditions and variations in the prevailing chemical systems in the saprolites/soils. The variable solubility of the secondary As-bearing phases influences the mobility of As in shallow soils and near-surface mining wastes.

AB  - Conventional triaxial tests were mostly conducted to explore the coal and gas outburst mechanisms based on the moulded coal specimens, leading to the difference of three-dimensional unequal stress condition between the simulated coal seam and the real coal seams. A true triaxial gas-solid coupled coal seepage test system was developed to fulfil the gas seepage under the true triaxial stress. Moreover, the deformation-failure characteristics and gas seepage behaviours of moulded coal and raw coal were investigated under true triaxial stress. By analysing the relations among stress, strain and permeability in true triaxial tests, it has established the important effect of the intermediate principle stress (sigma(2)) on the occurrence of coal and gas outburst. The coal's yield strength increased and permeability decreased when sigma(2) was at the early and middle stage of the load, while the coal's permeability increased and instable failure happened when sigma(2) was at the late stage of the load. Particle flow code software was applied innovatively to simulate the seepage experiment, proving the reliability of experimental results. Meanwhile, the test standard based on raw coal was proposed. Furthermore, the present research results provide a new insight and approach for the prevention and monitoring of coal and gas outburst.

AB  - Sakhaite, ca. Ca48Mg16(BO3)(32)(CO3)(16)(HCl,H2O)(2), is a rare rock-forming borate-carbonate mineral typically occurring in high-temperature, low-pressure calcareous skarns. It forms a complete solid solution with harkerite, ca. Ca48Mg16[AlSi4(O,OH)(16)](4)(BO3)(16)(CO3)(16)(HCl,H2O)(2). The solid solution can be described with the general formula Ca-48(Mg, Fe, Mn)(16)(CO3)(16)[AlaSi5-a(O,OH)(16)](y)(BO3)(32-4y)(HCl,H2O)(n) where y(max) = 8 and n(max) = 16 - y. In this study, we examine samples of sakhaite and harkerite from four localities worldwide: Titovskoye deposit, Sakha Republic, Russia (type locality for sakhaite); Solongo B deposit, Buryatia Republic, Russia; Camas Malag, Skye, Scotland (type locality for harkerite); as well as a sakhaite-like mineral from the Kombat Mine, Tsumeb. The Si:B ratios of the samples ranged from that of end-member sakhaite (containing B only) to that of end-member harkerite (Si:B = 1:1), with several intermediate compositions. All samples were deficient in B relative to the ideal composition, implying significant substitution for borate groups. The Si:Al ratio of silicate-containing samples ranged from the ideal 4:1 to 4:1.5, implying substitution of Al at the Si site. The cubic unit-cell parameter was found to increase linearly with increasing Si content, except for the sakhaite-like mineral from Tsumeb. This mineral was found to have significant substitution of Pb for Ca (0.4-0.5 apfu) and was poor in Cl, which in most sakhaite and harkerite samples occupies the interstitial site surrounded by four borate groups. This interstitial site in the Tsumeb samples appears to be, instead, mainly occupied by H2O, which may qualify the mineral as a distinct species.

AB  - Mining is the extraction and processing of valuable ferro and non-ferro metals and minerals to be further used in manufacturing industries. Valuable metals and minerals are extracted from the geological deposits and ores deep in the surface through complex manufacturing technologies. The extraction and processing of mining industries involve particle emission to air or water, toxicity to the environment, contamination of water resources, ozone layer depletion and most importantly decay of human health. Despite all these negative impacts towards sustainability, mining industries are working throughout the world to facilitate the employment sector, economy and technological growth. The five most important miners in the world are South Africa, Russia, Australia, Ukraine, Guinea. The mining industries contributes to their GDP significantly. However, the most important issue is making the mining world sustainable thus reducing the emissions. To address the environmental impacts caused by the mining sectors, this paper is going to analyse the environmental impacts caused by the 5 major minerals extraction processes, which are bauxite, ilmenite, iron ore, rutile and uranium by using the life-cycle impact assessment technologies. The analysis is done here using SimaPro software version 8.4 using ReCipe, CML and Australian indicator method.

AB  - The current research was performed on four petrologic end members samples from Syncrude's North Mine collected in 2012 (NM12), i.e. marine clay (MC), marine sand (MS), estuarine clay (EC), and estuarine sand (ES). The mineralogical compositions of the four petrological end members were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), quantitative XRD (QXRD), elemental analysis, and particle size distribution (PSD) measurements. Bulk samples from the four petrologic end members, after bitumen removal, were mainly composed of clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, chlorite, and mixed-layer expandable clays) and non-clay minerals such as quartz, carbonates, feldspars, and traces of TiO2 minerals, gypsum, and pyrite. Bulk samples of the clay end members were composed of significantly higher amounts of clay minerals and lower amounts of quartz compared with the bulk samples of the sand end members. XRD analysis of oriented preparations (air dried-54% RH and ethylene glycolated) of the <0.2m fractions of the four end members showed that interstratified illite-smectite of high (approximate to 30%) and low (approximate to 10%) expandability were observed only in clay-rich end members, i.e. NM12-EC and MC, respectively. Kaolinite-smectite was only found in the <0.2m fraction of the NM12-MC with an expandability between 5 and 10%. Interstratification of illite-smectite was observed in the <0.2m fraction of NM09-MC and EC samples but the expandability was only 10% for both fractions. However, kaolinite-smectite was not found in the same fraction for NM09-MC and EC. ES and EC had the highest and lowest bitumen contents, respectively, for the NM12, NM09, and AM10 samples.

AB  - Relevance. Traditional beneficiation processes do not provide full disclosure of minerals due to the design parameters of the equipment, so they are modernized by attracting operations of hydrometallurgical and chemical processing, which increase the efficiency of enrichment due to application of a new kind of energy, for example, technology of chemical leaching of metals. The direction of increasing the volume of production of metals by leaching non-conforming raw materials and wastes of mining and processing in piles, which is used to produce copper, gold, uranium, becomes more relevant. The aim of the study is the proof of ecological-economic efficiency of leaching of non-conforming raw materials and wastes of mining and processing in a pile and substantiation of their prospects. Methods of the research include analysis and synthesis of results of previously performed theoretical and experimental studies and those borrowed from the literature, patent data in analysis modeling. Results. In the complex "hydrometallurgy and ore leaching" the least cost of the product is achieved when the uranium content in ore is 0,08 %. At increasing uranium content without growth in ore production output the rate of production decreases due to low recoveries of uranium and duration of leaching. Calculation of irrigation parameters is based on the laws of infiltration hydrodynamics and correlations between the solvent, its concentration and wetting zone diameter. Analytical modeling of leaching efficiency was implemented in designing low-grade ores processing in a specific field. The distinctive feature of the project is in cascade location of the equipment for gravity movement of the material. The processes are arranged according to the principle of maximum reduction of process pumping, trails of technological pipelines and other utilities. The practice of dumping leaching tailings contributes to development of waste natural leaching with migration of liquid chemical components in crust layers and gas ones - into atmosphere, that decreases uranium teaching rates in a pile, reducing it to the level of work in progress with the complexity of possibilities of deep disposal. Conclusions. After leaching in a pile, uranium content in leaching tailings remains high enough to be considered as poor ore with radiation impact on the environment. A promising direction for wasteless recovery of metals from sub-standard materials is a combination of chemical processing and mechanical activation in leaching.

AB  - Rare earth element (REE, La-Lu) patterns in groundwater are the result of complex solid-water interactions and can therefore be applied as process indicators in this system. At a remediated basement area of a heap in a post-U-mining area (Ronneburg, Germany), REE patterns in near surface groundwater were studied for 10 years (2005-2014) along a groundwater flow path. The groundwater passed through Quaternary sand, silt, and again sand, resulting in increased element and ion concentrations (e.g., Al, Co, Mg, Mn, REE, SO42-) along the flow path, most of which decreased steadily over the 10 years. The decline in concentrations was more pronounced for observation points in the downstream area. It is likely that, during mining operations, elements were retained by sorption or buffering reactions in the silty/loamy material and have been gradually mobilized with fading subsequent delivery. The REE patterns in groundwater were enriched in middle (Sm-Dy) and heavy REE (Ho-Lu) and featured a positive Ce anomaly. The basic pattern (without Ce anomaly) in groundwater was attributed to mobilization from the Silurian black shale that had been dumped. This signature was also retained in the silty central part currently being leached, resulting in increasing concentrations of heavy REE along the flow path. Efflorescent salts at Gessenhalde indicated capillary rise because they reflected the major groundwater characteristics in the REE patterns. Moreover, especially in the downstream area, Mn oxide coatings occurred in the zone of capillary rise above the groundwater table. These Mn phases (birnessite and todorokite) preferentially accumulated Ce over other REE. Positive Ce anomalies in groundwater indicate at least partial dissolution of these Mn phases. Ferric phases like schwertmannite and goethite were found to slightly enrich light REE. However, based on this dataset, it was possible to relate specific features of the REE patterns to the input pattern of the heap and local geology as well as the formation/dissolution of secondary phases.

AB  - Noblesse multi-collector noble gas mass spectrometer is specially designed for multi-collection of Ar isotopes with different beam sizes, especially for small ion beams, precisely, and hence is perfectly suitable for Ar-40/Ar-39 geochronology. We have analyzed widely used sanidine, muscovite, and biotite standards with recommended ages of similar to 1.2-133Ma, with the aim to assess the reliability of Noblesse for Ar-40/Ar-39 dating. An ESI MIR10 30W CO2 laser was used for total fusion or incremental heating samples. Extracted gases were routinely purified by four SAES NP10 getters (one at similar to 400 degrees C and others at room temperature). A GP50 getter and a metal cold finger cooled by liquid N (-196 degrees C) were also attached for additional purification if necessary. The Ar isotopes were then measured by Noblesse using Faraday or multiplier according to the signal intensities. Over a period of 1.5months 337 air calibrations produced a weighted mean Ar-40/Ar-36 of 296.50 +/- 0.08 (2 sigma, MSWD=4.77). Fish Canyon sanidine is used to calculate J-values, which show good linear relationship with position in irradiation. The age of four mineral standards (Alder Creek sanidine, Brione muscovite, Yabachi sanidine, and Fangshan biotite) are within error of the accepted ages. Five Alder Creek sanidine aliquots yielded an age range of 1.174-1.181 +/- 0.013Ma (2 sigma) which broadly overlaps the established age of the standard and the uncertainty approaches those of the foremost Ar/Ar laboratories in the world. The weighted mean ages of four Brione muscovite aliquots (18.75 +/- 0.16Ma, 2 sigma), five Yabachi sanidine aliquots (29.50 +/- 0.19Ma, 2 sigma), and three Fangshan biotite aliquots (133.0 +/- 0.76Ma, 2 sigma) are consistent with the recommended values of these standards, and the uncertainties are typical of modern Ar/Ar laboratories world-wide.

AB  - Illegal gold mining and the resulting gold mine tailing ponds on Buru Island in Maluku, Indonesia have increased Mercury (Hg) levels in agricultural soil and caused massive environmental damage. High levels of Hg in soil lowers plant productivity and threatens the equilibrium of the food web. One possible method of handling Hg-contaminated soils is through bioremediation, which could eliminate Hg from the rhizosphere (root zone). In this study, indigenous fungi isolated from Hg-contaminated soil exhibited Hg-resistance in vitro. Soil samples were collected from the rhizosphere of pioneer plants which grew naturally in areas contaminated with gold mine tailing. The fungi's capacity for Hg-resistance was confirmed by their better growth in chloramphenicol-boosted potato dextrose agar media which contained various HgCl2 concentrations. Four isolates exhibited resistance of up to 25 mg kg(-1) of Hg, and in an experiment with young Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.) test plants, two fungi species (including Aspergillus) were demonstrated to increase the soil's availability of Hg. The results suggest that Hg-resistant indigenous fungi can mobilize mercury in the soil and serve as potential bioremediation agents for contaminated agricultural land.

AB  - Background: Hip fractures are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Hip fracture incidence varies across different levels of accessibility/remoteness and socioeconomic status (SES). As part of the Ageing, Chronic Disease and Injury Study, we aimed to map the pattern of hip fractures across the western region of the Australian state of Victoria, which contains a range of remoteness levels and SES. Methods: Data on hip fractures resulting in hospital admission were extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (VAED) for men and women aged 40+ years during 2010-2013 inclusive. An age-adjusted incidence rate (per 10,000 population/year) was calculated for the entire region. Crude incidence rates and length of acute care hospital stay (excluding rehabilitation) were calculated for each Local Government Area (LGA). The impact of aggregated age, accessibility/remoteness index of Australia (ARIA) and SES on hip fracture rates aggregated across LGAs was determined using Poisson regression. Results: For men, the age-standardised rate of hospitalisations for hip fracture across the whole region was 19.2 per 10,000 population/year (95%Cl 18.0-20.4) and for women, 40.0 (95%Cl 38.3-41.7). The highest incidence rates for both sexes occurred in the less accessible LGAs of Yarriambiack and Hindmarsh, as well as the LGA with the lowest SES, Central Goldfields. In both sexes, approximately two thirds of individuals were discharged from acute hospital care within 14 days. Increasing age, higher remoteness and lower SES were all associated with higher hip fracture rates. Conclusion: Crude incidence rates varied by location. Given that a high proportion of patients had acute hospital care of :514 days, and accessibility and SES were associated with hip fracture rates, these results can inform policy and provide a model for other groups to conduct similar research in their local environment.

AB  - The environmental cycling of mercury (Hg) can be affected by natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Of particular concern is how these disruptions increase mobilization of Hg from sites and alter the formation of monomethylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative form of Hg for humans and wildlife. The scientific community has made significant advances in recent years in understanding the processes contributing to the risk of MeHg in the environment. The objective of this paper is to synthesize the scientific understanding of how Hg cycling in the aquatic environment is influenced by landscape perturbations at the local scale, perturbations that include watershed loadings, deforestation, reservoir and wetland creation, rice production, urbanization, mining and industrial point source pollution, and remediation. We focus on the major challenges associated with each type of alteration, as well as management opportunities that could lessen both MeHg levels in biota and exposure to humans. For example, our understanding of approximate response times to changes in Hg inputs from various sources or landscape alterations could lead to policies that prioritize the avoidance of certain activities in the most vulnerable systems and sequestration of Hg in deep soil and sediment pools. The remediation of Hg pollution from historical mining and other industries is shifting towards in situ technologies that could be less disruptive and less costly than conventional approaches. Contemporary artisanal gold mining has well-documented impacts with respect to Hg; however, significant social and political challenges remain in implementing effective policies to minimize Hg use. Much remains to be learned as we strive towards the meaningful application of our understanding for stakeholders, including communities living near Hg-polluted sites, environmental policy makers, and scientists and engineers tasked with developing watershed management solutions. Site-specific assessments of MeHg exposure risk will require new methods to predict the impacts of anthropogenic perturbations and an understanding of the complexity of Hg cycling at the local scale.

TI  - Multi-pulse laser ranging method for pre-detection with high frequency resonance
AU  - Huang, M. S.

AU  - Liu, X. C.
T2  - Acta Physica Sinica
AB  - Based on the measurement principle of pulse time-of-flight, non-cooperative target ranging technology using a pulsed laser diode (LD) as a light source has received widespread attention in recent years. Using leading edge timing method to directly detect pulses, its measuring range is about a few tens of meters and only a cm-level single-shot accuracy could be reached due to the limitations of its pulse width and eye-safe laser power of the LD, which cannot meet the needs of most applications. Especially, in order to increase its receiver channel bandwidth from hundreds of MHz to even a few GHz to reduce its work error, its distance measurement accuracy and ranging distance are significantly degraded as its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases. When a target is out of its measuring range, the back diffused laser pulse signal with an SNR of much less than 1 will be too weak to be extracted even with digital correlation processing technology. In this paper, using a pre-detection with high frequency resonance and multi-pulse correlation processing, a new ranging method to solve long ranging targets with high precision is proposed for the first time. Through the pre-detection circuit with high frequency resonance, a pulsed photocurrent signal is amplified and filtered, and then converted into a bipolar attenuation oscillation signal. Thereafter, its SNR is further improved by a new pulse function constructed through multi-pulse correlation processing. The peak of the new pulse is constant and its zero crossing point is found to be the timing point to calculate the target distance. The method has a better SNR and a high timing accuracy. And the detected ranging distance can increase one thousand meters or more. Theoretical calculation results show that the minimum detectable peak current of light pulse is around 17 nA in the method. Comparing with the direct pulse detection method, its SNR can increase 60 times. When a received peak of a photocurrent pulse is within a dynamic range of 1 : 1 0000, its work error is less than 0.1 ps. A pulsed laser rangefinder is developed based on the principle. And its average laser emission power is about 1 mW. Its measurement ranging without cooperative target is greater than 2000 m. Its distance measurement accuracy increases up to +/-(3 mm + 2 ppm) in a range of 1.5-300 m. For a long ranging target, its distance measurement accuracy is +/-(10 mm + 10 ppm). The rangefinder system is used in a total station product and can be used to measure large-scale engineering structures (such as roads, bridges, dams, tunnels, subways, etc.), building structures and industrial sites.

AB  - Public awareness of tailings dam failures is increasing in the wake of incidents in Canada and abroad. The present work establishes the current state of practice in mine tailings dam monitoring and provides a summary of the current technical and operational gaps identified through industry and stakeholder engagement. These gaps may be addressed with currently available technologies supplied by commercial instrumentation manufacturers; however, the assumed costs and lack of regulatory demand may serve as barriers to adoption. An integrated approach and diverse suite of technologies is needed to address issues of dam stability, worker and public safety, and environmental protection. Technological applications and limitations are described and design requirements are proposed for an integrated, real-time monitoring system. Socio-economic impacts and loss reduction benefits are considered and the need for industry and regulator participation is emphasized.

TI  - METALLIFEROUS COALS OF AZEYSKOE DEPOSIT OF IRKUTSK COAL BASIN
AU  - Ilenok, S. S.
AU  - Arbuzov, S. I.
T2  - Bulletin of the Tomsk Polytechnic University-Geo Assets Engineering
AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to find new sources of valuable elements that determine the development of modern innovative economy. Coals and ashes of coals are considered as their perspective source. The study of geochemical characteristics of coal and modes of occurrence of chemical elements in coals and ashes of the coals is required for estimation of metal content in coal deposits and development of the criteria for detecting metalliferous coals and techniques for extraction of valuable elements. A promising source of valuable elements is Azeyskoe deposit, where the content of a number of valuable elements reaches possible industrially important ore concentrations. The main aim of the research is to study the geochemical characteristics and modes of occurrence of impurity elements in coals, coal ashes and noncoal intercalations in coal seams of Azeyskoe deposit. Objects of the research are coal and coal bearing rocks of Azeyskoe deposit of Irkutsk basin. Methods: instrumental neutron activation analysis, mass spectrometry method with inductively coupled plasma, x-ray phase analysis, scanning electron microscopy with x-ray spectral analysis, ashing with determination of ash content and humidity, extraction of bitumen and humic acids. Results. The authors have determined the enrichment of Azeiskoe deposit coals with a number of rare impurity elements (REE, Sc, Zr, Hf, Ta, Th). Pyroclastic material as a source of rare earth elements, thorium, tantalum, zirconium and hafnium, is very important in this enrichment. It was determined that the coals in oxidation zone are characterized by anomalously high concentrations of rare impurity elements (REE, Sc, Cr, Co, Au), bottom formation zones of coal seams are enriched with heavy rare earth elements, Sc, Co, Sb, Ta, Hf, Ba. Presence of native and intermetallic mineralization in coals is revealed. It is established that in low-sulfur coals (similar to 0,5 %) with a low content of sulfide sulfur native forms of elements-chalcophiles prevail. In total, more than 80 mineral forms of impurity elements, including monazite, bastnezite, zircon, baddeleylte, native and intermetallic compounds, etc., were found out.

AU  - Jahanbakhshzadeh, A.
AU  - Aubertin, M.

T2  - Canadian Geotechnical Journal
AB  - Backfill is commonly used world-wide in underground mines to improve ground stability and reduce solid waste disposal on the surface. Practical solutions are required to assess the stress state in the backfilled stopes, as the stress state is influenced by the fill settlement that produces a stress transfer to the adjacent rock walls. The majority of existing analytical and numerical solutions for the stresses in backfilled openings were developed for two-dimensional (plane strain) conditions. In reality, mine stopes have a limited extension in the horizontal plane so the stresses are influenced by the four walls. This paper presents recent three-dimensional (3D) simulations results and a new 3D closed-form solution for the vertical and horizontal stresses in inclined backfilled stopes with parallel walls. This solution takes into account the variation of the stresses along the opening width and height, for various inclination angles and fills properties. The numerical results are used to validate the analytical solution and illustrate how the stress state varies along the opening height, length, and width, for different opening sizes and inclination angles of the footwall and hanging wall. Experimental results are also used to assess the validity of the proposed solution.

AB  - Conventional passive air samplers (PAS) and passive dry deposition samplers (PAS-DD) were deployed along a 90 km south-north transect at five sites in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) during October to November 2015. The purpose was to compare and characterize the performance of the two passive sampling methods for targeted compounds across a range of site types. Samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), and oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs). Sigma PAC and Sigma NPAH concentrations were highest in PAS and PAS-DD samplers at site AMS5, which is the closest sampling site to surface mining and upgrading facilities. The OPAHs were elevated at site AMS6, which is located in the town of Fort McMurray, approximately 30 km south of the main mining area. PAS-DD was enriched relative to PAS in particle-associated target chemicals, which is consistent with the relatively more open design of PAS-DD intended to capture particle-phase (and gas-phase) deposition. Petroleum coke (petcoke) (i.e., the carbonaceous byproduct of bitumen upgrading) and oil sands ore (i.e., the material mined in open-pit mines from which bitumen is extracted) were assessed for their potential to be a source of PACs to air in the oil sands region. The ore samples contained similar to 8 times and similar to 40 times higher Sigma PACs concentrations (dry weight basis) than delayed and fluid petcoke, respectively. The residue analysis of ore and petcoke samples also revealed that the chemical 4-nitrobiphenyl (4-NBP) can be used to track gas-phase emissions to air. A comparison of chemical residues in ore, petcoke, and air samples revealed that the ore is likely a major contributor to volatile PACs present in air and that both ore and petcoke are contributing to the particle-associated PACs in air near open-pit mining areas. The contribution of petcoke particles in passive air samples was also confirmed qualitatively using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).

T2  - Applied Surface Science
AB  - High quality of graphene is necessary for its applications at industrial scale production. The most convenient way is its direct growth on dielectrics which avoid the transfer route of graphene from metal to dielectric substrate usually followed by graphene community. The choice of a suitable dielectric for the gate material which can replace silicon dioxide (SiO2) is in high demand. Various properties like permittivity, thermodynamic stability, film morphology, interface quality, bandgap and band alignment of other dielectrics with graphene needs more exploration. A potential dielectric material is required which could be used to grow graphene with all these qualities. Direct growth of graphene on magnesium oxide (MgO) substrates is an interesting idea and will be a new addition in the library of 2D materials. The present work is about the direct growth of graphene on MgO substrates by an ambient pressure chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. We address the surface instability issue of the polar oxides which is the most challenging factor in MgO. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed the topographical features of the graphene coated on MgO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study is carried out to extract information regarding the presence of necessary elements, their bonding with substrates and to confirm the sp-2 hybridization of carbon, which is a characteristic feature of graphene film. The chemical shift is due to the surface reconstruction of MgO in the prepared samples. For graphene-MgO interface, valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO) extracted from valence band spectra reported. Further, we predicted the energy band diagram for single layer and thin film of graphene. By using the room-temperature energy band gap values of MgO and graphene, the CBO is calculated to be 6.85 eV for single layer and 5.66 eV for few layer (1-3) of graphene layers.

T2  - Applied Geochemistry
AB  - Complex redox and pH microenvironments have developed on arsenic-rich (percent level As) mine wastes at two gold mine processing areas in southern New Zealand that were abandoned 70-80 years ago. Redox conditions range from surficial zones that are being actively oxidised, with formation of authigenic scorodite and Fe oxides, to zones of active chemical reduction around organic debris where authigenic As sulfides, mainly realgar, are actively forming. Authigenic realgar is forming in low-redox microenvironments in a high-sulfur setting with decomposing primary pyrite and arsenopyrite, and in low-sulfur pre-oxidised As-rich mine tailings. Realgar has formed in close proximity (micron scale) to authigenic and/or detrital arsenolite at one low-sulfur site, and in close proximity (cm scale) to authigenic scorodite at the sulfur-rich site. The latter site also has minor accumulations of authigenic gold, which is nanoparticulate and microparticulate and dispersed through a coating of Fe oxyhydroxide and biofilm on authigenic scorodite. Gold was probably mobilised by ephemeral metastable thiosulfate complexes during oxidation of primary auriferous sulfides, and redeposited as those complexes decomposed. Detrital gold has not been noticeably dissolved and redeposited in the low-sulfur mine wastes. The dynamic redox gradients that have developed on these mine wastes are distinctly different from those that form on most mine wastes elsewhere, where an oxidation front progressively penetrates into primary sulfide residues. The dynamic redox gradients can persist at these New Zealand sites until all the organic debris has decomposed, after which the more reduced components including authigenic realgar will become oxidised.

AB  - In this study, we reported the potential of various methanol fractions of onion (MFO) and its components quercetin and quercetin glucosides on platelet aggregation and antioxidant activity. The onion extracts were separated into several fractions using methanol and water. Further, these extracts were analyzed using simple high-performance liquid chromatographydiode array detector method to separate quercetin (Q), quercetin-4'-O- monoglucoside and quercetin-3, 4'-O-diglucoside from onion sample. It was observed that the bioactive compounds were accumulated in the non-polar portions rather than in the polar one. MFO and flavonol glucosides inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation, and the anti-aggregatory effects were comparatively studied using rat PRP (platelet-rich plasma). Among the extracted compounds, quercetin was found as a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation compared to quercetin glucosides, whereas quercetin glucosides showed high antioxidant activities. These results suggest that MFO, quercetin and quercetin glucosides have powerful antiplatelet and antioxidant activities. These studies provide possible information leading to the intake of onions rich in these flavonols as a dietary supplement and functional food ingredient to prevent thrombosis and cardiovascular and oxidative stress-related diseases and might be utilized as a real source of valuable phytochemicals for the pharmaceutical and food industries for the development of antioxidant, anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents.

T2  - Biogeochemistry
AB  - Warming may increase the extent and intensity of insect defoliations within Arctic ecosystems. A thorough understanding of the implications of this for litter decomposition is essential to make predictions of soil-atmosphere carbon (C) feedbacks. Soil nitrogen (N) and C cycles naturally are interlinked, but we lack a detailed understanding of how insect herbivores impact these cycles. In a laboratory microcosm study, we investigated the growth responses of heterotrophic soil fungi and bacteria as well as C and N mineralisation to simulated defoliator outbreaks (frass addition), long-term increased insect herbivory (litter addition at higher background N-level) and non-outbreak conditions (litter addition only) in soils from a Subarctic birch forest. Larger amounts of the added organic matter were mineralised in the outbreak simulations compared to a normal year; yet, the fungal and bacterial growth rates and biomass were not significantly different. In the simulation of long-term increased herbivory, less litter C was respired per unit mineralised N (C:N of mineralisation decreased to 20 +/- 1 from 38 +/- 3 for pure litter), which suggests a directed microbial mining for N-rich substrates. This was accompanied by higher fungal dominance relative to bacteria and lower total microbial biomass. In conclusion, while a higher fraction of foliar C will be respired by insects and microbes during outbreak years, predicted long-term increases in herbivory linked to climate change may facilitate soil C-accumulation, as less foliar C is respired per unit mineralised N. Further work elucidating animal-plant-soil interactions is needed to improve model predictions of C-sink capacity in high latitude forest ecosystems.

AU  - Kuhlberg, M.
AU  - Miller, S.
T2  - Canadian Historical Review
AB  - While there are many tales of mining companies polluting the Canadian communities in which they have operated, Sudbury's early history stands out. It is arguably the most extreme example of an industry dictating to government how the latter dealt with the local pollution problem - in this case, sulphur dioxide emissions. The capstone achievement was the creation of an extrajudicial solution to the problem that permanently suspended the legal rights of residents seeking redress for their grievances. Moreover, the Ontario government was duplicitous in this affair - namely, by zealously luring settlers to the region in an effort to develop farming there even though it was acutely aware of the local pollution problem. Finally, this story is truly tragic because the pollution need never have happened to the extent that it did. The provincial politicians knew full well that the means existed - within a short jaunt of Sudbury no less - to mitigate the problem, but the politicians refused to force the mining firms to adopt them. Retelling Sudbury's story thus highlights how the Ontario government's decision to grant the mining firms practical impunity to pollute the local environment - both human and non-human - was a matter of political choice.

AB  - Effluent from Europe's largest active gold mine is discharged to the adjacent River Seurujoki via natural treatment wetlands in Lapland Finland. Site waters, including two sources of mine effluent, treatment wetland surface water and Seurujoki river water were chemically and isotopically characterized. The results of isotopic characterization were evaluated to determine the effectiveness of selected environmental conservative isotopes (delta O-18, delta D, Sr-87/Sr-86) as tracers of water/solute source. Non-conservative isotopes (delta Li-7, delta Mg-26, delta Mg-25, delta S-34(SO4)) were evaluated as tracers of fractionation inducing processes that provide insight to contaminant attenuation and mobility mechanisms. The two sources of mine effluent were chemically distinct, and the impacts of mine effluent were persistent in downstream river water to at least 12.8 km. Sr isotope-based estimates of mine effluent discharge to the river were in good agreement with Cl concentration-based estimates, and suggest effluent comprised approximately 4% of river discharge in both June 2013 and June 2015. These instantaneous mixing results were applied in a multi-isotope approach to characterize non-conservative solute and isotopic behavior for Li and SO4. In 2015 Li-7 was enriched in downstream river water by approximately 3 parts per thousand with no discernible concentration change, suggesting ongoing in-stream ion exchange reactions with oxy-hydroxide precipitates. While SO4 was attenuated by over 50% in the downstream direction, the observed S-34(SO4) depletion indicates that bacterial sulfate reduction was not a driver of in-stream attenuation. Further, depletion of O-18 and deuterium in treatment wetland 4 indicated that fresh meteoric water comprised approximately 25% of the treatment wetland discharge in March 2015. The contemporaneous flushing of numerous contaminants (Na, Ca, Mg, SO4, Mn, and Li) from the wetland supports the conceptual model in which disruption of contaminant concentration gradients will lead to contaminant leaching from the wetlands.

AB  - A facile methodology for the large-scale production of layer-controlled MoS2 layers on an inexpensive substrate involving a simple coating of single source precursor with subsequent roll-to-roll-based thermal decomposition is developed. The resulting 50 cm long MoS2 layers synthesized on Ni foils possess excellent long-range uniformity and optimum stoichiometry. Moreover, this methodology is promising because it enables simple control of the number of MoS2 layers by simply adjusting the concentration of (NH4)(2)MoS4. Additionally, the capability of the MoS2 for practical applications in electronic/optoelectronic devices and catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction is verified. The MoS2-based field effect transistors exhibit unipolar n-channel transistor behavior with electron mobility of 0.6 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and an on-off ratio of approximate to 10(3). The MoS2-based visible-light photodetectors are fabricated in order to evaluate their photoelectrical properties, obtaining an 100% yield for active devices with significant photocurrents and extracted photoresponsivity of approximate to 22 mA W-1. Moreover, the MoS2 layers on Ni foils exhibit applicable catalytic activity with observed overpotential of approximate to 165 mV and a Tafel slope of 133 mV dec(-1). Based on these results, it is envisaged that the cost-effective methodology will trigger actual industrial applications, as well as novel research related to 2D semiconductor-based multifaceted applications.

TI  - Electron-Poor Polar Intermetallics: Complex Structures, Novel Clusters, and Intriguing Bonding with Pronounced Electron Delocalization
AU  - Lin, Q. S.
AU  - Miller, G. J.
T2  - Accounts of Chemical Research
AB  - Intermetallic compounds represent an extensive pool of candidates for energy related applications stemming from magnetic, electric, optic, caloric, and catalytic properties. The discovery of novel intermetallic compounds can enhance understanding of the chemical principles that govern structural stability and chemical bonding as well as finding new applications. Valence electron-poor polar intermetallics with valence electron concentrations (VECs) between 2.0 and 3.0 e-/atom show a plethora of unprecedented and fascinating structural motifs and bonding features. Therefore, establishing simple structure-bonding-property relationships is especially challenging for this compound class because commonly accepted valence electron counting rules are inappropriate. During our efforts to find quasicrystals and crystalline approximants by valence electron tuning near 2.0 e-/atom, we observed that compositions close to those of quasicrystals are exceptional sources for unprecedented valence electron-poor polar intermetallics, e.g., Ca4Au10In3 containing (Au10In3) wavy layers, Li14.7Mg36.8Cu21.Ga-5(66) adopting a type IV clathrate framework, and Sc4MgxCu15-xGa7.5 that is incommensurately modulated. In particular, exploratory syntheses of AAu(3)T (A = Ca, Sr, Ba and T = Ge, Sn) phases led to interesting bonding features for Au, such as columns, layers, and lonsdaleite-type tetrahedral frameworks. Overall, the breadth of Au-rich polar intermetallics originates, in part, from significant relativistics effect on the valence electrons of Au, effects which result in greater 6s/5d orbital mixing, a small effective metallic radius, and an enhanced Mulliken electronegativity, all leading to ultimate enhanced binding with nearly all metals including itself. Two other successful strategies to mine electron-poor polar intermetallics include lithiation and "cation-rich" phases. Along these lines, we have studied lithiated Zn-rich compounds in which structural complexity can be realized by small amounts of Li replacing Zn atoms in the parent binary compounds CaZn2, CaZn3, and CaZn5; their phase formation and bonding schemes can be rationalized by Fermi surface-Brillouin zone interactions between nearly free-electron states. "Cation-rich", electron-poor polar intermetallics have emerged using rare earth metals as the electropositive ("cationic") component together metal/metalloid clusters that mimic the backbones of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, which give evidence of extensive electronic delocalization and multicenter bonding. Thus, we can identify three distinct, valence electron-poor, polar intermetallic systems that have yielded unprecedented phases adopting novel structures containing complex clusters and intriguing bonding characteristics. In this Account, we summarize our recent specific progress in the developments of novel Au-rich BaAl4-type related structures, shown in the gold-rich grid, lithiation-modulated Ca-etallics containing unprecedented hydrocarbon-like planar Co-Ge metal clusters and pronounced delocalized multicenter bonding. We will focus mainly on novel structural motifs, bonding analyses, and the role of valence electrons for phase stability.

AB  - The Geza arc is an important part of the Yidun Island arc in Sanjiang tectonic-magmatic rock belt. It is located at the southern tip of the Yidun island arc belt. It is an important copper-lead-zinc polymetallic metallogenic belt and Indosinian porphyry copper belt in the western region of China. Pulang porphyry copper deposit is a typical representative of the Indosinian porphyry copper deposits. Based on the previous studies, the big data analysis technique was used to make a contrastive study of the ore-forming related granite in Pulang porphyry copper deposit and the global adakite. As a result, 506 element combinations and 127765 overlap ratios were obtained. The result shows that the geochemical data of the Pulang porphyry are basically overlapped with the global adakite, and have similar characteristics with the global adakite. However, the Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn metallogenic elements are significantly higher than those of the global adakite, and although the ratios of REE and Ga to the major element are in the range of the global adakite, they show the phenomenon of an end member in the global adakite. In addition, the adakite associated with porphyry copper deposits are distributed partially in the global adakite, and some or most of the data are out of the distribution range of the global adakite, and with characteristics of low Sr/Cu, Ta/Cu, Al/Mo, Mn/Zn, Mn/Cu, Mn/Mo and Hf, K, Ti, P, Co, Th, Ca/Cu. The farther the data points deviate from the global adakite range, the stronger the alteration and mineralization are, and the closer the relationship with copper and molybdenum mineralization is. The geochemical data mining results can be used as a prospecting indicator, which can provide a new scientific basis for the geological prospecting of the deep and periphery of the Pulang copper deposit.

AB  - Objectives In this work, we use Sr isotopes to analyze human hair and determine short-term movements of a contemporary human traveler and of early-modern individuals from an archaeological site (Roccapelago, Modena, Italy, 16th-18th century). Materials and methodsResultsAnalyses were performed using a Neptune MC-ICP-MS. We first set up and tested the procedure on scalp hair of a contemporary human, who spent some time between Brazil and Italy. We then analyzed the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of eight exceptionally well-preserved archaeological hair specimens associated with human mummies from Roccapelago. Trace elements were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS on single-hair specimens to check the preservation of the archaeological samples. The strontium isotope composition of modern human hair varies from 0.7087 to 0.7093. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the Roccapelago hair strands range from 0.7082 to 0.7137, with an average of 0.70930.0031 (2 sigma), revealing also intra-individual differences in isotopic composition along the length of the hair shaft. Data were compared with local archaeological rodent bones and teeth and with published isotopic values of water and outcropping rocks. Trace element abundances of archaeological and modern human hair are similarly low in terms of Rare Earth Element (REE) and metal contents, in particular after HNO3 leaching. DiscussionThe variable modern human hair Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios show that high-resolution hair sampling tracks the movements of this individual between the two continents. The Sr isotope composition of the mummy hair is consistent with sub-annual human movements from Roccapelago to an area with different Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. Historical sources indicate that individuals from Roccapelago travelled with their herds to Tuscany for transhumance pastoralism practices. The high radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (>0.71) found in some of the hair are possibly consistent with the Tuscan Magmatic Province and the Tuscan Metamorphic Complex isotope signature. To our knowledge, this is the first study in an archaeological context where the Sr isotope evidence of mobility is corroborated by historical documents.

AB  - Background: Gastroschisis is a congenital anomaly of the fetal abdominal wall, usually to the right side of umbilical insertion. It is often detected by routine antenatal ultrasound. Significant maternal and pediatric resources are utilised in the care of women and infants with gastroschisis. Increasing rates of gastroschisis worldwide have led institutions to review local data and investigate outcomes. A collaborative project was developed to review local epidemiology and investigate antenatal and neonatal factors influencing hospital length of stay (LOS) and total parental nutrition (TPN) in infants born with gastroschisis. Methods: We performed a five-year review of infants born with gastroschisis (2011-2015) at a major Australian centre. Complex gastroschisis was defined as involvement of stenosis, atresia, ischemia, volvulus or perforation and closed or vanishing gastroschisis. We extracted data from files and databases at the two participating hospitals, a major maternal fetal medicine centre and the affiliated children's hospital. Results: There were 56 infants antenatally diagnosed with gastroschisis with no terminations, one stillbirth (2%) and one infant with 'vanishing' gastroschisis. The mean maternal age was 23.9 years (range, 15-39 years). The mean gestation at delivery was 36 weeks (range, 25-39(+3) weeks). Of the 55 neonates who received surgical management, 62% had primary closure. The median LOS was 33 (IQR, 23-45) days and the median duration of TPN was 26 (IQR, 17-36) days. Longer days on TPN (median 35 vs 16 days, P = 0.03) was associated with antenatal finding of multiple dilated bowel loops. Postnatal diagnosis of complex gastroschisis was made in 16% of cases and was associated with both longer LOS (median 89 vs 30 days, P = 0.003) and days on TPN (median 46 vs 21 days, P = 0.009). Conclusion: Complex gastroschisis was associated with greater days on TPN and LOS. We found no late-gestation stillbirths and a low overall rate of 1.8%, suggesting the risk for stillbirth associated with gastroschisis is lower than previously documented. This information may assist counselling families. Improved data collection worldwide may reveal causative factors and enable antenatal outcome predictors.

T2  - Biotechnology for Biofuels
AB  - BackgroundAcetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) is a complex hemicellulose found in softwoods such as Norway spruce (Picea abies). AcGGM has a large potential as a biorefinery feedstock and source of oligosaccharides for high-value industrial applications. Steam explosion is an effective method for extraction of carbohydrates from plant biomass. Increasing the reaction pH reduces the combined severity of treatment, affecting yields and properties of extracted oligosaccharides. In this study, steam explosion was used to extract oligosaccharides from Norway spruce wood chips soaked with sodium citrate and potassium phosphate buffers with pH of 4.0-7.0. Yields, monosaccharide composition of released oligosaccharides and biomass residue, their acetate content and composition of their lignin fraction were examined to determine the impact of steam explosion buffering on the extraction of softwood hemicellulose.ResultsReducing the severity of steam explosion resulted in lower yields, although the extracted oligosaccharides had a higher degree of polymerization. Higher buffering pH also resulted in a higher fraction of xylan in the extracted oligos. Oligosaccharides extracted in buffers of pH>5.0 were deacetylated. Buffering leads to a removal of acetylations from both the extracted oligosaccharides and the hemicellulose in the residual biomass. Treatment of the residual biomass with a GH5 family mannanase from Aspergillus nidulans was not able to improve the AcGGM yields. No hydroxymethylfurfural formation, a decomposition product from hexoses, was observed in samples soaked with buffers at pH higher than 4.0.ConclusionsBuffering the steam explosion reactions proved to be an effective way to reduce the combined severity () and produce a wide range of products from the same feedstock at the same physical conditions. The results highlight the impact of chemical autohydrolysis of hemicellulose by acetic acid released from the biomass in hydrothermal pretreatments. Lower combined severity results in products with a lower degree of acetylation of both the extracted oligosaccharides and residual biomass. Decrease in severity appears not to be the result of reduced acetate release, but rather a result of inhibited autohydrolysis by the released acetate. Based on the results presented, the optimal soaking pH for fine-tuning properties of extracted AcGGM is below 5.0.

TI  - A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE INDIAN MINING REGULATIONS IN COMPARISON TO SASKATCHEWAN MINING LAW WHERE THE FIRST NATIONS HOLDS MINERAL TITLE
AU  - Mills, P. D.
T2  - Alberta Law Review
AB  - The Indian Mining Regulations were adopted in 1954, revised in 1961, and amended in 1968 and 1978 as a means to promote mineral resource development on First Nation reserves, where First Nations hold title to the mineral resource. In this article, the Indian Mining Regulations, as part of a suite of regulations associated with the Indian Act, are outlined in relationship to Saskatchewan mining law. First is a general survey of First Nations' mineral titles across Canada where the Indian Mining Regulations apply. This article then discusses the application of these Regulations; compliance with provincial law; the disposition of minerals; permits; leases; and, finally, the assignment of royalties. It is recommended that a critical review of mineral resource potentials, exploration, mine permitting, and standards for environmental monitoring and reclamation be established prior to any assignment of the existing Indian Mining Regulations against any mineral resource development that occurs on First Nation lands or reserves.

AB  - Mine tailings and wastewater generate man-made environments with several selective pressures, including the presence of heavy metals, arsenic and high cyanide concentrations, but severe nutritional limitations. Some oligotrophic and pioneer bacteria can colonise and grow in mine wastes containing a low concentration of organic matter and combined nitrogen sources. In this study, Pseudomonas mendocina P6115 was isolated from mine tailings in Durango, Mexico, and identified through a phylogenetic approach of 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD genes. Cell growth, cyanide consumption, and ammonia production kinetics in a medium with cyanide as sole nitrogen source showed that at the beginning, the strain grew assimilating cyanide, when cyanide was removed, ammonium was produced and accumulated in the culture medium. However, no clear stoichiometric relationship between both nitrogen sources was observed. Also, cyanide complexes were assimilated as nitrogen sources. Other phenotypic tasks that contribute to the strain's adaptation to a mine tailing environment included siderophores production in media with moderate amounts of heavy metals, arsenite and arsenate tolerance, and the capacity of oxidizing arsenite. P. mendocina P6115 harbours cioA/cioB and aoxB genes encoding for a cyanide-insensitive oxidase and an arsenite oxidase, respectively. This is the first report where P. mendocina is described as a cyanotrophic and arsenic oxidizing species. Genotypic and phenotypic tasks of P. mendocina P6115 autochthonous from mine wastes are potentially relevant for biological treatment of residues contaminated with cyanide and arsenic.

AB  - The Amami Plateau, Daito Ridge, and Oki-Daito Ridge of the northwestern Philippine Sea Plate are remnants of Mesozoic island arcs. We have newly recovered samples of peridotite and peridotite-derived minerals from the Daito Ridge. The peridotite samples are composed of serpentinized/ altered olivines, orthopyroxene porphyroclasts, small clinopyroxenes, and spinels, indicating a harzburgitic origin. Chondrite-and primitive mantle-normalized trace-element patterns for clinopyroxenes are characterized by a steep positive slope from middle rare earth elements to heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) plus yttrium. The light rare earth elements (LREEs) and Sr and Zr contents of clinopyroxenes vary in abundance, and some crystals have high LREE/HREE ratios coupled with positive Sr and Zr anomalies. These petrological and geochemical characteristics are not consistent with the Daito peridotites being the residue of a single partial melting event including melt extraction expected for mid-ocean ridge mantle. Instead, the peridotite source must have been enriched with slab-derived components, which are associated with arc-related magma. Thus, it is concluded that the studied peridotite fragments belong to an exhumed mantle section of a remnant proto-Philippine Sea island arc.

AB  - Speciated mercury gridded emissions inventories together with chemical transport models and concentration measurements are essential when investigating both the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the mercury cycle in the environment. Since different mercury species have contrasting behaviour in the atmosphere, their proportion in anthropogenic emissions could determine the spatial impacts. In this study, the time series from 1970 to 2012 of the EDGARv4.tox2 global mercury emissions inventory are described; the total global mercury emission in 2010 is 1772 tonnes. Global grid-maps with geospatial distribution of mercury emissions at a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolution are provided for each year. Compared to the previous tox1 version, tox2 provides updates for more recent years and improved emissions in particular for agricultural waste burning, power generation and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors. We have also developed three retrospective emissions scenarios based on different hypotheses related to the proportion of mercury species in the total mercury emissions for each activity sector; improvements in emissions speciation are seen when using information primarily from field measurements. We evaluated them using the GEOS-Chem 3-D mercury model in order to explore the influence of speciation shifts, to reactive mercury forms in particular, on regional wet deposition patterns. The reference scenario S1 (EDGARv4.tox2 S1) uses speciation factors from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP); scenario S2 ("EPA_power") uses factors from EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR); and scenario S3 ("Asia_filedM") factors from recent scientific publications. In the reference scenario, the sum of reactive mercury emissions (Hg-P and Hg2+) accounted for 25.3% of the total global emissions; the regions/countries that have shares of reactive mercury emissions higher than 6% in total global reactive mercury are China + (30.9%), India + (12.5%) and the United States (9.9%). In 2010, the variations of reactive mercury emissions amongst the different scenarios are in the range of -19.3 t/yr (China +) to 4.4 t/yr (OECD_Europe). However, at the sector level, the variation could be different, e.g., for the iron and steel industry in China reaches 15.4 t/yr. Model evaluation at the global level shows a variation of approximately +/- 10% in wet deposition for the three emissions scenarios. An evaluation of the impact of mercury speciation within nested grid sensitivity simulations is performed for the United States and modelled wet deposition fluxes are compared with measurements. These studies show that using the S2 and S3 emissions of reactive mercury, can improve wet deposition estimates near sources.

AB  - Plants possess a complex network of mechanisms to utilize and, if necessary, detoxify metals. Plants utilize constitutive basal tolerance mechanisms to maintain appropriate internal metal levels under normal conditions. However, adaptive hyper-tolerance mechanisms are used in order to tolerate excess metal exposure. The production of metal binding chelators could be one way to convey these tolerances. Chelator production of field and greenhouse-derived materials was investigated to determine any multi-metal hyper-tolerances in different populations of the grass Deschampsia cespitosa (L) Beauv. Plant tissue was collected from metal-contaminated mine sites, and from specimens grown in metal exposure hydroponic experiments. The chelator metabolites fro m these samples were simultaneously analyzed using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. In the hydroponic grown grass, histidine was produced at high concentrations solely in the hyper-tolerant populations during metal exposure. In all of the populations, the responses of chelators were metal-specific, where levels of nicotianamine were at high concentrations during Ni exposure, and levels of phytochelatins were high during Cu exposure. Moreover, a similar pattern of chelator production was seen in the root specimens collected from mine sites contaminated with Ni and (or) Cu. Histidine was the strongest Ni chelator involved in adaptive hyper-tolerance, while constitutive basal tolerance to Ni and Cu was observed via the responses of nicotianamine and phytochelatin, respectively.

AB  - Mining agreements with potentially significant revenues for Aboriginal communities in Canada and Australia have recently proliferated. Case studies have documented the impact of revenues from such agreements, but broader theoretical work and systematic analysis of variables determining positive outcomes - which could support informed choices about the use and management of mineral revenues - have been lacking. Using existing research on Indigenous peoples and customary landowners in Australia and Papua New Guinea, this article formulates some initial theoretical insights; identifies key variables that are likely to shape the outcomes of revenue management; and highlights fruitful areas for future research.

AB  - We review recent progress in our understanding of the global cycling of mercury (Hg), including best estimates of Hg concentrations and pool sizes in major environmental compartments and exchange processes within and between these reservoirs. Recent advances include the availability of new global datasets covering areas of the world where environmental Hg data were previously lacking; integration of these data into global and regional models is continually improving estimates of global Hg cycling. New analytical techniques, such as Hg stable isotope characterization, provide novel constraints of sources and transformation processes. The major global Hg reservoirs that are, and continue to be, affected by anthropogenic activities include the atmosphere (4.4-5.3 Gt), terrestrial environments (particularly soils: 250-1000 Gg), and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., oceans: 270-450 Gg). Declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions between 1990 and 2010 have led to declines in atmospheric Hg-0 concentrations and Hg-II wet deposition in Europe and the US (-1.5 to -2.2% per year). Smaller atmospheric Hg-0 declines (-0.2% per year) have been reported in high northern latitudes, but not in the southern hemisphere, while increasing atmospheric Hg loads are still reported in East Asia. New observations and updated models now suggest high concentrations of oxidized Hg-II in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere where deep convection can scavenge these Hg-II reservoirs. As a result, up to 50% of total global wet Hg-II deposition has been predicted to occur to tropical oceans. Ocean Hg-0 evasion is a large source of present-day atmospheric Hg (approximately 2900 Mg/year; range 1900-4200 Mg/year). Enhanced seawater Hg-0 levels suggest enhanced Hg-0 ocean evasion in the intertropical convergence zone, which may be linked to high Hg-II deposition. Estimates of gaseous Hg-0 emissions to the atmosphere over land, long considered a critical Hg source, have been revised downward, and most terrestrial environments now are considered net sinks of atmospheric Hg due to substantial Hg uptake by plants. Litterfall deposition by plants is now estimated at 1020-1230 Mg/year globally. Stable isotope analysis and direct flux measurements provide evidence that in many ecosystems Hg-0 deposition via plant inputs dominates, accounting for 57-94% of Hg in soils. Of global aquatic Hg releases, around 50% are estimated to occur in China and India, where Hg drains into the West Pacific and North Indian Oceans. A first inventory of global freshwater Hg suggests that inland freshwater Hg releases may be dominated by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM; approximately 880 Mg/year), industrial and wastewater releases (220 Mg/year), and terrestrial mobilization (170-300 Mg/year). For pelagic ocean regions, the dominant source of Hg is atmospheric deposition; an exception is the Arctic Ocean, where riverine and coastal erosion is likely the dominant source. Ocean water Hg concentrations in the North Atlantic appear to have declined during the last several decades but have increased since the mid-1980s in the Pacific due to enhanced atmospheric deposition from the Asian continent. Finally, we provide examples of ongoing and anticipated changes in Hg cycling due to emission, climate, and land use changes. It is anticipated that future emissions changes will be strongly dependent on ASGM, as well as energy use scenarios and technology requirements implemented under the Minamata Convention. We predict that land use and climate change impacts on Hg cycling will be large and inherently linked to changes in ecosystem function and global atmospheric and ocean circulations. Our ability to predict multiple and simultaneous changes in future Hg global cycling and human exposure is rapidly developing but requires further enhancement.

TI  - PROBLEMS OF OPERATION OF ELECTRIC PUMPING SECTIONAL TYPE UNITS ON KIMBERLITE MINES OF ALROSA AND THE WAYS OF THEIR SOLUTION
AU  - Ovchinnikov, N. P.
T2  - Bulletin of the Tomsk Polytechnic University-Geo Assets Engineering
AB  - The relevance. Russian Federation is one of the world's leaders in diamond industry. Today, the predominant part (about 95 %) of all Russian diamonds is mined on ore (kimberlite) and alluvial deposits, which are located on the territory of Yakutia. Practice shows that underground mining of kimberlite fields in Western Yakutia is associated with the abundant water flow to mine workings. Without application of sufficient number of pumping equipment, water penetrating to mine workings makes diamond extraction more difficult and unsafe for people. Today, for dealing with mine water inflows the electric pump sectional type unit are used on kimberlite mines. As mine drainage is an essential process in diamond extraction, improving the reliability of the related equipment is the relavant scientific and practical task. Objects: electric pumping sectional type units of kimberlite mines Mir, Udachny, Internatsionalny and "Aykhal". The main aim of the research is to study the influence of different production factors, mainly hydrogeological conditions, on durability of pumping equipment of kimberlite mines drainage systems of "ALROSA" ISC. Methods. To achieve this aim the author has used a comprehensive approach including: analysis of the physico-chemical composition of mine waters, analysis of significant practical material by these pumping equipment work and previously published articles on the subject of research, experimental researches of kimberlite mines electric pump units of "ALROSA" ISC. Results. According to the results of the researches, the author proposed the recommendations for improving reliability of a pumping equipment of kimberlite mines drainage units, which are administered by "ALROSA" ISC.

AB  - The initial conditions for the development of a large peatland complex in the St Lawrence Lowlands were reconstructed to increase the understanding of early development and expansion modes in this region. Peatland basin morphometry was identified by creating a model based on over 1500 existing peat depth measurements, and six cores were extracted along transects from a central (deepest) location towards the margins. C accumulation rates and ecohydrological conditions were reconstructed from plant macrofossils, testate amoeba assemblages and C-14 chronologies. Luminescence dating was performed to better delineate the timing of dune stabilization in the area and potentially related climate changes. Shallow freshwater plant communities acted as nuclei for the development of a rich minerotrophic fen around 10300cal. a BP in the deepest part of a shallow depression at the surface of the St-Maurice river delta. Peat inception was followed by the paludification of peripheral parabolic dune systems. Luminescence dating suggested dune stabilization between 11500 and 10900years ago. The initial rich fen persisted until 9500cal. a BP, and was replaced by a poor fen dominated by sedges as a result of a decrease in mineral nutrient influx from upland runoff. The shift to ombrotrophic conditions in the oldest section of Lac-a-la-Tortue peatland started around 5150cal. a BP. This major ecohydrological change coincides with those observed in several other peatlands in southern Quebec. Variations in carbon and peat accumulation rates in both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic sectors appear to have been primarily controlled by hydroseral succession, peat-forming vegetation, hydrological conditions, topography and fire activity. This study is the first to provide a quantification of the total carbon pool of a peatland complex in southern Quebec at 6.39 Mt C, corresponding to a mean C mass per area of 96.9kgCm(-2) (sigma=50.60kgCm(-2)).

AB  - Nollmotzite (IMA2017-100), Mg[U-V((UO2)-O-VI)(2)F3O4](H2O)(4), is a new uranium oxide fluoride mineral found in the Clara mine, Black Forest Mountains, Germany. Electron microprobe analysis provided the empirical formula (Mg1.06CU0.02)(Sigma 1.08)[U-V((UO2)-O-VI)(2)O-3.85 F-3.15][(H2O)(3.69)(OH)(0.31)](Sigma 4.00) based on three U and 15 O + F atoms per formula unit. Nollmotzite is monoclinic, space group Cm, with a = 7.1015 (12) angstrom, b = 11.7489 (17) angstrom, c = 8.1954 (14) angstrom, beta = 98.087 (14)degrees, V = 676.98 (19) angstrom(3) and Z = 2. The crystal structure [twinned by reticular merohedry; refined to R = 0.0369 with GoF = 1.09 for 1527 unique observed reflections, I > 3 sigma (I)] is based upon [U-V((UO2)-O-V-O-I)(2)F3O4](2- )sheets of, beta - U3O8 topology and contains an interlayer with MgF2(H2O)(4) octahedra. Adjacent sheets are linked through F-Mg-F bonds, as well as via hydrogen bonds. The presence of fluorine and pentavalent uranium in the structure of nollmotzite has potentially important implications for the safe disposal of nuclear waste.

AB  - The Indonesian Archipelago extends over 5000 km of latitude, from 95 degrees E to 141 degrees E, and hosts some of the world's largest active metal mines. While some fascinating ethnographic and historical sources exist, virtually nothing is known of the country's prehistoric metallurgical traditions. Given Indonesia's scale, this situation cannot be remedied in short order, but with this paper we seek to elucidate some metal production and consumption behaviours on Bali, located around 115 degrees E, during the last centuries of the first millennium bc and the early to middle first millennium ad. The studied early Metal Age assemblage of 27 copper-base artefacts from the sites of Pacung, Sembiran, Bangkah, Pangkung Paruk, Gilimanuk and Manikliyu includes bangle, bowl, drum, hook, mirror and ornamental typologies, and fragments thereof. Fourteen of the 27 samples were suffering from corrosion, but a strong tendency towards leaded copper alloys (21 of 27) can be distinguished, with some bronzes, a high-tin bronze and a leaded high-tin bronze. The high proportion of leaded artefacts mean that lead isotope data cannot be used to identify possible sources of copper, but there is good consistency with Mainland South-East Asian Iron Age leaded alloy signatures for the bulk of the assemblage, possibly indicating the existence of long-range (similar to 2000-3000 km one way) exchange systems at the outset of the Island South-East Asian Metal Age, and perhaps as far as China and India in the case of the mirror and bowl, respectively. Of particular note, the Manikliyu 'Pejeng' drum, a stylistically idiosyncratic type known from Bali and Java, and for which there is local production evidence, transpired to be consistent in terms of elemental composition and lead signature with Mainland 'Dong Son' drums. This could suggest that Pejeng drums were produced not just from metal imported from the Mainland but with melted down Mainland drums; an intriguing case of local reinterpretation of foreign elite material culture and iconography.

TI  - WATER INFLOW INTO MINE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT COAL DEPOSIT EXPLOITATION (KUZBASS)
AU  - Purgina, D. V.
AU  - Kuzevanov, K. I.
T2  - Bulletin of the Tomsk Polytechnic University-Geo Assets Engineering
AB  - Relevance. Safety and efficiency of coal deposit development depends directly on natural hydrogeological conditions and their changes under the influence of mining deposits in various ways. Particularly significant and sudden complications can arise with high water cut of rocks, a sharp change in their filtration properties under the influence of mining operations or changes in supply of aquifer complexes. Multidirectional factors of water inflow of coal deposits determine the need to identify and analyze the leading factors in formation of water inflows into underground mines. The aim of the study is to analyze natural factors effecting the change in the magnitude of water inflows in mining solid minerals by the underground method using the example of coal mines in the central part of Kuzbass; study the hydrogeological conditions of coal deposits, using a similar method; identify regularities and group the leading factors in formation of water inflows into underground mining. Methodology. To study the magnitude of possible meteorological changes, the material was provided by specialized electronic databases, both monthly averages and urgent observations of air temperature and the amount of atmospheric precipitation. Information array processed by the weather station in Kedrovka (Kemerovo) for 1955 to 2015 was obtained from the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information - World Data Center (VNIIGMI-WDC), literature sources and stock materials. The materials provided by the "Zarechnaya" LLC "Georesurs" Ltd., as well as the data on water inflows in Alexeyevskaya mine and 7 Noyabrya mine were used as the initial data on water inflows and filtration properties of rocks for monitoring geological environment on the fields. Processing meteorological parameters to identify their patterns is based on the use of statistical methods of data processing. The results are visualized using Microsoft Word, Exel, Surfer, AutoCad. Results. The authors have revealed the factors that have the greatest influence on formation of water inflow into the mine workings, and carried out the analysis of the change in climatic characteristics by the temporary statistical methods on randomness and presence of a trend using the Pitmen criterion and the inversion criterion, respectively. Based on the results of the research, a conceptual model of formation of water inflows into mining is constructed.

AB  - Algae has been known as one of the potential marine bio-resources that have been used in many fields such as bio-energy, food, pharmaceutical and medical applications. Study of macro-algae or seaweed for medicine application, in particular, highlights to empower their ingredients as a promising antioxidant like anti-aging agent due to their diversity in biological activity. The tropical climate of Indonesia with the highest marine biodiversity puts this country an auspicious source of numerous alga species as a novel antioxidant source. A Sample of 29 species of macroalgae has been collected from Coast of Pari Island as a part of Seribu Islands, Indonesia. Screening and extracting of aqueous tropical marine alga protein as a potential source for an antioxidant agent has been done by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging method, and protein contents have been determined by Lowry method. Sample number 26 of the phylum Rhodophyta have 9.00 +/- 0.03 % protein content, which is potential for nutritional food in form of nutraceutical. That sample demonstrated the maximum DPPH scavenging activity 79.27 +/- 1.81 %. Moreover, crude extract from another species from phylum Rhodophyta had the very lower IC50 (3.4333 +/- 0.29 mg/ml) followed by Chlorophyta species (7.1069 +/- 1.78 mg/ml). In general, this study found that algae from phylum Rhodophyta possess a high content of protein, high activity towards free radical. Nevertheless, algae acquire the lowest IC50 value not only dominated by Rhodophyta but also from phylum Chlorophyta. The conclusion of this study leads to empowering high antioxidant activity algae as an anti-aging agent, which can be used in pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, the next study should be concerned on the properties of the algae which has been known to be suitable for pharmaceutical fields.

AB  - Two speciated and spatially resolved emissions databases for polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) were developed. The first database was derived from volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions data provided by the Cumulative Environmental Management Association (CEMA) and the second database was derived from additional data collected within the Joint Canada-Alberta Oil Sands Monitoring (JOSM) program. CALPUFF modelling results for atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylated PAHs, and dibenzothiophenes (DBTs), obtained using each of the emissions databases, are presented and compared with measurements from a passive air monitoring network. The JOSM-derived emissions resulted in better model-measurement agreement in the total PAH concentrations and for most PAH species concentrations compared to results using CEMA-derived emissions. At local sites near oil sands mines, the percent error of the model compared to observations decreased from 30% using the CEMA-derived emissions to 17% using the JOSM-derived emissions. The improvement at local sites was likely attributed to the inclusion of updated tailings pond emissions estimated from JOSM activities. In either the CEMA-derived or JOSM-derived emissions scenario, the model underestimated PAH concentrations by a factor of 3 at remote locations. Potential reasons for the disagreement include forest fire emissions, re-emissions of previously deposited PAHs, and long-range transport not considered in the model. Alkylated PAH and DBT concentrations were also significantly underestimated. The CALPUFF model is expected to predict higher concentrations because of the limited chemistry and deposition modelling. Thus the model underestimation of PACs is likely due to gaps in the emissions database for these compounds and uncertainties in the methodology for estimating the emissions. Future work is required that focuses on improving the PAC emissions estimation and speciation methodologies and reducing the uncertainties in VOC emissions which are subsequently used in PAC emissions estimation.

TI  - Julius Kaljuvee, Ivan Reinwald, and Estonian pioneering ideas on meteorite impacts and cosmic neocatastrophism in the early 20th century
AU  - Racki, G.
AU  - Viik, T.
AU  - Puura, V.
T2  - Bsgf-Earth Sciences Bulletin
AB  - The article comprehensively presents little known Estonian contribution to the recognition of first meteorite impact structures in Europe, related to works of Julius Kaljuvee (Kalkun; 1869-1940) and Ivan Reinwald (Reinwaldt; 1878-1941). As an active educator specialized in geoscience, Kaljuvee was the first to hypothesize in 1922 that Kaali lake cirque in Saaremaa Island, Estonia, was created by meteorite impact. Thanks to mining engineer Reinwald, this assumption was accepted since 1928 due to the exhaustive field and borehole works of the latter (also as a result of exploration by several German scholars, including renowned Alfred Wegener). The impact origin of Kaali structure was proved finally in 1937 by finding of meteoritic iron splinters (as the first European site). Reinwald was not only outstanding investigator of meteorite cratering process, but also successful propagator of the Estonian discoveries in Anglophone mainstream science in 1930s. In addition, in his 1933 book, Kaljuvee first highlighted an impact explanation of enigmatic Ries structure in Bavaria, as well as probable magmatic activation in distant regions due to "the impulse of a giant meteorite". He also outlined ideas of the inevitable periodic cosmic collisions in geological past ("rare event" theory nowadays), and resulting biotic crises. In a general conceptual context, the ideas of Kaljuvee were in noteworthy direct or indirect link with concepts of the great French naturalists - Laplace, Cuvier and Elie de Beaumont. However, some other Kaljuvee's notions, albeit recurrent also later in geoscientific literature, are queer at the present time (e.g., the large-body impact as a driving force of continental drift and change the Earth axis, resulting in the Pleistocene glaciation). Thus, the Kaljuvee thought-provocative but premature dissertation is rather a record of distinguishing erudite activity, but not a real neocatastrophic landmark in geosciences history. Nevertheless, several concepts of Kaljuvee were revived as the key elements in the current geological paradigm.

AU  - Reinert, H.
T2  - Acme-an International E-Journal for Critical Geographies
AB  - The article explores a set of sacrificial logics that cluster around a prospective copper mine, situated on the bank of a fjord in the Norwegian Arctic. Analyzing the project as a "sacrifice zone" in the making, the argument first draws out some of the ways in which sacrifice is being used to conceptualize, compel, critique and justify a still-future resource extraction project. From there, it moves to discuss sacrificial logics that are at work, more covertly, in the language of planning decisions and reports. Finally, it uses the concept of sacrifice to decipher a curious public exchange between the mayor of the municipality and the director of the mining company-an exchange that reveals concealed dynamics when considered through the oscillation between "payment" and "gift", with "sacrifice" as an obviated third term. In closing, the essay presents some general observations on the relationship between capitalism and sacrificial destruction.

AB  - The efficacy of oil sands water capped tailings technology is currently being assessed in the first pilot pit lake in the Athabasca Oil Sands region (AOSR). Base Mine Lake (BML, Syncrude Canada Mildred Lake mine, Fort McMurray AB Canada) was commissioned in December of 2012 and consists of circa 40m depth of fluid fine tailings (FFT) overlain by circa 10m of a freshwater cap. As this is the first oil sands pit lake, it is unknown to what extent known oxygen consuming constituents (OCC) such as methane, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia will mobilize from the underlying FFT layer in BML and impact oxygen concentrations within the water cap. Thus, the field objectives here were to characterize the physico-chemistry and geochemistry of the BML water cap from the FFT water interface (FWI) to the surface over two summers (2015 and 2016). Results identify that the similar to 10m water cap thermally stratifies and that oxygen persists, albeit at low levels (i.e. <5% saturation) to the FWI during the summer season for both years. Consistent with the FFT acting as an OCC source, aqueous CH4, Sigma H2S and NH4+ concentrations were highest closer to the FWI, decreasing upwards into the water cap. As O-2 persists to the FWI, Sigma H2S was rapidly removed within this region, with little mobilized to the overlying water as evidenced by nondetectable Sigma H2S within 1 m of the FWI. In contrast, CH4 and NH4+ concentrations were detectable higher up into the water cap, indicating incomplete oxidation at the FWI most likely due to oxygen limitation. In 2015, CH4 was the only identified variable significantly negatively related to BML water cap oxygen concentrations. However in 2016, NH4+ emerged as an important OCC negatively related to water cap oxygen concentrations in addition to CH4. Mass balance of nitrogen redox species throughout the water column are consistent with active nitrification occurring in 2016; which was not evident in 2015 results. Thus, within 4 years of commissioning, nitrification has become an active and important process affecting water column oxygen concentrations within this pit lake. This is in contrast to an absence of detectable microbial nitrification in active oil sands tailing ponds, despite high levels of ammonia. While the absence of nitrification occurring in oil sands tailings ponds has previously been suggested to reflect naphthenic acids toxicity, results here identify that some lower limit of oxygen may also be required for this metabolism to flourish and that at very low oxygen levels (i.e. <5% saturation), nitrifying microbes appear to be outcompeted by methanotrophs, at least during early establishment stages within a pit lake.

AB  - The microbial ecology and activity of serpentine deposits and associated hydrated minerals are largely unknown. Previous research has largely focused on microbial communities in active serpentinizing systems, whereas relatively little research has demonstrated the ability of serpentine deposits to host microbial communities after the cessation of serpentinization. Given the potential role of serpentinization reactions fueling primitive microbial metabolisms on early Earth and the identification of serpentine deposits on Mars, knowledge of these geobiological relationships and potential for serpentine to host extant microbial communities and preserve biosignatures is increasingly important for planetary exploration seeking signs of life. The selection of habitable sites most likely to yield putative biosignatures is crucial to mission success. In this study, we aimed to characterize, on the basis of both metabolic activity and taxonomic composition, the microbial communities hosted in two naturally co-occurring and mineralogically distinct substrates within the serpentine-rich Jeffrey Mine pit-igneous quartzofeldspathic intrusives and serpentinite. Detection of heterotrophic activity in both lithologies at 24 degrees C, and in serpentinite at -5 degrees C, demonstrated that each substrate had the ability to host a viable microbial community, at Mars-relevant temperatures. Targeted amplicon sequencing subsequently showed the presence of bacterial, fungal, and photosynthetic microbial communities in both substrates. Here, we have demonstrated the presence of a viable lithic microbial community within two rock types in the Jeffrey Mine and provided evidence that lithologies associated with serpentine deposits and proximal hydrated minerals have the ability to support diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial colonization.

AB  - The relevance of the research. The authors have analyzed and estimated complex resources of the Bakchar deposit. Until now Bakchar deposit has been considered exclusively as a marine oolitic iron deposit. The studied rocks can be the subject of future mining for the first-priority payback of the facility. The main aim of the work was the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the potential associated mineral components of the Bakchar deposit. The methods: optical microscopy, petrographic analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence analysis. Results. Due to the studies the authors have concluded that glauconite resources for the deposit are about 800 million tons. Resources are estimated at 34 million tons within western detail explored area (5 km(2)) of deposit with an average glauconite content of 27,8 % (glauconitolite - 4,6 million tons, glauconitic sandstone - 18,1 million tons, glauconite-chamosite-goethite ooidal iron ore -11,3 million tons). Turonian sandy siltstones of the Ipatovo Formation are enriched with magnetite and ilmenite with their total average content in the rock of 15,2 %. The presence of these minerals provides a high magnetic signal (magnetic susceptibility) of sediments of 113,4...295,7.10(-5) SI (the first and second quartiles, respectively). The resources of magnetite and ilmenite are about 2,75 million tons within the western area of deposit according to 13 drill holes. TiO2 amounts about 815 thousand tons (with an average TiO2 content of 29,6 %), and Fe2O3 - 934,9 thousand tons (with an average Fe2O3 content of 34 %) of these resources. Textural features of the studied rocks (low cementation) allow us to recommend hydraulic borehole mining as a method of priority exploitation of both glauconite deposits and magnetite-ilmenite layer.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) from mining operations, engines, and ore processing may have adverse effects on health and well-being of workers and population living nearby. In this study, the characteristics of PM in an underground chrome mine were investigated in Kemi, Northern Finland. The concentrations and chemical composition of PM in size ranges from 2.5 nm to 10 mu m were explored in order to identify sources, formation mechanisms, and post-emission processes of particles in the mine air. This was done by using several online instruments with high time-resolution and offline particulate sampling followed by elemental and ionic analyses. A majority of sub-micrometer particles (< 1 mu m in diameter, PM1) originated from diesel engine emissions that were responsible for a rather stable composition of PM1 in the mine air. Another sub-micrometer particle type originated from the combustion products of explosives (e.g., nitrate and ammonium). On average, PM1 in the mine was composed of 62%, 30%, and 8% of organic matter, black carbon, and major inorganic species, respectively. Regarding the analyzed elements (e.g., Al, Si, Fe, Ca), many of them peaked at > 1 mu m indicating mineral dust origin. The average particle number concentration in the mine was (2.3 +/- 1.4)*10(4) #/cm(3). The maximum of particle number size distribution was between 30 and 200 nm for most of the time but there was frequently a distinct mode < 30 nm. The potential origin of nano-size particles remained as challenge for future studies.

AB  - Biochar has the potential to decrease the leaching of nutrients from agricultural systems to watercourses. We applied cattle slurry (0 or 40 t ha(-1)) and different amounts of spruce biochar (0, 10, 20 or 40 t ha(-1)) to the surface of a boreal grass field in autumn and analyzed the nutrient content in the soil and the regrowth of grass (Phleurn pretense) in the autumn over three years. In addition, four grass mats from each treatment were lifted each autumn and stored for 2-3 months outdoors (between -36 degrees C and 12 degrees C) for simulated snowmelt experiments. In the following winter, 30 kg snow was added to the grass mats and slowly melted with infra-red heaters over a 7-day period. All surface runoff water was collected and the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved phosphate phosphorus (PO4-P), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved total potassium (K), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH were measured. Biochar temporarily improved growing conditions by increasing pH values and the content of plant available acid ammonium acetate extractable P (P-Ac,) and K (K-Ac) in the soil, which also increased losses in surface runoff during the first snowmelt. In contrast, the biochar retained slurry- and mineral fertilizer-originated NO3-N on the soil during the three year experiment and prevented NO3-N losses in surface runoff during the first snowmelt after autumnal slurry addition. The biochar-induced increase in phosphorus (P) loss in surface runoff during the first snowmelt after slurry application was considerable (0.1-0.5 kg P ha(-1)) and the decrease in nitrogen (N) loss was moderate (0.2-0.6 kg N ha(-1)) compared to annual P and N losses in surface runoff in an adjacent field. The surface application of biochar can be recommended for the inhibition of nutrient losses to watercourses via surface runoff only if the capacity of used biochar to retain both N and P can be verified before application.

The analysis of changes in chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils is the important stage of searches ofminerals, development of corresponding methodology, and methodology of ecological monitoring as well. The aim of the research is to reveal the changes in chemical composition of peat and soil acid extracts in east part of the Vasyugan mire. Methods: landscape-geochemical and statistical methods, methods of definition of chemical and mineral composition of peat and soils, imitating mathematical modelling. Results and conclusions. According to approbation of peats and mineral soils in March 2017 and 2018 in east part of the Vasyugan mire (Western Siberia, the Ob river basin, the Russian Federation) the authors have analyzed: chemical composition of acid extracts from peats and soils using 1CP MS; composition of mineral inclusions in peat and soils using the method of scanning electronic microscopy and XRD-analysis. Concentration of 73 chemical elements was determined and three groups of elements were allocated: 1) with rather steady increase from a surface to bottom soils and/or a strongly pronounced maximum in bottom soils; 2) with well expressed maxima in the top and bottom parts of peat deposits; 3) with other types of distribution. The major factors of spatial changes in chemical composition of peat and soils are mainly natural biogeochetnical conditions, water exchange intensity, ratio of the atmospheric and ground water and mineral feed which determine the common availability of water and nutrients for bog vegetation, removal of toxic substances for this vegetation.

AB  - An understanding of the formation of toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) in Cr-containing mine tailings and associated soils and sediments, requires an understanding of the underlying dissolution mechanisms of chromitite, a common chromite-bearing rock in both ophiolites suites and ultramafic intrusions. This study will examine dissolution mechanisms of chromitite in various acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions containing cultivated bacteria, manganese oxides, sulfates, and phosphates. Dissolution of chromitite is non-stoichiometric under acidic, near-neutral, and alkaline pH conditions and involves the release of chromite nanoparticles and complex dissolution/re-precipitation reactions. Chromitite samples are obtained from the Black Thor chromite deposit in Northern Ontario, Canada; part of the "Ring of Fire" intrusive complex. The examined chromitite is composed of chromite, (Fe0.5Mg0.5) (Al0.6Cr1.4)O-4 and clinochlore; Mg-3[Si4O10(OH)(2)]center dot[MgAl1.33(OH)(6)], the latter phase contains similar to 3 wt% Cr in the form of chromite nanoparticles. Bulk dissolution data are collected after dissolution experiments with chromitite powders, and the chemical and mineralogical composition of treated chromitite surfaces is characterized with a combination of surface analytical techniques (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and nano-to micro-analytical techniques (scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and focused ion beam technology). In the chromitite systems studied here, the non-stoichiometric dissolution of clinochlore is the dominant reaction, which results in the formation of a hydrous and porous silica precipitate that is depleted in chromite nanoparticles relative to untreated clinochlore. Complete replacement of clinochlore by hydrous silica on the surface of chromitite under acidic conditions promotes the release of chromite nanoparticles and results in higher Cr: Si in solutions and in higher proportions of secondary Cr species on its surface (secondary Cr species are defined as surface terminations that do not occur on an untreated chromite surface, such as -Cr3+-OH2 and -Cr6+-OH). Cultivated bacteria from a sulfide-bearing acid-mine drainage system affect neither the degree of dissolution nor the formation of secondary Cr species, whereas pyrolusite (MnO2) particles, and adsorbed or precipitated Fe-and Al-bearing hydroxide, -sulfate, and -phosphate species, affect release and re-adsorption of chromite nanoparticles and Cr-bearing species during dissolution of chromitite under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. These results show that weathering of chromitite and the release of Cr into the environment are strongly controlled by factors such as dissolution rates of Cr-bearing silicates and chromite, the release of chromite nanoparticles, re-precipitation of amorphous silica, the presence of particles in solution, and the pH-dependence adsorption (or precipitation) of Fe-and Al-bearing hydroxides and sulfates.

TI  - Recent trends in water analysis triggering future monitoring of organic micropollutants
AU  - Schmidt, T. C.
T2  - Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry
AB  - Water analysis has been an important area since the beginning of analytical chemistry. The focus though has shifted substantially: from minerals and the main constituents of water in the time of Carl Remigius Fresenius to a multitude of, in particular, organic compounds at concentrations down to the sub-nanogram per liter level nowadays. This was possible only because of numerous innovations in instrumentation in recent decades, drivers of which are briefly discussed. In addition to the high demands on sensitivity, high throughput by automation and short analysis times are major requirements. In this article, some recent developments in the chemical analysis of organic micropollutants (OMPs) are presented. These include the analysis of priority pollutants in whole water samples, extension of the analytical window, in particular to encompass highly polar compounds, the trend toward more than one separation dimension before mass spectrometric detection, and ways of coping with unknown analytes by suspect and nontarget screening approaches involving high-resolution mass spectrometry. Furthermore, beyond gathering reliable concentration data for many OMPs, the question of the relevance of such data for the aquatic system under scrutiny is becoming ever more important. To that end, effect-based analytics can be used and may become part of future routine monitoring, mostly with a focus on adverse effects of OMPs in specific test systems mimicking environmental impacts. Despite advances in the field of water analysis in recent years, there are still many challenges for further analytical research.

TI  - Solid-phase speciation and post-depositional mobility of arsenic in lake sediments impacted by ore roasting at legacy gold mines in the Yellowknife area, Northwest Territories, Canada

AB  - Arsenic (As) concentrations in lake sediments in the Yellowknife region, Northwest Territories, Canada, are elevated from the weathering of mineralized bedrock and/or from the aerial deposition of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) generated via the roasting of arsenical gold ores at the now-defunct Giant Mine and other historical roasting operations in the area. Sediment cores were collected from shallow-and deep-water sites in two lakes located downwind of Giant Mine to determine the origin of As in sediments and understand how As concentrations and solid-phase speciation vary with sediment depth and spatially with changes in water depth and sediment texture. Deep-water cores were dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods. Select sediment intervals were chosen for polished section preparation and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-based automated mineralogy, electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), and synchrotron-based microanalyses to characterize As-hosting solid phases. Sediment redox conditions and the post-depositional mobility of As at the shallow-water sites were assessed by sampling sediment porewaters using dialysis arrays (peepers). At the shallow-water sites, maximum sediment As concentrations occur at the sediment-water interface. In contrast, maximum As concentrations in the deep-water cores occur at sediment depths> 15 cm. Dating using Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods indicates that the As-rich horizons at both deep-water sites are coincident with the period of maximum emissions from the Giant Mine roaster. Four predominant As-hosting solid phases were identified: anthropogenic As2O3 from stack emissions, and authigenic realgar, As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxide, and As-bearing framboidal pyrite. The contribution of arsenopyrite to total sediment As concentrations was negligible, suggesting that elevated As concentrations are largely derived from ore roasting. In near-surface sediments at the shallow-water sites, the dominant host of As is Fe-oxyhydroxide. Congruent porewater profiles for As and Fe indicate that the post-depositional mobilization of As is governed by the reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxide. Deep-water sediments are enriched in As2O3 that has persisted for more than 60 years. The presence of authigenic As-bearing sulphides suggests that the partial dissolution of As2O3 leads to the formation of less bioaccessible phases where reduced sulphur (S) is available. The distributions of As-hosting solid phases at the shallow-and deep-water sites are interpreted to be both directly and indirectly influenced by water depth. Fine-grained As2O3 particles are less likely to persist in shallow-water areas and typically accumulate in deep-water zones as a result of sediment-focusing processes. Fine-grained organic matter also preferentially accumulates in deeper areas, which influences redox gradients in porewater, the stability field for As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxide, and the depth of authigenic As-bearing sulphide precipitation.

AB  - The primary purpose of a detonation in a high explosive (HE) is to provide the energy to drive a surrounding confiner, typically for mining or munitions applications. The details of the interaction between an HE detonation and its confinement are essential to achieving the objectives of the explosive device. For the high pressures induced by detonation loading, both the solid HE and confiner materials will flow. The structure and speed of a propagating detonation, and ultimately the pressures generated in the reaction zone to drive the confiner, depend on the induced flow both within the confiner and along the HE-confiner material interface. The detonation-confiner interactions are heavily influenced by the material properties and, in some cases, the thickness of the confiner. This review discusses the use of oblique shock polar analysis as a means of characterizing the possible range of detonation-confiner interactions. Computations that reveal the fluid mechanics of HE detonation-confiner interactions for finite reaction-zone length detonations are discussed and compared with the polar analysis. This includes cases of supersonic confiner flow; subsonic, shock-driven confiner flow; subsonic, but shockless confiner flow; and sonic flow at the intersection of the detonation shock and confiner material interface. We also summarize recent developments, including the effects of geometry and porous material confinement, on detonation-confiner interactions.

AB  - A continuous record of 29 trace elements (TEs) has been constructed between 1650 and 1991 CE (Common Era) from an ice core retrieved in 1992 from the Guliya ice cap, on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. Enrichments of Pb, Cd, Zn and Sb were detected during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century (similar to 1850-1950) while enrichments of Sn (1965-1991), Cd and Pb (1975-1991) were detected during the second half of the 20th century. The EFs increased significantly by 20% for Cd and Sb, and by 10% for Pb and Zn during 1850-1950 relative to the pre-1850s. Comparisons of the Guliya TEs data with other ice core-derived and production/consumption data suggest that Northern Hemisphere coal combustion (primarily in Western Europe) is the likely source of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Sb during the 1850-1950 period. Coal combustion in Europe declined as oil replaced coal as the primary energy source. The European shift from coal to oil may have contributed to the observed Sn enrichment in similar to 1965 (60% EF increase in 1975-1991), although regional fossil fuel combustion (coal and leaded gasoline) from western China, Central Asia, and South Asia (India, Nepal), as well as Sn mining/smelting in Central Asia, may also be possible sources. The post-1975 Cd and Pb enrichments (40% and 20% EF increase respectively in 1975-1991) may reflect emissions from phosphate fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, and/or non-ferrous metal production, from western China, Central Asia, and/or South Asia. Leaded gasoline is likely to have also contributed to the post-1975 Pb enrichment observed in this record. The results strongly suggest that the Guliya ice cap has recorded long-distance emissions from coal combustion since the 1850s with more recent contributions from regional agriculture, mining, and/or fossil fuel combustion. This new Guliya ice core record of TEs fills a geographical gap in the reconstruction of the pollution history of this region that extends well beyond modern instrumental records.

TI  - Impacts of human-induced environmental change in wetlands on aquatic animals
AU  - Sievers, M.

T2  - Biological Reviews
AB  - Many wetlands harbour highly diverse biological communities and provide extensive ecosystem services; however, these important ecological features are being altered, degraded and destroyed around the world. Despite a wealth of research on how animals respond to anthropogenic changes to natural wetlands and how they use created wetlands, we lack a broad synthesis of these data. While some altered wetlands may provide vital habitat, others could pose a considerable risk to wildlife. This risk will be heightened if such wetlands are ecological traps-preferred habitats that confer lower fitness than another available habitat. Wetlands functioning as ecological traps could decrease both local and regional population persistence, and ultimately lead to extinctions. Most studies have examined how animals respond to changes in environmental conditions by measuring responses at the community and population levels, but studying ecological traps requires information on fitness and habitat preferences. Our current lack of knowledge of individual-level responses may therefore limit our capacity to manage wetland ecosystems effectively since ecological traps require different management practices to mitigate potential consequences. We conducted a global meta-analysis to characterise how animals respond to four key drivers of wetland alteration: agriculture, mining, restoration and urbanisation. Our overarching goal was to evaluate the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems, as well as identify current knowledge gaps that limit both the current understanding of these responses and effective wetland management. We extracted 1799 taxon-specific response ratios from 271 studies across 29 countries. Community- (e.g. richness) and population-level (e.g. density) measures within altered wetlands were largely comparable to those within reference wetlands. By contrast, individual fitness measures (e.g. survival) were often lower, highlighting the potential limitations of using only community- and population-level measures to assess habitat quality. Only four studies provided habitat-preference data, preventing investigation of the potential for altered wetlands to function as ecological traps. This is concerning because attempts to identify ecological traps may detect previously unidentified conservation risks. Although there was considerable variability amongst taxa, amphibians were typically the most sensitive taxon, and thus, may be a valuable bio-indicator of wetland quality. Despite suffering reduced survival and reproduction, measures such as time to and mass at metamorphosis were similar between altered and reference wetlands, suggesting that quantifying metamorphosis-related measures in isolation may not provide accurate information on habitat quality. Our review provides the most detailed evaluation to date of the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems. We emphasise that the role of wetlands in human-altered ecosystems can be complex, as they may represent important habitat but also pose potential risks to animals. Reduced availability of natural wetlands is increasing the importance of altered wetlands for aquatic animals. Consequently, we need to define what represents habitat quality from the perspective of animals, and gain a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of habitat selection and how these factors could be manipulated. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the quality of these wetlands should be implemented to maximise their conservation potential.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a common contaminant in soils at e.g. mining, shooting range, and glassworks sites. In order to make reliable risk assessments and appropriate decisions on various "gentle remediation options", such as applying phosphate, compost, or zero-valent iron to soils, the binding mechanism of Pb and its speciation needs to be known. Multi-surface geochemical equilibrium models are useful tools for estimating trace metal solubility and speciation, but for Pb the predictions are often poor. This study evaluates the recent parameterization for Pb in the Visual MINTEQ code for its ability to predict the solubility of Pb at different pH values in four historically contaminated Swedish soils. As an independent validation of the model performance, the modeled solid-phase speciation was compared to measured Pb speciation retrieved using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Furthermore, potential artefacts by the presence of Pb colloids were investigated by filtering solutions through both 0.45 pm and 10 kDa fillers. The model accuracy for predicting Pb solubility was improved compared with previous studies producing log root mean square error (RMSE) values below 0.42 in three out of four soils, just by using generic assumptions. The use of ultrafiltered (< 10 kDa) instead of the 0.45 mu m-filtered Pb concentrations lowered the RMSE with similar to 0.4 log units in two soils, giving a more accurate evaluation of the model performance. EXAFS proved to be a useful tool for validating and constraining the model, since the solid phase speciation did not exactly agree with the modeled results using default assumptions. However, a sample-specific optimization of the amount of "active" solid organic matter and Al + Fe hydroxides resulted in improved prediction of Pb solubility as well as better agreement with the EXAFS measurements. Solubility of Pb in the fourth, As-rich soil was probably controlled by Pb-5 (AsO4)(3)Cl (mimetite) with a solubility product constant of 10(-83.5)(3).

AB  - Relevance. Modernization of infrastructure of the oil and gas complex of Western Siberia and development of the northern territories require the widespread use of local non-metallic raw materials, in areas that are almost directly adjacent to the main industrial sites in 1970-1980-s the colossal reserves of opal-cristobalite rocks diatomites and opoka, were explored. They have a near-surface occurrence and industrial practice of their use in dozens of industries. Deficiency of natural raw materials in industrial sector of the north of the Tyumen region amounts to 50-70 %. This creates an economic basis for development of deposits of opal-cristobalite rocks. The Syagoy site the largest in the near-Arctic zone Arka-Tabyakha deposit, due to its geological structure and confinement to the parallel-ridge relief, can be considered as a representative of other deposits of opal-cristobalite rocks in the north of Western Siberia. The main aim is the study of lithology of clayey diatomite of Syagoy site and analysis of engineering-geological conditions of Syagoy site, with a view to assess the economic feasibility of developing the field. The methods: field studies, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence analysis, differential thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, lithological and petrographic analysis. The results. The Syagoy site has huge forecast resources and relatively high quality of raw materials, however, the main limiting factors for development of deposit are economic and geological factors. The geomorphological and geocryological conditions of the territory of the parallel-ridge relief along with the total ice content of 50-60 % will have a critical impact on the cost of technological operations related to field development, transportation, storage and processing of raw materials, making the development of such deposits unprofitable. Real prospects for development of opal-cristobalite rocks in the Far North of Western Siberia exist for deposits that combine proximity to potential consumers of raw materials and do not form cryogenic hillocks and ridges.

AB  - Phytomelioration and tree species selection on poor mine soils are important for reclamation and afforestation success. Black alder (Alnus glutinosa), as N-fixing species, is often planted on afforested post-mining barrens as an admixture to improve soil properties and enhance growth of target tree species. Objective of this study was to assess the effect of black alder admixture on chemical, physical and microbial properties of sandy mine soils afforested with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The topsoil samples (0-5 cm) were taken in areas afforested with Scots pine with black alder admixture at 1 m, 2 m, 4 m and 8 m from the black alder rows and measured for texture, maximum water holding capacity (WHC), pH, C-org and N contents. The measured soil microbial properties included microbial biomass (C-mic), basal respiration rate (RESP), N mineralization rate and urease activity (URE). Community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of soil microbial communities were determined with Biolog (R) Ecoplates. The highest C-org, N, C-mic, RESP, N mineralization rate and URE values were measured at 1 m from the alders row and then decreased rapidly. The influence of alders ranged to ca 2 m-3 m from the alders row depending on the soil property. Soil microbial communities close to the alders row were functionally more diverse than those in soils from larger distances. There were distinct differences in CLPPs between microbial communities from soil at 1 m and 8 m from the alders row wherein those close to the alders were more efficient in degradation of carbohydrates and those at 8 m in degradation of polymers. Results of the study clearly indicate positive influence of black alder on several soil properties crucial for their biological activity and fertility.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are widely distributed photosynthetic microorganisms that can be found in almost every terrestrial and aquatic environment. In heavily eutrophicated water bodies, massive proliferation of cyanobacteria can lead into excessive surface water blooms. Over the last decades the presence of Aphanizomenon sp. dominated blooms have also been reported in the Curonian Lagoon. Recent reports indicate that removal of wild cyanobacterial blooms from the Curonian Lagoon as a management measure should be prioritized. In this study, the utilization of wild cyanobacteria as a potential source of high-added value products by means of supercritical CO2 extraction (SFE-CO2) is reported. Central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were employed to optimize SFE-CO2 parameters (temperature, pressure and time) to obtain high yield lipophilic extracts. Under optimal conditions (42.5 MPa, 55 degrees C and 120 min), SFE-CO2 yielded 4.43 g/100 g DW of nonpolar extract, showing 20% higher extraction efficiency at 3-fold lower extraction time as compared to the conventional Soxhlet extraction. SFE-CO2 fraction was rich in alpha-linolenic acid (27% of total fatty acids) and alpha-tocopherol (293 mu g/g extract). Moreover, the total phenolic content and the in vitro radical scavenging capacity of extracts and solid fractions were evaluated too. Furthermore, preliminary life cycle assessment (LCA) showed that SFE-CO2 had a higher life cycle impact as compared to the hexane system. Thus, SFE-CO2 could be utilized to valorise wild cyanobacteria into valuable products with various industrial applications.

AB  - The application of a non-destructive analytical procedure to characterise the mineral phases in meteorites is a key issue in order to preserve this type of scarce materials. In the present work, the Elephant Moraine 83227 meteorite, found in Antarctica in 1983 and originated from 4 Vesta asteroid, was analysed by micro-Raman spectroscopy, micro-energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence and the structural and chemical analyser (Raman spectroscopy coupled with scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectroscopy) working in both point-by-point and image modes. The combination of all these techniques allows the extraction of, at the same time, elemental, molecular and structural data of the studied microscopic area of the meteorite. The most relevant results of the Elephant Moraine 83227 were the finding of tridymite for the first time in a 4 Vesta meteorite, along with quartz, which means that the meteorite suffered high temperatures at a certain point. Moreover, both feldspar and pyroxene were found as the main mineral phases in the sample. Ilmenite, apatite, chromite and elemental sulphur were also detected as secondary minerals. Finally, calcite was found as a weathering product, which was probably formed in terrestrial weathering processes of the pyroxene present in the sample. Besides, Raman spectroscopy provided information about the conditions that the meteorite experienced; the displacements in some feldspar Raman bands were used to estimate the temperature and pressure conditions to which the Elephant Moraine 83227 was subjected, because we obtained both low and high formation temperature feldspar.

TI  - A sustainable Arctic: Making hard decisions
AU  - Trump, B. D.

T2  - Arctic Antarctic and Alpine Research
AB  - The Arctic is experiencing substantial increases in human activity in areas ranging from fossil fuel and mineral extraction to transport along Arctic waterways. Such actions may yield new sources of economic benefits and further objectives to promote national defense, yet they may also generate potential risks to the Arctic environment. As such, concerns from various stakeholders have been raised regarding how to make Arctic operations better meet sustainability goals and balance defense and economic objectives with environmental degradation. This article describes how decision analytical tools, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), may help identify policies and project proposals that minimize the potential for environmental degradation within a framework of maximizing economic, industrial, and defense objectives. Specifically, MCDA conducts value tradeoffs to assess the utility of various decision alternatives against disparate criteria; for this case, this includes the evaluation of Arctic operation sustainability. This article demonstrates through an example of industrial mining in Greenland how MCDA might serve as a tool to guide uncertain decisions for various Arctic projects, and potentially indicate opportunities to structure such projects to provide greater sustainability for their longer-term operations.

Elements of the technogenic ore-mining landscape have been revealed to have a negative impact on the environment within the identified centers. It is shown that mining works are one of the main sources of ecological tension and potable fresh water pollution in highly hazardous copper-pyrite deposits. A range of mine engineering, geoecological, and social problems of the mining republics of the northern Caucasus are evaluated.

AB  - In the present study, we examined the subcellular distribution of metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Cu, Se and Zn) in the liver and gonads of wild white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) collected downstream from a metal mining operation (exposure area) and in a reference area. Metal partitioning among potentially metal-sensitive fractions (heat-denatured proteins (HDP), mitochondria and microsomes) and potentially biologically detoxified fractions (heat-stable proteins (HSP) and metal-rich granules) within cells was determined after differential centrifugation, NaOH digestion and heat-denaturation steps. Metal-handling strategies between liver and gonads, and between sexes, were examined. Hepatic metal concentrations were significantly higher in exposed compared to reference fish, especially for Se (14x), Cd (5x) and Cu (3x), and did not vary between sexes. In contrast, gonadal Cd, Cu, Se and Zn concentrations were consistently lower in testes than in ovaries; marked differences in Cd and Se concentrations between exposed and reference fish were observed for both sexes. Overall, metal-handling strategies were similar in both liver (male and female pooled) and female gonads, but differed from those in male gonads, likely due to the different functions assigned to ovaries and testes. Subcellular partitioning of As, Cd and Cu showed that the HSP fraction was most responsive to increased metal exposure, presumably reflecting Cu regulation, and possibly Cd and As detoxification. Zinc concentrations were tightly controlled and mainly found in the HDP fraction. Interestingly, changes in Cd-handling strategy in female gonads were particularly evident, with Cd shifting dramatically from the metal-sensitive HDP fraction in reference fish to the metal-detoxified HSP fraction in exposed fish. It seems that Cd detoxification in female gonads was not fully induced in the less contaminated fish, but became more effective above a threshold Cd concentration of 0.05 nmol/g dry weight. Partitioning of Se was different, with the largest contributor to the total liver and gonad Se burdens being the putative metal-sensitive HDP fraction, suggesting that excess Se in this fraction in exposed fish may lead to Serelated stress. The present subcellular partitioning results demonstrate that metal handling strategies vary among metals, between organs and (in some cases) as a function of metal exposure. They also show promise in identifying metals of potential concern in a risk assessment context.

TI  - Early mining and smelting lead anomalies in geological archives as potential stratigraphic markers for the base of an early Anthropocene
AU  - Wagreich, M.
AU  - Draganits, E.
T2  - Anthropocene Review
AB  - This article reviews possible lower boundaries for an early Anthropocene period. Although a noticeable environmental impact of humans, caused by hunting, the use of fire, forest clearance, animal domestication and agriculture had already occurred in the Neolithic, these early signals are strongly diachronous and localised. Here, we examine early significant, synchronous and regional stratigraphic signals indicating an anthropogenic influence as consequences of mining and smelting-related trace metal contamination. A first regional lead contamination event in the Northern Hemisphere is recognized during the (Eastern Mediterranean) Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age, between 3500 and 2800 BP, with a peak at around 3000 BP. Another pronounced anthropogenic lead peak is recorded around 2000 BP, during the Roman period. These events, as defined by lead enrichment and changes in lead isotope ratios, accompanied by other trace metal enrichments, are found in several types of archives, such as Arctic ice-cores and European peat-bogs, speleothems as well as fluvial, lake and marine records. Potential stratigraphic correlations and secondary markers may be present using tephrochronology, climate events, and magnetostratigraphy. Such a definition of the base of a formally defined (early) Anthropocene stage/period allows the application of the GSSP (Global Stratotype Section and Point) concept by using a point in a physical archive, and, in contrast to the late Anthropocene, includes a significant quantity of anthropogenic strata as evidence for an Anthropocene chronostratigraphic unit.

AU  - Williams, M. R.

T2  - Austral Ecology
AB  - The extraction of mineral deposits in ecologically sensitive landscapes can lead to conflicts between mining and conservation interests (Tibbett 2015). Determining any effect of mining operations and how far these impacts spread from a mine site are therefore important issues in assessing the likely ecological impacts of proposed developments. Matsuki et al. (2016) examined the effects of mine-generated dust on plants at two sites in semi-arid Australia: Barrow Island and Windarling Range. They concluded that there was no evidence that dust accumulation on plants caused negative impacts, such as increased mortality. For the Windarling study, however, there are shortcomings in the methods on which this conclusion is based. Indeed, there are data available that clearly show the opposite conclusion: that mine-generated dust at Windarling Range resulted in a substantially higher mortality rate of the threatened perennial shrub Tetratheca paynterae subsp. paynterae (Elaeocarpaceae) between 2004 and 2005.

AB  - The Diavik Waste Rock Project, located in a region of continuous permafrost in northern Canada, includes complementary field and laboratory experiments with the purpose of investigating scale-up techniques for the assessment of the geochemical evolution of mine waste rock at a large scale. As part of the Diavik project, medium-scale field experiments ( similar to 1.5 m high active zone lysimeters) were conducted to assess the long term geochemical evolution and drainage of a low-sulfide waste rock under a relatively simple (i.e. constrained by the container) flow regime while exposed to atmospheric conditions. A conceptual model, including the most significant processes controlling the sulfide-mineral oxidation and weathering of the associated host minerals as observed in a laboratory humidity cell experiment, was developed as part of a previous modelling study. The current study investigated the efficacy of scaling the calibrated humidity cell model to simulate the geochemical evolution of the active zone lysimeter experiments. The humidity cell model was used to simulate the geochemical evolution of low-sulfide waste rock with S content of 0.053 wt.% and 0.035 wt.% (primarily pyrrhotite) in the active zone lysimeter experiments using the reactive transport code MIN3P. Water flow through the lysimeters was simulated using temporally variable infiltration estimated from precipitation measurements made within 200 m of the lysimeters. Flow parameters and physical properties determined during previous studies at Diavik were incorporated into the simulations to reproduce the flow regime. The geochemical evolution of the waste-rock system was simulated by adjustment of the sulfide-mineral content to reflect the values measured at the lysimeters. The temperature dependence of the geochemical system was considered using temperature measurements taken daily, adjacent to the lysimeters, to correct weathering rates according to the Arrhenius equation. The lysimeter simulations indicated that a model developed from simulations of laboratory humidity cell experiments, incorporating detailed representations of temporally variable temperature and water infiltration, can be scaled to provide a reasonable assessment of geochemical evolution of the medium-scale field experiments.

AB  - Parameters of electromagnetic responses (EMRe) generated during uniaxial compression of rock samples under excitation by deterministic acoustic pulses are presented and discussed. Such physical modeling in the laboratory allows to reveal the main regularities of electromagnetic signals (EMS) generation in rock massive. The influence of the samples mechanical properties on the parameters of the EMRe excited by an acoustic signal in the process of uniaxial compression is considered. It has been established that sulfides and quartz in the rocks of the Tashtagol iron ore deposit (Western Siberia, Russia) contribute to the conversion of mechanical energy into the energy of the electromagnetic field, which is expressed in an increase in the EMS amplitude. The decrease in the EMS amplitude when the stress-strain state of the sample changes during the uniaxial compression is observed when the amount of conductive magnetite contained in the rock is increased. The obtained results are important for the physical substantiation of testing methods and monitoring of changes in the stress-strain state of the rock massive by the parameters of electromagnetic signals and the characteristics of electromagnetic emission.
