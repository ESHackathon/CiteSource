AB  - A number of marine mammal species travel off Rausu, Shiretoko as feeding and breeding habitats, providing resources for tourism. However, seasonal sea ice and severe weather conditions have restricted visual observations of marine mammals off Rausu except for daytime observations between spring and fall. To compensate for this lack of information, fixed passive acoustic recording devices were deployed to monitor the presence of marine mammals during November 2012-March 2014. Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) burst pulsed calls in July, November, and December; ribbon seal (Histriophoca fasciata) downsweeps in February and March; killer whale (Orcinus orca) pulsed calls from April to August; and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) clicks in July and August were detected. Cetacean species were possibly involved in foraging since their pulsed calls or clicks were often detected during foraging. In contrast, ribbon seals were possibly involved in breeding behaviours as seal vocalizations are likely related to breeding activities. This passive acoustic monitoring will provide new insights into the ecology of diverse marine mammals off Rausu.

AB  - UNESCO World Natural Heritage sites are established to ensure the long-term conservation of natural areas. Nemuro Strait in northern Japan is adjacent to the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage Site, and attracts various trophic levels of marine species, including marine mammals. Although the coexistence of humans and marine mammals is an important issue in this area, the temporal habitat use of cetaceans in this area is unknown. Here, we document seasonal and diel changes in cetacean vocalizations collected using passive acoustic recording devices during November 2012-March 2014. Killer whale calls occurred in spring and summer, and sperm whale clicks were detected in summer. Pacific white-sided dolphin calls were recorded in summer and late fall. No cetaceans were recorded during the sea ice period in February and March. The dolphin calls and unknown click trains were significantly more frequent at night. In contrast, marginal diel changes in killer whale calls were detected. Our results suggest that the majority of cetaceans utilize Nemuro Strait at night during the ice-free period, and we provide new insights into the habitat use and diversity of marine mammals in the Strait.

AB  - Autonomous acoustic recorders have advanced our understanding of cetaceans, providing information for better models of species distribution, behavior, ecology, and conservation. For over a decade, Acoustic Recording Packages (ARPs), and its broader-bandwidth successor, High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP), have been used for Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) providing high-fidelity, long-term acoustic data sets for cetacean studies. Some of these studies are summarized below showing a wide range of applications and results including species signal characterization, seasonal and daily presence patterns, geographic and habitat use, population density and abundance estimations, acoustic stimuli behavioral response, and swimming behavior via array tracking. Species studied include low-frequency baleen whales and high-frequency dolphins and beaked whales.

AB  - Understanding environmental drivers of species' behavior is key for successful conservation. Within cetacean research, studies focused on understanding such drivers often consider local conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature), but rarely include large-scale, long-term parameters such as climate indices. Here we make use of long-term passive acoustic monitoring data to examine relationships between eight classes of toothed whales and climate indices, specifically El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, as well as local surface conditions (temperature, salinity, sea surface height) at two sites in the Hawaiian Archipelago. We find that El Nino Southern Oscillation most influenced cetacean detections at monitored sites. In many cases, detection patterns matched well with combinations of one or more climate indices and surface conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering climate indices in efforts to understand relationships between marine top predators and environmental conditions.
   The El Nino Southern Oscillation is the primary climate index influencing detections of eight classes of toothed whales at two sites in the Hawaiian Archipelago, according to an analysis of surface conditions, climate indices and long-term passive acoustic monitoring data.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed line array of hydrophones is a standard method for localizing cetaceans during line-transect cetacean abundance surveys. Perpendicular distances estimated between localized whales and the trackline are essential for abundance estimation using acoustic data. Uncertainties in the acoustic data from hydrophone movement, sound propagation effects, errors in the time of arrival differences, and whale depth are not accounted for by most two-dimensional localization methods. Consequently, location and distance estimates for deep-diving cetaceans may be biased, creating uncertainty in abundance estimates. Here, a model-based localization approach is applied to towed line array acoustic data that incorporates sound propagation effects, accounts for sources of error, and localizes in three dimensions. The whale's true distance, ship trajectory, and whale movement greatly affected localization results in simulations. The localization method was applied to real acoustic data from two separate sperm whales, resulting in three-dimensional distance and depth estimates with position bounds for each whale. By incorporating sources of error, this three-dimensional model-based approach provides a method to address and integrate the inherent uncertainties in towed array acoustic data for more robust localization.

AB  - Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory's monitoring and mitigation program during an academic seismic study in April-June 2004 was the largest cetacean survey undertaken to date in the southeast Caribbean Sea. A total of 10,007 km (904 h) of visual observations occurred from the seismic vessel R/V Maurice Ewing and from the support vessel R/V Seward Johnson II. In addition, 7375 km (846 h) of passive acoustic monitoring for vocalizing cetaceans occurred from the Ewing via a towed 250-m hydrophone array. Approximately 1293 cetaceans in 46 groups were seen from the two vessels, and 78 acoustic detections were made. Nine cetacean species were identified of which the long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis), Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis), and bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) were sighted most frequently. The striped dolphin (S. coeruleoalba), spinner dolphin (S. longirostris), pantropical spotted dolphin (S. attenuata), short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) were also identified during visual surveys. Only the sperm whale was positively identified by acoustic monitoring alone. At least 17 sperm whale detections (visual and/or acoustic) were made around the islands and atolls of the Venezuelan Archipelago near and beyond the 1000-m depth contour. Overall cetacean density in intermediate-depth water (100 to 1000 m deep) was five times greater than in deep (>1000 m) water. This study addresses previous data gaps on the occurrence of cetaceans in shelf and offshore waters across a wide area of the southeast Caribbean Sea in spring.

AB  - Long-term distribution data for cetaceans are lacking, inhibiting the ability of management bodies to assess trends and react appropriately. Such is true even along the US Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) where previous passive acoustic monitoring programs have laid the groundwork for monitoring cetacean occurrence over a multidecadal scale. Here, we continue and expand the scope of previous acoustic programs, providing a synopsis of the monthly cetacean acoustic occurrence from late 2017 to late 2020. Acoustic data were collected using bottom-mounted autonomous recorders located at seven stations along the OCS in depths of 212-900 m. Automated cetacean vocalization detector-classifiers were applied, and the resulting automated detections directed the manual review of a subset of the data by analysts. Only manual detections informed the occurrence results. Six baleen whale species and at least eight toothed whale species occurred in the region with diversity increasing in winter. In considering previous monitoring program results, we found evidence that some mysticete whales are spending less time in the region annually, confirmed that some species occur farther offshore than previously reported, and identified two previously unreported areas utilized by beaked whales. For effective species management, these findings must be considered, and monitoring programs continued.

AB  - A variety of cetacean species inhabit the productive waters offshore of Washington State, USA. Although the general presence of many of these species has been documented in this region, our understanding of fine-scale habitat use is limited. Here, passive acoustic monitoring was used to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of ten cetacean species at three locations offshore of Washington. Between 2004 and 2013, a total of 2845 days of recordings were collected from sites on the continental shelf and slope, and in a submarine canyon. Acoustic presence was higher for all species at sites farther offshore. Detections were highest during the fall and winter for blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), likely related to reproductive behavior, while minke whales (B. acutorostrata) were only detected on two days. Odontocetes showed temporal separation, with sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) detections highest in spring, Risso's (Grampus griseus) and Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) highest in summer, and Stejneger's beaked whales (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), and the BW37V signal type highest in winter or spring. There was interannual variation in detections for most mysticete species, which may be linked to oceanographic conditions: blue and fin whale detections increased during 2007 and 2008, and fin and humpback whale detections increased in 2011. These results inform our understanding of cetacean behavior and habitat use in this region and may aid in the development of conservation strategies suited to the dynamic conditions that drive cetacean distribution.

AB  - Understanding the seasonal movements and distribution patterns of migratory species over ocean basin scales is vital for appropriate conservation and management measures. However, assessing populations over remote regions is challenging, particularly if they are rare. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus spp) are an endangered species found in the Southern and Indian Oceans. Here two recognized subspecies of blue whales and, based on passive acoustic monitoring, four "acoustic populations" occur. Three of these are pygmy blue whale (B. m. brevicauda) populations while the fourth is the Antarctic blue whale (B. m. intermedia). Past whaling catches have dramatically reduced their numbers but recent acoustic recordings show that these oceans are still important habitat for blue whales. Presently little is known about the seasonal movements and degree of overlap of these four populations, particularly in the central Indian Ocean. We examined the geographic and seasonal occurrence of different blue whale acoustic populations using one year of passive acoustic recording from three sites located at different latitudes in the Indian Ocean. The vocalizations of the different blue whale subspecies and acoustic populations were recorded seasonally in different regions. For some call types and locations, there was spatial and temporal overlap, particularly between Antarctic and different pygmy blue whale acoustic populations. Except on the southernmost hydrophone, all three pygmy blue whale acoustic populations were found at different sites or during different seasons, which further suggests that these populations are generally geographically distinct. This unusual blue whale diversity in sub-Antarctic and sub-tropical waters indicates the importance of the area for blue whales in these former whaling grounds.

AB  - Cetaceans spend most of their time below the surface of the sea, highlighting the importance of passive acoustic monitoring as a tool to facilitate understanding and mapping their year-round spatial and temporal distributions. To increase our limited knowledge of cetacean acoustic detection patterns for the east and west coasts of Gwaii Haanas, a remote protected area on Haida Gwaii, BC, Canada, acoustic datasets recorded off SGang Gwaay (Sep 2009-May 2011), Gowgaia Slope (Jul 2017-Jul 2019), and Ramsay Island (Aug 2018-Aug 2019) were analyzed. Comparing overlapping periods of visual surveys and acoustic monitoring confirmed presence of 12 cetacean species/species groups within the study region. Seasonal patterns were identified for blue, fin, humpback, grey and sperm whale acoustic signals. Killer whale and delphinid acoustic signals occurred year-round on both coasts of Haida Gwaii and showed strong diel variation. Cuvier's, Baird's, beaked whale and porpoise clicks, were identified in high-frequency recordings on the west coast. Correlations between environmental factors, chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature, and cetacean acoustic occurrence off Gwaii Haanas were also examined. This study is the first to acoustically monitor Gwaii Haanas waters for an extended continuous period and therefore serves as a baseline from which to monitor future changes.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an optimal method for detecting and monitoring cetaceans as they frequently produce sound while underwater. Cue counting, counting acoustic cues of deep-diving cetaceans instead of animals, is an alternative method for density estimation, but requires an average cue production rate to convert cue density to animal density. Limited information about click rates exists for sperm whales in the central North Pacific Ocean. In the absence of acoustic tag data, we used towed hydrophone array data to calculate the first sperm whale click rates from this region and examined their variability based on click type, location, distance of whales from the array, and group size estimated by visual observers. Our findings show click type to be the most important variable, with groups that include codas yielding the highest click rates. We also found a positive relationship between group size and click detection rates that may be useful for acoustic predictions of group size in future studies. Echolocation clicks detected using PAM methods are often the only indicator of deep-diving cetacean presence. Understanding the factors affecting their click rates provides important information for acoustic density estimation. (c) 2024 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The distribution and seasonal movements of sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus are poorly understood in the western North Atlantic Ocean, despite a long history of human exploitation of the species. Cetacean surveys in this region are typically conducted during the summer, when weather conditions are amenable for visual observation, resulting in a seasonal bias in species occurrence data. In the present study, we conducted multi-year passive acoustic monitoring to assess year-round sperm whale occurrence along the continental slope between Florida and New England, USA. Between 2011 and 2015, we collected 2037 d of recordings using bottom-mounted recorders deployed at 5 sites. We analyzed these recordings for sperm whale echolocation clicks, which were detected commonly between New England and North Carolina, but infrequently off the coast of Florida. In the northern half of the study region, we observed distinct seasonal patterns in the daily prevalence of sperm whale clicks, with a winter peak in occurrence off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, followed by an increase later in the spring at sites further north. South of Cape Hatteras, seasonal patterns were less apparent. We detected sperm whale clicks during all hours of the day throughout the study area, and did not observe strong diel patterns. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive year-round baseline on the occurrence of sperm whales across multiple recording sites, demonstrating the utility of passive acoustic monitoring to assess patterns in sperm whale occurrence across broad spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - 1. Research in the western Mediterranean has shown that sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) are present as small, globally distinct populations that face numerous threats.
   2. The eastern Mediterranean is not well studied, and few surveys have investigated the composition of cetacean communities. In this study, visual-acoustic surveys were conducted off the coast of Israel during April-May 2022 to characterize the cetacean community.
   3. Sperm whales (three encounters), Cuvier's beaked whales (one encounter), bottlenose dolphins (one encounter (Tursiops truncatus)) and unidentified delphinids (17 encounters) were acoustically detected.
   4. Sperm whales were foraging similar to 10 km off Haifa, at 370-1220 m deep and social vocalizations (codas) corresponded to the Mediterranean dialect. One immature male that was photographed is known from 12 previous encounters in the Ligurian Sea, indicating a west-east movement of approximately 2800 km.
   5. Automated passive acoustic monitoring of narrow, relatively shallow areas such as the Sicily Channel could provide an opportunity to reduce mortality of individuals making long-distance movements within Mediterranean basins. Israeli waters provide habitat for cetaceans, with two threatened subpopulations-sperm and Cuvier's beaked whales-that are negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities, including those that introduce underwater noise. More data are needed on densities of these deep-water species, and an evaluation of the threats faced in the wider Levantine basin.

AB  - Knowledge of cetacean occurrence and behaviour in southern African waters is limited, and passive acoustic monitoring has the potential to address this gap efficiently. Seasonal acoustic occurrence and diel-vocalizing patterns of sperm whales in relation to environmental conditions are described here using passive acoustic monitoring data collected off the west coast of South Africa. Four autonomous acoustic recorders (AARs) were deployed on 3 oceanographic moorings from July 2014 to January 2017. Sperm whale clicks were detected year round in most recording sites, with peaks in acoustic occurrence in summer and late winter through spring. Diel-vocalizing patterns were detected in winter, spring and summer. Higher percentages of sperm whale clicks were recorded by AARs deployed at 1100 m water depth compared to those concurrently deployed at 850 and 4500 m, likely inferring that the whales exhibited some preference to water depths around 1100 m. Acoustic propagation modelling suggested a maximum detection range of 83 km in winter for sperm whale clicks produced at 1100 m. Random forest models classified daylight regime, sea surface height anomaly and month of the year as the most important predictors of sperm whale acoustic occurrence. The continuous acoustic occurrence of sperm whales suggests that the study area supports large biomasses of prey to sustain this species' food requirements year round. This is the first study to describe the seasonal acoustic occurrence and diel-vocalizing patterns of sperm whales off the west coast of South Africa, extending knowledge of the species previously available only through whaling records.

AB  - We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetacean species in the Gulf of Alaska region. BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the known ranges of small and resident populations. This National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA)-led effort uses structured expert elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA's BIAs for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for these BIAs came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification data; and/or prey studies. A total of 20 BIAs were identified, delineated, and scored for six species: beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Of the 20 total BIAs, there were two small and resident populations, one migratory, and 17 feeding areas; no reproductive BIAs were identified. An additional five watch list areas were identified, a new feature to the second version of BIAs. In addition to more comprehensive narratives and maps, the BIA II products improve upon the first version by creating metadata tables and incorporating a scoring and labeling system which improves quantification and standardization of BIAs within and across regions. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans.

AB  - Simple Summary Little effort has been made to conserve cetaceans in the Miaodao Archipelago, which is hindered by a lack of baseline data on their species and distribution patterns. Using a passive acoustic monitoring technique, we found a decrease in cetacean diversity; the East Asian finless porpoise is the sole cetacean species that can be reliability detected in this area, and their distribution exhibits seasonally patterns. Further research and conservation measures are needed to protect cetaceans in this area. Once an important cetacean habitat, the Miaodao Archipelago has been altered by human-induced disturbances over several decades. While cetacean diversity is known to have decreased, no recent data on species diversity around Miaodao are known to exist. Capitalizing on the high vocal activity of cetaceans, three passive acoustic surveys, including towed and stationary types, were undertaken to detect the presence of species-specific vocalizations in May 2021, October 2021, and July 2022, as most cetacean sightings occurred during May and August in recent years. The results revealed that the East Asian finless porpoise is the sole cetacean species that can be reliably observed around the archipelago, as no other species were detected. The acoustic data also revealed potentially clumped distributions of finless porpoises with some seasonal variation. While not acoustically detected during any of the surveys, humpback whales, minke whales, and killer whales have been visually sighted in the region. The lack of acoustic detection of these species suggests that they are likely to be temporary visitors to the region, or at least exhibit strong seasonality in their presence within the region. These new data provide the latest snapshot of cetacean presence around the Miaodao Archipelago that can help inform future research and conservation.

KW  - SOUND
AB  - Passive acoustic detection is being increasingly used to monitor visually cryptic cetaceans such as Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) that may be especially sensitive to underwater sound. The efficacy of passive acoustic detection is traditionally characterized by the probability of detecting the animal's sound emissions as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. The probability of detection can be predicted using accepted, but not necessarily accurate, models of the underwater acoustic environment. Recent field studies combining far-field hydrophone arrays with on-animal acoustic recording tags have yielded the location and time of each sound emission from tagged animals, enabling in-situ measurements of the probability of detection. However, tagging studies can only take place in calm seas and so do not reflect the full range of ambient noise conditions under which passive acoustic detection may be used. Increased surface-generated noise from wind and wave interaction degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of animal sound receptions at a given distance leading to a reduction in probability of detection. This paper presents a case study simulating the effect of increasing ambient noise on detection of M. densirostris foraging clicks recorded from a tagged whale swimming in the vicinity of a deep-water, bottom-mounted hydrophone array.

AB  - 1. The New York Bight is an extremely busy maritime region, with extensive shipping traffic and commercial fishing activity. It is part of the migratory ranges of a number of cetacean species, and includes threats from ship strikes, noise exposure, and line entanglements. Previous cetacean surveys of the Bight offer limited information on cetacean occurrence and distribution in the region, having been restricted to visual sightings with limited temporal coverage. 2. A passive acoustic monitoring survey was conducted over a 258-day period to broaden understanding of the seasonal occurrences of blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), and North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales during late summer, autumn, winter, and early spring. Stationary acoustic recorders were positioned near the entrance to New York Harbour and as a linear transect extending from Long Island to the continental shelf edge. 3. Blue, fin, and right whales were detected on 11%, 100%, and 16% of the survey days, respectively. Blue whales were detected offshore during January, February, and March. Fin whales were detected offshore every day, and less often near-shore. Right whales occurred sporadically during every month, but were most often detected at near-shore recorders between late February and mid-May. 4. Based on the acoustic data alone, it is unclear exactly how these species are using this habitat, although it is clear that they occur in the area longer than was previously thought. Thus, management practices should incorporate this extended seasonal presence to mitigate any effects on the whales from shipping and fishing activities.

AB  - The presence of beaked whales in mass-strandings coincident with navy maneuvers has prompted the development of methods to detect these cryptic animals. Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, produce distinctive echolocation clicks during long foraging dives making passive acoustic detection a possibility. However, performance of passive acoustic monitoring depends upon the source level, beam pattern, and clicking behavior of the whales. In this study, clicks recorded from Digital acoustic Tags (DTags) attached to four M. densirostris were linked to simultaneous recordings from an 82-hydrophone bottom-mounted array to derive the source level and beam pattern of the clicks, as steps towards estimating their detectability. The mean estimated on-axis apparent source level for the four whales was 201 dB(rms97). The mean 3 dB beamwidth and directivity index, estimated from sequences of clicks directed towards the far-field hydrophones, were 13 degrees and 23 dB, respectively. While searching for prey, Blainville's beaked whales scan their heads horizontally at a mean rate of 3.6 degrees/s over an angular range of some +/-10 degrees. Thus, while the DI indicates a narrow beam, the area of ensonification over a complete foraging dive is large given the combined effects of body and head movements associated with foraging.

AB  - Distribution models are needed to understand spatiotemporal patterns in cetacean occurrence and to mitigate anthropogenic impacts. Shipboard line-transect visual surveys are the standard method for estimating abundance and describing the distributions of cetacean populations. Ship-board surveys provide high spatial resolution but lack temporal resolution and seasonal coverage. Stationary passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) employs acoustic sensors to sample point locations nearly continuously, providing high temporal resolution in local habitats across days, seasons and years. To evaluate whether cross-platform data synthesis can improve distribution predictions, models were developed for Cuvier's beaked whales, sperm whales, and Risso's dolphins in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico using two different methods: generalized additive models and neural networks. Neural networks were able to learn unspecified interactions between drivers. Models that incorporated PAM datasets out-performed models trained on visual data alone, and joint models performed best in two out of three cases. The modeling results suggest that, when taken together, multiple species distribution models using a variety of data types may support conservation and management of Gulf of Mexico cetacean populations by improving the understanding of temporal and spatial species distribution trends.

AB  - Sowerby's beaked whale is a deep-diving cetacean species specialized to live in the deep waters of the North Atlantic, including offshore Irish waters. Sightings of Sowerby's beaked whales in this area are infrequent and a substantial increase in our knowledge of their presence comes from recent static acoustic monitoring (SAM) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). However, most information on this species has been derived from stranding records, which provide opportunistic insights into this elusive species' cryptic life history. Here we report on the live stranding of a 1200 mm long neonate and an adult 5 m female Sowerby's beaked whale in July 2015 and on the stranding of a 4.9 m pregnant female in September 2020 with a 495 mm long male foetus in the south-west of Ireland. These stranding events provide an important insight into the reproductive life history of this species and provide further evidence that Sowerby's beaked whales calve in offshore Irish waters.

AB  - The sea is home to a myriad of marine animal species, many of which use sound as a primary means of communication, navigation and foraging. Of particular interest are the Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) of the cetacean family. Massive commercial whaling prior to 1960 brought the species close to extinction and its population still remains very low. Passive acoustic monitoring of baleen whales has recently been used to provide long-term information about their presence and behavior, and provides an attractive complement to traditional visual based monitoring. In this work we present a frequency domain based algorithm developed for extracting the frequency contours of the dominant harmonic in tonal calls of blue whales (B and D cans). The algorithm uses a two pass approach to contour extraction. In the first pass, partial candidate contours are formed, followed by a second pass which uses the partial information to construct complete contours. When evaluated on a one hour labeled recording, the algorithm had 90% recall and 76% precision.

AB  - The development and broad use of passive acoustic monitoring techniques have the potential to help assessing the large-scale influence of artificial noise on marine organisms and ecosystems. Deep-sea observatories have the potential to play a key role in understanding these recent acoustic changes. LIDO (Listening to the Deep Ocean Environment) is an international project that is allowing the real-time long-term monitoring of marine ambient noise as well as marine mammal sounds at cabled and standalone observatories. Here, we present the overall development of the project and the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques to provide the scientific community with real-time data at large spatial and temporal scales. Special attention is given to the extraction and identification of high frequency cetacean echolocation signals given the relevance of detecting target species, e.g. beaked whales, in mitigation processes, e.g. during military exercises.

AB  - Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications.

AB  - Information on the species diversity and habitat use of cetaceans can help us to understand the community ecology of marine top predators. Passive acoustic monitoring has been widely applied in the cetacean research in recent years since cetacean vocalizations can be effectively detected through automatic detection methods. However, species identification based on tonal sounds remains challenging due to the high intra-specific variation. In order to examine the seasonal changing pattern of species diversity and species-specific occurrence, we applied an automatic detection and classification algorithm on the acoustic recordings collected from the marine cable hosted observatory (MACHO) off the northeastern Taiwan. The representative frequencies of cetacean tonal sounds within 4.5-48 kHz were detected by the local-max detector. Twelve statistical feature vectors were extracted based on the distribution of representative frequency and were used in the discriminant function analysis to classify four cetacean groups. The correct classification rate was 72.2% based on the field recording collected from onboard surveys. Analysis on one-year MACHO recordings revealed that the species diversity was highest in winter and spring. In addition, different patterns of seasonal occurrence were observed between different cetacean groups. Short finned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins were the most common species, they mainly occurred in winter and summer. False killer whales were mostly detected in winter and spring. On the contrary, smaller delphinids, such as spinner dolphins, spotted dolphins, and Fraser's dolphins were mainly detected in summer. Bottlenose dolphins represent the least common species. The current results show that the seasonal occurrence of multiple cetacean species can be effectively monitored by a marine observatory. In the future, the biodiversity, species-specific habitat use, and inter-specific interaction of cetaceans can be investigated through an underwater acoustic monitoring network.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be used to monitor acoustic presence and behaviour of cetaceans, providing continuous, long-term, and seasonally unbiased data. The efficiency of PAM methods, however, depends on the ability to detect and correctly interpret acoustic signals. The upcall is the most prevalent vocalization of the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) and is commonly used as a basis for PAM studies on this species. However, previous studies report difficulties to distinguish between southern right whale upcalls and similar humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) vocalizations with certainty. Recently, vocalizations comparable to southern right whale upcalls were detected off Elephant Island, Antarctica. In this study, these vocalizations were structurally analyzed, and call characteristics were compared to (a) confirmed southern right whale vocalizations recorded off Argentina and (b) confirmed humpback whale vocalizations recorded in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean. Based on call features, detected upcalls off Elephant Island could be successfully attributed to southern right whales. Measurements describing slope and bandwidth were identified as the main differences in call characteristics between species. With the newly gained knowledge from this study, additional data can be analyzed providing further insight into temporal occurrence and migratory behaviour of southern right whales in Antarctic waters.

AB  - Although four species of odontocete and four species of baleen whale have been recorded in Prydz Bay, their vocalizations have been rarely investigated. Underwater vocalizations were recorded during March 2017 in Prydz Bay, Antarctica. Bio-duck sounds, downsweeps, inverted "u" shape signals, whistles, pulsed sounds, and broadband clicks were recorded. Bio-duck sounds and downsweeps were associated with Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) based on visual observations. Similarities between inverted "u" shape signals, biphonic calls, and clicks with vocalizations previously described for killer whales (Orcinus orca) lead us believe the presence of Antarctic killer whales. According to sound structures, signal characteristics, and recording location, Antarctic type C killer whales were the most probable candidates to produce these detected calls. These represent the first detection of inverted "u" shape signals in Antarctic waters, and the first report of Antarctic killer whale in Prydz Bay based on passive acoustic monitoring. The co-existence of Antarctic minke and killer whales may imply that minke whales can detect differences between the sounds of mammal-eating and fish-eating killer whales. Our descriptions of these underwater vocalizations contribute to the limited body of information regarding the distribution and acoustic behavior of cetaceans in Prydz Bay.

AB  - Advances in mobile autonomous platforms for oceanographic sensing, including gliders and deep-water profiling floats, have provided new opportunities for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of cetaceans. However, there are few direct comparisons of these mobile autonomous systems to more traditional methods, such as stationary bottom moored recorders. Cross-platform comparisons are necessary to enable interpretation of results across historical and contemporary surveys that use different recorder types, and to identify potential biases introduced by the platform. Understanding tradeoffs across recording platforms informs best practices for future cetacean monitoring efforts. This study directly compares the PAM capabilities of a glider (Seaglider) and a deep-water profiling float (QUEphone) to a stationary seafloor system (High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package, or HARP) deployed simultaneously over a 2 week period in the Catalina Basin, California, United States. Two HARPs were deployed 4 km apart while a glider and deep-water float surveyed within 20 km of the HARPs. Acoustic recordings were analyzed for the presence of multiple cetacean species, including beaked whales, delphinids, and minke whales. Variation in acoustic occurrence at 1-min (beaked whales only), hourly, and daily scales were examined. The number of minutes, hours, and days with beaked whale echolocation clicks were variable across recorders, likely due to differences in the noise floor of each recording system, the spatial distribution of the recorders, and the short detection radius of such a high-frequency, directional signal type. Delphinid whistles and clicks were prevalent across all recorders, and at levels that may have masked beaked whale vocalizations. The number and timing of hours and days with minke whale boing sounds were nearly identical across recorder types, as was expected given the relatively long propagation distance of boings. This comparison provides evidence that gliders and deep-water floats record cetaceans at similar detection rates to traditional stationary recorders at a single point. The spatiotemporal scale over which these single hydrophone systems record sounds is highly dependent on acoustic features of the sound source. Additionally, these mobile platforms provide improved spatial coverage which may be critical for species that produce calls that propagate only over short distances such as beaked whales.

AB  - Although the wider Eastern Tropical Pacific has been systematically surveyed during summer/fall, relatively little effort has focused on shelf and slope waters of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Such data are useful for establishing baseline information and assessing potential changes in cetacean occurrence and distribution relative to natural (e.g., El Nifio-Southern Oscillation, climate change) and anthropogenic factors. A visual acoustic survey for cetaceans occurred as part of a monitoring and mitigation program during an academic geophysical seismic study off Nicaragua and Costa Rica, during November-December 2004. Approximately 2 067 cetaceans representing at least seven species were seen in 75 groups during 373 h (3416 km) of daytime observations from the seismic research vessel (R/V) Maurice Ewing. The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) were the most frequently sighted species (30 % of all groups sighted); both were seen in shelf waters < 100 m deep and in slope waters. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus; 10 % of sightings) was the third most frequently sighted species and was only seen in water > 100 m deep. In addition, sightings were made of spinner dolphins (S. longirostris), short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), and unidentified dolphins and whales. Unconfirmed sightings of a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and a pod of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) were also recorded. An additional six groups of dolphins (50 % confirmed to species, all pantropical spotted dolphins) were made during 187 h (1549 km) of observation effort during darkness, two of which were detected within 30 m of the vessel bow using a night vision device. A total of 217 cetacean detections occurred during 633 h of passive acoustic monitoring. A small concentration of 12 humpback whales was seen in eight groups, and two humpbacks were recorded singing in the Gulf of Fonseca on 9 December 2004. To our knowledge, such concentrations of humpback whales, particularly singing humpbacks, have not been previously reported in this specific area. In addition, a humpback mother-calf pair, likely from the Northern Hemisphere population, was seen off Northern Costa Rica on 25 November 2004. Although cetacean sighting rates were significantly different during seismic and non-seismic periods even when corrected for differential detection probability related to sea conditions, our survey results do provide information to address previous data gaps on cetacean occurrence in shelf and slope waters off the Pacific coast of Central America during late fall.

AB  - We integrated existing published and unpublished information to delineate Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for fin, gray, North Pacific right, and humpback whales, and belugas in U.S. waters of the Gulf of Alaska. BIAs are delineated for feeding, migratory corridors, and small and resident populations. Supporting evidence for these BIAs came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; traditional ecological knowledge; photo-and genetic-identification data; whaling data, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents; prey studies; and anecdotal information from fishermen. The geographic extent of the BIAs in this region ranged from approximately 900 to 177,000 km(2). Information gaps identified during this assessment include (1) reproductive areas for fin, gray, and North Pacific right whales; (2) detailed information on the migration routes of all species; (3) detailed information on the migratory timing of all species except humpback whales; and (4) cetacean distribution, density, and behavior in U.S. Gulf of Alaska waters off the continental shelf. To maintain their utility, these BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.

AB  - The distribution, abundance, and habitat of cryptic cetacean species such as beaked whales and dwarf/pygmy sperm whales (Kogia spp.) are challenging to study due to their long dive times and/or very limited surface behavior. Even less is known in minimally studied and remote regions, including the Mariana Archipelago and parts of the broader western Pacific. In 2018, we deployed a network of eight Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders (DASBRs) on the west side of the Mariana Archipelago with the goal of examining the distribution and habitat of beaked whales and Kogia spp. in this region using passive acoustic monitoring. Concurrently, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data were collected within the drift area and combined with satellite oceanographic data to build Ensemble Random Forest Models to identify specific oceanographic features that determine the distribution of these species. DASBRs deployed at locations ranging from 13 degrees N to 18 degrees N generally drifted from east to west between the Mariana Archipelago and the West Mariana Ridge. Spectral and temporal characteristics of echolocation signals were used to identify the presence of beaked whales and Kogia spp. species. This dataset contained frequency modulated (FM) pulses characteristic of Longman's (Indopacetus pacificus), Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), and Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) beaked whales, as well as the unidentified beaked whale FM pulse known as the "BWC," along with narrow-band high frequency clicks from Kogia spp. The detection rate was substantially higher for all species on the five tracks in the region north of 15.5 degrees N than for those drifts occurring farther south. Species distribution models suggest that differences in the oceanographic characteristics between the northern and southern regions may impact foraging opportunities, possibly explaining the specific ecological niche for these species within this water mass. This is the first study of the distribution of cryptic cetacean species within the wider Mariana Archipelago region. We demonstrate that autonomous drifting acoustic recorders, combined with environmental sampling and remote satellite data are a powerful tool for studying the habitat dependent distribution of cryptic cetacean species.

AB  - Fixed passive acoustic monitoring can be used for long-term recording of vocalizing cetaceans. Both presence monitoring and animal density estimation requires the call rates and sound source levels of vocalizations produced by single animals. In this study, blue whale calls were recorded using acoustic bio-logging systems in Skjalfandi Bay off Husavik, Northeast Iceland, in June 2012. An accelerometer was attached to individual whales to monitor diving behavior. During 21 h recording two individuals, 8 h 45 min and 13 h 2 min, respectively, 105 and 104 lunge feeding events and four calls were recorded. All recorded calls were down-sweep calls ranging from 105 to 48Hz. The sound duration was 1-2 s. The source level was estimated to be between 158 and 169 dB re 1 mu Pa rms, assuming spherical sound propagation from the possible sound source location to the tag. The observed sound production rates and source levels of individual blue whales during feeding were extremely small compared with those observed previously in breeding grounds. The feeding whales were nearly acoustically invisible. The function of calls during feeding remains unknown. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea provides habitat for globally threatened cetaceans. The Hellenic Trench is an Important Marine Mammal Area, providing core habitat for sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus and Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris. Surveys have characterized distributions of these species in near-shore areas (< 2000 m deep). Sparse survey effort in deeper waters during winter has allowed speculation that it is not an important habitat in winter. We used passive acoustic monitoring from towed arrays to document cetaceans during summer and winter, covering 18 366 km of trackline off the Peloponnese and Crete. We confirmed the acoustic presence of 5 odontocetes: sperm whales (n = 49 encounters; mean depth (<(x)over bar>): 3360 m; range (R): 1250 to 4210 m), Cuvier's beaked whales (n = 4; (x) over bar: 3070 m; R: 1970 to 3770 m), Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus (n = 5; (x) over bar: 3340 m; R: 2250 to 4440 m), striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba (n = 2; (x) over bar: 2980 m; R: 2490 to 3470 m) and rough-toothed dolphins Steno bredanensis (n = 1; 3650 m). We also encountered 224 unidentified delphinids, including a potential blackfish (3020 m). We confirmed that these species are present in the Hellenic Trench throughout the year. Given the impact of multiple threats on sperm and Cuvier's beaked whales in the Hellenic Trench, we suggest that policymakers follow the precautionary approach in managing human activities in the area. Ongoing seismic surveys, hydrocarbon extraction and uncontrolled shipping could have potentially negative effects on these species at the population level and we advise caution in permitting such activities in future.

AB  - In the frame of the European Sea-floor Observatory Network (ESONET) and in preparation of the Demonstration Mission Listening to the Deep-Ocean Environment (LIDO) algorithms for the automated real-time detection, classification and localisation of cetaceans have been developed.
   Such Passive Acoustic Monitoring techniques have the potential to play a key role in cetaceans' conservation for they allow a non-invasive study of their behaviour, a better knowledge of their population dynamics, and a better understanding of their dynamic relationship with their environment. This paper investigates the development of efficient and accurate techniques to be used as the basis of a localisation module for an automated real-time Passive Acoustic Monitoring system.
   An opportunity to assess the capabilities of the developed localisation modules was given by recordings collected with a bottom-mounted (around 2080 m depth) tetrahedral compact hydrophone array located offshore the port of Catania (Sicily) during the NEMO-ONDE campaign in the years 2005-2006 by INFN and CIBRA [2]. A well-known class of methods for acoustic source localisation is based on time differences of arrival (TDOA). Its capabilities have shown to be useful even in adverse situations (i.e., few sensors, high noise levels and/or poor calibration). A second class of methods, the space-time methods, originated in underwater applications such as sonar but reached its most significant achievements over the last 20 years in digital communications with recent progress in the treatment of broad-band signals. These developments are here revisited under the scope of the localisation and tracking of cetacean vocalisations.
   Various broadband space-time methods were implemented and allowed to map the sound radiated during the detected clicks and to consequently localise both sperm whales and vessels. Hybrid methods were also developed which improved the robustness of space-time methods to noise and reverberation and reduced processing time. In most cases, the small variance obtained for these estimates lessened the necessity of additional statistical clustering. Even though not independently confirmed by sightings, the tracks derived in the proposed frame can be considered to be consistent with the known movements of sperm whales and vessels.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring systems are used to study cetaceans through the sounds they produce. Among them, toothed whales emit sequences of acoustic impulses having a rhythmic pattern. As they generally live in pods, click trains from several individuals are often interleaved and recorded together with additional natural or anthropogenic impulsive sources. This paper presents an algorithm that uses the rhythmic properties of odontocete click trains for detecting rhythmic impulse trains embedded in other impulse sounds and de-interleaving click trains from simultaneous clicking odontocetes. The contributions of the article are: (1) a method to detect the presence/absence of rhythmic click trains and to characterize the time - Inter Click Interval (ICI) pattern of click trains; (2) an analytical analysis of the performances of this method (jitter, length of click trains); (3) the demonstration of its efficiency on real data with wild beluga whales recorded in Canada.

AB  - We integrated existing published and unpublished information to delineate Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for bowhead, fin, gray, North Pacific right, and humpback whales and belugas in U.S. waters of the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea. Supporting evidence for these BIAs came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; traditional ecological knowledge; photo-and genetic-identification data; and whaling data, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents. The geographic extent of the BIAs in this region ranged from approximately 1,200 to 373,000 km(2). Information gaps identified during this assessment include (1) reproductive areas for all species; (2) detailed information on the migration routes and timing of all species; and (3) cetacean distribution, density, and behavior in U.S. Bering Sea waters off the continental shelf. To maintain their utility, these BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.

AB  - Habitat use by the endangered Mediterranean sperm whale subpopulation remains poorly understood, especially in winter. The sustained presence of oceanographic autonomous underwater vehicles in the area presents an opportunity to improve observation effort, enabling collection of valuable sperm whale distribution data, which may be crucial to their conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring loggers were deployed on vertically profiling oceanographic gliders surveying the north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2012-2013 and June 2014. Sperm whale echolocation `usual click' trains, characteristic of foraging activity, were detected and classified from the recordings, providing information about the presence of sperm whales along the glider tracks. Widespread presence of sperm whales in the north-western Mediterranean Sea was confirmed. Winter observations suggest different foraging strategies between the Ligurian Sea, where mobile and scattered individuals forage at all times of day, and the Gulf of Lion, where larger aggregations target intense oceanographic features in the open ocean such as fronts and mixing events, with reduced acoustic presence at dawn. This study demonstrates the ability to successfully observe sperm whale behaviour from passive acoustic monitoring gliders. We identified possible mission design changes to optimize data collected from passive acoustic monitoring glider surveys and significantly improve sperm whale population monitoring and habitat use.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is crucial to expanding the knowledge of beaked whales, including the northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) and Sowerby's beaked whale (Mesoplodon bidens). Existing descriptions of clicks produced by these species are limited by sample size, number of individuals recorded, and geographic scope. Data from multiple encounters in the western North Atlantic are used to provide a quantitative description of clicks produced by these species. Recordings from nine encounters with northern bottlenose whales in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were analyzed (N = 2239 clicks). The click type described had a median peak frequency of 25.9 kHz (10th-90th percentile range: 22.9-29.3 kHz), and a median inter-click interval (ICI) of 402 ms (N = 1917, 10th-90th percentile range: 290-524 ms). Recordings from 18 Sowerby's beaked whale encounters from Nova Scotia were analyzed (N = 762 clicks). The click type described had a median peak frequency of 65.8 kHz (10th-90th percentile range: 61.5-76.5 kHz), and a median ICI of 237 ms (N = 677, 10th-90th percentile range: 130-315 ms). These results will contribute to the development of methods to detect and classify beaked whale clicks to the species level, improving the effectiveness of PAM and enhancing scientific understanding and conservation efforts for cryptic and at-risk cetaceans.

AB  - Simple Summary The MARCET project (MAC/1.1b/149) aims to monitor the health status of resident cetaceans in Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) of particular interest for whale-watching in Macaronesia. This study, performed in the Canary Islands, Spain, used an autonomous surface vehicle (Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;)) to detect cetacean species using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). The automatic detections, via an acoustic acquisition system (Pambuoy), were compared with human detections for the same period. Although automatic detections were lower than human detections, this experiment has allowed the intercomparison of these two techniques, the system's performance, and its improvement by system re-setting. The present work, carried out with a close cooperation between biology, engineering, and oceanography, will integrate with veterinary sciences. The evaluation of ocean ecosystems, cetacean health, and human activities by means of advanced technologies will provide a novel and integrative One Health approach to current and future studies. Within the MARCET European project and community framework, a Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;) SV2 vehicle was deployed, equipped with a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) device, in a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). The soundscape was continuously recorded from 23 July 2018 until 30 July 2018 and was primarily used for marine mammal sound detection. This study aims to compare these automatically embedded detections from the Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;) with human expert detections. Furthermore, it provides an assessment of the performance of the automatic detector and discusses the use of this type of technology to monitor wildlife, particularly cetaceans. The MARCET project and this study are only possible due to the multidisciplinary integration of veterinary sciences, ecological, zoological, and biological knowledge and mechanical, communication, and electronics engineering. It represents an excellent example of new technologies, capacities, skills, and cutting-edge knowledge where veterinary science education and training should progressively be involved to contribute to the surveillance and control of ocean health.

AB  - The Gulf of Alaska is an important habitat for a diverse array of marine mammals, many of which were severely depleted by historical whaling. To study current cetacean distributions in this region, passive acoustic monitoring was used to detect species-specific call types between 2011 and 2015 at five locations spanning the continental shelf, slope, and offshore seamounts. Spatial and temporal detection patterns were examined for nine species to compare differences in behavior and habitat use. Mysticetes showed seasonal increases in calling that indicated possible behavioral shifts between feeding and breeding in blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales, and matched known migration timing of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Interannual changes in blue and fin whale calling may relate to the marine heat wave that began in 2013 and lasted through the end of the monitoring period. Odontocete detections revealed unique spatial distributions, with killer whales (Orcinus orca) most common on the continental shelf and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) most common on the continental slope, where detections occurred year-round. Beaked whales showed both spatial and temporal separation: Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii) detections were highest at Quinn Seamount in the spring, Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) at Pratt Seamount in winter, and Stejneger's (Mesoplodon stejnegeri) on the continental slope in the fall. The year-round presence of many species highlights the ecological importance of the Gulf of Alaska and the spatiotemporal information reported here should inform future conservation efforts.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become a popular method for studying both marine mammal behavior and distribution, especially among cetaceans. The Antarctic minke whale ( Balaenoptera bonaerensis ) occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, and our knowledge concerning its vocal behavior is very limited. Along the coast of Uruguay, minke whales constitute one of the species with the most stranding data collected. Until now, sounds of Antarctic minke whales had never been recorded off the Uruguayan coast. Two different bio-duck call types were recorded along the Atlantic Ocean and the Rio de la Plata River coasts by employing PAM stations off the coast of Uruguay in five different positions. One call was recorded off the Atlantic coast, and the four other calls were recorded along the Rio de la Plata River, including the classic bio-duck call. In addition to the aforementioned bio-duck call, evidence of a novel call, the bio-duck pulse train, was found. This call was produced in an environment very different from the oceanic environment. The bioduck pulse train has never been described in previous works, making the findings of the present work all the more novel.

AB  - Mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), used for antisubmarine warfare (ASW), has been associated with multiple beaked whale (BW) mass stranding events. Multinational naval ASW exercises have used MFAS offshore of the Mariana Archipelago semi-annually since 2006. We report BW and MFAS acoustic activity near the islands of Saipan and Tinian from March 2010 to November 2014. Signals from Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), and a third unidentified BW species, were detected throughout the recording period. Both recorders documented MFAS on 21 August 2011 before two Cuvier's beaked whales stranded on 22-23 August 2011. We compared the history of known naval operations and BW strandings from the Mariana Archipelago to consider potential threats to BW populations. Eight BW stranding events between June 2006 and January 2019 each included one to three animals. Half of these strandings occurred during or within 6 days after naval activities, and this co-occurrence is highly significant. We highlight strandings of individual BWs can be associated with ASW, and emphasize the value of ongoing passive acoustic monitoring, especially for beaked whales that are difficult to visually detect at sea. We strongly recommend more visual monitoring efforts, at sea and along coastlines, for stranded cetaceans before, during and after naval exercises.

AB  - From October 2011 to May 2012, we conducted the first marine mammal surveys of Okinawan waters, using line-transect vessel surveys and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). We obtained 913 km of visual survey effort, and 1,039 cumulative hours of PAM data from around the island. Only a single on-effort sighting was made (of two common bottlenose dolphins [Tursiops truncatus]) during visual surveys, and acoustic detection rates were generally low, with the exception of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) observations during their winter/spring breeding season. The apparent low density of at least some marine mammals observed in Okinawan waters may be due to the depletion of coastal populations. We believe this could result from many decades of heavy and largely-uncontrolled hunting of small cetaceans in waters around the island.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers considerable potential for density estimation of cryptic cetaceans, such as beaked whales. However, comparative studies on the accuracy of PAM density estimates from these species are lacking. Concurrent, low-cost drifting PAM, with SoundTraps suspended at 200 m depth, and land-based sightings, were conducted off the Canary Islands. Beaked whale density was estimated using a cue-count method, with click production rate and the probability of click detection derived from digital acoustic recording tags (DTags), and distance sampling techniques, adapted to fixed-point visual surveys. Of 32 870 detections obtained throughout 206 h of PAM recordings, 68% were classified as "certain" beaked whale clicks. Acoustic detection probability was 0.15 [coefficient variation (CV) 0.24] and click production rate was 0.46 clicks s(-1) (CV 0.05). PAM density estimates were in the range of 21.5 or 48.6 whales per 1000 km(2) [CV 0.50 or 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.7-22.4 or 47-50.9), depending on whether "uncertain" clicks were considered. Density estimates from concurrent sightings resulted in 33.7 whales per 1000 km(2) (CV 0.77, 95% CI 8.9-50.5). Cue-count PAM methods under application provide reliable estimates of beaked whale density, over relatively long time periods and in realistic scenarios, as these match the concurrent density estimates obtained from visual observations.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a common method for detection of endangered North Atlantic right whales. This study reports on the acoustic behavior of right whales on the winter calving grounds to assess their acoustic detectability in this habitat. In addition to known call types, previously undescribed low amplitude short broadband signals were detected from lactating females with calves. The production of higher amplitude tonal calls occurred at lower rates for lactating females than from other age/sex classes suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may be less effective in detecting mother-calf pairs in this critical habitat area.

AB  - The "ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative" (ASI) is a pilot programme aimed at establishing an integrated and coordinated monitoring system for cetaceans across the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic (hereafter "ACCOBAMS") area. Conducted in coordination with Mediterranean coastal countries, it supports the implementation of European and regional policies, in particular the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Ecosystem Approach process. In summer 2018, a synoptic survey was conducted across the Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area, combining visual monitoring from aircrafts with visual and passive acoustic monitoring from vessels. Species density and abundance were estimated through design-based approach in a line-transect sampling framework. Based on data arising from the aerial survey only, uncorrected design-based abundance was obtained for striped (N=426,744, CV=0.13), common (N=65,359, CV=0.4), bottlenose (N=63,333, CV=0.17), and Risso ' s dolphins (N=26,006, CV=0.3), Cuvier's beaked whales (N=2,929, CV=0.4) and long-finned pilot whales (N=5,540 CV=0.4). A merged category of either striped or common dolphins resulted in 212,828 individuals (CV=0.26). Fin whales abundance of 1,749 animals (CV=0.3) was corrected for both availability and perception biases and resulted in 3,282 (CV=0.31). The ASI survey offers an overall picture of the distribution and abundance of cetaceans throughout the Mediterranean basin, providing robust estimates to be considered as a baseline for future regional systematic monitoring programmes. The ASI survey is the first step towards establishing a long-term monitoring program across the entire ACCOBAMS area, and, as such, it sets the basis for further future basin-wide monitoring efforts using systematic, shared, coordinated and comparable methods. The information gathered will further enhance knowledge on cetacean status, facilitating the development of informed conservation and mitigation measures, as well as supporting the implementation of international obligations. Furthermore, the outcomes of this survey will support both place- and threat-based conservation efforts in the ACCOBAMS area, through the identification of Important Marine Mammal Areas and Cetacean Critical Habitats. Here the results of the ASI survey are presented and discussed alongside proposed management and conservation actions aimed at ensuring the persistence of cetacean populations in the region.

AB  - We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetaceans in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region. BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the known ranges of small and resident populations. This effort, the second led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA's BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for BIA II came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification data; whaling data, including stomach and fecal contents; prey studies; and genetics. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, the BIA II products incorporate a scoring and labeling system, which will improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans. In the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region, a total of 19 BIAs were identified, delineated, and scored for seven species, including bowhead, North Pacific right, gray, humpback, fin, and sperm whales, and belugas. These include one hierarchical BIA for belugas that consists of one localized "child" BIA within an overarching "parent" BIA. There were 15 feeding, 3 migratory, and 1 small and resident population BIAs; no reproductive BIAs were identified. In some instances, information existed about a species' use of a particular area and time, but the information was insufficient to confidently delineate the candidate BIA; in those cases, the candidate BIA was added to a watch list. A total of 22 watch list areas were identified and delineated for 10 species, including all species mentioned above and minke whales, harbor porpoises, and Dall's porpoises. There were 15 feeding, 4 migratory, 2 reproductive, and 1 small and resident population watch list areas. Some BIAs and watch list areas were transboundary between the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region and the Arctic region.

AB  - The recently named Rice's whale in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most endangered whales in the world, and improved knowledge of spatiotemporal occurrence patterns is needed to support their recovery and conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring methods for determining spatiotemporal occurrence patterns require identifying the species' call repertoire. Rice's whale call repertoire remains unvalidated though several potential call types have been identified. This study uses sonobuoys and passive acoustic tagging to validate the source of potential call types and to characterize Rice's whale calls. During concurrent visual and acoustic surveys, acoustic-directed approaches were conducted to obtain visual verifications of sources of localized sounds. Of 28 acoustic-directed approaches, 79% led to sightings of balaenopterid whales, of which 10 could be positively identified to species as Rice's whales. Long-moan calls, downsweep sequences, and tonal-sequences are attributed to Rice's whales based on these matches, while anthropogenic sources are ruled out. A potential new call type, the low-frequency downsweep sequence, is characterized from tagged Rice's whale recordings. The validation and characterization of the Rice's whale call repertoire provides foundational information needed to use passive acoustic monitoring for better understanding and conservation of these critically endangered whales.

AB  - For vocal animals with distinctive calls, passive acoustic monitoring can be used to infer presence, distribution, and abundance provided that the calls and calling behaviour are known. Key to enabling quantitative acoustic surveys are calibrated recordings of identified species from which the source parameters of the sounds can be estimated. Obtaining such information from free-ranging aquatic animals such as toothed whales requires multi-element hydrophone arrays, the use of which is often constrained by cost, the logistical challenge of long cables, and the necessity for attachment to a boat or mooring in order to digitise and store multiple channels of high-sample rate audio data. Such challenges are compounded when collecting recordings or tracking the diving behaviour of deep-diving animals for which the array must be deployed at depth. Here we report the development of an autonomous drifting deep-water vertical passive acoustic array that uses readily available off-the-shelf components. This lightweight portable array can be deployed quickly and repeatedly to depths of up to 1000 m from a small boat. The array comprises seven ST-300 HF SoundTrap autonomous recorders equally spaced on an 84 m electrical-mechanical cable. The single-channel digital sound recordings were configured to allow for synchronisation in post-processing using an RS-485 timing signal logged by all channels every second. We outline how to assemble the array, and provide software for time-synchronising the acoustic recorders. To demonstrate the utility of the array, we present an example of short-finned pilot whale clicks localised on the deep-water (700 m) array configuration. This array method has broad applicability for the cost-effective study of source parameters, acoustic ecology, and diving behaviour of deep diving toothed whales, which are valuable not only to understand the sensory ecology of deep-diving cetaceans, but also to improve passive acoustic monitoring for conservation and management.

AB  - Several groups of Sowerby's beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens) were encountered on July 4, 2011, during a shipboard cetacean survey conducted off the eastern seaboard of the United States. Acoustic recordings were collected using a three-element towed hydrophone array. Many echolocation clicks were recorded during the encounter, but no tonal sounds were detected. A total of 2969 echolocation clicks were included in analyses of frequency and temporal characteristics. A Gaussian mixture model with four mixtures was fitted to the histogram of peak frequencies; four subsets of clicks were designated. The majority of clicks (n=2048) contained a median peak frequency of 33 kHz, while the others contained a median peak frequency of 25 kHz (n=324), 51 kHz (n=304), or 67 kHz (n=293). Most clicks did not contain a clear frequency-modulated upsweep, though some clicks exhibited a slight sweep from 30-36 kHz. Seven burst pulses were detected in the encounter, two of which were of high enough quality for detailed analysis. The acoustic characteristics of Sowerby's beaked whales have not previously been described; the current study will facilitate incorporation of these data into passive acoustic monitoring programs in the North Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - The economic relevance of Mysticetes has prompted marine ecologists and biologists to investigate this suborder of cetaceans. Mysticetes produce distinct vocal repertoires, which are recorded to analyse the behaviour of the species within its ecology. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a standard technique for tracking Mysticete movement and vocalisation. PAM collects enormous datasets over a long period, making it practically impossible to analyse with typical visual examination methods. Machine learning (ML) techniques such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) have made automatic recognition and analysis of extensive sound recordings possible. Nevertheless, the performance of ML tools is determined by the adopted feature extraction technique. Hence, this article introduces the method of principal component analysis (PCA) as a performance-efficient alternative feature extraction technique for detecting Mysticete vocalisations using HMM. Performance of the developed PCA-HMM detector is compared with state-of-the-art detectors using two different Mysticete vocalisations (Humpback whale songs and Bryde's whale short pulses). In both species, results show that the PCA-HMM detector has the best performance and is more suitable for use in real-time application since it exhibits less computational time complexity.

AB  - Passive acoustic tracking provides an unobtrusive method of studying the movement of sound-producing animals in the marine environment where traditional tracking methods may be costly or infeasible. We used passive acoustic tracking to characterize the fine-scale movements of singing humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground. Male humpback whales produce complex songs, a phenomenon that is well documented in tropical regions during the winter breeding season, but also occurs at higher latitudes during other times of year. Acoustic recordings were made throughout 2009 using an array of autonomous recording units deployed in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Song was recorded during spring and fall, and individual singing whales were localized and tracked throughout the array using a correlation sum estimation method on the time-synchronized recordings. Tracks were constructed for forty-three song sessions, revealing a high level of variation in movement patterns in both the spring and fall seasons, ranging from slow meandering to faster directional movement. Tracks were 30 min to 8 h in duration, and singers traveled distances ranging from 0.9 to 20.1 km. Mean swimming speed was 2.06 km/h (SD 0.95). Patterns and rates of movement indicated that most singers were actively swimming. In one case, two singers were tracked simultaneously, revealing a potential acoustic interaction. Our results provide a first description of the movements of singers on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground, and demonstrate the utility of passive acoustic tracking for studying the fine-scale movements of cetaceans within the behavioral context of their calls. These methods have further applications for conservation and management purposes, particularly by enhancing our ability to estimate cetacean densities using passive acoustic monitoring.

AB  - Due to recent advances in passive acoustic monitoring techniques, beaked whales are now more effectively detected acoustically than visually during vessel-based (e.g. line-transect) surveys. Beaked whales signals can be discriminated from those of other cetaceans by the unique characteristics of their echolocation clicks (e.g. duration >175 mu s, center frequencies between 30 and 40 kHz, inter-click intervals between 0.2 and 0.4 s and frequency upsweeps). Furthermore, these same characteristics make these signals ideal candidates for testing automated detection and classification algorithms. There are several different beaked whale automated detectors currently available for use. However, no comparative analysis of detectors exists. Therefore, comparison between studies and datasets is difficult. The purpose of this study was to test, validate, and compare algorithms for detection of beaked whales in acoustic line-transect survey data. Six different detection algorithms (XBAT, Ishmael, PAMGUARD, ERMA, GMM and FMCD) were evaluated and compared. Detection trials were run on three sample days of towed-hydrophone array recordings collected by NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) during which were confirmed visual sightings of beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon peruvianus). Detections also were compared to human verified acoustic detections for a subset of these data. In order to measure the probabilities of false detection, each detector was also run on three sample recordings containing clicks from another species: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). Qualitative and quantitative comparisons and the detection performance of the different algorithms are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cetaceans are ecologically important marine predators, and designating individuals to distinct populations can be challenging. Passive acoustic monitoring provides an approach to classify cetaceans to populations using their vocalizations. In the Hawaiian Archipelago, three genetically distinct, sympatric false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) populations coexist: a broadly distributed pelagic population and two island-associated populations, an endangered main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) population and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) population. The mechanisms that sustain the genetic separation between these overlapping populations are unknown but previous studies suggest that the acoustic diversity between populations may correspond to genetic differences. Here, we investigated whether false killer whale whistles could be correctly classified to population based on their characteristics to serve as a method of identifying populations when genetic or photographic-identification data are unavailable. Acoustic data were collected during line-transect surveys using towed hydrophone arrays. We measured 50 time and frequency parameters from whistles in 16 false killer whale encounters identified to population and used those measures to train and test random forest classification models. Random forest models that included three populations correctly classified 42% of individual whistles overall and resulted in a low kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.15, indicating low agreement between models, and the true population. Whistles from the MHI population showed the highest correct classification rate (52%) compared to pelagic and NWHI whistles (42 and 36%, respectively). Pairwise random forest models classifying pelagic and MHI whistles proved slightly more accurate (62% accuracy, kappa = 0.24), though a similar pelagic-NWHI model did not (56% accuracy, kappa = 0.12). Results suggest that the time-frequency whistle characteristics are not suitable to confidently classify encounters to a specific false killer whale population, although certain features of whistles produced by the endangered MHI population allow for overall higher classification accuracy. Inclusion of other vocalization types, such as echolocation clicks, and alternative whistle variables may improve correct classification success for these sympatric populations.

AB  - Large-amplitude internal solitary waves and internal tides are common oceanographic features in the South China Sea, which are generated in the Luzon Strait and propagate westward cross the basin area to the continental shelf and hit the east wage of DongSha Atoll. These waves shoal near Dongsha plateau and force nutrients and plankton and potentially entraining fishes, squids, and nutrients into the upper ocean, potentially foraged by cetaceans. Several studies have indicated that dolphins and whales may exploit prey aggregations associated with predictable but ephemeral ocean features, such as upwellings, fronts, and eddies. Prey availability for dolphins in the South China Sea influenced by the aggregative properties of internal waves is speculated and once was reported by one photo in 2005 in a benign sea state. This study presents evidence that internal waves attract and aggregate dolphins by using integrative analysis of current data, pressure data, and passive acoustic monitoring data.

AB  - Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) face threats from diminishing sea ice and increasing anthropogenic activities in the Arctic. Passive acoustic monitoring is the most effective means for monitoring their distribution and population trends, based on the detection of their calls. Passive acoustic monitoring, however, is influenced by the sound propagation environment and ambient noise levels, which impact call detection probability. Modeling and simulations were used to estimate detection probability for bowhead whale frequency-modulated calls in the 80-180 Hz frequency band with and without sea ice cover and under various noise conditions. Sound transmission loss for bowhead calls is substantially greater during ice-covered conditions than during open-water conditions, making call detection similar to 3 times more likely in open-water. Estimates of daily acoustic detection probability were used to compensate acoustic detections for sound propagation and noise effects in two recording datasets in the northeast Chukchi Sea, on the outer shelf and continental slope, collected between 2012 and 2013. The compensated acoustic density suggests a decrease in whale presence with the retreat of sea ice at these recording sites. These results highlight the importance of accounting for effects of the environment on ambient noise and acoustic propagation when interpreting results of passive acoustic monitoring.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be an effective tool for studying marine fauna in coral reefs and other ecosystems. We analyzed PAM data from 2006 to 2009 at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. We measured received sound pressure levels (SPL) over time within different frequency bands from 0 to 20 kHz, and used automated and manual techniques to detect parrotfish scrapes and cetacean vocalizations. SPLs were greatest overall in the snapping-shrimp-dominated bands above 2.5 kHz, and they increased at night and decreased during cold months. In frequency bands <1.5 kHz, containing mainly fish sounds (and seasonal whale song), SPL peaked at dawn and dusk. Humpback whale song was detected in December through April; occurrence was greater during 2008-2009 than 2006-2007, possibly reflecting an increase in whale density near FFS. Parrotfish bite sounds were detected year-round, and parrotfish foraged most actively during the afternoon. Dolphins were detected on 12-64 % of days per month, with low levels of activity during the day that increased in late afternoon and were highest at night. More frequent detections of dolphins in February/March 2007, October 2008, and February/March 2009 may correspond to pulses of food availability via the mesopelagic prey community. Minke whale "boing" sounds were detected from late October, with one or two peaks in the December-March period; during March 2009 minke whale calls were present nearly every day. The results provide the first long-term record of minke whales in the NWHI, and show the potential of PAM on remote coral reefs to monitor patterns over time of many trophic levels, from herbivores to apex predators.

KW  - RECORDINGS
AB  - Long-term fixed passive acoustic monitoring of cetacean populations is a logistical and technological challenge, often limited by the battery capacity of the autonomous recorders. Depending on the research scope and target species, temporal subsampling of the data may become necessary to extend the deployment period. This study explores the effects of different duty cycles on metrics that describe patterns of seasonal presence, call type richness richness, and daily call rate of three blue whale acoustics populations in the Southern Indian Ocean. Detections of blue whale calls from continuous acoustic data were subsampled with three different duty cycles of 50%, 33%, and 25% within listening periods ranging from 1 min to 6 h. Results show that reducing the percentage of recording time reduces the accuracy of the observed seasonal patterns as well as the estimation of daily call rate and call call type richness. For a specific duty cycle, short listening periods (5-30 min) are preferred to longer listening periods (1-6 h). The effects of subsampling are greater the lower the species' vocal activity or the shorter their periods of presence. These results emphasize the importance of selecting a subsampling scheme adapted to the target species. (c) 2024 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the North Pacific consistently range as far north as the Bering Sea. While occasional sightings of fin whales occur north of the Bering Strait, they are rarely documented north of 67A degrees N. However, a recent increase in passive acoustic monitoring has shown that fin whales are more prevalent in the Chukchi Sea than previously thought. During a 2012 field survey in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea, fin whale calls were detected on a DiFAR sonobuoy deployed at 71.575A degrees N, 157.823A degrees W, 50 km off Barrow near the mouth of Barrow Canyon. On August 27, 2012, approximately 30 fin whale downsweep calls were detected over an hour and a half, at bearings of approximately 270-290A degrees from the sonobuoy. Since only one sonobuoy was deployed, in situ localization of the calls was not possible. Post hoc range estimates using a combination of modal dispersion techniques, nonlinear time-domain warping, and geoacoustic inversion resulted in a source range estimate of less than 5 km. This location is approximately 280 and 365 km northeast of the previous closest acoustic detection and confirmed visual sighting of a fin whale, respectively. These results represent the farthest northeast record of fin whale calls in the Alaskan Arctic and illustrate the importance of continued passive acoustic monitoring in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has been an effective tool to study cetaceans in remote regions of the Arctic. Here, we advance methods to acoustically identify the only two Arctic toothed whales, the beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhal (Monodon monoceros), using echolocation clicks. Long-term acoustic recordings collected from moorings in Northwest Greenland were analyzed. Beluga and narwhal echolocation signals were distinguishable using spectrograms where beluga clicks had most energy >30 kHz and narwhal clicks had a sharp lower frequency limit near 20 kHz. Changes in one-third octave levels (TOL) between two pairs of one-third octave bands were compared from over one million click spectra. Narwhal clicks had a steep increase between the 16 and 25 kHz TOL bands that was absent in beluga click spectra. Conversely, beluga clicks had a steep increase between the 25 and 40 kHz TOL bands that was absent in narwhal click spectra. Random Forest classification models built using the 16 to 25 kHz and 25 to 40 kHz TOL ratios accurately predicted the species identity of 100% of acoustic events. Our findings support the use of echolocation TOL ratios in future automated click classifiers for acoustic monitoring of Arctic toothed whales and potentially for other odontocete species.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are top predators throughout the world's oceans. In the North Pacific, the species is divided into three ecotypes-resident (fish-eating), transient (mammal-eating), and offshore (largely shark-eating)-that are genetically and acoustically distinct and have unique roles in the marine ecosystem. In this study, we examined the year-round distribution of killer whales in the northern Gulf of Alaska from 2016 to 2020 using passive acoustic monitoring. We further described the daily acoustic residency patterns of three killer whale populations (southern Alaska residents, Gulf of Alaska transients, and AT1 transients) for one year of these data. Highest year-round acoustic presence occurred in Montague Strait, with strong seasonal patterns in Hinchinbrook Entrance and Resurrection Bay. Daily acoustic residency times for the southern Alaska residents paralleled seasonal distribution patterns. The majority of Gulf of Alaska transient detections occurred in Hinchinbrook Entrance in spring. The depleted AT1 transient killer whale population was most often identified in Montague Strait. Passive acoustic monitoring revealed that both resident and transient killer whales used these areas much more extensively than previously known and provided novel insights into high use locations and times for each population. These results may be driven by seasonal foraging opportunities and social factors and have management implications for this species.

AB  - Observations of cetaceans during the winter are difficult, if not impossible in some locations, yet their presence, habitat use, and behaviour during this period are important for conservation and management. Typically, observations come from vessel surveys, with citizen science networks increasingly adding significant sighting data. In compliment to this, acoustic data collection systems can be deployed to collect information remotely over long periods, and in almost any conditions. Here we describe how the combination of these data collection techniques works to fill knowledge gaps, with data from a wellestablished citizen science network, and a single passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) recorder integrated to identify killer whale presence during winter months in Clayoquot Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
   Together these data show the overwinter use of Clayoquot Sound by killer whales is greater than previously thought. During the study period, February 21 to April 25, 2015, the citizen science network noted 14 visual encounters ranging from Amphitrite Point to Hot Spring Cove, Vancouver Island. The PAM recorded 17 acoustic encounters within the 10 km detection radius of the recorder, deployed off Siwash Point, Flores Island. This included 15 encounters not recorded by the visual network. Both resident and Bigg's (transient) transient whale groups were recorded, although analysis of vocalizations determined that the majority of the encounters recorded acoustically were of northern resident killer whales. This may be a function of life history, with Bigg's killer whales typically noted to be less acoustically active, or could represent greater site use by this group. This first use of acoustic monitoring over the winter, complemented with visual data, can establish a better understanding of year-round use of this area by killer whales and has broader application to other sites.

AB  - This paper discusses passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals during the Sirena 10 survey. We present results of testing a towed array consisting of 4 broadband hydrophones arranged in a tetrahedral configuration (CPAM Compact Passive Acoustic Monitoring), for detection, classification and localization of marine mammals. Robust angular determinations of detected signals were possible using time of arrival but range estimation was hindered by stability issues with the towed body. We present a preliminary cluster analysis of vocalization time series for species classification. Finally, we discuss the utility of such passive acoustic systems for cetacean surveys and their applications in abundance and habitat suitability modeling for marine mammals.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are one of several baleen whale species in the Northwest Atlantic that coexist with vessel traffic and anthropogenic noise. Passive acoustic monitoring strategies can be used in conservation management, but the first step toward understanding the acoustic behavior of a species is a good description of its acoustic repertoire. Digital acoustic tags (DTAGs) were placed on humpback whales in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary to record and describe the non-song sounds being produced in conjunction with foraging activities. Peak frequencies of sounds were generally less than 1 kHz, but ranged as high as 6 kHz, and sounds were generally less than 1 s in duration. Cluster analysis distilled the dataset into eight groups of sounds with similar acoustic properties. The two most stereotyped and distinctive types ("wops" and "grunts") were also identified aurally as candidates for use in passive acoustic monitoring. This identification of two of the most common sound types will be useful for moving forward conservation efforts on this Northwest Atlantic feeding ground. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The study of humpback whale song using passive acoustic monitoring devices requires bioacousticians to manually review hours of audio recordings to annotate the signals. To vastly reduce the time of manual annotation through automation, a machine learning model was developed. Convolutional neural networks have made major advances in the previous decade, leading to a wide range of applications, including the detection of frequency modulated vocalizations by cetaceans. A large dataset of over 60 000 audio segments of 4 s length is collected from the North Atlantic and used to fine-tune an existing model for humpback whale song detection in the North Pacific (see Allen, Harvey, Harrell, Jansen, Merkens, Wall, Cattiau, and Oleson (2021). Front. Mar. Sci. 8, 607321). Furthermore, different data augmentation techniques (time-shift, noise augmentation, and masking) are used to artificially increase the variability within the training set. Retraining and augmentation yield F-score values of 0.88 on context window basis and 0.89 on hourly basis with false positive rates of 0.05 on context window basis and 0.01 on hourly basis. If necessary, usage and retraining of the existing model is made convenient by a framework (AcoDet, acoustic detector) built during this project. Combining the tools provided by this framework could save researchers hours of manual annotation time and, thus, accelerate their research.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of ocean soundscapes can provide information on ecosystem status for those tasked with protecting marine resources. In 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established a long-term, continuous, low-frequency (10Hz-2kHz) passive acoustic monitoring site in the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS), located offshore of the central United States of America (U.S.) west coast, near San Francisco, CA. The California Current flows southward along the coast in this area, supporting a diverse community of marine animals, including several baleen whale species. Acoustic data analysis revealed that both large vessels and vocalizing baleen whales contribute to the ambient soundscape of the CBNMS. Sound levels fluctuated by month with the highest levels in the fall and lowest levels in the summer. Throughout the year, very low-frequency (10-100Hz) sound levels were most variable. Vessels and whales overlap in their contributions to ambient sound levels within this range, although vessel contributions were more omnipresent, while seasonal peaks were associated with vocalizing whales. This characterization of low-frequency ambient sound levels in the CBNMS establishes initial baselines for an important component of this site's underwater soundscape. Standardized monitoring of soundscapes directly supports NOAA's ability to evaluate and report on conditions within national marine sanctuaries.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring adds to knowledge of whale presence and distribution over space and time. The gray whale (Eschrictius robustus) undertakes an annual migration between remote feeding and breeding locales, with its highly sonorous nature suggesting employment of low-frequency calls to be inherent to travel behaviours, perhaps aiding navigation and social cohesion. We consider whether these calling behaviours can be used to better understand the process of migration, where call presence and relative abundance might represent a means to track the progress of migrating whales. Passive acoustic recordings made on the west coast of Vancouver Island, a mid-way point of gray whale migration, were first analysed for abundance over time to examine the progression of migration. Then the acoustic record was compared to shore-based recordings undertaken from Point Vincente, California to better assess their use as a census tool. The timing in peaks of calling, particularly of far-ranging moan-like calls, and shore counts showed a high degree of congruence when considered with a lag time of 8 days to account for travel time between the two survey locations. This suggests that passive acoustic monitoring could complement the long running and shore-based counts in recording annual population movement, and add to our understanding of gray whales on poorly known segments of their migration route or at times when visual observations are not possible.

PAM-driven studies in Indian waters have so far been relatively very scarce. Furthermore, cetacean populations inhabiting the north western Indian Ocean are far less studied than those in many other regions around the world. This work likely constitutes the first systematic study of the vocal repertoire of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at a near-shore site along the western coast of India. Analysis of the observed vocalizations provides an insight into the behaviour of the species. This is significant as it assists in developing a better understanding of the habitat use of the non-migratory Arabian Sea humpback whale population. In contrast, other breeding populations such as those around the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Australia have been relatively well studied. Underwater passive acoustic data were collected during March 2017 using an autonomous logger at a shallow-water site off the eastern edge of Grande Island off the coast of Goa. Humpback whale vocalizations were found to occur over multiple days in the recordings. Time-frequency contours of individual units of vocalization were extracted with the aid of an automatic detection technique and the characteristics of the units were measured. Further, successive units were analysed for formation of phrases and themes. Reconstruction of putative songs from the identified units and themes was not possible due to the limitations imposed by the nature of data collection. Detailed analyses of units, phrases and themes are presented.

AB  - Cetacean exposure to underwater noise in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean is largely unknown. With the goal to characterize sound pressure and sound exposure levels in different environments, we have employed data from one month of passive acoustic monitoring in a coastal and an oceanic location to register sound pressure level variations and to calculate sound exposure levels to which cetacean species are subjected. Noise profiles varied between locations; Rio de Janeiro coastal area had higher levels than the Vit ' oria-Trindade Seamount Chain area. At both sites, low-frequency hearing cetaceans were the group under higher exposure during day and night. For high-frequency and very high-frequency groups, the day period presented higher levels. Results highlight the conditions of these unexplored soundscapes and the necessity for taking underwater noise into consideration for space-time regulation of marine areas in cetacean conservation efforts.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring takes advantage of the relative opacity of the ocean to sound. Traditionally, long-term monitoring has employed archival instruments from which data are accessed only when the recording instrument is retrieved. Recent advances in low-power instrumentation and computational speed allow passive acoustic data to be collected, processed and relayed to shore in near real time from fixed and mobile platforms deployed at the sea floor, in the water column or on the ocean's surface. Measurements of ambient noise provide insight into natural sound sources, such as rainfall, earthquakes or marine animals, as well as anthropogenic sound sources, such as shipping or resource extraction. Near real-time passive acoustic measurements allow scientists and agencies to monitor shipping, observe underwater seismicity and detect the presence of critically endangered large whales. The development and use of real-time passive acoustic monitoring systems will grow in coming decades to help better manage increasing industrialization of the oceans. This chapter reviews the capabilities of real-time passive acoustic monitoring to address civilian scientific needs. The currently available suite of instrumentation and platforms used for passive acoustic monitoring are discussed along with the wide variety of measurements that can be made with this technology. Finally, examples of how real-time passive acoustic monitoring has improved our understanding of the ocean are presented.

AB  - There is widespread evidence that small-scale fisheries (SSF) bycatch threatens many populations of small cetaceans, yet conservation efforts are often limited by a lack of basic knowledge regarding their abundance, distribution, and habitat use. Here, we used passive acoustic monitoring from an SSF platform-of-opportunity to better characterize the distribution and habitat use of small cetaceans in northern Peru, focussing on the little-known Burmeister's porpoise Phocoena spinipinnis. From 2009 to 2012, acoustic click detectors (C-PODs) were attached to fishing nets for the duration of 116 fishing sets (30 fishing trips). Dolphins (unspecified delphinids) and porpoises were recorded around 71 and 22% of fishing sets, respectively. The probability of occurrence and buzzing behavior (a proxy for foraging), and time spent, were linked to both static and dynamic environmental variables to examine the drivers of habitat use. Dolphin activity was spread evenly throughout the fishing area and was not linked to any habitat variables. In contrast, porpoises were detected in neritic waters, and habitat models performed well, identifying preferences for shallow (<200 m depth) and cooler (17-18 degrees C) waters, close (<50 km) to shore. The high bycatch rate of small cetaceans in Peruvian SSF gave us the unique opportunity to investigate the link between bycatch and cetacean activity around vessels. We found a positive relationship between the likelihood of a bycatch event and acoustic presence for both dolphins and porpoises, however as we did not know the timing of entanglement, we could not link vocalization rates to mortality events. Nonetheless, as small cetaceans (particularly dolphins) frequently encounter fishing boats, the likelihood of entanglements may be reduced through effective efforts to alert animals to the presence of the net, either acoustically (using acoustic alarms) or visually. This study demonstrates that passive acoustic monitoring from a fisheries platform can provide insights into the distribution and habitat use of small cetaceans at relatively low cost, and is likely to be suitable in regions with low monitoring effort and high fishing pressure.

AB  - Competition for prey resources among ecologically similar populations that occur in sympatry can be reduced by spatiotemporal resource partitioning. Understanding patterns of habitat use of cetaceans can be difficult since they are highly mobile and can have large home ranges. We used passive acoustic monitoring at 15 sites along the coast of Washington State, USA, to assess habitat use patterns of 2 sympatric populations of fish-eating killer whales Orcinus orca: northern residents (NRKW) and southern residents (SRKW). This area is part of the ocean distributions of a number of important runs of Chinook salmon Oncorhyncus tshawytscha, the preferred prey of both populations, and is proposed critical habitat for SRKW. We compared monthly occurrence of both populations at recorder locations grouped by their proximity to the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the north and the Columbia River to the south in one analysis and by their distance from shore in a second analysis. NRKW and SRKW were detected throughout the year with spring and fall peaks in occurrence. The northernmost sites accounted for 93% of NRKW detections, while less than half of SRKW detections were at these sites. SRKW were most frequently detected at nearshore sites (83% of detections), while the majority of NRKW detections were at mid-shelf and deep sites (94% of detections). This study provides further information about the habitat use of these resident killer whale populations with implications for their management and conservation.

AB  - The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) emits a typical short acoustic signal, defined as a "click", almost continuously while diving. It is produced in different time patterns to acoustically explore the environment and communicate with conspecifics. Each emitted click has a multi-pulse structure, resulting from the production of the sound within the sperm whale's head. A Stable Inter Pulse Interval (Stable IPI) can be identified among the pulses that compose a single click. Applying specific algorithms, the measurement of this interval provides useful information to assess the total length of the animal recorded. In January 2005, a cabled hydrophone array was deployed at a depth of 2,100 m in the Central Mediterranean Sea, 25 km offshore Catania (Ionian Sea). The acoustic antenna, named OvDE (Ocean noise Detection Experiment), was in operation until November 2006. OvDE provided real time acoustic data used to perform Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) of cetacean sound emissions. In this work, an innovative approach was applied to automatically measure the Stable IPI of the clicks, performing a cepstrum analysis to the energy (square amplitude) of the signals. About 2,100 five-minute recordings were processed to study the size distribution of the sperm whales detected during the OvDE long term deep-sea acoustic monitoring. Stable IPIs were measured in the range between 2.1 ms and 6.4 ms. The equations of Gordon (1991) and of Growcott (2011) were used to convert the IPIs into measures of size. The results revealed that the sperm whales recorded were distributed in length from about 7.5 m to 14 m. The size category most represented was from 9 m to 12 m (adult females or juvenile males) and specimens longer than 14 m (old males) seemed to be absent.

AB  - An Increase in the study of cetaceans' sounds has motivated the development of different automated sound detection and classification techniques. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is extensively used to study these cetaceans' sounds over a period to understand their daily activities within their ecosystem. Using PAM, the gathered sound datasets are usually large and impractical to manually analyse and detect. Thus, hidden Markov models (HMM) is one of the popular tools used to automatically detect and classify these cetaceans' sounds. Nonetheless, HMM rely heavily on the employed feature extraction method such as Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and linear predictive coding (LPC). In most cases, the more reliable the extracted feature vector from the known sound label, the higher the sensitivity of the HMM. Although these aforementioned feature extraction methods are widely used, their design is based on filters and requires windowing, fast Fourier transforms (FFT), and logarithm operations. Consequently, this increases the computational time complexity of the HMM. Here, we describe a selective time domain feature extraction method that can be easily adapted with the HMM. This proposed feature extraction method uses a combination of some simple but robust parameters such as the mean, relative amplitude and relative power/energy (MAP), which are selected based on empirical observations of the call to be detected. The performance of this proposed MAP-HMM was verified using the acoustic dataset of continuous recordings of an inshore Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera) short pulse calls collected in a single site in False bay, South-West of South Africa. Aside from exhibiting a low computational complexity, the proposed MAP-HMM offers superior sensitivity and false discovery rate performances in comparison to the LPCHMM and MFCC-HMM.

AB  - Entanglement in net fisheries (static and drift) is the largest known cause of direct anthropogenic mortality to many small cetacean species, including harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), in UK waters. Despite this, little is known about the behaviour of small cetaceans in proximity to nets. We have developed a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) system for tracking the fine-scale three-dimensional (3D) movements of echolocating cetaceans around actively fishing nets by localising their acoustic clicks. The system consists of two compact four-channel acoustic recorders with sample-synchronised sensor packages that use 3D motion tracking technology to accurately calculate log orientation, depth, water temperature and ambient light level. Two recorders were used in tandem, with each one attached to and floating above the net floatline. The system can be deployed during normal fishing operations by a trained researcher or experienced fisheries observer. Recordings were analysed in PAMGuard software and the 3D positions of echolocating animals in the vicinity of the system were calculated using an acoustic particle filter-based localisation method. We present findings from four deployments in UK waters (each 1-2 days in duration) in which 12 distinct harbour porpoise encounters yielded a sufficient number of detected clicks to track their movements around the net. The tracks show a variety of behaviours, including multiple instances of animals actively foraging in close proximity to the fishing net. We show that a relatively inexpensive PAM system, which is practical to deploy from active fishing vessels, is capable of providing highly detailed data on harbour porpoise behaviour around nets. As harbour porpoises are the one of the most difficult species to localise, this methodology is likely to be suitable for elucidating the behaviour of many other toothed whale species in a variety of situations.

AB  - The expansion of offshore renewables has raised concerns over potential disturbance to coastal cetaceans. In this study, we used passive acoustic monitoring to assess whether cetaceans responded to pile-driving noise during the installation of two 5 MW offshore wind turbines off NE Scotland in 2006. Monitoring was carried out at both the turbine site and a control site in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Harbour porpoises occurred regularly around the turbine site in all years, but there was some evidence that porpoises did respond to disturbance from installation activities. We use these findings to highlight how uncertainty over cetacean distribution and the scale of disturbance effects constrains opportunities for B-A-C-I studies. We explore alternative approaches to assessing the impact of offshore wind farm upon cetaceans, and make recommendations for the research and monitoring that will be required to underpin future developments.

AB  - Visual line transect (VLT) surveys are central to the monitoring and study of marine mammals. However, for cryptic species such as deep diving cetaceans VLT surveys alone suffer from problems of low sample sizes and availability bias where animals below the surface are not available to be detected. The advent of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) technology offers important opportunities to observe deep diving cetaceans but statistical challenges remain particularly when trying to integrate VLT and PAM data. Herein, we present a general framework to combine these data streams to estimate abundance when both surveys are conducted simultaneously. Secondarily, our approach can also be used to derive an estimate of availability bias. We outline three methods that vary in complexity and data requirements which are (1) a simple distance sampling (DS) method that treats the two datasets independently (DS-DS Method), (2) a fully integrated approach that applies a capture-mark recapture (CMR) analysis to the PAM data (CMR-DS Method) and (3) a hybrid approach that requires only a subset of the PAM CMR data (Hybrid Method). To evaluate their performance, we use simulations based on known diving and vocalizing behavior of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). As a case study, we applied the Hybrid Method to data from a shipboard survey of sperm whales and compared estimates to a VLT only analysis. Simulation results demonstrated that the CMR-DS Method and Hybrid Method reduced bias by >90% for both abundance and availability bias in comparison to the simpler DS -DS Method. Overall, the CMR-DS Method was the least biased and most precise. For the case study, our application of the Hybrid Method to the sperm whale dataset produced estimates of abundance and availability bias that were comparable to estimates from the VLT only analysis but with considerably higher precision. Integrating multiple sources of data is an important goal with clear benefits. As a step towards that goal we have developed a novel framework. Results from this study are promising although challenges still remain. Future work may focus on applying this method to other deep-diving species and comparing the proposed method to other statistical approaches that aim to combine information from multiple data sources.

AB  - The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/CE) aims to achieve and maintain the 'good environmental status' (GES) of marine ecosystems, including the assessment of marine mammal populations. However, assessing their abundance and distribution is challenging due to their mobility, elusiveness, and difficult data acquisition. This article highlights the role of passive acoustic monitoring as a complementary approach to traditional methods (mainly plane and boat surveys). It also presents the conclusions and perspectives of a workshop organized at the 34th conference of the European Cetacean Society in O'Grove, Spain (18th to 20th April 2023). Building on the rich foundation established by the European Cetacean Society (ECS) in 1987, this society plays a pivotal role in advancing marine mammal research and conservation efforts across European waters. The workshop emphasized the need for harmonization of protocols, indicators, and guidelines to ensure comparability of results. The establishment of a dedicated European working group was proposed to coordinate passive acoustic monitoring efforts, foster collaboration, and share best practices. The workshop concluded that the consolidation of scientific knowledge, the development of common guidelines, and the establishment of a transnational working group would improve the understanding and conservation of these vulnerable species and their habitats.

AB  - Beaked whales have been reported to mass strand as result of naval sonar exercises and the ability to mitigate such negative effects is of increasing importance. We present results that suggest that passive acoustic detection of beaked whales is feasible using broadband hydrophone arrays towed at shallow depths. In particular, the presence of delayed surface reflections is an important classification cue indicating that the received sound had been generated by a whale foraging at depth. This contextual information can easily be visualized by time-delay estimation techniques. We show that the use of non-acoustic contextual information of a deep diving foraging whale provides a promising approach to improving the classification performance of a passive acoustic detector of beaked whales.

AB  - Beaked whale are difficult to observe visually and are among the most sensitive species to anthropogenic noise. Thus passive acoustic monitoring is particularly interesting to study these species and mitigate noise impact. This paper presents the outline of an automatic recognition method of beaked whale signals. This method has three steps: a transient detector, individual click classification and click association in click trains using a multi hypothesis tracker. Click train association enhances classification because a click is not emitted alone and click trains have properties that can be characteristic of a species (e.g. inter-click-interval). The results are presented for three species: Blainville's, Cuvier's and Gervais beaked whale. The results obtained are very encouraging.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is one of the most effective and widely used methods for marine mammal detection and population density estimation. In most cases, it is associated with an inevitably large volume of raw acoustic data, making analysis exclusively by human experts challenging and extremely time-demanding. We present a neural network algorithm for detection of tonal signals produced by toothed cetaceans which allocates time intervals with high likelihood of marine mammal signal presence in underwater sound recordings. The proposed model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) of the ResNet152 architecture used as a backbone with additional linear layers. The input data for the model are spectrograms of short segments of underwater sound recordings. Training of the network was performed on a benchmark dataset of bottlenose dolphin whistles labeled by human experts. Analysis of the performance metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) showed the proposed model's superiority in comparison to widely used acoustic energy-based approaches. In virtue of the model's versatility, we believe that it can be successfully used for detection of tonal signals of other species characterized by producing tonal acoustic signals. This assumption was confirmed by preliminary results of the application of the developed CNN to a large archive of the White Sea beluga whale recordings.

AB  - Monitoring programmes for white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) have been called for repeatedly in recent years because this species is likely to be negatively impacted by climate change, but also because such a broadly dispersed, high trophic feeder can serve as an effective ecosystem sentinel. Arctic ecosystems are difficult to monitor because of the extensive winter ice coverage and extreme environmental conditions in addition to low human population densities. However, passive acoustic monitoring has proved to be a reliable method to remotely survey the presence of some marine mammals in the Arctic. In this study, we evaluate the potential use of echolocation loggers (T-POD and C-POD, Chelonia Ltd.) for remote monitoring of white whales. Captive experiments and open water surveys in three arctic/subarctic habitats (ice-noise-dominated environment, ice-free environment and low-turbidity waters) were used to document detection performance and to explore the use of logger angle and inter-click interval data to look at activity patterns and tidal influences on space use. When acoustic results were compared to concurrent visual observations, echolocation detection was only attributed to periods of white whale presence near the recorder deployment sites. Both T-PODs and C-PODs effectively detected echolocation, even under noisy ice. Diel and tidal behavioural patterns were identified. Acoustically identified movement patterns between sites were visually confirmed. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring white whales using echolocation loggers and describes some important features of their behaviour as examples of the potential application of this passive acoustic monitoring method in Arctic and subarctic regions.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals is common, and it is now possible to estimate absolute animal density from acoustic recordings. The most appropriate density estimation method depends on how much detail about animals' locations can be derived from the recordings. Here, a method for estimating cetacean density using acoustic data is presented, where only horizontal bearings to calling animals are estimable. This method also requires knowledge of call signal-to-noise ratios, as well as auxiliary information about call source levels, sound propagation, and call production rates. Results are presented from simulations, and from a pilot study using recordings of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) calls from Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) hydrophones at Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean. Simulations replicating different animal distributions showed median biases in estimated call density of less than 2%. The estimated average call density during the pilot study period (December 2007-February 2008) was 0.02 calls hr(-1) km(2) (coefficient of variation, CV: 15%). Using a tentative call production rate, estimated average animal density was 0.54 animals/1000 km(2) (CV: 52%). Calling animals showed a varied spatial distribution around the northern hydrophone array, with most detections occurring at bearings between 90 and 180 degrees.

AB  - Long-term passive acoustic monitoring of cetaceans is frequently limited by the data storage capacity and battery life of the recording system. Duty cycles are a mechanism for subsampling during the recording process that facilitates long-term passive acoustic studies. While duty cycles are often used, there has been little investigation on the impact that this approach has on the ability to answer questions about a species' behavior and occurrence. In this study, the effects of duty cycling on the acoustic detection of southern resident killer whales (SRKW) (Orcinus orca) were investigated. Continuous acoustic data were subsampled to create 288 subsampled datasets with cycle lengths from 5 to 180 min and listening proportions from 1% to 67%. Duty cycles had little effect on the detection of the daily presence of SRKW, especially when using cycle lengths of less than an hour. However, cycle lengths of 15-30 min and listening proportions of at least 33% were required to accurately calculate durations of acoustic bouts and identify those bouts to ecotype. These results show that the optimal duty cycle depends on the scale of the research question and provide a framework for quantitative analysis of duty cycles for other marine species.

AB  - Understanding the behavioral ecology of a species is fundamental to effective conservation and management efforts. This study quantifies the behavioral ontogeny of North Atlantic right whale mother-calf pairs from birth to weaning spanning three critical habitat areas off the eastern coast of the United States and Canada. Data from 55 focal follows of 34 mother-calf pairs were collected from 2011 to 2015. Resting behaviors dominated the activity budgets for both mother and calf during the first 5 months, putting them at increased risk of vessel collisions. There was an increase in the proportion of active behaviors (travel, foraging, social activity) in both mother and calf as the calf matured. Importantly, the type of active behaviors, in particular surface skim feeding and surface active social behavior, meant that the risk of vessel collision to the pair did not decrease as the calf matured. Mother-calf right whale pairs showed very low calling rates on the calving grounds, suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may not be an effective mitigation tool during the early months. However, calling rates increase once the pair leave the calving areas with both calf age and activity levels increasing, at which point passive acoustic monitoring becomes valuable. Protective measures need to take these rapid developmental changes throughout calf growth into account to improve the efficacy of protection measures for the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other species where behavioral ecology changes rapidly during maturation.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) with autonomous bottom-moored recorders is widely used to study cetacean occurrence, distribution and behaviors, as it is less affected by factors that limit other observation methods (e.g., vessel, land and aerial-based surveys) such as inclement weather, sighting conditions, or remoteness of study sites. During the winter months in Hawai'i, humpback whale male song chorusing becomes the predominant contributor to the local soundscape and previous studies showed a strong seasonal pattern, suggesting a correlation with relative whale abundance. However, the relationship between chorusing levels and abundance, including non-singing whales, is still poorly understood. To investigate how accurately acoustic monitoring of singing humpback whales tracks their abundance, and therefore is a viable tool for studying whale ecology and population trends, we collected long-term PAM data from three bottom-moored Ecological Acoustic Recorders off west Maui, Hawaii during the winter and spring months of 2016-2021. We calculated daily medians of root-mean-square sound pressure levels (RMS SPL) of the low frequency acoustic energy (0-1.5 kHz) as a measure of cumulative chorusing intensity. In addition, between December and April we conducted a total of 26 vessel-based line-transect surveys during the 2018/19 through 2020/21 seasons and weekly visual surveys (n = 74) from a land-based station between 2016 and 2020, in which the location of sighted whale pods was determined with a theodolite. Combining the visual and acoustic data, we found a strong positive second-order polynomial correlation between SPLs and abundance (land: 0.72 <= R-2 <= 0.75, vessel: 0.81 <= R-2 <= 0.85 for three different PAM locations; Generalized Linear Model: p(land) MUCH LESS-THAN 0.001, p(vessel) MUCH LESS-THAN 0.001) that was independent from recording location (p(land) = 0.23, p(vessel) = 0.9880). Our findings demonstrate that PAM is a relatively low-cost, robust complement and alternative for studying and monitoring humpback whales in their breeding grounds that is able to capture small-scale fluctuations during the season and can inform managers about population trends in a timely manner. It also has the potential to be adapted for use in other regions that have previously presented challenges due to their remoteness or other limitations for conducting traditional surveys.

AB  - Passive acoustic surveys are becoming increasingly popular as a means of surveying for cetaceans and other marine species. These surveys yield large amounts of data, the analysis of which is time consuming and can account for a substantial proportion of the survey budget. Semi-automatic processes enable the bulk of processing to be conducted automatically while allowing analyst time to be reserved for validating and correcting detections and classifications. Existing modules within the Passive Acoustic Monitoring software PAMGuard were used to process a large (25.4 Terabyte) dataset collected during towed acoustic ship transits. The recently developed 'Multi-Hypothesis Tracking Click Train Detector' and the 'Whistle and Moan Detector' modules were used to identify occasions within the dataset at which vocalising toothed whales (odontocetes) were likely to be acoustically present. These putative detections were then reviewed by an analyst, with false positives being corrected. Target motion analysis provided a perpendicular distance to odontocete click events enabling the estimation of detection functions for both sperm whales and delphinids. Detected whistles were assigned to the lowest taxonomical level possible using the PAMGuard 'Whistle Classifier' module. After an initial tuning process, this semi-automatic method required 91 hr of an analyst's time to manually review both automatic click train and whistle detections from 1,696 hr of survey data. Use of the 'Multi-Hypothesis Tracking Click Train Detector' reduced the amount of data for the analyst to search by 74.5%, while the 'Whistle and Moan Detector' reduced data to search by 85.9%. In total, 443 odontocete groups were detected, of which 55 were from sperm whale groups, six were from beaked whales, two were from porpoise and the remaining 380 were identified to the level of delphinid group. An effective survey strip half width of 3,277 and 699 m was estimated for sperm whales and delphinids respectively. The semi-automatic workflow proved successful, reducing the amount of analyst time required to process the data, significantly reducing overall project costs. The workflow presented here makes use of existing modules within PAMGuard, a freely available and open-source software, readily accessible to acoustic analysts.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of passive acoustic detection of contact calls produced by the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. The proposed solution is based on using a generalized likelihood ratio, test detector of polynomial-phase signals with unknown amplitude and polynomial coefficients observed in the presence of locally stationary Gaussian noise. The closed form representation for a minimal sufficient statistic is derived and a realizable detection scheme is developed. The receiver operation characteristic curves are calculated using empirical data recordings containing known right whale calls. The curves demonstrate that the proposed detector provides superior detection performance as compared with other known detection techniques for northern right whale contact calls.

AB  - The occurrence and distribution of sperm whales in New Zealand waters is mainly known from whaling records or opportunistic sightings by the public and a systematic estimation of the abundance and distribution has never been conducted. In this study, we investigated the foraging activity and occurrence of sperm whales off the Eastern coast of New Zealand using passive acoustic monitoring techniques. Three acoustic recorders were moored to the ocean floor at different locations on the east side of the North and South Island to collect passive acoustic data from June 2016 until August 2017. A total of 53,823 echolocation click trains were recorded and analyzed to understand the spatial and temporal variation of sperm whale foraging activity. No difference in the foraging activity was found between night-time and day-time periods at any of the locations. Click train detections increased toward the south, suggesting increased foraging activity near Kaikoura. At each station, sperm whale foraging activity varied by month.

AB  - Acoustic bio-sonar characteristics of non-marine toothed whales are very critical for any conservation efforts using passive acoustic monitoring. The acoustic surveys have now been recognized as effective methods for freshwater cetaceans monitoring and abundance estimation compared to the traditional visual surveys. These species have been declared as data deficient by the IUCN and acoustic surveys present themselves as the relatively cost-effective approach. Irrawaddy dolphins Orcaella brevirostris referred to as facultative freshwater cetaceans because they occupy both fresh-and near-shore marine waters are among the cetaceans at greatest risk to population extirpation and perhaps extinction. Their vulnerability stems from habitat requirements that are coupled to marine and freshwater habitats subjected to intense human intervention. The bio-sonar characteristics of these species are highly sensitive to their habitat and the Irrawaddy dolphins are spread across varied environments over distant geographic locations. A good understanding of their acoustic bio-sonar characteristics across habitats can potentially provide significant conservation inputs. The two habitats considered in this work are contrasting in their origin and evolution. The first is the rivers systems of the Sundarbans mangrove forest with a deltaic habitat and second is the Chilika Lagoon with rain water and high tide fed habitat. Detailed analysis of the Sundarbans Irrawaddy dolphins were reported in 2013 with well-defined acoustic signal parameters. The authors have applied the same parameters for a comprehensive comparison of the species in the two habitats with a critical review on the correlation of the habitat features and the acoustic bio-sonar characteristics. Long term recording of the dolphin clicks in the Chilika lagoon have been analyzed and compared with the Sunderbans results available in the open literature. The acoustic parameters and their physical correlation with the animal behaviour and the habitat status have been presented. Multiple parameters such as centroid frequency, peak frequency, signal source level, bandwidth, duration of clicks, inter-click interval etc have been considered for the study.

AB  - With one million animal species at risk of extinction, there is an urgent need to regularly monitor threatened species. However, in practice this is challenging, especially with wide-ranging, elusive and cryptic species or those that occur at low density.
   Here we compare two non-invasive methods, passive acoustic monitoring (n = 12) and camera trapping (n = 53), to detect chimpanzees Pan troglodytes in a savanna-woodland mosaic habitat at the Issa Valley, Tanzania. With occupancy modelling we evaluate the efficacy of each method, using the estimated number of sampling days needed to establish chimpanzee absence with 95% probability, as our measure of efficacy.
   Passive acoustic monitoring was more efficient than camera trapping in detecting wild chimpanzees. Detectability varied over seasons, likely due to social and ecological factors that influence party size and vocalization rate. The acoustic method can infer chimpanzee absence with less than 10 days of recordings in the field during the late dry season, the period of highest detectability, which was five times faster than the visual method.
   Synthesis and applications. Despite some technical limitations, we demonstrate that passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for species monitoring. Its applicability in evaluating presence/absence, especially but not exclusively for loud call species, such as cetaceans, elephants, gibbons or chimpanzees provides a more efficient way of monitoring populations and inform conservation plans to mediate species-loss.

AB  - The ability to modify vocalizations to compensate for environmental noise is critical for successful communication in a dynamic acoustic environment. Many marine species rely on sound for vital life functions including communication, navigation and feeding. The impacts of significant increases in ocean noise levels from human activities are a current area of concern for the conservation of marine mammals. Here, we document changes in calling behaviour by individual endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in increased background noise. Right whales, like several bird and primate species, respond to periods of increased noise by increasing the amplitude of their calls. This behaviour may help maintain the communication range with conspecifics during periods of increased noise. These call modifications have implications for conservation efforts for right whales, affecting both the way whales use sound to communicate and our ability to detect them with passive acoustic monitoring systems.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool that allows remote detection of marine mammals through their vocalizations. While call detection provides information on species presence, additional information may be contained within the vocalizations that could provide more information regarding the demographics and/or number of individuals in a particular area based on passive acoustic detections. The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis produces a stereotyped upswept call, termed the upcall, that is thought to function as a long-distance contact call in this species. As such, the call is likely to contain cues providing information about the individual producing it. The goal of this study was to test whether the right whale upcall could potentially encode information related to the identity and age of the caller. Using upcalls recorded from 14 known individuals through non-invasive suction cup archival acoustic tags, we demonstrate that the upcall does contain sufficient information to discriminate individual identity and age class, with average classification levels of 72.6 and 86.1%, respectively. Parameters measured from the fundamental frequency, duration, and formant structure were most important for discrimination among individuals. This study is the first step in demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining additional data from passive acoustic monitoring to aid in the conservation efforts for this highly endangered species.

AB  - Anthropogenic noise may significantly impact exposed marine mammals. This work studied the vocalization response of endangered blue whales to anthropogenic noise sources in the mid-frequency range using passive acoustic monitoring in the Southern California Bight. Blue whales were less likely to produce calls when mid-frequency active sonar was present. This reduction was more pronounced when the sonar source was closer to the animal, at higher sound levels. The animals were equally likely to stop calling at any time of day, showing no diel pattern in their sensitivity to sonar. Conversely, the likelihood of whales emitting calls increased when ship sounds were nearby. Whales did not show a differential response to ship noise as a function of the time of the day either. These results demonstrate that anthropogenic noise, even at frequencies well above the blue whales' sound production range, has a strong probability of eliciting changes in vocal behavior. The long-term implications of disruption in call production to blue whale foraging and other behaviors are currently not well understood.

AB  - Beaked whales are deep diving elusive animals, difficult to census with conventional visual surveys. Methods are presented for the density estimation of beaked whales, using passive acoustic monitoring data collected at sites in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) from the period during and following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010-2013). Beaked whale species detected include: Gervais' (Mesoplodon europaeus), Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) and an unknown species of Mesoplodon sp. (designated as Beaked Whale Gulf-BWG). For Gervais' and Cuvier's beaked whales, we estimated weekly animal density using two methods, one based on the number of echolocation clicks, and another based on the detection of animal groups during 5 min time-bins. Density estimates derived from these two methods were in good general agreement. At two sites in the western GOM, Gervais' beaked whales were present throughout the monitoring period, but Cuvier's beaked whales were present only seasonally, with periods of low density during the summer and higher density in the winter. At an eastern GOM site, both Gervais' and Cuvier's beaked whales had a high density throughout the monitoring period.

AB  - Low-frequency acoustic signals generated by baleen whales can propagate over vast distances, making the assignment of calls to specific individuals problematic. Here, we report the novel use of acoustic recording tags equipped with high-resolution accelerometers to detect vibrations from the surface of two tagged fin whales that directly match the timing of recorded acoustic signals. A tag deployed on a buoy in the vicinity of calling fin whales and a recording from a tag that had just fallen off a whale were able to detect calls acoustically but did not record corresponding accelerometer signals that were measured on calling individuals. Across the hundreds of calls measured on two tagged fin whales, the accelerometer response was generally anisotropic across all three axes, appeared to depend on tag placement and increased with the level of received sound. These data demonstrate that high-sample rate accelerometry can provide important insights into the acoustic behavior of baleen whales that communicate at low frequencies. This method helps identify vocalizing whales, which in turn enables the quantification of call rates, a fundamental component of models used to estimate baleen whale abundance and distribution from passive acoustic monitoring.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to develop a four-channel underwater passive acoustic monitoring system for the use of underwater vehicles. Humans have received abundant blessings of the ocean, and thus it is very important to recognise marine biodiversity and to maintain sound ocean ecosystems for the sustainable utilisation of the ecosystem services. Final goal of this research is to realise a long-term and wide-range monitoring of marine mammals using autonomous underwater vehicles, and to evaluate the healthiness of ocean ecosystems and environments. Underwater glider has no propulsive machinery, and then it is one of the most suitable underwater vehicles for acoustic observation. It is widely known that killer whale is the top predator of ocean food chain. Recently, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of marine mammals has appeared in the spotlight. This paper deals with a 4-channel underwater passive acoustic monitoring system. Maximum operational depth is 400 metre. The system consists of four hydrophones, pre-amplifier with anti-aliasing low-pass filter, a 4-ch portable recorder. It is also equipped with a 3-axis digital compass, a GPS device, and a 2-ch serial data logger so as to estimate the accurate direction of sound source even though the system may be drifted in the waves.

AB  - Beaked whales produce frequency-modulated echolocation pulses that appear to be species-specific, allowing passive acoustic monitoring to play a role in understanding spatio-temporal patterns. The Cross Seamount beaked whale is known only from its unique echolocation signal (BWC) with no confirmed species identification. This beaked whale spans the Pacific Ocean from the Mariana Archipelago to Baja California, Mexico, south to the equator, but only as far north as latitude 29 & DEG;N. Within these warm waters, 92% of BWC detections occurred at night, 6% during crepuscular periods, and only 2% during daylight hours. Detections of BWC signals on drifting recorders with a vertical hydrophone array at 150 m depth demonstrated that foraging often occurred shallow in the water column (<150 m). No other species of beaked whale to date has been documented foraging in waters this shallow. Given their nocturnal, shallow foraging dives, this species appears to prefer prey that may be available in the water column only during those hours. The foraging behavior of Cross Seamount beaked whales appears to be unique among all beaked whales, and these findings contribute additional ecological and acoustic information which can help guide future efforts to identify this cryptic whale.

AB  - We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) in the Arctic region. The Arctic region extends from the Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Amundsen Gulf, and Viscount Melville Sound. This NOAA-led effort uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, BIA II products incorporated a scoring and labeling system to improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support marine spatial planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for Arctic BIA II came from data derived from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite telemetry; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification; aboriginal subsistence harvests, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents; and prey studies. BIAs were identified for bowhead (Balaena mysticetus), gray (Eschrichtius robustus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales. In total, 44 BIAs were delineated and scored for the Arctic, including 12 reproduction, 24 feeding, and 8 migration BIAs. BIAs were identified in all months except January-March. Fifteen candidate areas did not have sufficient information to delineate as BIAs and were added to a watch list for future consideration in the BIA process. Some BIAs were transboundary between the Arctic region and the Aleutian Islands-Bering Sea region. Several BIAs were transnational, extending into territorial waters of Russia (in the Chukchi Sea) and Canada (in the Beaufort Sea), and a few BIAs were delineated in international waters.

AB  - Little is known about the ecology of many beaked whale species, despite concerns raised by mass strandings linked to certain sources of anthropogenic noise. Here, we used passive acoustic monitoring to examine spatial and temporal patterns in beaked whale occurrence at six locations along the continental slope in the western North Atlantic Ocean. We analyzed 2642 days of recordings collected between 2011 and 2015, and identified echolocation signals from northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus), Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Sowerby's (Mesoplodon bidens), Gervais', (Mesoplodon europaeus), and Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) beaked whales, and one signal type of unknown origin. We recorded multiple species at each site, with detections generally occurring year-round, and observed latitudinal gradients and site-specific variation in relative species occurrence. Notably, we regularly detected Cuvier's beaked whales in a region where they have not been commonly observed, and discovered potential habitat partitioning among Cuvier's and Gervais' beaked whales within their overlapping ranges. This information on the distribution and seasonal occurrence of North Atlantic beaked whale species offers new insight into patterns of habitat use, and provides a year-round baseline from which to assess potential anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - For the planned tidal turbine site in Puget Sound, WA, the main concern is to protect Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKW) due to their Endangered Species Act status. A passive acoustic monitoring system is proposed because the whales emit vocalizations that can be detected by a passive system. The algorithm for detection is implemented in two stages. The first stage is an energy detector designed to detect candidate signals. The second stage is a spectral classifier that is designed to reduce false alarms. The evaluation presented here of the detection algorithm incoprporates behavioral models of the species of interest, environmental models of noise levels and potential false alarm sources to provide a realistic characterization of expected operational performance.

AB  - Despite frequent records from other parts of the North Atlantic, minke whales have never been acoustically recorded in the North Sea. This study investigated the detectability of pulse trains previously associated with this species in other regions, in acoustic data from ten sites along the east coast of Scotland. Since preliminary results confirmed pulse train presence, subsequently, an automated detector was applied to these data to record the seasonal and diel presence of minke whale pulse trains. Minke whales were detected from May to November, with most detections occurring in June, July and October. No acoustic detections were made in December, January or in the month of April, whilst no data were available for February and March. This pattern of acoustic presence supports available visual data and suggested an absence of minke whales from the study area during winter. Minke whale acoustic presence showed a statistically significant diel pattern, with a detection peak during night time. This study established the acoustic detectability of minke whales in the North Sea and highlights the potential of using passive acoustic monitoring to study the seasonal presence and spatial distribution of minke whales in the North Sea and wider Northeast Atlantic.

AB  - Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) inhabit a wide variety of ecosystems including both low- and high-latitude areas. Understanding the habitat selection of humpback whale populations is key for humpback whale stock management and general ecosystem management. In the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (ASSO), the investigation of baleen whale distribution by sighting surveys is temporally restricted to the austral summer. The implementation of autonomous passive acoustic monitoring, in turn, allows the study of vocal baleen whales year-round. This study describes the results of analysing passive acoustic data spanning 12 recording positions throughout the ASSO applying a combination of automatic and manual analysis methods to register humpback whale acoustic activity. Humpback whales were present at nine recording positions with higher acoustic activities towards lower latitudes and the eastern and western edges of the ASSO. During all months, except December (the month with the fewest recordings), humpback whale acoustic activity was registered in the ASSO. The acoustic presence of humpback whales at various locations in the ASSO confirms previous observations that part of the population remains in high-latitude waters beyond austral summer, presumably to feed. The spatial and temporal extent of humpback whale presence in the ASSO suggests that this area may be used by multiple humpback whale breeding populations as a feeding ground.

AB  - Pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima) are deep diving cetaceans that commonly strand along the coast of the southeast US, but that are difficult to study visually at sea because of their elusive behavior. Conventional visual surveys are thought to significantly underestimate the presence of Kogia and they have proven difficult to approach for tracking and tagging. An approach is presented for density estimation of signals presumed to be from Kogia spp. based on passive acoustic monitoring data collected at sites in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) from the period following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010-2013). Both species of Kogia are known to inhabit the GOM, although it is not possible to acoustically separate the two based on available knowledge of their echolocation clicks. An increasing interannual density trend is suggested for animals near the primary zone of impact of the oil spill, and to the southeast of the spill. Densities were estimated based on both counting individual echolocation clicks and counting the presence of groups of animals during one-min time windows. Densities derived from acoustic monitoring at three sites are all substantially higher (4-16 animals/1000 km(2)) than those that have been derived for Kogia from line transect visual surveys in the same region (0.5 animals/1000 km(2)). The most likely explanation for the observed discrepancy is that the visual surveys are underestimating Kogia spp. density, due to the assumption of perfect detectability on the survey trackline. We present an alternative approach for density estimation, one that derives echolocation and behavioral parameters based on comparison of modeled and observed sound received levels at sites of varying depth.

AB  - Automatic click detectors and full-bandwidth sound recorders are widely used in passive acoustic monitoring of small cetaceans. Detection of these signals depends on a variety of factors, including signal to noise ratio. Passive acoustic monitoring is often used to study impact of underwater noise on small cetaceans, but as detection probability is affected by changes in signal to noise ratio, variable noise levels may affect conclusions drawn from these experiments. Therefore, we examine how different detectors and filters perform in varying ocean noise conditions. C-PODs and full-bandwidth recorders (Wildlife Acoustics, SM2M+) were deployed at two stations in an environment with fluctuating ambient noise for 42 days. Noise level and harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) click trains simultaneously recorded on both loggers were compared. Overall, we found that porpoise click detections by the algorithm used to analyse full-band recorder data (Pamguard) paralleled detections by the C-POD. However, Pamguard detected significantly more clicks than the C-POD. A decrease in detections was seen for both loggers with increasing noise in the band 20 -160 kHz, in particular for levels above 100 dB re 1 mu Pa rms. We also found that the Pamguard detection function changed the least over varying noise conditions when compared to the C-POD detectors. This study sheds light on the fact that inference of animal presence/absence or density that are based on echolocation cues (here, Porpoise Positive Minutes) shall account for the acoustic environments where probability of detecting signals may be affected by variability in ambient noise levels.

AB  - Shallow, low-activity, low-biosonar parabolic-shaped dives were observed in biologging data from tagged harbor porpoises in Danish waters and identified as potential sleeping behavior. This behavioral state merits consideration in assessing the context for noise exposure and passive acoustic monitoring studies. Similar dives have also been reported for other cetacean species. The existence of low-level bioacoustic dives that may represent that sleeping has implications for the mitigation of not only noise exposure but also of bycatch as well as legal repercussions given the protected status of sleeping, as a part of resting, under many legislative regimes.

AB  - Killer whales are apex predators with temporally and spatially varying distributions throughout the world's oceans. Their ecology and behaviour are poorly understood in most regions due to limited research, often because of logistical challenges. Here, we used a passive acoustic monitoring device to investigate the seasonal acoustic occurrence and diel vocalizing behaviour of killer whales around the remote sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs), Southern Ocean. Killer whales showed diel vocalizing patterns that varied seasonally in relation to their prey abundance and social activities. Killer whale calls were intermittently detected year-round with a high number of hours containing calls in October to December, and a secondary peak in February to May, corresponding to seal prey abundance. Random forest modelling identified wind speed as the primary predictor of the occurrence of killer whale calls (with a negative correlation) while sea surface height, chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature were moderately important. We provide the first acoustic evidence that killer whale occurrence around the PEIs might coincide with variability in environmental conditions and prey abundance. Our results provide the first indication of diel vocalizing pattern of killer whales in the Southern Ocean. This knowledge is important for understanding killer whale ecology and adaptation to the changing oceans.

AB  - North Atlantic right whale monitoring in Roseway Basin, Canada, is primarily based on short-term (<14 d) visual surveys conducted during August-September. Variability in survey effort has been the biggest limiting factor to studying changes in the population's occurrence and habitat use. Such efforts could be enhanced considerably using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). We sought to determine if variation in whale presence, relative abundance, demography, and/or behavior (estimated through visual surveys) could be explained by variation in three right whale call types in this habitat. A generalized linear model was fit to 23 d of concurrent PAM and visual monitoring during four summers within the Roseway Basin Right Whale Critical Habitat boundaries. The model revealed significant positive relationships between relative abundance, call counts and presence of surface-active group behavior. PAM can refine daily right whale presence estimates. While visual observations (n = 23 d) implied a 40% decline in right whale presence during 2014-2015 relative to 2004-2005, PAM data (n = 211 d) showed right whales were present between 71%-85% of survey days throughout all years analyzed. We demonstrate that PAM is a useful tool to extend periods of right whale monitoring, especially in areas where visual monitoring efforts may be limited.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico is a region densely populated by marine mammals that must adapt to living in a highly active industrial environment. This paper presents a new approach to quantifying the anthropogenic impact on the marine mammal population. The results for sperm and beaked whales of a case study of regional population dynamics trends after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, derived from passive acoustic-monitoring data gathered before and after the spill in the vicinity of the accident, are presented.

AB  - Acoustic detection of cetaceans is challenged by the variability of calls and the presence of variable background noise. One detection method is to start with frequency band-limited signal and noise estimates, and apply a likelihood ratio test (LRT). These detectors suffer from false alarms when broadband signals overlap the band of interest, triggering detection. Some detectors only consider previous samples, causing further false alarms. The authors propose a method of reducing false alarms by defining a guard band that is not expected to contain energy from the species of interest. A second LRT is performed by testing the ratio of the signal estimate in the signal band with the signal estimate of the guard band. This method is shown to reduce false alarms with a small reduction in detection performance. A detection method is also presented that can be optimized for high processing efficiency, while improving false-alarm rejection from signals that are longer in duration than the signal of interest. Performance is demonstrated on real cetacean recordings and ocean noise. The detection algorithm is implemented in PAMGUARD, an open source Java application designed for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of cetaceans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seamounts are considered hot spots of biodiversity and can aggregate pelagic predators and their prey. Passive acoustic monitoring was conducted over 3 mo in 2012 to document the occurrence of odontocetes near a seamount chain in the central equatorial Pacific in relation to oceanographic changes over time. Beaked whale echolocation signals were most frequently encountered. The main beaked whale signal was an unknown type, BW38, which resembled signals produced by Blainville's beaked whales. It had high occurrence during high sea surface temperature and low sea surface salinity. Cuvier's beaked whales were the second most detected. They had an opposite pattern and were encountered more often when sea surface temperature was low and net primary productivity was high. Risso's dolphins and short-finned pilot whales had high acoustic densities, and echolocated predominantly at night. Risso's dolphins occurred more often during low sea surface height deviation. False killer whales were less frequently detected and mostly occurred during the day. Sperm whale detections were fewer than expected and associated with high chlorophyll a. Short duration Kogiidae encounters occurred on average every third day. These types of long-term site studies are an informative tool to comparatively assess species composition, relative abundance, and relationship to oceanographic changes.

AB  - Estimating the detection probability of small cetaceans using either visual or acoustic surveys is difficult because they do not surface or vocalise continuously and can be imperceptible to an observer or hydrophone. Animals seen at the surface may have lower vocalisation rates, while submerged individuals may be more vocally active. This study aims to estimate visual, acoustic and combined detection probability by using Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) methodology. We used vessel-based visual sightings and acoustic data (based on click identification) collected simultaneously during the ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative in summer 2018 onboard the R/V Song of the Whale. This study focused on small cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea, including the most commonly-encountered species, the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). We identified duplicate events between visual and acoustic platforms using a decision tree based on time and distance thresholds to estimate g(0) (the detection probability on the trackline) for small cetaceans. A total of 30 duplicate events were identified from 107 and 109 events identified by the visual and acoustic platforms respectively. We tested the models with two key functions. With a hazard-rate key function, the g(0) was estimated at 0.52 (CV=21.0%) for both platforms combined, 0.29 (CV=25.6%) for the visual platform and 0.32 (CV=25.1%) for the acoustic platform. With a half-normal key function, g(0) was estimated at 0.51 (CV = 21.7%) for both platforms combined, 0.29 (CV = 25.6%) for the visual platform and 0.33 (CV = 23.2%) for the acoustic platform. Our results illustrate that passive acoustic monitoring can be used as an independent platform in MRDS to estimate the detection probability. Our estimate of g(0) was well below 1, far from the perfect detection commonly assumed for abundance estimation. Without correction for detection biases, total abundance would be underestimated by a factor of two when using both acoustic and visual data. This highlights the importance of using dual-platform surveys to estimate detection probability in order to improve abundance estimates and conservation efforts.

AB  - Little is known about the year-round occurrence of blue whales in Atlantic Canadian waters. We used passive acoustic monitoring to investigate blue whale call presence and increase our understanding of year-round blue whale occurrence along the eastern edge of the Scotian Shelf, Nova Scotia, Canada. Blue whale calls were recorded at 3 deep water sites within and near the Gully Marine Protected Area from October 2012 to September 2014 using bottom-mounted passive acoustic recorders. Calls were categorized as either tonal or downsweeping. At all 3 sites, tonal calls occurred most often from November through January in both years and in August 2014, while the majority of downsweeping calls occurred during May through September 2014. There was no discernible diel pattern in the occurrence of tonal calls. Downsweeping calls occurred most often during evening twilight, with a dramatic peak in occurrence during the hour of 19:00 Atlantic Standard Time at all 3 sites. The peak in downsweeping call occurrence during evening twilight may have been related to blue whale foraging ecology. This study sheds light on the poorly understood year-round occurrence of blue whales off Atlantic Canada. Understanding when and where blue whales occur will help to inform management decisions for the protection and conservation of this endangered population.

AB  - In the context of passive acoustic monitoring of large whales, we propose a new method for localizing blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) from the acoustic recordings of only one sensor. We use a precise modelling of the sound propagation thanks to SPECFEM, a spectral element code for solving wave propagation equations. Based on field measurements in Northern Chile, we ran a simulation on a large supercomputer. We also exploited a recording device, Bombyx II, for one and a half months, with visual monitoring of the zone by a group of experts. We find that the method applied to the south east Pacific song of blue whales gives theoretical results of about 50% success in position recovery. Since we have redundancy in our data, we were able to locate the whale with a precision of 500 m over a box of 10 km by 5 km in the case when we have both visual detection and a strong acoustic signal. More tests should be performed before validating this method, but these first results are encouraging.

AB  - The southeast Pacific (SEP) contains the home ranges of several migratory large whale species, determined largely based on research in coastal waters. These whales' pelagic seasonal residency is unknown. The Juan Fernandez Archipelago (JFA) is an offshore island in the SEP where passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data collection is ongoing at the HA03 hydroacoustic station (sample rate of 250 Hz) maintained by the Preparatory Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Six years (2007-2009 and 2014-2016) of PAM data from HA03 were examined for the acoustic presence of Antarctic, Chilean (southeast Pacific 1, southeast Pacific 2), and southeast Indian Ocean blue whale song types; the fin whale 20-Hz song; and minke whale vocalizations. The weekly presence or absence of these six vocalization types was annotated manually by an expert analyst and then averaged across all years. For each vocalization type, the number of weeks per month with presence was averaged over all years. Consistently, we found austral wintertime presence of Antarctic blue, fin, and minke whales; and the year-round presence of Chilean blue whales. Southeast Indian Ocean blue whales were also detected, but very rarely. We discuss the possible seasonal movements of each species or acoustic group in the offshore SEP. This is the first year-round multispecies study of baleen whale in the offshore SEP and provides valuable information for understanding the migrations of endangered baleen whales in this region, highlighting the importance of offshore areas as hotspots for baleen whale biodiversity.

AB  - Sperm whales have depredated black cod (Anoplopoma fimbria) from demersal longlines in the Gulf of Alaska for decades, but the behavior has recently spread in intensity and geographic coverage. Over a three-year period 11 bioacoustic tags were attached to adult sperm whales off Southeast Alaska during both natural and depredation foraging conditions. Measurements of the animals' dive profiles and their acoustic behavior under both behavioral modes were examined for statistically significant differences. Two rough categories of depredation are identified: "deep" and "shallow." "Deep depredating" whales consistently surface within 500 m of a hauling fishing vessel, have maximum dive depths greater than 200 m, and display significantly different acoustic behavior than naturally foraging whales, with shorter inter-click intervals, occasional bouts of high "creak" rates, and fewer dives without creaks. "Shallow depredating" whales conduct dives that are much shorter, shallower, and more acoustically active than both the natural and deep depredating behaviors, with median creak rates three times that of natural levels. These results suggest that depredation efforts might be measured remotely with passive acoustic monitoring at close ranges. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of dolphins is limited by our ability to classify calls to species. Significant overlap in call characteristics among many species, combined with a wide range of call types and acoustic behavior, makes classification of calls to species challenging. Here, we introduce BANTER, a compound acoustic classification method for dolphins that utilizes information from all call types produced by dolphins rather than a single call type, as has been typical for acoustic classifiers. Output from the passive acoustic monitoring software, PAMGuard, was used to create independent classifiers for whistles, echolocation clicks, and burst pulses, which were then merged into a final, compound classifier for each species. Classifiers for five species found in the California Current ecosystem were trained and tested using 153 single-species acoustic events recorded during a 4.5 mo combined visual and acoustic shipboard cetacean survey off the west coast of the United States. Correct classification scores for individual species ranged from 71% to 92%, with an overall correct classification score of 84% for all five species. The conceptual framework of this approach easily lends itself to other species and study areas as well as to noncetacean taxa.

AB  - The minke whale is one of the most abundant species of baleen whales worldwide, yet is rarely sighted in subtropical waters. In the North Pacific, they produce a distinctive sound known as the boing, which can be used to acoustically localize individuals. A vessel-based survey using both visual and passive acoustic monitoring was conducted during the spring of 2007 in a large (616,000 km(2)) study area encompassing the Mariana Islands. We applied line transect methods to data collected from a towed hydrophone array to estimate the abundance of calling minke whales in our study area. No minke whales were sighted, but there were hundreds of acoustic detections of boings. Computer algorithms were developed to localize calling minke whales from acoustic recordings, resulting in over 30 independent localizations, a six-fold increase over those estimated during the survey. The two best estimates of abundance of calling minke whales were determined to be 80 and 91 animals (0.13 and 0.15 animals per 1,000 km2, respectively; CV = 34%). These are the first density and abundance estimates for calling minke whales using towed hydrophone array surveys, and the first estimates for this species in the Mariana Islands region. These are considered minimum estimates of the true number of minke whales in the study area.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has been successfully used to study deep-diving marine mammal populations. To assess regional population trends of sperm whales in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM), including impacts of the Deepwater Horizon platform oil spill in 2010, the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center-Gulf Ecological Monitoring and Modeling (LADC-GEMM) consortium collected broadband acoustic data in the Mississippi Valley/Canyon area between 2007 and 2017 using bottom-anchored moorings. These data allow the inference of short-term and long-term variations in site-specific abundances of sperm whales derived from their acoustic activity. A comparison is made between the abundances of sperm whales at specific sites in different years before and after the oil spill by estimating the regional abundance density. The results show that sperm whales were present in the region throughout the entire monitoring period. A habitat preference shift was observed for sperm whales after the 2010 oil spill with higher activities at sites farther away from the spill site. A comparison of the 2007 and 2015 results shows that the overall regional abundance of sperm whales did not recover to pre-spill levels. The results indicate that long-term spatially distributed acoustic monitoring is critical in characterizing sperm whale population changes and in understanding how environmental stressors impact regional abundances and the habitat use of sperm whales.

AB  - Short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) are large, deep-diving predators with diverse foraging strategies, but little is known about their echolocation. To quantify the source properties of short-finned pilot whale clicks, we made 15 deployments off the coast of Tenerife of a deep-water hydrophone array consisting of seven autonomous time-synced hydrophone recorders (SoundTraps), enabling acoustic localization and quantification of click source parameters. Of 8185 recorded pilot whale clicks, 47 were classified as being recorded on-axis, with a mean peak-to-peak source level (SL) of 181 +/- 7 dB re 1 mu Pa, a centroid frequency of 40 +/- 4 kHz, and a duration of 57 +/- 23 mu s. A fit to a piston model yielded an estimated half-power (-3 dB) beam width of 13.7 degrees [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.2 degrees-14.5 degrees] and a mean directivity index (DI) of 22.6 dB (95% CI 22.5-22.9 dB). These measured SLs and DIs are surprisingly low for a deep-diving toothed whale, suggesting we sampled the short-finned pilot whales in a context with little need for operating a long-range biosonar. The substantial spectral overlap with beaked whale clicks emitted in similar deep-water habitats implies that pilot whale clicks may constitute a common source of false detections in beaked whale passive acoustic monitoring efforts.

AB  - The passive acoustic monitoring of cetaceans is a research method that can provide unique information on the animal's behaviour since the animals can be studied at great depths and at a long-range without interference. Nevertheless, the real-time data collection, transfer, and analysis using these techniques are difficult to implement and maintain. In this paper, a review of several experiments that have used this approach will be provided. The first class of detectors consists of hydrophone systems housed under buoys on the sea surface with wireless data transmission, while the second type comprises several acoustic detector networks integrated within submarine neutrino telescopes cabled to the shore.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring was used to detect the sounds of rarely sighted Antarctic blue and fin whales to investigate their seasonal occurrence (as presence or absence of whale calls) and behaviour (as determined from call rates) in the Benguela ecosystem. Data were collected using autonomous acoustic recorders deployed on oceanographic moorings for 16.26 months off the west coast of South Africa in 2014 and 2015. Satellite derived environmental variables were used as predictors of whale acoustic occurrence and behaviour. Migratory Antarctic blue and fin whales were acoustically present in South African waters between May and August with call occurrence peaks in July whereas some fin whales extended their presence to November. No whale calls were recorded in summer for either species, suggesting whales use the Benguela ecosystem as an overwintering ground and migration route. Antarctic blue whales produced both their characteristic Z-call and their feeding associated D-call. Fin whales produced calls characteristic of animals from the eastern Antarctic fin whale acoustic population. Random forest models identified environmental variables such as sea surface temperature anomaly, sea surface height, wind speed, months of the year, Ekman upwelling index and log-transformed chlorophyll-a as the most important predictors of call occurrence and call rates of blue and fin whales. Here we present the first acoustic recordings of Antarctic blue and fin whales in the Benguela ecosystem, and provide preliminary information to investigate seasonal abundance and distribution of these large baleen whale populations. This work demonstrates the feasibility of cost-effectively monitoring Antarctic top-consumer baleen whales in the Benguela ecosystem.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to develop a solar-powered autonomous surface vehicle (SASV) for the use of ocean environment monitoring and underwater passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals. Measuring items of the logger version CTD with optical fast DO sensor are depth, temperature, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll and turbidity. The authors have also developed kinds of underwater passive acoustic monitoring systems (UPAMSs) for establishing a soundness index of the ocean, and contributing to preventative safety measures for collision avoidance of high-speed vessels and cetaceans. A practical application of the SASV can be watching over swarm intelligent underwater vehicles. This SASV consists of a couple of solar panels with a charge-and-discharge controller, an embedded PC, a couple of thrustors, a GPS device and a 3-axis digital compass for navigation. The SASV can be operated in autonomous control mode and manual control mode by a small game controller. Feature of this small-sized, lightweight and low-cost SASV is easy handling and long-term operation. This paper deals with its design concept, hardware components, control software, and trial run.

AB  - Beaked whale foraging pulses were detected on the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) off Kaua'i, Hawaii, via long term passive acoustic monitoring. The unidentified pulses do not match foraging pulses of known species on the range but are similar to the unidentified beaked whale first detected at Cross Seamount, Hawaii. Although there has not been a visual confirmation of the unidentified beaked whale species, analysis of data collected from 2007 to 2019 has identified beaked whale foraging dive characteristics from echolocation pulses. From the 13 years of data, the most distinct patterns were that all foraging dives occurred at night and the nighttime foraging dive rate was Oil group vocal periods (GVP) per hour, with most detections on shallow hydrophones (625-1,000 m deep) over steep bathymetric slopes. Data collected during U.S. Navy training events were used to compare dive behavior during midfrequency active sonar (MFAS) activity against baseline periods; it was determined that the whales reduced GVPs during sonar and these remained low for at least 3 days after the training events. These results are the first longterm record of acoustic signals from the Cross Seamount beaked whale and provide important insights into their habitat use and occurrence patterns.

AB  - The fin whale is a globally endangered species and is listed as threatened in Australia, however no peer-reviewed studies are available to indicate the migratory movements of the species in Australian waters. This study uses passive acoustic monitoring as a tool to identify the migratory movements of fin whales in Australian waters. Sampling was conducted from eight locations around Australia between 2009 and 2017, providing a total of 37 annual migratory records. Taken together, our observations provide evidence of fin whale migration through Australian waters, with earliest arrival of the animals recorded on the Western Australian coast, at Cape Leeuwin in April. The whales travel through Cape Leeuwin, migrating northward along the Western Australian coast to the Perth Canyon (May to October), which likely acts as a way-station for feeding. Some whales continue migrating as far north as Dampier (19 degrees S). On Australia's east coast, at Tuncurry, fin whale seasonal presence each year occurred later, from June to late September/October. A total of only 8,024 fin whale pulses were recorded on the east coast, compared to 177,328 pulses recorded at the Perth Canyon. We suggest these differences, as well as the spatial separation between coasts, provide preliminary evidence that the fin whales present on the east and west coasts constitute separate sub-populations.

AB  - The Istanbul Strait (Bosphorus) is a part of the Turkish Straits System, connecting the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. There are three cetacean species in the Strait, namely the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), and the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). To monitor the presence of the cetaceans, a fixed stereo passive acoustic monitoring system (A-tag) was deployed in the middle of the Strait from July 2009 to September 2010. In total 26,814 click trains were detected. Presence, direction and inter-click intervals of phonating cetaceans were measured. Most click trains were detected during the night time. Diel presence pattern was prominent in March and April. In spring, the cetaceans were concentrated in one specific direction from the fixed monitoring system. In contrast, they were found in all directions for the rest of the year. Short range sonar (inter-click intervals (ICIs) less than 50 ms) was commonly detected in spring. During the rest of the year ICIs could reach up to 150 ms. All these findings suggest that they were feeding or socializing in spring and mostly travelling in the other seasons. It is well known that pelagic fish such as sprat and bluefish start their migration from the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea in spring. This study suggests that the cetaceans use the middle part of the Strait for feeding on the pelagic fish in spring when the fish migration has just started.

AB  - A prototype real-time, passive-acoustic observing system for killer whales was developed and tested off the coast of Newport, Oregon, USA. The system consists of two modules: 1) the passive-acoustic monitoring (PAM) module, which sits on the seafloor and continuously monitors the underwater soundscape for killer whale calls, and 2) a surface buoy, which receives information on acoustics detections from the PAM module via an underwater acoustic modem link and relays the information to shore via an Iridium (TM) satellite connection. The system was deployed in similar to 65 m deep water off Oregon in September 2015 for five days, during which the real-time detection capability was tested. A high rate of false positive detections was observed. Later analysis revealed that Dolphin clicks and impulsive sounds by invertebrate caused detection errors. During the experiment, killer whale sounds were projected with an underwater playback system to validate the detection algorithm.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) produce a variety of acoustic signal types used for communication: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Discrete pulsed calls are highly stereotyped, repetitive, and unique to individual pods found around the world. Discriminating amongst pod specific calls can help determine population structure in killer whales and is used to track pod movements around oceans. Killer whale presence in the Canadian Arctic has increased substantially, but we have limited understanding of their ecology, movements, and stock identity. Two autonomous passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) hydrophones were deployed in the waters of Eclipse Sound and Milne Inlet, in northern Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada, in August and September 2017. Eleven killer whale pulsed call types, three multiphonic and eight monophonic, are proposed and described using manual whistle contour extraction and feature normalization. Automated detection of echolocation clicks between 20 and 48 kHz demonstrated little to no overlap between killer whale calls and echolocation presumed to be narwhal, which suggests that narwhal remain audibly inconspicuous when killer whales are present. Describing the acoustic repertoire of killer whales seasonally present in the Canadian Arctic will aid in understanding their acoustic behaviour, seasonal movements, and ecological impacts. The calls described here provide a basis for future acoustic comparisons across the North Atlantic and aid in characterizing killer whale demographics and ecology, particularly for pods making seasonal incursions into Arctic waters.

AB  - Minke whales comprise some of the most widely distributed species of baleen whales, some populations of which are still regularly targeted by commercial whaling. Here, we review the conservation status of common (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Antarctic (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) minke whale populations, against the backdrop of ongoing whaling operations and other anthropogenic threats, including climate change, entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, and noise pollution. Although some coastal minke whale populations have been studied in detail, others, which inhabit remote and ecologically sensitive locations, such as the Antarctic ice shelf, are among the least understood populations of marine mammals. The unresolved taxonomy of dwarf minke whales further highlights some of the existing knowledge gaps concerning these species. Due to their relatively small size and elusive behaviors, large uncertainties exist for almost all minke whale populations with respect to behavior, migratory routes and winter distributions, hindering effective conservation and management. However, recent advances in research technology, such as passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), unmanned aerial systems (UAS), multisensor recording tags, and machine learning assisted photo-identification, are increasingly being applied to study minke whales and their habitat, and are starting to open new windows into their life history and ecology. In future research, these non- and less-invasive methods should be integrated in larger-scale comparative studies aiming to better understand minke whale behavior, ecological interactions and their varying habitats to drive and support effective species conservation.

AB  - The population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, numbers approximately 336 individuals, and continues to decline. Current development and implementation of protection measures and monitoring of right whale presence relies on visual surveys from vessel and aerial platforms, and passive acoustic monitoring, which contribute to location data. Here we demonstrate that satellite imagery can be used to detect and confirm the North Atlantic right whales at a species level using newly available imaging methods, providing another tool to inform conservation efforts. Using optical satellite imagery with 15 cm resolution, 25 right whales were observed in Cape Cod Bay on April 24, 2021. Species confirmation was possible due to clearly visible callosity patterns indicative of their species within this range. Although the variations in callosity patterns commonly used to identify individuals were too small to be resolved at this image resolution, one whale with large distinctive markings visible on his body was identified at an individual level from satellite imagery alone. Although visual and acoustic survey methods can be combined for monitoring this species in critical habitats, satellite-based monitoring can be especially helpful to understand whale presence outside the areas monitored with existing visual and acoustic detection methods.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are top marine predators occurring globally. In Antarctic waters, five ecotypes have been described, with Type C being the smallest form of killer whale known. Acoustic recordings of nine encounters of Type C killer whales were collected in 2012 and 2013 in McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea. In a combined 3.5 h of recordings, 6386 killer whale vocalizations were detected and graded based on their signal-to-noise ratio. Spectrograms of the highest-quality calls were examined for characteristic patterns yielding a catalogue of 28 call types (comprising 1250 calls). Acoustic parameters of each call were measured and summarized by call type. Type C killer whales produced complex calls, consisting of multiple frequency-modulated, amplitude-modulated and pulsed components. Often, two components occurred simultaneously, forming a biphonation; although the biphonic components did not necessarily start and end together, with one component lasting over several others. The addition and deletion of components yielded call subtypes. Call complexity appears stable over time and may be related to feeding ecology. Characterization of the Type C acoustic repertoire is an important step for the development of passive acoustic monitoring of the diverse assemblage of killer whale ecotypes in Antarctica's rapidly changing marine ecosystems.

AB  - Distribution and movement patterns of Antarctic blue whales Balaenoptera musculus intermedia at large temporal and spatial scales are still poorly understood. The objective of this study was to explore spatio-temporal distribution patterns of Antarctic blue whales in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, using passive acoustic monitoring data. Multi-year data were collected between 2008 and 2013 by 11 recorders deployed in the Weddell Sea and along the Greenwich meridian. Antarctic blue whale Z-calls were detected via spectrogram cross-correlation. A Blue Whale Index was developed to quantify the proportion of time during which acoustic energy from Antarctic blue whales dominated over background noise. Our results show that Antarctic blue whales were acoustically present year-round, with most call detections between January and April. During austral summer, the number of detected calls peaked synchronously throughout the study area in most years, and hence, no directed meridional movement pattern was detectable. During austral winter, vocalizations were recorded at latitudes as high as 69 degrees S, with sea ice cover exceeding 90%, suggesting that some Antarctic blue whales overwinter in Antarctic waters. Polynyas likely serve as an important habitat for baleen whales during austral winter, providing food and reliable access to open water for breathing. Overall, our results support increasing evidence of a complex and non-obligatory migratory behavior of Antarctic blue whales, potentially involving temporally and spatially dynamic migration routes and destinations, as well as variable timing of migration to and from the feeding grounds.

AB  - The earliest long-term monitoring of low-frequency signals of large whales was via cabled military arrays. These arrays provided valuable new data but were restricted in the locations that were monitored and there was no open access to the data collected. In order to monitor the low-frequency signals of large whales in different areas and over shorter time scales, Haruphones, single hydrophone, autonomous recording packages, were developed by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and deployed in the Gulf of Alaska and the eastern tropical Pacific. By integrating the acoustic data from these broadly spaced deployments with other data streams, new discoveries about blue whales in the eastern Pacific Ocean were made. These included establishing the geographic range and migratory patterns of eastern north Pacific blue whales; establishing that the eastern tropical Pacific appears to be a blue whale "hot spot" where as many as four, but primarily three, acoustic populations of blue whales occur; determining that the Gulf of Alaska is a region where eastern and western North Pacific blue whales overlap in space and time; and showing that blue whale calling behavior has a diel pattern whereby animals produce more sounds at night than during the day. In aggregate, these data show that passive acoustic monitoring is a valuable tool for establishing blue whale population identity, determining habitat range, and studying behavioral ecology over long time periods and in remote regions of the ocean.

AB  - The number of migrating fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) appears to be increasing in the Pacific Arctic after changes in the marine ecosystem and recovering from depletion by commercial whaling. Fin whale songs are sequences of sounds produced repeatedly, and they may be used for population structure assessments. However, little is known about song types and population structures in the Pacific Arctic. We recorded fin whale songs using a fixed passive acoustic monitoring system from July 2012 to June 2015 in the southern Chukchi Sea. We randomly selected one hour of data from each week of the study period and measured the inter-pulse intervals (IPIs) of the songs. Songs were detected from August to November 2012-2014. All songs had a sequence of doublets with two IPIs (10.5 and 19.6 s), and they were similar to previously reported songs of whales from the eastern North Pacific in 2001-2013 but differed from those of whales from the Bering Sea and northeastern Chukchi Sea in 2007-2010. These results suggest that one group of fin whales migrated to the southern Chukchi Sea from the eastern North Pacific in 2012-2014, or the song changed. Comparing songs from different areas of the Pacific Arctic during the same years will reveal whether this group dispersed in this area.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is effective for examining the temporal variation of cetacean occurrences through continuous recording. How ever, the interpretation of behavior variability remains difficult. Cetacean tonal sounds are believed to play an important role in communication. Changes in tonal sound usage can be indicative of changes in cetacean behavior. In this study, we applied a generalized tonal sound detector on recordings from the marine cable hosted observatory (MACHO) off Northeastern Taiwan. The tonal sound detector is a modified local-max detector, which examines the prominence of tonality in 2 ms time intervals. Detections were confirmed based on the short-time transient characteristic of tonal sounds. The burst pulse, fundamental frequency, and harmonic were separated during post-processing. The detection results can be used to analyze the frequency distribution and modulation of the tonal sounds. Following individual contour extractions, the tonal sounds were classified to examine the repertoire composition through duration and frequency normalization. An evident nighttime occurrence was identified for both the burst pulse and tonal sound. The mode frequency of tonal sound did not show a significant difference, but the percentage of overlapping tonal sounds, Shannon entropy of frequency distribution, and repertoire complexity varied significantly among diurnal cycles. The current framework of quantification on tonal sound modulation and repertoire complexity provides intuitive parameters for the variability of cetacean behavior, which can be used to examine the temporal variations of cetacean habitat use. The precision in distinguishing different species and behaviors may be increased by comparing the repertoire established through automatic classification.

AB  - Globally, the Indian Ocean appears to have the greatest blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus ssp) acoustic diversity, with at least four acoustic populations from three defined sub-species. To understand how these different populations use this region as habitat, we first need to characterize their spatial and seasonal distributions. Here, we build on previous passive acoustic monitoring studies and analyze a passive acoustic dataset spanning large temporal (9 years) and spatial (3-9 sites covering more than 12 million km(2) of potential acoustic habitat in the southwest Indian Ocean) scales. A novel detection algorithm was employed to investigate the long-term presence of Antarctic blue whale and SEIO and SWIO pygmy blue whale calls. We found that Antarctic and pygmy blue whales have completely different spatial and seasonal distribution in the southern Indian Ocean. Antarctic blue whales are heard almost year-round on the whole array, with great inter-annual variability. The two pygmy blue whales share a highly stable seasonal acoustic presence, but their geographical distributions overlap at only a few central Indian Ocean sites. However, Antarctic and pygmy blue whale acoustic co-occurrence is common, especially in sub-tropical waters. These temporal and spatial distributions strengthen our understanding of seasonal occurrence and habitat use of distinct populations of blue whales in the southern Indian Ocean. A better comprehension of the ecology of Indian Ocean blue whales will require interdisciplinary studies to examine the drivers of the variability seen from passive acoustic studies.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) produce song and non-song vocalisations, which allows their presence to be detected through passive acoustic monitoring. To determine the seasonal and diel acoustic presence and acoustic behaviour of humpback whales at the migratory stopover site off Bermuda, three hydrophones were deployed between March 2018 and April 2019 on Challenger Bank and the Bermuda platform. Song was the predominant vocalisation type encountered, with 65% of song recordings containing whale chorus and a clear seasonal trend of humpback whale occurrence in the spring and winter months from late December to mid-May. A strong diel pattern in singing activity was detected. Singing activity significantly increased at night relative to the daytime (p<0.01), whilst twilight periods were characterised by intermediate levels of singing. The song structure encountered in spring 2018 consisted of 18 units, 6 themes and 5 transitional phrases. The high occurrence of whale chorus and the strong seasonal and diel patterns of male humpback whale singing activity highlights the importance of Bermuda not just on their northward migration during spring, as described historically, but also on their southward migration during winter. Bermuda therefore constitutes a two-way migratory stopover site for humpback whales. The present study also provides Bermuda's planning authorities with better constraints on the duration and intensity of anthropogenic activities in these waters.

AB  - The Chukchi Sea environment changes considerably in physical and biological conditions, driven by the expanding volume of warm Pacific summer water. These environmental changes can affect the migration timing of baleen whales in the southern Chukchi Sea. However, few studies have been conducted in this area to determine the migration timing of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), the only baleen whale species endemic to the Arctic region. In this study, we conducted a fixed passive acoustic monitoring of bowhead whales in the southern Chukchi Sea from July 2012 to October 2015 and compared the occurrence patterns of vocalizations to physical and biological environmental factors. Bowhead whale calls were detected in fall/winter and spring during the ice-freezing and retreating periods, respectively. The fall migration timing of bowhead whales through the southern Chukchi Sea was delayed in the years when the timing of sea ice formation was late, and it formed increasingly later in the years 2013, 2014, and 2012, in that sequence. Moreover, the sea surface temperature decreased before freeze-up, which affected the timing of fall migration of bowhead whales. There was no clear relationship between the occurrence of bowhead whale calls and the abundance of prey, especially in spring, suggesting that most bowhead whales use the southern Chukchi Sea as a corridor during their spring northward migrations. However, the occurrence of bowhead whales and high abundance of zooplankton in October-November present the possibility that bowhead whales expand their feeding area in the southern Chukchi Sea.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an increasingly used technique to access the occurrence, distribution, and abundance of cetaceans that may be visually unavailable most of the time. The largest tailings dam failure disaster occurred on 5 November 2015, when the Fundao dam collapsed, releasing over 50 million cubic meters of tailings into the Doce River basin; 14 days later, the tailings plume reached the Atlantic Ocean. PAM was implemented in the concerned area and cetacean species were acoustically identified. Whistles and clicks of visual and acoustic matches were used to predict and classify exclusive acoustic records through random forest models. The identified species were Guiana, rough-toothed, and bottlenose dolphins. Additionally, the franciscana, the most threatened cetacean in the western South Atlantic Ocean, was also acoustically identified. The whistle classifier had 86.9% accuracy with final frequency, duration, and maximum frequency ranked as the most important parameters. The clicks classifier had 86.7% accuracy with peak frequency and 3 dB bandwidth as the most important parameters for classifying species. Considering the potential effect of the increase in turbidity on sound transmission, such as attenuation, the presented classifier should be continuously improved with novel data collected from long-term acoustic monitoring.

AB  - Several marine autonomous recording units (MARUs) were deployed in northeastern Gulf of Mexico from 2010-2012 to study the acoustic ecology of Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. However, the acoustic repertoire of this sub-population is poorly documented, presently limiting the efficacy of acoustic monitoring applications. Numerous stereotyped, low-frequency signals from a putative biological sound source were found throughout the recordings. Sounds fell into three categories distinguished by spectral and temporal properties. Multiple calls overlapped temporally on individual MARUs, suggesting that multiple sources produced these sounds. The basic features are similar to those from other mysticetes, but they differ from any previously published sounds. Since Bryde's whales are the most common mysticete in the Gulf and have previously been observed within the recording area on multiple occasions, it is likely that Bryde's whales are the most probable source of these sounds. These results potentially identify a suite of previously undocumented calls from Bryde's whales, which could facilitate future passive acoustic monitoring efforts to better understand the population dynamics and status of this sub-population.

AB  - The use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) around marine developments is commonplace. A buffer-based PAM system (e.g., C-POD) is a cost-effective method for assessing cetacean acoustic presence. Devices have been deployed by Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) Marine around the United Kingdom, allowing an examination of the performance of C-PODs with respect to background noise, tilt angle, and environmental factors. C-PODs were found to often only monitor for a few seconds of each minute, resulting in significant loss of monitoring time. Issues were likely driven by environmental and deployment factors. The practical limitations of buffer-based PAM systems in high-energy/noisy environments are indicated here.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are highly vocal, producing a wide repertoire of sounds often organised into song. Song is prolific at breeding sites but also documented along migration routes and at feeding sites, including along the west coast of South Africa (28 degrees-34 degrees S). Here we examine the occurrence of humpback whale song within False Bay, South Africa, using intermittent recording periods from moored hydrophones spanning September 2016 to January 2018. Recordings from four locations were scrutinised for humpback whale vocalisations using long-term spectral averages (LTSAs). In total, 7205 h were examined, with song identified in 3% (211 h) of recording hours. Song was exclusively documented in September and October 2016 and was more prevalent at the most westerly sites. Diel patterns of song presence were modelled, showing the likelihood of detection was higher in the early morning and late evening (GAM: p < 0.05). On 15 occasions, two or more singers were detected with temporally overlapping song components. These results indicate prevalent, albeit seasonal, song production by humpback whales off the coast of South Africa and highlight the utility of passive acoustic monitoring to indicate their presence, behaviour, and potential population linkages in the region.

AB  - The endangered beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) population in Cook Inlet, AK faces threats from a variety of anthropogenic factors, including coastal development, oil and gas exploration, vessel traffic, and military activities. To address existing gaps in understanding about the occurrence of belugas in Cook Inlet, a project was developed to use passive acoustic monitoring to document the year-round distribution of belugas, as well as killer whales (Orcinus orca), which prey on belugas. Beginning in June 2009, ten moorings were deployed throughout the Inlet and refurbished every two to eight months. Despite challenging conditions consisting of strong tidal currents carrying debris and seasonal ice cover, 83% of mooring deployments were successfully recovered. Noise from water flow, vessel traffic, and/or industrial activities was present at several sites, potentially masking some signals. However, belugas were successfully detected at multiple locations. Detections were relatively common in the upper inlet and less common or absent at middle and lower inlet locations. Killer whale signals were also recorded. Some seasonal variability in the occurrence of both belugas and killer whales was evident. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is an efficient way to provide insights on the ecology of large whales. This approach allows for long-term and species-specific monitoring over large areas. In this study, we examined six years (2010 to 2015) of continuous acoustic recordings at up to seven different locations in the Central and Southern Indian Basin to assess the peak periods of presence, seasonality and migration movements of Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia). An automated method is used to detect the Antarctic blue whale stereotyped call, known as Z-call. Detection results are analyzed in terms of distribution, seasonal presence and diel pattern of emission at each site. Z-calls are detected year-round at each site, except for one located in the equatorial Indian Ocean, and display highly seasonal distribution. This seasonality is stable across years for every site, but varies between sites. Z-calls are mainly detected during autumn and spring at the subantarctic locations, suggesting that these sites are on the Antarctic blue whale migration routes, and mostly during winter at the subtropical sites. In addition to these seasonal trends, there is a significant diel pattern in Z-call emission, with more Z-calls in daytime than in nighttime. This diel pattern may be related to the blue whale feeding ecology.

AB  - Marine organisms inhabiting coastal waters are known to be driven by periodic cycles such as diel, tidal, and seasonal changes. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) breed in shallow and warm coastal waters, with males singing complex songs during the breeding season. To investigate periodic variations in humpback whale singing activities, we conducted fixed passive acoustic monitoring in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, Japan, from winter to spring during 2016-2018. The singing activity and individual number of singers were observed throughout the day and night using a very long baseline passive acoustic array. The occurrence of singers peaked before sunrise and in the evening and was reduced during the daytime. The frequency of song reception depended on the tidal phase. A generalised additive model demonstrated that the occurrence of singers increased during the flood tide and decreased during the ebb tide in the waters west of Chichijima Island. These results suggest that the singing behaviour of humpback whales in breeding areas is affected by the diel and tidal cycles. Male humpback whales may change their behaviour or singing location depending on the strength and direction of the tidal current, considering that the selection of a stable location is beneficial for singing whales.

AB  - The presence of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA is not well understood. Adequate protection of right whales in the face of plans to develop offshore renewable energy requires more information about this species' distribution and occurrence in this region. We present findings from the first year-round study dedicated to marine mammals in New Jersey's nearshore waters using line transect surveys and passive acoustic monitoring. Four groups of right whales, including a cow-calf pair, were sighted. Right whales were detected acoustically during all seasons. Sightings of females and subsequent confirmations of these same individuals in the calving grounds a month or less later illustrate that these waters are part of this species' migratory corridor. Observations of skim-feeding behavior suggest that feeding may also occur in areas farther south than the main feeding grounds. Based on the year-round occurrence of right whales off New Jersey, we recommend that presumed seasonal migratory patterns not be used alone to determine the timing of construction activities or monitoring/mitigation efforts for offshore development. Our results also provide support for the expansion of existing critical habitat to include nearshore waters of the mid-Atlantic.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring with hydrophones makes it possible to detect the presence of marine animals over large areas. For monitoring to be cost-effective, this process should be fully automated. We explore a new approach to detecting whale calls, using an end-to-end neural architecture and traditional speech features. We compare the results of the new approach with a convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to spectrograms, currently the standard approach to whale call detection. Experiments are conducted using the "Acoustic trends for the blue and fin whale library" from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC). We experiment with different types of speech features (mel frequency cepstral coefficients and filter banks) and different ways of framing the task. We demonstrate that a time delay neural network is a viable solution for whale call detection, with the additional benefit that spectrogram tuning required to obtain high-quality spectrograms in challenging acoustic conditions is no longer necessary. While the initial speech feature-based system (accuracy 96%) did not outperform the CNN (accuracy 98%) when trained on exactly the same dataset, it presents a viable approach to explore further.

KW  - MIXTURES
AB  - Many marine mammal species are highly social and are frequently encountered in groups or aggregations. When conducting passive acoustic monitoring in such circumstances, recordings commonly contain vocalizations of multiple individuals which overlap in time and frequency. This paper considers the use of blind source separation as a method for processing these recordings to separate the calls of individuals. The example problem considered here is that of the songs of humpback whales. The high levels of noise and long impulse responses can make source separation in underwater contexts a challenging proposition. The approach present here is based on time-frequency masking, allied to a noise reduction process. The technique is assessed using simulated and measured data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for separating humpback whale songs.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of the global ocean has increased dramatically over the last decade, providing insights into seasonal sea ice and wind/wave variability, biodiversity, geophysical hazards, and anthropogenic noise impacts. All of these phenomena are sentinels of marine ecosystem health and ocean climate change. Recognizing the utility of underwater sound, the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) formed a passive acoustic research program with the goal of quantifying deep-ocean and coastal soundscapes in support of NOAA's mission to conserve and manage marine ecosystems. PMEL Acoustics Program researchers have built a stable of novel ocean technologies, including autonomous stationary hydrophones, mobile platforms, and near-real-time surface buoys with satellite communication capability. These passive acoustic monitoring systems have been deployed in every major ocean basin on Earth, enabling significant advancements in understanding of natural and anthropogenic sounds. This progress includes evaluation of human-made sound levels across US waters, observations of ship noise fluctuations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluation of noise levels from offshore wave-energy devices. Progress in natural sound research includes assessment of seasonal variability in the presence of endangered cetacean species due to population recovery and/or changing ocean temperatures as well as early detection of the collapse of an Antarctic ice shelf.

AB  - Odontocetes depredating fish caught on longlines is a serious socio-economic and conservation issue. A good understanding of the underwater depredation behavior by odontocetes is therefore required. Historically, depredation on demersal longlines has always been assumed to occur during the hauling phase. In this study, we have focused on the depredation behavior of two ecotypes of killer whales, Orcinus orca, (Crozet and Type D) from demersal longlines around the Crozet Archipelago (Southern Indian Ocean) using passive acoustic monitoring. We assessed 74 hr of killer whale acoustic presence out of 1,233 hr of recordings. Data were obtained from 29 hydrophone deployments from five fishing vessels between February and March 2018. We monitored killer whale buzzing activity (i.e., echolocation signals) as a proxy for feeding attempts around soaking longlines. These recordings revealed that the two ecotypes were feeding at close range from soaking longlines, even when fishing vessels were not present. Our results suggest that both killer whale ecotypes are likely to depredate soaking longlines, which would imply an underestimation of their depredation rates. The implication of underestimating depredation rates is inaccurate accounting for fish mortality in fisheries' stock assessments.

AB  - Aiming to gather information on southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) mother-calf pairs' vocal behavior, archival acoustic recorders were deployed at a calving area off Brazil. Manual inspection of spectrograms revealed seven call classes: upcall, downcall, down-upcall, tonal variable, tonal constant, hybrid, and pulsive calls, which are consistent with those previously described for this species in Argentina. Gunshots and warbles, vocalizations described from other right whale species, were not detected. Mean values of start, end, maximum, minimum and peak frequencies, frequency bandwidth and duration were calculated for each call class. Start and end frequencies, frequency bandwidth and duration of upcalls recorded off Brazil were compared to those from other right whale populations and species. Only mean duration of upcalls from Brazil were significantly different from upcalls from all other populations. Differences in call duration may be driven by differences in demographic factors or background noise features among study areas. The repertoire characterization presented in this study will contribute to increase the utility of passive acoustic monitoring as a tool for conservation and research of southern right whales off Brazil as it provides important baseline information on the vocal behavior of this species.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has proven to be an indispensable tool for many aspects of baleen whale research. Manual detection of whale calls on these large data sets demands extensive manual labor. Automated whale call detectors offer a more efficient approach and have been developed for many species and call types. However, calls with a large level of variability such as fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 40 Hz call and blue whale (B. musculus) D call have been challenging to detect automatically and hence no practical automated detector exists for these two call types. Using a modular approach consisting of faster region-based convolutional neural network followed by a convolutional neural network, we have created automated detectors for 40 Hz calls and D calls. Both detectors were tested on recordings with high- and low density of calls and, when selecting for detections with high classification scores, they were shown to have precision ranging from 54% to 57% with recall ranging from 72% to 78% for 40 Hz and precision ranging from 62% to 64% with recall ranging from 70 to 73% for D calls. As these two call types are produced by both sexes, using them in long-term studies would remove sex-bias in estimates of temporal presence and movement patterns.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are known to utilize Massachusetts Bay as a feeding ground in the spring and summer, during the annual migration of the Gulf of Maine sub-population. However, there is a limited understanding of the pattern of humpback whale occurrence in this region outside of the feeding period. Passive acoustic monitoring of Massachusetts Bay over a two-year period, revealed an extended presence of acoustically active humpback whales throughout a majority of the study period (87%; 633 days of presence out of 725 days of acoustic monitoring). Humpback whale presence oscillated between lengthy periods of consistent presence (April to December) and relatively shorter periods of variable presence (December to March). Seasonal variation in presence was evident during three distinct phases: (1) maximum-presence from spring to early winter; (2) variable-presence in early winter and early spring; and (3) minimum-presence mid-winter. The variation in seasonal presence was concurrent with coarse migratory patterns of humpback whales, and yearly variations in presence presumably reflect a shift in the influx and efflux of whales between years. The extended presence of humpbacks in this area suggests that Massachusetts Bay is an important, year-round habitat for the Gulf of Maine sub-population, and may warrant revision of management and regulatory practices to reflect this presence.

TI  - Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed hydrophone array results in identification of a previously unknown beaked whale habitat
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA  - English
KW  - GAS
AB  - Beaked whales are diverse and species rich taxa. They spend the vast majority of their time submerged, regularly diving to depths of hundreds to thousands of meters, typically occur in small groups, and behave inconspicuously at the surface. These factors make them extremely difficult to detect using standard visual survey methods. However, recent advancements in acoustic detection capabilities have made passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) a viable alternative. Beaked whales can be discriminated from other odontocetes by the unique characteristics of their echolocation clicks. In 2009 and 2010, PAM methods using towed hydrophone arrays were tested. These methods proved highly effective for real-time detection of beaked whales in the Southern California Bight (SCB) and were subsequently implemented in 2011 to successfully detect and track beaked whales during the ongoing Southern California Behavioral Response Study. The three year field effort has resulted in (1) the successful classification and tracking of Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Baird's (Berardius bairdii), and unidentified Mesoplodon beaked whale species and (2) the identification of areas of previously unknown beaked whale habitat use. Identification of habitat use areas will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between beaked whale distribution, occurrence, and preferred habitat characteristics on a relatively small spatial scale. These findings will also provide information that can be used to promote more effective management and conservation of beaked whales in the SCB, a heavily used Naval operation and training region.

AB  - In the past decade, much progress has been made in real-time passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammal occurrence and distribution from autonomous platforms (e. g., gliders, floats, buoys), but current systems focus primarily on a single call type produced by a single species, often from a single location. A hardware and software system was developed to detect, classify, and report 14 call types produced by 4 species of baleen whales in real time from ocean gliders. During a 3-week deployment in the central Gulf of Maine in late November and early December 2012, two gliders reported over 25 000 acoustic detections attributed to fin, humpback, sei, and right whales. The overall false detection rate for individual calls was 14%, and for right, humpback, and fin whales, false predictions of occurrence during 15-min reporting periods were 5% or less. Transmitted pitch tracks-compact representations of sounds-allowed unambiguous identification of both humpback and fin whale song. Of the ten cases when whales were sighted during aerial or shipboard surveys and a glider was within 20 km of the sighting location, nine were accompanied by real-time acoustic detections of the same species by the glider within 612 h of the sighting time.

AB  - Little is known of the movements and seasonal occurrence of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of South Africa and the Antarctic, populations once brought to near extinction by historic commercial whaling. We investigated the seasonal occurrence and diel-vocalizing pattern of humpback whale songs off the west coast of South Africa (migration route and opportunistic feeding ground) and the Maud Rise, Antarctica (feeding ground), using passive acoustic monitoring data collected between early 2014 and early 2017. Data were collected using acoustic autonomous recorders deployed 200-300 m below the sea surface in waters 855, 1,118 and 4,400 m deep. Acoustic data were manually analyzed for humpback whale vocalizations. While non-song calls were never identified, humpback whale songs were detected from June through December in South African waters, with a peak in percentage of acoustic occurrence around September/October in the austral spring. In Antarctic waters, songs were detected from March through May and in July (with a peak occurrence in April) where acoustic occurrence of humpback whales was negatively correlated to distance to the sea ice extent. Humpback whales were more vocally active at night than in the day at all recording sites. Detection range modelling indicates that humpback whale vocalizations could be detected as far as 18 and 45 km from recorders in South African and Antarctic waters, respectively. This study provides a multi-year description of the offshore acoustic occurrence of humpback whales off the west coast of South Africa and Maud Rise, Antarctica, regions that should continue to be monitored to understand these recovering populations.

AB  - Killer whales in British Columbia are at risk, and little is known about their winter distribution. Passive acoustic monitoring of their year-round habitat is a valuable supplemental method to traditional visual and photographic surveys. However, long-term acoustic studies of odontocetes have some limitations, including the generation of large amounts of data that require highly time-consuming processing. There is a need to develop tools and protocols to maximize the efficiency of such studies. Here, two types of analysis, real-time and long term spectral averages, were compared to assess their performance at detecting killer whale calls in long-term acoustic recordings. In addition, two different duty cycles, 1/3 and 2/3, were tested. Both the use of long term spectral averages and a lower duty cycle resulted in a decrease in call detection and positive pod identification, leading to underestimations of the amount of time the whales were present. The impact of these limitations should be considered in future killer whale acoustic surveys. A compromise between a lower resolution data processing method and a higher duty cycle is suggested for maximum methodological efficiency. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The United States and Canada employ dynamic management strategies to improve conservation outcomes for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). These strategies rely on near real-time knowledge of whale distribution generated from visual surveys and opportunistic sightings. Near real-time passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems have been operational for many years but acoustic detections of right whales have yet to be incorporated in dynamic management because of concerns over uncertainty in the location of acoustically detected whales. This rationale does not consider whale movement or its contribution to location uncertainty following either visual or acoustic detection. The goal of this study was to estimate uncertainties in right whale location following acoustic and visual detection and identify the timescale at which the uncertainties become similar owing to post-detection whale movement. We simulated whale movement using an autocorrelated random walk model parameterized to approximate three common right whale behavioral states (traveling, feeding, and socializing). We then used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate whale location over a 96-hr period given the initial uncertainty from the acoustic and visual detection methods and the evolving uncertainties arising from whale movement. The results demonstrated that for both detection methods the uncertainty in whale location increases rapidly following the initial detection and can vary by an order of magnitude after 96 hr depending on the behavioral state of the whale. The uncertainties in whale location became equivalent between visual and acoustic detections within 24-48 hr depending on whale behavior and acoustic detection range parameterization. These results imply that using both visual and acoustic detections provides enhanced information for the dynamic management of this visually and acoustically cryptic and highly mobile species.

AB  - Marine megafauna occurrence was recorded in the deep-sea region bordering the abyssal plain similar to 400 km north-west of Luanda, Angola. The survey took place during an Environmental Baseline Study (EBS), prior to drilling exploration activities, with the goal of characterizing the habitat and biodiversity of the region. Offshore shipboard surveys were conducted during September 2018 in water depths ranging from 2350-3850 m. We recorded daytime sightings of marine mammals and sea turtles and at night made audio recordings using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) methods focused on capturing the sounds of vocalizing marine mammals. A variety of species were visually detected, including the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), common dolphin (Delphinus spp.), striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), Atlantic spotted dolphin (S. frontalis), and olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). Acoustic click bouts similar to those made by several odontocete species, possibly including beaked whales, were recorded within the 25-48 kHz range. The humpback whale was the most frequently sighted species, accounting for 56% of mammal sightings, indicating a potential far offshore migratory habitat in this region. Most notably, right whales (probable Eubalaena australis) were visually observed. This is the first confirmed record of right whales in Angolan waters since the early 1900s. As development expands in this offshore region, these data can usefully inform future monitoring and mitigation strategies focused on minimizing impacts to wildlife.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly employed to monitor whales, their population size, habitat usage, and behaviour. However, in the case of the eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue whale (EIOPB whale), its applicability is limited by our lack of understanding of the behavioural context of sound production. This study explored the context of singing behaviour using a 7.6-day biotelemetry dataset from a single EIOPB whale moving north from 31.5 degrees S to 28.5 degrees S along the Western Australian coast and a simultaneously collected, but separate, acoustic recording. Diving behaviour was classified using an automated classification schema. Singing was identified in the depth, pitch, and fluking time series of the dive profile. The EIOPB whale sang profusely as it migrated, spending more time singing during the day (76.8%) than at night (64.9%), and most during twilight periods (83.3%). The EIOPB whale almost exclusively produced the three-unit (P3) song while milling. It sang the two-unit (P2) song in similar proportions to the P3 song while travelling, except at night when P3 was sung 2.7 times more than P2. A correlation between singing depth, migration duration, and water temperature provides a biological basis to explain depth preferences for sound production, which may contribute to the cause of intra- and inter-annual sound frequency trends.

AB  - North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis calve during winter off Florida and Georgia, USA, a region of high shipping traffic, and ship-strike risk is a concern. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of right whales on their foraging grounds increases detection opportunities to inform mariners of right whale presence and reduce the likelihood of ship strike. This study evaluates the effectiveness of PAM on right whale calving grounds by documenting the occurrence of right whale call detections on 2 types of acoustic instruments deployed off the coasts of Savannah, GA, and Jacksonville, FL, and comparing results with visual sightings and ambient noise conditions. Over 400 right whale calling events were detected on archival marine acoustic recording units (MARUs) at 2 sites across 2 seasons, and 92% of these calling events included right whale upcalls. Daily detections on archival MARUs and near-real time Autobuoys, which automatically detect upcalls, were significantly correlated and occurred on up to 25% of days off Savannah and 46% of days off Jacksonville. Visual aerial surveys detected right whales within 20 km of each acoustic site on a similar proportion of days with visual survey effort (15 to 33% off Savannah and 34 to 43% off Jacksonville). Acoustic methods enabled greater temporal effort, yielding a 2- to 10-fold increase in days with right whale detections over visual methods. Shipping noise and fish chorusing likely mask right whale call detections. However, considering the high number of right whale calling event detections by PAM during this study the results indicate that this is an effective method to augment detection of right whales in this environment, especially at night when they cannot be seen.

AB  - Over the years, researchers have continued to put forward solutions to lessen the threats faced by whales within their ecosystem. The correct detection of the different species of whale is important in the search for solutions that will lessen the threats. In order to accurately detect and classify whale species, a number of techniques have been proposed over the years, with varying degrees of success. This research seeks to improve the performance of the hidden Markov models (HMMs), which is one of the most consistent methods for the detection and classification of whale vocalisations. The performance of HMMs is affected by the quality of the feature vectors fed into them. Thus, this research proposes feature extraction (FE) techniques based on principal component analysis. The principal components (PC) computed from PCA and kernel PCA were uniquely transformed into feature vector structures suitable for the HMMs. The emerging models, PCA-HMMs and kPCA-HMMs, were experimented with on passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) datasets containing southern right whale and humpback whale vocalisations. The results from the experiments showed that the kPCA-HMMs outperformed PCA-HMMs. This is due to kPCA's ability to find non-linear subspaces that may exist in whale vocalisations. Furthermore, the results of the developed PC-HMMs were compared with other existing FE techniques used with HMMs in the literature for the detection of whale vocalisations. The proposed PC-HMMs did not only outperform the existing FE-HMMs but also offered lower computational complexity than the existing HMMs for the detection of whale vocalisations.

AB  - Cetaceans have elicited the attention of researchers in recent decades due to their importance to the ecosystem and their economic values. They use sound for communication, echolocation and other social activities. Their sounds are highly non-stationary, transitory and range from short to long sounds. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a popular method used for monitoring cetaceans in their ecosystems. The volumes of data accumulated using PAM are usually big, so they are difficult to analyze using manual inspection. Therefore different techniques with mixed outcomes have been developed for the automatic detection and classification of signals of different cetacean species. So far, no single technique developed is perfect to detect and classify the vocalizations of over 82 known species due to variability in time-frequency, difference in the amplitude among species and within species' vocal repertoire, physical environment, among others. The accuracy of any detector or classifier depends on the technique adopted as well as the nature of the signal to be analyzed. In this article, we review the existing techniques for the automatic detection and classification of cetacean vocalizations. We categorize the surveyed techniques, while emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques. The article suggests possible research directions that can improve existing detection and classification techniques. In addition, the article recommends other suitable techniques that can be used to analyze non-linear and non-stationary signals such as the cetaceans' signals. Several research have been dedicated to this topic, however, there is no review of these past results that gives a quick overview in the area of cetacean detection and classification. This review will help researchers and practitioners in the field to make insightful decisions based on their requirements.

AB  - Estimates of abundance and their changes through time are key elements of marine mammal conservation and management. Absolute marine mammal abundance in a region of the open ocean is often difficult to attain. However, methods of estimating their abundance based on passive acoustic recordings are becoming increasingly employed. This study shows that passive acoustic monitoring of North Atlantic minke whales with a single hydrophone provides sufficient information to estimate relative population abundance. An automated detector was developed for minke whale pulse trains and an approach for converting its output into a relative abundance index is proposed by accounting for detectability as well as false positives and negatives. To demonstrate this technique, a 2 y dataset from the seven sites of the Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network project on the U.S. east coast was analyzed. Resulting relative abundance indices confirm pulse train-calling minke whale presence in the deep waters of the outer continental shelf. The minkes are present December through April annually with the highest abundance near the site offshore of Savannah, Georgia.

AB  - The occurrence of typical inter-click intervals (ICIs) is considered for the analysis of marine mammals signals. A new framework for passive acoustic monitoring is introduced based on ICI information retrieved from ocean acoustic data. The proposed scheme involves extraction of plausible click trains consist of echolocation clicks from various annotated data of marine mammals; here we investigate sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), and killer whale (Orcinus orca). Then a preliminary investigation on the analysis of the proposed ICI-based parameters is carried out. In order to characterize the biological clicks, some distinct information of ICI are derived from the click trains, which are extracted from the phase slope functions of the signals. The experimental results obtained from real-recorded ocean data reveal that the proposed ICI-based scheme can be a useful tool for monitoring various types of marine mammal vocalizations.

AB  - Beaked whales can remain submerged for an hour or more and are difficult to sight when they come to the surface to breathe. Passive acoustic detection (PAD) not only complements traditional visual-based methods for detecting these species but also can be more effective because beaked whales produce clicks regularly to echolocate on prey during deep foraging dives. The effectiveness of PAD for beaked whales depends not only on the acoustic behavior and output of the animals but also on environmental conditions and the quality of the passive sonar implemented. A primary constraint on the range at which beaked whale clicks can be detected involves their high frequencies, which attenuate rapidly, resulting in limited ranges of detection, especially in adverse environmental conditions. Given current knowledge of source parameters and in good conditions, for example, with a wind speed of 2 m/s, a receiver close to the surface should be able to detect acoustically Cuvier's beaked whales with a high probability at distances up to 0.7 km, provided the listening duration exceeds the deep dive interval, about 2.5 h on average. Detection ranges beyond 4 km are unlikely and would require low ambient noise or special sound propagation conditions. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.2988277]

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has become an increasingly prevalent tool for estimating density of marine mammals, such as beaked whales, which vocalize often but are difficult to survey visually. Counts of acoustic cues (e.g., vocalizations), when corrected for detection probability, can be translated into animal density estimates by applying an individual cue production rate multiplier. It is essential to understand variation in these rates to avoid biased estimates. The most direct way to measure cue production rate is with animal-mounted acoustic recorders. This study utilized data from sound recording tags deployed on Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris, 19 deployments) and Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris, 16 deployments) beaked whales, in two locations per species, to explore spatial and temporal variation in click production rates. No spatial or temporal variation was detected within the average click production rate of Blainville's beaked whales when calculated over dive cycles (including silent periods between dives); however, spatial variation was detected when averaged only over vocal periods. Cuvier's beaked whales exhibited significant spatial and temporal variation in click production rates within vocal periods and when silent periods were included. This evidence of variation emphasizes the need to utilize appropriate cue production rates when estimating density from passive acoustic data. (C) 2017 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Herring-eating killer whales debilitate herring with underwater tail slaps and likely herd herring into tighter schools using a feeding-specific low-frequency pulsed call ('herding' call). Feeding on herring may be dependent upon daylight, as the whales use their white underside to help herd herring; however, feeding at night has not been investigated. The production of feeding-specific sounds provides an opportunity to use passive acoustic monitoring to investigate feeding behaviour at different times of day. We compared the acoustic behaviour of killer whales between day and night, using an autonomous recorder deployed in Iceland during winter. Based upon acoustic detection of underwater tail slaps used to feed upon herring we found that killer whales fed both at night and day: they spent 50% of their time at night and 73% of daytime feeding. Interestingly, there was a significant diel variation in acoustic behaviour. Herding calls were significantly associated with underwater tail slap rate and were recorded significantly more often at night, suggesting that in low-light conditions killer whales rely more on acoustics to herd herring. Communicative sounds were also related to underwater tail slap rate and produced at different rates during day and night. The capability to adapt feeding behaviour to different light conditions may be particularly relevant for predator species occurring in high latitudes during winter, when light availability is limited.

AB  - Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are among the least studied of all the large mammals. This is especially true of Shepherd's beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi), which until recently had been very rarely sighted alive, with nothing known about the species' acoustic behaviour. Vocalisations of Shepherd's beaked whales were recorded using a hydrophone array on two separate days during marine mammal surveys of the Otago submarine canyons in New Zealand. After carefully screening the recordings, two distinct call types were found; broadband echolocation clicks, and burst pulses. Broadband echolocation clicks (n = 476) had a median inter-click-interval (ICI) of 0.46 s and median peak frequency of 19.2 kHz. The burst pulses (n = 33) had a median peak frequency of constituent clicks (n = 1741) of 14.7 kHz, and median ICI of 11 ms. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited bandwidth used to record the signals. To the authors' knowledge, this study presents the first analysis of the characteristics of Shepherd's beaked whale sounds. It will help with identification of the species in passive acoustic monitoring records, and future efforts to further analyse this species' vocalisations. (C) 2018 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - In this paper, we present an automatic method, without human supervision, for the detection and classification of blue whale vocalizations from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data using Hidden Markov Model technology implemented with a state-of-the-art machine learning platform, the Kaldi speech processing toolkit. 157.5 hours of PAM data were annotated for model training and testing, selected from a dataset collected from the Corcovado Gulf, Chilean Patagonia in 2016. The system obtained produced 85.3% accuracy for detection and classification of a range of different blue whale vocalizations. This system was then validated by comparing its unsupervised detection and classification results with the published results of southeast Pacific blue whale song phrase ('SEP2') via spectrogram cross-correlation, involving a dataset collected with a different hydrophone instrument. The proposed system led to a reduction in the root mean square error relative to published results as high as 80% when compared with comparable methods employed elsewhere. This is a significant step in advancing the monitoring of endangered whale populations in this region, which remains poorly covered in terms of PAM and general ocean observation. With further training, testing and validation, this system can be applied to other target signals and regions of the world ocean.

AB  - North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) produce a loud, broadband signal referred to as the gunshot sound. These distinctive sounds may be suitable for passive acoustic monitoring and detection of right whales; however, little is known about the prevalence of these sounds in important right whale habitats, such as the Bay of Fundy. This study investigates the timing and distribution of gunshot sound production on the summer feeding grounds using an array of five marine acoustic recording units deployed in the Bay of Fundy, Canada in mid-summer 2004 and 2005. Gunshot sounds were common, detected on 37 of 38 recording days. Stereotyped gunshot bouts averaged 1.5 h, with some bouts exceeding 7 h in duration with up to seven individuals producing gunshots at any one time. Bouts were more commonly detected in the late afternoon and evening than during the morning hours. Locations of gunshots in bouts indicated that whales producing the sounds were either stationary or showed directional travel, suggesting gunshots have different communication functions depending on behavioral context. These results indicate that gunshots are a common right whale sound produced during the summer months and are an important component in the acoustic communication system of this endangered species.

AB  - Collisions between traffic and wildlife can have population-level consequences and carry economic costs. Vessel-strike may threaten the viability of whale populations especially where habitat overlaps with frequent vessel traffic; as seen in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, which is the entrance to the busy Ports of Auckland and holds a year-round population of endangered Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). Here, we identify a serious threat: out of 44 Bryde's whale-deaths, 17 of 20 (85%), with known cause of mortality, sustained injuries consistent with vessel-strike; a mortality rate that is likely to be unsustainable. This information started a social forum with stakeholders engaged in science-based discussion of mitigation measures to reduce lethal vessel-strikes in this region. To determine the viability of different mitigation actions we studied Bryde's whale behavior with suction-cup attached tags. Tagged whales (n = 7, 62.5 h) spent 91% of their time at depths within the maximum draft of vessels transiting the Gulf, increasing the probability of vessel-strike. Whales are broadly distributed throughout the Gulf so re-routing traffic would not lessen the threat of vessel-strike. Monitoring whales visually is difficult and not applicable at night, when whales rested closer to the surface than during the day. Passive acoustic monitoring is unreliable due to the whales' low vocal activity and because low frequency calls are susceptible to masking from vessel noise. These findings resulted in a Transit Protocol for Shipping including voluntary speed restrictions and a monitoring plan, highlighting the value of scientific and social stakeholders working together for conservation.

AB  - Although sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) are distributed throughout the globe, their behaviour and vocal repertoire are poorly described. We used passive acoustic monitoring to describe the vocal behaviour of sei whales in the Falkland Islands, between December 2018 and April 2019. We isolated more than 2000 low-frequency calls for manual classification, of which 510 calls with high signal-to-noise ratio were quantitatively measured. Five categories of stereotyped call types in the 15-230 Hz range were described, some with multiple subcategories. These included some similar to previously described calls (e.g. downsweeps), but others that were novel in acoustic structure and frequency band. In the mid-frequency range, we documented a highly stereotyped, hierarchically structured and rhythmically repetitive song display. Songs were arranged in phrases with a structure composed of repetitive sub-phrases, and a diverse variety of sounds in the 1-5 kHz range. Singing commenced in late February, despite the presence of whales and calls since early December, and continued through April. These acoustic properties and behavioural characteristics indicate that this is likely a male breeding display similar to songs and singing of other balaenopterids. This is the first detailed description of a song display for sei whales, highlighting the importance of the Falkland Islands.

AB  - The performance of large-aperture hydrophone arrays to detect and localize blue and fin whales' 15-85 Hz signature vocalizations under ocean noise conditions was assessed through simulations from a normal mode propagation model combined to noise statistics from 15 960 h of recordings in Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. The probability density functions of 2482 summer noise level estimates in the call bands were used to attach a probability of detection/masking to the simulated call levels as a function of whale depth and range for typical environmental conditions. Results indicate that call detection was modulated by the calling depth relative to the sound channel axis and by modal constructive and destructive interferences with range. Masking of loud infrasounds could reach 40% at 30 km for a receiver at the optimal depth. The 30 LIB weaker blue whale D-call were subject to severe masking. Mapping the percentages of detection and localization allowed assessing the performance of a six-hydrophone array under mean- and low-noise conditions. This approach is helpful for optimizing hydrophone configuration in implementing passive acoustic monitoring arrays and building their detection function for whale density assessment, as an alternative to or in combination with the traditional undersampling visual methods.

AB  - Long-term passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals on navy ranges provides the opportunity to better understand the potential impact of sonar on populations. The navy range in Tongue of the Ocean (TOTO), Bahamas contains extensive hydrophone arrays, potentially allowing estimation of the density of deep diving, vocally active species such as the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Previous visual surveys in TOTO have been of limited spatiotemporal coverage and resulted in only sporadic sightings of sperm whales, whereas passive acoustic observations suggest the species is present year round. However, until now the means of acoustically determining the specific number of individuals in each cluster has been limited. We used recently developed algorithms to identify the number of echolocating whales present during a 42 d study period. We screened a 297 h acoustic data set to determine the proportion of time animals were present; fifty 10 min samples during presence were analyzed to estimate the number of individuals vocalizing during each sample. These counts were combined with an independent estimate of the proportion of 10 min periods when tagged animals vocalize. The estimated average density was 0.16 whales/1,000 km2 (CV 27%; 95% CI 0.0950.264). The method is potentially applicable to other areas containing dense hydrophone arrays.

AB  - We examined recordings from a 15-month (May 2009-July 2010) continuous acoustic data set collected from a bottom-mounted passive acoustic recorder at a sample frequency of 6 kHz off Portland, Victoria, Australia (38 degrees 33'01 '' S, 141 degrees 15'13 '' E) off southern Australia. Analysis revealed that calls from both subspecies were recorded at this site, and general additive modeling revealed that the number of calls varied significantly across seasons. Antarctic blue whales were detected more frequently from July to October 2009 and June to July 2010, corresponding to the suspected breeding season, while Australian blue whales were recorded more frequently from March to June 2010, coinciding with the feeding season. In both subspecies, the number of calls varied with time of day; Antarctic blue whale calls were more prevalent in the night to early morning, while Australian blue whale calls were detected more often from midday to early evening. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we show that each subspecies adopts different seasonal and daily call patterns which may be related to the ecological strategies of these subspecies. This study demonstrates the importance of passive acoustics in enabling us to understand and monitor subtle differences in the behavior and ecology of cryptic sympatric marine mammals.

AB  - False killer whales Pseudorca crassidens and short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus are known to interact with long-line fishing gear in Hawaiian waters, causing economic loss and leading to whale injuries and deaths. The main Hawaiian Islands' insular population of false killer whales is listed as endangered and the offshore population is considered 'strategic' under the Marine Mammal Protection Act due to relatively high bycatch levels. Discriminating between these species acoustically is problematic due to similarity in the spectral content of their echolocation clicks. We used passive acoustic monitoring along with data from satellite tags to distinguish signals from these 2 species. Acoustic encounters recorded with autonomous instruments offshore of the islands of Hawai'i and Kaua'i were matched with concurrent and nearby location information obtained from satellite tagged individuals. Two patterns of echolocation clicks were established for the 2 species. The overall spectral click parameters were highly similar (22 kHz peak and 25 kHz center frequency), but false killer whales had shorter duration and broader bandwidth clicks than short-finned pilot whales (225 mu s, 8 kHz [-3 dB bandwidth] and 545 mu s, 4 kHz, respectively). Also, short-finned pilot whale clicks showed distinct spectral peaks at 12 and 18 kHz. Automated classification techniques using Gaussian mixture models had a 6.5% median error rate. Based on these findings for echolocation clicks and prior published work on whistle classification, acoustic encounters of false killer whales and short-finned pilot whales on autonomous instruments should be identifiable to species level, leading to better long-term monitoring with the goal of mitigating bycatch.

AB  - The Arctic is changing rapidly, leading to changes in habitat availability and increased anthropogenic disturbance. Information on the distribution of animals is needed as these changes occur. We examine seasonal presence of marine mammals in the western Canadian Arctic near Sachs Harbour, Northwest Territories, using passive acoustic monitoring between 2015 and 2016. We also examined the influence of environmental variables (ice concentration and distance, wind speed) on the presence of these species. Both bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) arrived in late April, and belugas departed in mid-August, while bowheads departed in late October. Bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) vocalizations began in October, peaked from April through June, and stopped in early July. Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) vocalized occasionally in all months, but were generally quiet. Whales migrated in as the ice broke up and migrated out before ice formed in the autumn. Bearded seals started vocalizing as ice formed and stopped once ice was almost gone. Given the importance of sea ice to the timing of migration of whales and vocalization by bearded seals, the trends that we present here may change in the future due to the increasing ice-free season caused by climate change. Our study therefore serves as a baseline with which to monitor future change.

AB  - Six years of passive acoustic monitoring data from the Gulf of California reveal seasonality and movements for the northeastern Pacific blue whales. Three sites were studied, one from the southern (Punta Pescadero) and two from the northern (Isla Tiburon and Canal de Ballenas) regions. A total of 4,953 h were analyzed, and 15,539 blue whale calls were detected, of which 2,723 (18%) were A calls, 11,249 were B calls (72%), and 1,567 were D calls (10%). A and B calls were produced both as song units (2,524) or AB singular calls (2,026). The high rate of songs and their seasonality suggest that the GC is a winter-breeding ground. A shift from AB call predominance in winter, to D calls in spring and early summer, especially at the entrance of the GC, suggests the importance of this area for reproduction and foraging. Analysis of calling frequency suggests a clear movement of blue whales from the southern region (Punta Pescadero) to the northern regions (Canal de Ballenas and Isla Tiburon), with subsequent southern movement in March. The seasonality and mobility of blue whales in the Gulf of California, inferred from their calling, contributes to the ecological understanding of this population.

AB  - The appropriate use and interpretation of passive acoustic data for monitoring the Critically Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis (hereafter right whale) rely on knowledge of their calling behavior and how it varies with respect to time, space, demographics, and observed behavior. To assess such relationships in a habitat of increased management importance, sonobuoys (disposable drifting hydrophones) were deployed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, to record sounds from aggregating right whales during visual aerial surveys in the summers (June through August) of 2017 (n = 8), 2018 (n = 13), and 2019 (n = 16). Upcalls, gunshots, and various mid-frequency (250-800 Hz) tonal calls were compared to demographics and observed behaviors of concurrently observed right whales using correlation matrices, linear regressions, and generalized linear models. Our results show that (1) call rates increased from June to August for all call types; (2) calling rates were associated negatively with observed foraging behavior and positively with observed socializing behavior; (3) upcalls were occasionally produced at higher rates (>20 calls h-1) when in association with gunshots and tonal calls; (4) acoustic monitoring did not always detect right whale presence at fine timescales (2-6 h), but presence estimates were improved when multiple calls types were considered; and (5) calling rates were too variable to provide reliable density estimates of observed right whales. These results have important implications for the interpretation of passive acoustic monitoring in this habitat and provide evidence that some whale behaviors (e.g. socializing) may be reliably inferred from acoustics alone.

AB  - Mobile predators serve important ecological functions, including acting as nutrient vectors between different ecosystems. In coral reefs, pelagic nutrient subsidies are believed to play an increasingly important role under ongoing and projected environmental changes. Here, we combine visual sightings with passive acoustic monitoring to report habitat use and behaviour by cetaceans within atoll lagoons in the Maldives and Chagos archipelagoes. We demonstrate that spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are the most widely distributed and numerically abundant cetacean inside these atolls (>90% of all individual cetaceans by numbers). Our visual and acoustic observations both provide evidence of a regular diurnal behaviour, where dolphins enter the lagoons during the morning, for day-time resting, and exit during the afternoon, for night-time foraging offshore. Using standard metabolic models and timing of lagoonal residencies, we estimate that a dolphin pod would deposit approximately 288 +/- 17 kg year(-1) of nitrogen of primarily mesopelagic origin inside the lagoons. The nitrogen deposited inside an atoll lagoon by a dolphin pod resident year-round will therefore likely enhance coral reef productivity and resilience and suggests that these dolphins play a role in making pelagic energy and nutrients available to coral reefs. The absence of any acoustic detections following the reversal of the monsoon winds suggests that the short-to-medium-term residency of the dolphins is sensitive to seasonal productivity dynamics.

AB  - Masking from industrial noise can hamper the ability to detect marine mammal sounds near industrial operations, whenever conventional (pressure sensor) hydrophones are used for passive acoustic monitoring. Using data collected from an autonomous recorder with directional capabilities (Directional Autonomous Seafloor Acoustic Recorder), deployed 4.1 km from an arctic drilling site in 2012, the authors demonstrate how conventional beamforming on an acoustic vector sensor can be used to suppress noise arriving from a narrow sector of geographic azimuths. Improvements in signal-to-noise ratio of up to 15 dB are demonstrated on bowhead whale calls, which were otherwise undetectable using conventional hydrophones. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America

AB  - Several seamounts have been identified as hotspots of marine life in the Azores, acting as feeding stations for top predators, including cetaceans. Passive acoustic monitoring is an efficient tool to study temporal variations in the occurrence and behaviour of vocalizing cetacean species. We deployed bottom-moored Ecological Acoustic Recorders (EARs) to investigate the temporal patterns in acoustic presence and foraging activity of oceanic dolphins at two seamounts (Condor and Gigante) in the Azores. Data were collected in March-May 2008 and April 2010-February 2011. Dolphins were present year round and nearly every day at both seamounts. Foraging signals (buzzes and bray calls) were recorded in >87% of the days dolphin were present. There was a strong diel pattern in dolphin acoustic occurrence and behaviour, with higher detections of foraging and echolocation vocalizations during the night and of social signals during daylight hours. Acoustic data demonstrate that small dolphins consistently use Condor and Gigante seamounts to forage at night. These results suggest that these seamounts likely are important feeding areas for dolphins. This study contributes to a better understanding of the feeding ecology of oceanic dolphins and provides new insights into the role of seamount habitats for top predators.

AB  - Fisheries acoustics surveys provide platforms for deploying passive acoustic equipment to detect cetacean vocalizations. Passive acoustic methods are developing as viable alternatives to visual surveys, particularly for small, inconspicuous species such as the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed hydrophone array was carried out during an acoustic survey of clupeids in the Clyde Sea and surrounding sea lochs to identify spatial relationships between porpoises and their prey. Methods were developed to process passive acoustic data, successfully identifying porpoise echolocation clicks while discriminating them from the transmitted 120-kHz echosounder pulse and its reflections. To date, this has been a confounding factor which has made these survey techniques potentially incompatible. The highest biomass of pelagic fish was detected in the northernmost parts of the survey region, as were the largest number of porpoises. A moving average was used to examine the scale of the relationships identified, and it was found that while porpoises show no significant preferences for pelagic prey numbers at the smallest scales, they do show significant avoidance of larger areas (5+ km) with very low pelagic fish biomass. This study demonstrates that high-frequency passive acoustic monitoring can be used effectively alongside multifrequency fisheries echosounder surveys to provide novel insights into the trophic interactions between these species, and that further work will hopefully prove useful in improving the efficacy of management strategies for harbour porpoises.

AB  - While the Greenland and Barents Seas are known habitats for several cetacean and pinniped species there is a lack of long-term monitoring data in this rapidly changing environment. Moreover, little is known of the ambient soundscapes, and increasing off-shore anthropogenic activities can influence the ecosystem and marine life. Baseline acoustic data is needed to better assess current and future soundscape and ecosystem conditions. The analysis of a year of continuous data from three passive acoustic monitoring devices revealed species-dependent seasonal and spatial variation of a large variety of marine mammals in the Greenland and Barents Seas. Sampling rates were 39 and 78 kHz in the respective locations, and all systems were operational at a duty cycle of 2 min on, 30 min off. The research presents a description of cetacean and pinniped acoustic detections along with a variety of unknown low-frequency tonal sounds, and ambient sound level measurements that fall within the scope of the European Marine Strategy Framework (MSFD). The presented data shows the importance of monitoring Arctic underwater biodiversity for assessing the ecological changes under the scope of climate change.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has the potential to be a useful tool for population estimation of sound-producing fish and mammals (mostly whales). Previous work on population estimates of callers employed a simple cross-correlation technique with recordings from two acoustic sensors, and the current work extends the technique to two configurations of a 3-acoustic sensors array using two different sounds, i.e., chirps which is commonly generated by damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), dugongs (Dugong dugon) etc., species, and grunts which is commonly generated by Japanese gurnard (Chelidonichthys kuniu), Grey gurnard (Eutrigla gumardus), gulf toadfish (O. beta), etc., species. We compared simulated results from this technique with values determined by theoretical approach. We have found that an increasing number of cross-correlation function (CCF) provide better results using this technique. However, the technique has some limitations including negligence of multipath interference, assuming the delays to be integer. (C) 2019 Shanghai Jiaotong University. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the attribution of the bio-duck call to Antarctic minke whales (AMW Balaenoptera bonaerensis), different studies have retrospectively identified several bio-duck call types at various sites throughout the Southern Hemisphere. The function of their vocal behavior however, remains largely unknown. Further insights into their repertoire usage may help to reveal the function of their calls. Here, we use passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data collected across six locations throughout the Weddell Sea (WS) in 2013 and from PALAOA Station (Ekstrom Ice Shelf, eastern WS) in 2015, 2016 and 2017. In 2013, we detected 11 bio-duck call types throughout the WS between May and December, with additional acoustic activity in February on the western recorder AMW calls fell into four general call clusters. Seasonal patterns of calls showed variability between locations and years. Furthermore, this is the first study to show that similar to other baleen whale species, AMWs also produce songs.

AB  - The Arctic marine environment is changing rapidly through a combination of sea ice loss and increased anthropogenic activity. Given these changes can affect marine animals in a variety of ways, understanding the spatial and temporal distributions of Arctic marine animals is imperative. We use passive acoustic monitoring to examine the presence of marine mammals near Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada, from October 2016 to April 2017. We documented bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus Linnaeus, 1758) and beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)) vocalizations later into the autumn than expected, and we recorded bowhead whales in early April. We recorded ringed seal (Pusa hispida (Schreber, 1775)) vocalizations throughout our deployment, with higher vocal activity than in other studies and with peak vocal activity in January. We recorded bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus (Erxleben, 1777)) throughout the deployment, with peak vocal activity in February. We recorded lower bearded seal vocal activity than other studies, and almost no vocal activity near the beginning of the spring breeding season. Both seal species vocalized more when ice concentration was high. These patterns in vocal activity document the presence of each species at this site over autumn and winter and are a useful comparison for future monitoring.

AB  - BackgroundClimate change is warming the Arctic faster than the rest of the planet. Shifts in whale migration timing have been linked to climate change in temperate and sub-Arctic regions, and evidence suggests Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) might be overwintering in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.MethodsWe used an 11-year timeseries (spanning 2009-2021) of BCB bowhead whale presence in the southern Chukchi Sea (inferred from passive acoustic monitoring) to explore relationships between migration timing and sea ice in the Chukchi and Bering Seas.ResultsFall southward migration into the Bering Strait was delayed in years with less mean October Chukchi Sea ice area and earlier in years with greater sea ice area (p = 0.04, r(2) = 0.40). Greater mean October-December Bering Sea ice area resulted in longer absences between whales migrating south in the fall and north in the spring (p < 0.01, r(2) = 0.85). A stepwise shift after 2012-2013 shows some whales are remaining in southern Chukchi Sea rather than moving through the Bering Strait and into the northwestern Bering Sea for the winter. Spring northward migration into the southern Chukchi Sea was earlier in years with less mean January-March Chukchi Sea ice area and delayed in years with greater sea ice area (p < 0.01, r(2) = 0.82).ConclusionsAs sea ice continues to decline, northward spring-time migration could shift earlier or more bowhead whales may overwinter at summer feeding grounds. Changes to bowhead whale migration could increase the overlap with ships and impact Indigenous communities that rely on bowhead whales for nutritional and cultural subsistence.

AB  - Managing interactions between human activities and marine mammals often relies on an understanding of the real-time distribution or occurrence of animals. Visual surveys typically cannot provide persistent monitoring because of expense and weather limitations, and while passive acoustic recorders can monitor continuously, the data they collect are often not accessible until the recorder is recovered. We have developed a moored passive acoustic monitoring system that provides near real-time occurrence estimates for humpback, sei, fin and North Atlantic right whales from a single site for a year, and makes those occurrence estimates available via a publicly accessible website, email and text messages, a smartphone/tablet app and the U.S. Coast Guard's maritime domain awareness software. We evaluated this system using a buoy deployed off the coast of Massachusetts during 2015-2016 and redeployed again during 2016-2017. Near real-time estimates of whale occurrence were compared to simultaneously collected archived audio as well as whale sightings collected near the buoy by aerial surveys. False detection rates for right, humpback and sei whales were 0% and nearly 0% for fin whales, whereas missed detection rates at daily time scales were modest (12%-42%). Missed detections were significantly associated with low calling rates for all species. We observed strong associations between right whale visual sightings and near real-time acoustic detections over a monitoring range 30-40 km and temporal scales of 24-48 hr, suggesting that silent animals were not especially problematic for estimating occurrence of right whales in the study area. There was no association between acoustic detections and visual sightings of humpback whales. The moored buoy has been used to reduce the risk of ship strikes for right whales in a U.S. Coast Guard gunnery range, and can be applied to other mitigation applications.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammal calls is an increasingly important method for assessing population numbers, distribution, and behavior. A common mistake in the analysis of marine mammal acoustic data is formulating conclusions about these animals without first understanding how environmental properties such as bathymetry, sediment properties, water column sound speed, and ocean acoustic noise influence the detection and character of vocalizations in the acoustic data. The approach in this paper is to use Monte Carlo simulations with a full wave field acoustic propagation model to characterize the site specific probability of detection of six types of humpback whale calls at three passive acoustic monitoring locations off the California coast. Results show that the probability of detection can vary by factors greater than ten when comparing detections across locations, or comparing detections at the same location over time, due to environmental effects. Effects of uncertainties in the inputs to the propagation model are also quantified, and the model accuracy is assessed by comparing calling statistics amassed from 24 690 humpback units recorded in the month of October 2008. Under certain conditions, the probability of detection can be estimated with uncertainties sufficiently small to allow for accurate density estimates. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

TI  - Measuring body length of male sperm whales from their clicks: The relationship between inter-pulse intervals and photogrammetrically measured lengths

KW  - SEA
KW  - OIL
AB  - Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) emit short, broadband clicks which often include multiple pulses. The time interval between these pulses [inter-pulse interval (IPI)] represents the two-way time for a pulse to travel between the air sacs located at either end of the sperm whale's head. The IPI therefore, is a proxy of head length which, using an allometric relationship, can be used to estimate total body length. Previous studies relating IPI to an independent measure of length have relied on very small sample sizes and manual techniques for measuring IPI. Sound recordings and digital stereo photogrammetric measurements of 21 individuals were made off Kaikoura, New Zealand, and, in addition, archived recordings of whales measured with a previous photogrammetric system were reanalyzed to obtain a total sample size of 33 individuals. IPIs were measured automatically via cepstral analysis implemented via a software plug-in for PAMGUARD, an open-source software package for passive acoustic monitoring. IPI measurements were highly consistent within individuals (mean CV = 0.63%). The new regression relationship relating IPI (I) and total length (T) was found to be T = 1.258I + 5.736 (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001). This new regression provides a better fit than previous studies of large (> 11 m) sperm whales. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3578455]

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a rapidly growing field, providing valuable insights in marine ecology. The approach allows for long-term, species-specific monitoring over a range of spatial scales. For many baleen whales fundamental information on seasonal occurrence and distribution is still missing. In this study, pulse trains produced by the North Atlantic minke whale, a highly mobile and cryptic species, are used to examine its seasonality, diel vocalization patterns and spatial distribution throughout the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS), USA. Three and a half years (2006, 2007 to 2010) of near continuous passive acoustic data were analyzed using automated detection methods. Random forests and cluster analyses grouped pulse trains into 3 main categories (slow-down, constant and speed-up), with several subtypes. Slow-down pulse trains were the most commonly recorded call category. Minke whale pulse train occurrence was highly seasonal across all years. Detections were made from August to November, with 88% occurring in September and October. No detections were recorded in January and February, and only few from March to June. Minke whale pulse trains showed a distinct diel pattern, with a nighttime peak from approximately 20:00 to 01:00 h Eastern Standard Time (EST). The highest numbers of pulse trains were detected to the east of Stellwagen Bank, suggesting that minke whales travel preferably in deeper waters along the outer edge of the sanctuary. These data show that minke whales consistently use Stellwagen Bank as part of their migration route to and from the feeding grounds. Unlike other baleen whales in this area they do not appear to have a persistent year-round acoustic presence.

AB  - False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) feed primarily on several species of large pelagic fish, species that are also targeted by the Hawai'i-permitted commercial deep-set longline fishery. False killer whales have been known to approach fishing lines in an attempt to procure bait or catch from the lines, a behavior known as depredation. This behavior can lead to the hooking or entanglement of an animal, which currently exceeds sustainable levels for pelagic false killer whales in Hawaii. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was used to record false killer whales near longline fishing gear to investigate the timing, rate, and spatial extent of false killer whale occurrence. Acoustic data were collected using small autonomous recorders modified for deployment on the mainline of longline fishing gear. A total of 90 fishing sets were acoustically monitored in 2013 and 2014 on a chartered longline vessel using up to five acoustic recorders deployed throughout the fishing gear. Of the 102 odontocete click and/or whistle bouts detected on 55 sets, 26 bouts detected on 19 different fishing sets were classified as false killer whales with high or medium confidence based on either whistle classification, click classification, or both. The timing of false killer whale acoustic presence near the gear was related to the timing of fishing activities, with 57% of the false killer whale bouts occurring while gear was being hauled, with 50% of those bouts occurring during the first third of the haul. During three fishing sets, false killer whales were detected on more than one recorder, and in all cases the whales were recorded on instruments farther from the fishing vessel as the haul proceeded. Only three of the 19 sets with acoustically-confirmed false killer whale presence showed signs of bait or catch damage by marine mammals, which may relate to the difficulty of reporting depredation. PAM has proven to be a relatively inexpensive and efficient method for monitoring the Hawai'i longline fishery for interactions with false killer whales. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Male fin whales sing using 20 Hz pulses produced in regular patterns of inter-note intervals, but little is known about fin whale swimming behavior while they are singing. Even less is known about fin whales in Hawaiian waters because they have rarely been sighted during surveys and passive acoustic monitoring has been limited to sparse hydrophone systems that do not have localization capabilities. We hypothesized that fin whale kinematics may be related to their singing behavior, or external variables such as time and sea state. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed 115 tracks containing 50,034 unique notes generated from passive acoustic recordings on an array of 14 hydrophones from 2011 to 2017 at the U.S. Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility off Kauai, Hawaii. Fin whales swam at an average speed of 1.1 m/s over relatively direct paths. We incorporated the whales' speed and turning angle into hidden Markov models to identify different behavioral states based on the whales' movements. We found that fin whale kinematic behavioral state was related to the vocalization rate (also known as cue rate) and time of day. When cue rate was higher, fin whales were more likely to swim slower and turn more than when cue rate was lower. During the night, fin whales were also more likely to swim slower and turn more than during the day. In addition, we examined whether the presence of singing fin whales was related to time and sea state using generalized additive models. Fin whale track presence was affected by day of the year and song season, and possibly also wind speed and wave height. Although the track kinematics from the fin whale tracks presented here are limited to a subset of whales that are acoustically active, they provide some of the only detailed movements of fin whales in the region and can be compared against fin whale swim speeds in other regions. Understanding how fin whale swimming behavior varies based on their vocalization patterns, time, and environmental factors will help us to contextualize potential changes in whale behavior during Navy training and testing on the range.

AB  - The development of marine renewables has raised concerns regarding impacts on wildlife, and environmental monitoring is often required. We examined 3 mo of continuous passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data collected at the Tidal Energy Ltd. DeltaStream turbine deployment in Ramsey Sound, UK. We aimed to assess the performance of the PAM system at an operational turbine, describe the 3D movements and behaviours of small cetaceans in the vicinity of the turbine, and model changes in detection rates against temporal and environmental variables. The PAM system was designed to acoustically detect, classify and track porpoises and dolphins via their vocalisations within a similar to 100 m radius of the turbine. In total, 247 small cetacean encounters were identified from click detections, which were also used to reconstruct the spatial movements of porpoises and dolphins, including close approaches to the turbine. Not all hydro phones were functional, which limited the ability to localise porpoise clicks; the probability of detecting and localising a click decreased by 50% at a range of similar to 20 m. Mechanical sounds on the turbine may have alerted cetaceans of its presence. In models examining acoustic detection patterns, the tidal state, time of day, low low-frequency noise levels and moon phase best explained the acoustic presence of porpoises. The limited duration of turbine operation yielded insufficient data to understand the effect of turbine rotation on animal presence and movement near the turbine. This is the first description of how small cetaceans behave and move around a tidal turbine, and we present recommendations regarding how PAM can be used to improve environmental monitoring at future tidal energy sites.

AB  - Non-song vocalizations of migrating pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) in Western Australia are described. Simultaneous land-based visual observations and underwater acoustic recordings detected 27 groups in Geographe Bay, WA over 2011 to 2012. Six different vocalizations were recorded that were not repeated in a pattern or in association with song, and thus were identified as non-song vocalizations. Five of these were not previously described for this population. Their acoustic characteristics and context are presented. Given that 56% of groups vocalized, 86% of which produced non-song vocalizations and 14% song units, the inclusion of non-song vocalizations in passive-acoustic monitoring is proposed.

AB  - There is strong socio-political support for offshore wind development in US territorial waters and construction is planned off several east coast states. Some of the planned development sites coincide with important habitat for critically endangered North Atlantic right whales. Both exclusion zones and passive acoustic monitoring are important tools for managing interactions between marine mammals and human activities. Understanding where animals are with respect to exclusion zones is important to avoid costly construction delays while minimizing the potential for negative impacts. Impact piling from construction of hundreds of offshore wind turbines likely require exclusion zones as large as 10 km. We have developed a three-hydrophone passive acoustic monitoring system that provides bearing information along with marine mammal detections to allow for informed management decisions in real-time. Multiple units form a monitoring system designed to determine whether marine mammal calls originate from inside or outside of an exclusion zone. In October 2021, we undertook a full system validation, with a focus on evaluating the detection range and bearing accuracy of the system with respect to right whale upcalls. Five units were deployed in Mid-Atlantic waters and we played more than 3500 simulated right whale upcalls at known locations to characterize the detection function and bearing accuracy of each unit. The modelled results of the detection function error were then used to compare the effectiveness of a bearing-based system to a single sensor that can only detect a signal but not ascertain directivity. Field trials indicated maximum detection ranges from 4-7.3 km depending on source and ambient noise levels. Simulations showed that incorporating bearing detections provide a substantial improvement in false alarm rates (6 to 12 times depending on number of units, placement and signal to noise conditions) for a small increase in the risk of missed detections inside of an exclusion zone (1%-3%). We show that the system can be used for monitoring exclusion zones and clearly highlight the value of including bearing estimation into exclusion zone monitoring plans while noting that placement and configuration of units should reflect anticipated ambient noise conditions.

AB  - North Pacific minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) boing calls are commonly detected in Hawaiian waters. When producing boing vocalizations, minke whales seem to be in one of two calling behavioral states. Most often minke whales produce boings with inter-call intervals of several minutes, but sometimes minke whales call rapidly with inter-call intervals of less than a minute. Since minke whales are difficult to detect visually, cue-rate-based density estimation using passive acoustic monitoring has been proposed. However, the variables that influence cue rate or calling rate are poorly understood in most whales, including minke whales. We collected passive acoustic recordings from 47 bottom-mounted hydrophones at the Pacific Missile Range Facility's instrumented range off the coast of KauaModified Letter Turned Commai, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai to test the hypothesis that minke whales call more rapidly when closer in proximity to other calling conspecifics. A total of 599 days of data were recorded between August 2012 and July 2017 and were automatically post-processed to detect, classify, and localize calls. Localized calls were grouped into tracks and manually validated, resulting in 509 individual tracks composed of 36,033 calls within a 16 x 39 km focal study area. Tracked minke whales exhibited a strong bimodal call rate with means of one call every 6.85 min (sigma= 2.54 min) and 0.63 min (sigma= 0.36 min). We ran hidden Markov models to quantify the relationship between call rate and the distance to the nearest calling conspecific. Overall, the probability of the higher call rate occurring increased as the distance to the nearest conspecific decreased, and the probability of the lower call rate occurring increased as the distance to the nearest conspecific increased. We also examined individual track data and found that minke whales may also exhibit other responses (i.e. increased speed, changes in heading, and cessation of calling) when calling conspecifics are nearby. These findings provide new information about minke whale calling behavior in what is likely a breeding area.

AB  - Daily acoustic calling rates of Eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whales were measured on 6 days during 1 mo of their 2008 breeding season in the sheltered coastal lagoon of Laguna San Ignacio in Baja California, Mexico. Visual counts of whales determined that the numbers of single animals in the lower lagoon more than tripled over the observation period. All call types showed production peaks in the early morning and evening with minimum rates generally detected in the early afternoon. For four of the five observation days, the daily number of "S1"-type calls increased roughly as the square of the number of the animals in the lower lagoon during both daytime and nighttime. This relationship persisted when raw call counts were adjusted for variations in background noise level, using a simple propagation law derived from empirical measurements. The one observation day that did not fit the square-law relationship occurred during a week when the group size in the lagoon increased rapidly. These results suggest that passive acoustic monitoring does not measure gray whale group size directly but monitors the number of connections in the social network, which rises as roughly M2/2 for a group size M.

AB  - Since passive acoustic monitoring is widely used, unidentified acoustic signals from marine mammals are commonly reported. The signal characteristics and emission patterns are the main clues to identify the possible sources. In this study, the authors describe two previously unidentified sounds, recorded at up to five widely-spaced sites (30 x 30 degree area) in the southern Indian Ocean, in 2007 and between 2010 and 2015. The first reported signal (M-call) consists of a single tonal unit near 22 Hz and lasting about 10 s, repeated with an interval longer than 2 min. This signal is only detected in 2007. The second signal (P-call) is also a tonal unit of 10 s, repeated every 160 s, but at a frequency near 27 Hz. Its yearly number increased greatly between 2007 and 2010, and moderately since then. Based on their characteristics and seasonal patterns, this study shows that both signals are clearly distinct from any known calls of blue whale subspecies and populations dwelling in the southern Indian Ocean. However, they display similarities with blue whale vocalizations. More particularly, the P-call can be mistaken for the first tonal unit of the Antarctic blue whale Z-call.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) have group-specific call repertoires that can be used to track groups and populations using passive acoustic monitoring. To provide a detailed description of the Icelandic killer whale repertoire and its variation, we analyzed acoustic data collected in five locations between 1985 and 2016. Calls were classified manually, and CART and random forest analyses were employed to validate the manual classification. A total of 91 call categories (including call types and subtypes) were defined. Most call categories were recorded in more than one location, with the highest proportion shared between herring grounds in Vestmannaeyjar (South) and Breioafjorour (West). However, both locations included call categories that were not recorded elsewhere in Iceland. Recordings from past herring wintering grounds in eastern Iceland included few call categories that matched other locations. Sample sizes from Reykjanes (Southwest) and Skjalfandi (North) were small and did not include unique call categories. The relative occurrence of call categories in Vestmannaeyjar changed little over a 14-year period (2002-2016), although shorter-term changes between years were observed that appeared to correlate to changes in individuals identified. This comparison of acoustic repertoires provides valuable information on the social structure and movement patterns of herring-eating killer whales around Iceland.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring allows the assessment of marine mammal occurrence and distribution at greater temporal and spatial scales than is now possible with traditional visual surveys. However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is commonly utilized to monitor cetacean species' distribution, abundance, and behavior. The demand for automated methods to detect and extract cetacean vocalizations from acoustic data has increased in the last few decades. Automatic whistle extraction of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin (IPBD) and other whistle-producing delphinids habitating in the coastal areas represents a challenging problem due to the high ambient noise, including ship noise snapping shrimp at the same habitat. The acoustic signal containing snapping shrimp sound was usually excluded during the development of the detection method. A robust tool of bioacoustics for snapping shrimp sound is still lacking. This study trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for semantic segmentation, initially developed for autonomous driving, to extract the whistle contour from spectrogram at a pixel level. A total of 1600 datasets was annotated for training and testing. As a result, the semantic segmentation classified the whistle with an overall mean Precision of 0.96, Accuracy of 0.89, and F-score of 0.86. In particular, the semantic segmentation extracted the whistle even if associated with a rich snapping shrimp sound, which the conventional method is incapable of. The advancement of metrics presented in this paper will enable long-term assessment of the IPBD population and individual or group tracking.

AB  - Expanded marine shipping and industrial activity has increased the risk of harmful effects on marine mammals. Quantitative estimates of marine mammal time and space distributions are essential for developing mitigation strategies designed to reduce the risks. Seasonal distributions of key marine mammals can be estimated by deploying passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) hydrophone systems and using the acoustic data to monitor, detect and identify species presence, often in near real-time. Most contemporary PAM deployments in the ocean are stationary and archive the acoustic data for post-recovery analyses after some extended period and are thus not ideal for addressing risk dynamics in near real-time. Substantive expansions of fixed PAM arrays over large ocean expanses can be economically and on-time limiting. Mobile autonomous vehicles now offer the economy of collecting the necessary acoustic and oceanographic data over extended periods and across large swaths of the ocean. They can operate with a high degree of spatial sampling flexibility in near real-time that cannot be easily achieved using fixed PAM arrays.
   The Whale Habitat and Listening Experiment (WHaLE), funded by the Marine Environmental Observation Prediction And Response Network (MEOPAR) at Dalhousie University, and using Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) autonomous vehicles, is searching for whale habitats and monitoring the distributional patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other at-risk baleen whales across the shelf waters of Atlantic Canada. This is being achieved through fixed PAM array deployments involving several research partners, as well as the deployment of profiling and surface gliders (autonomous vehicles) equipped with PAM systems capable of detecting and identifying baleen whales that produce sounds in the 10 - 2000 Hz frequency range. When fitted with onboard, automated detection and identification algorithms, the gliders can become powerful tools for near real-time monitoring of the at-risk whales and thus risk mitigation.

AB  - Arabian Sea humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), listed as "Endangered" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, remain resident throughout the year in the waters of the Arabian Sea and constitute a genetically isolated population. In the eastern Arabian Sea, information on humpback whales off the Indian coast has largely been limited to stranding records, local ecological knowledge, and opportunistic visual sighting data. These data, along with information from a long-term study off Oman, suggest that humpback whales migrate across the Arabian Sea into Indian ter-ritorial waters from October to March. To study the presence of Arabian Sea humpback whales in Indian waters more comprehensively, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was initiated along the west coast of India in 2019. Male humpback whales produce complex songs with a stereo-typed structure; these songs are shared within a population, and song patterns are known to evolve progressively over time. In this article, a struc-tural analysis of humpback whale song recorded over four days off the coast of Netrani Island, Karnataka, India, in December 2019 is presented. Time-frequency features of 2,641 individual call units were analysed. Call units had a fundamen-tal frequency bandwidth ranging from 149.98 to 541.65 Hz, with a duration ranging from 1.19 to 5.5 s. The call units were used to identify phrases and themes required to construct the structure of the song, which can potentially help identify the population to which singing individuals belong. This study indicates the need for a long-term PAM program across the Arabian Sea to compare whale songs across the region. Simultaneous recordings over multiple seasons will best assess population connectivity, seasonal occurrence, and movement patterns within and between populations across the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.

AB  - Most studies on tonal sounds extract contour parameters from fundamental frequencies. The presence of harmonics and the frequency distribution of multiple tonal sounds have not been well researched. To investigate the occurrence and frequency modulation of cetacean tonal sounds, the procedure of detecting the instantaneous frequency bandwidth of tonal spectral peaks was integrated within the local-max detector to extract adopted frequencies. The adopted frequencies, considered the representative frequencies of tonal sounds, are used to find the presence of harmonics and overlapping tonal sounds. The utility and detection performance are demonstrated on acoustic recordings of five species from two databases. The recordings of humpback dolphins showed a 75% detection rate with a 5% false detection rate, and recordings from the MobySound archive showed an 85% detection rate with a 5% false detection rate. These detections were achieved in signal-to-noise ratios of -12 to 21 dB. The parameters that measured the distribution of adopted frequency, as well as the prominence of harmonics and overlaps, indicate that the modulation of tonal sounds varied among different species and behaviors. This algorithm can be applied to studies on cetacean communication signals and long-term passive acoustic monitoring. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The U.S. Navy maintains several instrumented ranges equipped with large arrays of bottom-mounted hydrophones that are typically used to track undersea vehicles. The major ranges include the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) located in the Bahamas, the Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE) located off San Clemente Island, and the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) located off the western side of Kauai, HI. Each of these ranges provides tracking arrays covering an area in excess of 1200 km(2). These hydrophone arrays are being used to develop marine mammal passive acoustic detection, classification, localization, and density estimation methods. Hardware systems installed at all three facilities allow real-time monitoring of vocalizing marine mammals. Using these systems, Blainville's beaked whales have been detected at AUTEC and PMRF. Cuvier's beaked whales have been detected at SCORE and to a lesser extent at AUTEC. These "sonar sensitive" species are present despite the repeated use of sonar. Based on passive acoustics, the movement of these species in response to sonar has been documented. By combining passive acoustic beaked whale and sonar data with AUTEC ship track data, a risk function for Blainville's beaked whales was developed. In addition, by combining hydrophone with recording tag data, the beam pattern and source level of Blainville's beaked whale were measured along with the system's detection function. This enabled the development of passive acoustic density estimation algorithms. These algorithms are being applied to the long-term, in situ monitoring of beaked whale population at all three facilities.

AB  - The central Gulf of Maine was recently identified as a persistent wintering ground and potential mating ground for non-calving North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis based on aerial survey data. However, these surveys were limited by bad weather and light. Here, we use passive acoustic monitoring to examine the long-term persistence of right whales in this area throughout a nearly continuous period from October 2009 through October 2010. Three archival marine acoustic recording units were deployed in the Outer Fall/central Gulf of Maine. The data were manually reviewed for right whale up-calls and gunshots to investigate seasonal and diel patterns. Up-calls and gunshots occurred seasonally, with the most calls recorded from October through January and fewer calls detected from February through July, increasing again in August through October. Up-calls were most frequent in November, and gunshots in December. There was a clear bimodal diel pattern in up-calls, with the majority of calls occurring between 04:00 through 08:00 h and 13:00 through 22:00 h. There was a clear peak in diel distribution of gunshots, with the majority of calls occurring between 16: 00 and 22:00 h. Our data demonstrate the continuous presence of right whales in the central Gulf of Maine during the winter months. The rate of gunshots during winter months in Outer Fall supports the hypothesis that male advertisement and/or right whale mating behavior may be taking place in this region at that time.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly used for assessing populations of marine mammals; however, analysis of large datasets is limited by our ability to easily classify sounds detected. Classification of beaked whale acoustic events, in particular, requires evaluation of multiple lines of evidence by expert analysts. Here we present a highly automated approach to acoustic detection and classification using supervised machine learning and open source software methods. Data from four large scale surveys of beaked whales (northwestern North Atlantic, southwestern North Atlantic, Hawaii, and eastern North Pacific) were analyzed using PAMGuard (acoustic detection), PAMpal (acoustic analysis) and BANTER (hierarchical random forest classifier). Overall classification accuracy ranged from 88% for the southwestern North Atlantic data to 97% for the northwestern North Atlantic. Results for many species could likely be improved with increased sample sizes, consideration of alternative automated detectors, and addition of relevant environmental features. These methods provide a highly automated approach to acoustic detection and classification using open source methods that can be readily adopted for other species and geographic regions.

AB  - Automatically detecting animal signals in soundscape recordings is of benefit to passive acoustic monitoring programs which may be undertaken for research or conservation. Numerous algorithms exist, which are typically optimized for certain situations (i.e., certain animal sound types and ambient noise conditions). Adding to the library of algorithms, this paper developed, tested, and compared three detectors for Omura's whale vocalizations (15-62 Hz; <15 s) in marine soundscape recordings which contained noise from other animals, wind, earthquakes, ships, and seismic surveys. All three detectors were based on processing of spectrographic representations. The specific methods were spectrogram cross-correlation, entropy computation, and spectral intensity "blob" tracing. The latter two were general-purpose detectors that were adapted for detection of Omura's whale vocalizations. Detector complexity and post-processing effort varied across the three detectors. Performance was assessed qualitatively using demonstrative examples, and quantitatively using Receiver-Operating Characteristics and Precision-Recall curves. While the results of quantitative assessment were dominated by the spectrogram cross-correlation method, qualitative assessment showed that all three detectors offered promising performance.

AB  - Linking individual and population scales is fundamental to many concepts in ecology [1], including migration [2, 3]. This behavior is a critical [4] yet increasingly threatened [5] part of the life history of diverse organisms. Research on migratory behavior is constrained by observational scale [2], limiting ecological understanding and precise management of migratory populations in expansive, inaccessible marine ecosystems [6]. This knowledge gap is magnified for dispersed oceanic predators such as endangered blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus). As capital breeders, blue whales migrate vast distances annually between foraging and breeding grounds, and their population fitness depends on synchrony of migration with phenology of prey populations [7, 8]. Despite previous studies of individual-level blue whale vocal behavior via bio-logging [9, 10] and population-level acoustic presence via passive acoustic monitoring [11], detection of the life history transition from foraging to migration remains challenging. Here, we integrate direct high-resolution measures of individual behavior and continuous broad-scale acoustic monitoring of regional song production (Figure 1A) to identify an acoustic signature of the transition from foraging to migration in the Northeast Pacific population. We find that foraging blue whales sing primarily at night, whereas migratory whales sing primarily during the day. The ability to acoustically detect population-level transitions in behavior provides a tool to more comprehensively study the life history, fitness, and plasticity of population behavior in a dispersed, capital breeding population. Real-time detection of this behavioral signal can also inform dynamic management efforts [12] to mitigate anthropogenic threats to this endangered population [13, 14]).

AB  - Effective management of wild animal populations relies on an understanding of their spatio-temporal distributions. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a noninvasive method to investigate the distribution of free-ranging species that reliably produce sound. Critically endangered Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) (ABWs) co-occur with pygmy blue whales (B. m. brevicauda) (PBWs) around New Zealand. Nationally, both are listed as "data deficient" due to difficulties in access and visual sub-species identification. PAM was used to investigate the distributions of blue whales via sub-species specific song detections in central New Zealand. Propagation models, incorporating ambient noise data, enabled the comparison of detections among recording locations in different marine environments. ABW detections peaked during austral winter and spring, indicating that New Zealand, and the South Taranaki Bight (STB) in particular, is a migratory corridor for ABWs. Some ABW calls were also detected during the breeding season (September and October). PBW calls were highly concentrated in the STB, particularly between March and May, suggesting that an aggregation of PBWs may occur here. Therefore, the STB is of great importance for both sub-species of blue whale. PBW detections were absent from the STB during parts of austral spring, but PBWs were detected at east coast locations during this time. Detection area models were valuable when interpreting and comparing detections among recording locations. The results provide sub-species specific information required for management of critically endangered ABWs and highlight the relative importance of central New Zealand for both sub-species of blue whale.

AB  - Significant effort has been made over the last few decades to develop automated passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems capable of classifying cetaceans at the species level. The utility of such systems depends on the systems' ability to operate across a wide range of ocean acoustic environments; however, anecdotal evidence suggests that site-specific propagation characteristics impact the performance of PAM systems. Variability in propagation characteristics leads to differences in how each cetacean vocalization is altered as it propagates along the source-receiver path. A propagation experiment was conducted in the Gulf of Mexico to investigate the range-dependent impacts of acoustic propagation on the performance of an automated classifier. Modified bowhead and humpback vocalizations were transmitted over ranges from 1 to 10 km. When the classifier was trained with signals collected near the sound source, it was found that the performance decreased with increasing transmission range-this appeared to be largely explained by decreasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Generation of performance matrices showed that one method to develop a classifier that maintains high performance across many ranges is to include a varied assortment of ranges in the training data; however, if the training set is limited, it is best to train on relatively low SNR vocalizations.

AB  - A fundamental issue in cetacean conservation is determining the occurrence, distribution, and habitat use of target species. However, these baselines are extremely deficient in many poorly investigated regions, making it challenging to inform conservation management initiatives. In this case study, we employed three complementary approaches to generate conservation baselines on a "Vulnerable" near-shore delphinid species, the IndoPacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, in the waters southwest of Hainan (SW Hainan), China. First, in late 2013, we conducted large-scale local ecological knowledge (LEK) surveys with 510 Hainanese fishers. Our LEK findings revealed that SW Hainan was a previously underreported area with numerous fishermen encounters of humpback dolphins dating back to the 1970s. Second, from 2014 to 2019, we conducted monthly boat-based visual surveys in SW Hainan. Our sighting data verified the reliability of previous LEK findings and further confirmed the year-round occurrence and species dominance of humpback dolphins in SW Hainan. Third, we applied a supplementary approach (stationary passive acoustic monitoring, PAM) to monitor dolphin biosonar activities in the region. Our 10-site PAM dataset from February 2018 to June 2019 indicated spatiotemporal variations in dolphin click detections. To conclude, our findings, derived from multiple approaches, provide a scientific basis for cetacean conservation management and marine spatial planning on a regional scale. More generally, this study offers an integrated monitoring strategy consisting of three step-by-step approaches, which can help conservationists, especially those who work in data-deficient waters, obtain critical baseline data on cetaceans in an efficient, timely, and reliable way.

AB  - Long-term data of underwater passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) collected from two sites of pygmy blue whale presence within Australia, the continental shelf off Portland (38.5 degrees S, 141.2 degrees E) and the Perth Canyon (32 degrees S, 115 degrees E) were analysed to compare the acoustic behaviour of eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue (EIOPB) whales. Pygmy blue whale song detection was consistently higher at the Perth Canyon site than at the Portland sample site. Statistical analysis found there to be a significant difference in the production of song and phrase variants between sites (p < 0.01) with a shorter two-unit (P2) song variant being more common in the Perth Canyon area, while the traditional three-unit (P3) song variant was more frequent off Portland. This was supported by manual and feature space analysis techniques. Increasing song complexity was observed in the form of phrases with broken song units, a phenomenon that was first observed at the Portland site on isolated occasions but has occurred and proliferated in the Perth Canyon area from 2016 onwards. Analysis of environmental conditions indicated that increased background noise due to multiple EIOPB whales vocalising, as well as water depth, may influence song length. This was reflected by songs made up of shorter phrases dominating in higher background noise conditions and deeper water, while longer more complex phrase types dominate in quieter, shallower conditions. Further research is recommended to isolate any potential influence of environmental factors on song production.

AB  - Successful conservation and management of marine top predators rely on detailed documentation of spatiotemporal behavior. For cetacean species, this information is key to defining stocks, habitat use, and mitigating harmful interactions. Research focused on this goal is employing methodologies such as visual observations, tag data, and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. However, many studies are temporally limited or focus on only one or few species. In this study, we make use of an existing long-term (2009-2019), labeled PAM data set to examine spatiotemporal patterning of at least 10 odontocete (toothed whale) species in the Hawaiian Islands using compositional analyses and modeling techniques. Species composition differs among considered sites, and this difference is robust to seasonal movement patterns. Temporally, hour of day was the most significant predictor of detection across species and sites, followed by season, though patterns differed among species. We describe long-term trends in species detection at one site and note that they are markedly similar for many species. These trends may be related to long-term, underlying oceanographic cycles that will be the focus of future study. We demonstrate the variability of temporal patterns even at relatively close sites, which may imply that wide-ranging models of species presence are missing key fine-scale movement patterns. Documented seasonal differences in detection also highlights the importance of considering season in survey design both regionally and elsewhere. We emphasize the utility of long-term, continuous monitoring in highlighting temporal patterns that may relate to underlying climatic states and help us predict responses to climate change. We conclude that long-term PAM records are a valuable resource for documenting spatiotemporal patterns and can contribute many insights into the lives of top predators, even in highly studied regions such as the Hawaiian Islands.

AB  - Fin whales Balaenoptera physalus produce stereotyped low-frequency calls (1530 Hz) that can be detected at great ranges and are considered song when produced in a repeated temporal pattern. These calls, referred to as 20 Hz calls, were localized and tracked using a 1 km aperture array of 4 passive acoustic recorders at approximately 800 m depth northwest of San Clemente Island, offshore of Southern California, USA, for 4 continuous weeks during late fall 2007. A total of 1454 calls were localized over the recording period. The average (+/- SD) estimated source sound pressure level was 194.8 +/- 0.2 dB(pp) re 1 mu Pa-2 at 1 m (where pp is peak-to-peak) and 180.9 +/- 0.2 dB(rms) re 1 mu Pa at 1 m (where rms is root mean square). The majority of these calls were in the form of a doublet song pattern, with average inter-pulse intervals of 13 and 18 s. These tracks are the first to be reported for transiting solitary singing fin whales using passive acoustic monitoring techniques. Acoustic tracking of fin whales provides insight into the ecology and behavior of this endangered species as well as vocal behaviors, which are important when studying the potential impact of anthropogenic noise. Call source sound pressure level, along with calling behavior, provides important parameters required for population density estimation. Furthermore, studying fin whale song patterns may aid in distinguishing different subpopulations.

AB  - Male fin whales sing by producing 20 Hz pulses in regular patterns of inter-note intervals. While singing, fin whales may also alternate the frequency ranges of their notes. Different song patterns have been observed in different regions of the world's oceans. New song patterns suddenly emerging in an area have been hypothesized to either be indicators of new groups of whales in the area or signs of cultural transmission between groups. Since the status of fin whales around Hawaii is unknown and visual surveys are expensive and difficult to conduct in offshore areas, passive acoustic monitoring has been proposed as a way to monitor these whales. We used passive acoustic recordings from an array of 14 hydrophones to analyze the song patterns of 115 fin whale encounters made up of 50,034 unique notes off Kauai, Hawaii from 2011 to 2017. Fin whale singing patterns were more complicated than previously described. Fin whales off Hawaii sang in five different patterns made of two 20 Hz note types and both singlet and doublet inter-note interval patterns. The inter-note intervals present in their songs were 28/33 s for the lower frequency doublet, 30 s for the lower frequency singlet, 17/24 s for the higher frequency doublet, 17 s for the higher frequency singlet, and 12/20 s for the doublet that alternated between both note types. Some of these song patterns were unique to these fin whales in Hawaiian waters, while others were similar to song patterns recorded from fin whales off the U.S. west coast. Individual fin whales often utilized several different song patterns which suggests that multiple song patterns are not necessarily indicators of different individuals or groups. The dominant song pattern also changed over these years. Cultural transmission may have occurred between fin whales in Hawaiian waters and off the U.S. west coast, which has resulted in similar songs being present at both locations but on lagged timescales. Alternatively, groups occupying the Hawaiian waters could shift over time resulting in different song patterns becoming dominant. This work has implications for the population structure and behavior of Hawaii fin whales.

AB  - Large groups of animals aggregate around resource hotspots, with group size often influenced by the heterogeneity of the environment. In most cases, the foraging success of individuals within groups is interdependent, scaling either constructively or destructively with group size. Here we used biologging tags, acoustic prey mapping, passive acoustic recording of social cues and remote sensing of surface currents to investigate an alternative scenario in which large, dense aggregations of southeast Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, and northeast Pacific blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, were each associated with ephemeral krill aggregations large enough such that their availability to predators appeared to be influenced more by environmental features than by consumption, implying independence of group size and consumption rates. We found that the temporal scale and spatial extent of oceanographic drivers were consistent with the temporal scale and locations of predator aggregations, and additionally found that groups formed above bathymetric features known to promote zooplankton concentration. Additionally, we found calling behaviour counter-indicative of competition: blue whale foraging calls were anomalously high during observed aggregation time periods, suggesting signalling behaviour that could alert conspecifics to the location of high-quality resources. Modelled results suggest that the use of social information reduces the time required for individuals to discover and exploit high-quality resources, allowing for more efficient foraging without apparent costs to the caller. Thus, rorqual whales foraging in these environments appear to exhibit a social foraging strategy whereby a behaviour with negligible individual costs (signalling) provides information that enhances group foraging efficiency. The population density dependence of this social foraging strategy may help explain why some rorqual species were at first slow to recover from human exploitation, but have since increased more rapidly.

AB  - Knowing the abundance of a population is a crucial component to assess its conservation status and develop effective conservation plans. For most cetaceans, abundance estimation is difficult given their cryptic and mobile nature, especially when the population is small and has a transnational distribution. In the Baltic Sea, the number of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) has collapsed since the mid-20th century and the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN and HELCOM; however, its abundance remains unknown. Here, one of the largest ever passive acoustic monitoring studies was carried out by eight Baltic Sea nations to estimate the abundance of the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise for the first time. By logging porpoise echolocation signals at 298 stations during May 2011-April 2013, calibrating the loggers' spatial detection performance at sea, and measuring the click rate of tagged individuals, we estimated an abundance of 71-1105 individuals (95% CI, point estimate 491) during May-October within the population's proposed management border. The small abundance estimate strongly supports that the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise is facing an extremely high risk of extinction, and highlights the need for immediate and efficient conservation actions through international cooperation. It also provides a starting point in monitoring the trend of the population abundance to evaluate the effectiveness of management measures and determine its interactions with the larger neighboring Belt Sea population. Further, we offer evidence that design-based passive acoustic monitoring can generate reliable estimates of the abundance of rare and cryptic animal populations across large spatial scales.

AB  - Understanding habitat use patterns of animal populations across space and time is fundamental to identifying ecological requirements, and informing threat mitigation and conservation strategies. Persistent data gaps tend to occur with cryptic species in difficult-to-access environments, where the use of appropriate monitoring tools is indispensable for detection. Three populations of threatened and endangered killer whales occur year-round in waters off British Columbia, Canada; however, their winter habitat use patterns are not well known. Here we quantify wintertime use of the northern Strait of Georgia by these sympatric killer whale populations, revealing the importance of this previously understudied region. Using a network of passive acoustic monitoring devices deployed over three winter periods, we examine site-specific and regional patterns of occurrence of Bigg's, and Southern and Northern Resident killer whales. All three populations frequented these waters in nearly every month from November to April, and across all study years. Bigg's killer whales were detected most frequently, followed by Southern Residents, then Northern Residents. Population-specific differences in site use was apparent, with Southern Resident detections occurring more often than expected off the southwest side of Texada Island, while Northern Residents appeared to favor the east side of Texada Island. Remarkably, the patterns of winter use we observe in this region by Resident killer whale populations have seemingly persisted for at least 50 years. Additionally, we evaluate and discuss the effect of using multiple simultaneous recorders to characterize habitat use patterns. Lastly, we present a data-driven approach for estimating acoustic residence time, describe inter-population differences in winter residency in the northern Strait of Georgia, and discuss implications for critical habitat designation. This study fills important knowledge gaps related to killer whale winter occurrence off western Canada, highlighting the significance of the northern Strait of Georgia for these at-risk populations.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are highly social predators distributed throughout the world's oceans. They are divided into different ecotypes to foraging specializations, phenotype, and social organization. For Northern Hemisphere killer whale ecotypes, acoustic behaviour has been shown to relate to foraging strategies and social organization. In contrast to the intensively studied Northern Hemisphere ecotypes, distribution patterns, social structures, and acoustic behaviour of the Southern Hemisphere killer whale ecotypes are poorly known. One of the Southern Hemisphere ecotypes, the Antarctic Ecotype C killer whale, is known to occur in regions with dense pack ice. The limited accessibility of these areas make passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) methods a very effective investigation tool to derive information on ecotype-specific abundance and distribution. During 2 d in February 2013, it was possible to collect concurrent visual and acoustic information of Ecotype C killer whales off the Antarctic continent. From these events, a call type catalogue was compiled. The 2,238 examined calls were subjectively classified into 26 discrete call types. Ten percent of the examined calls were re-classified by two additional independent observers to examine robustness of the classification. Mean classification accordance among observers was 68%. Most call types were composed of more than one call part. Sixty-five percent of all call types were monophonic, and 35% were biphonic. Almost two-third of all call types started with a short, broadband pulse. The variability within call types was relatively high. The Ecotype C vocal repertoire contained typical acoustic features such as biphonation, high call complexity, and generally high variability in frequency modulation. For future studies, the distinct characteristics of some of the call types described herein could potentially serve as acoustic markers for PAM-based differentiation of killer whale ecotypes in the Southern Ocean.

AB  - In order to mitigate against possible impacts of seismic surveys on baleen whales it is important to know as much as possible about the presence of whales within the vicinity of seismic operations. This study expands on previous work that analyzes single seismic streamer data to locate nearby calling baleen whales with a grid search method that utilizes the propagation angles and relative arrival times of received signals along the streamer. Three dimensional seismic reflection surveys use multiple towed hydrophone arrays for imaging the structure beneath the seafloor, providing an opportunity to significantly improve the uncertainty associated with streamer-generated call locations. All seismic surveys utilizing airguns conduct visual marine mammal monitoring surveys concurrent with the experiment, with powering-down of seismic source if a marine mammal is observed within the exposure zone. This study utilizes data from power-down periods of a seismic experiment conducted with two 8-km long seismic hydrophone arrays by the R/V Marcus G. Langseth near Alaska in summer 2011. Simulated and experiment data demonstrate that a single streamer can be utilized to resolve left-right ambiguity because the streamer is rarely perfectly straight in a field setting, but dual streamers provides significantly improved locations. Both methods represent a dramatic improvement over the existing Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) system for detecting low frequency baleen whale calls, with similar to 60 calls detected utilizing the seismic streamers, zero of which were detected using the current R/V Langseth PAM system. Furthermore, this method has the potential to be utilized not only for improving mitigation processes, but also for studying baleen whale behavior within the vicinity of seismic operations.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring, mitigation, animal density estimation, and comprehensive understanding of the impact of sound on marine animals all require accurate information on vocalization source level to be most effective. This study focused on examining the uncertainty related to passive sonar equation terms that ultimately contribute to the variability observed in estimated source levels of fin whale calls. Differences in hardware configuration, signal detection methods, sample size, location, and time were considered in interpreting the variability of estimated fin whale source levels. Data from Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean and off Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean provided the opportunity to generate large datasets of estimated source levels to better understand sources of uncertainty leading to the observed variability with and across years. Average seasonal source levels from the Wake Island dataset ranged from 175 to 188 dB re 1 lPa m, while the 2007-2008 seasonal average detected off Portugal was 189 dB re 1 lPa m. Owing to the large inherent variability within and across this and other studies that potentially masks true differences between populations, there is no evidence to conclude that the source level of 20-Hz fin whale calls are regionally or population specific.

AB  - Approximately half of the North Pacific humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae stock visits the shallow waters of the main Hawaiian Islands seasonally. Within this breeding area, mature males produce an elaborate acoustic display known as song, which becomes the dominant source of ambient underwater sound between December and April. Following reports of unusually low whale numbers that began in 2015/16, we examined song chorusing recorded through long-term passive acoustic monitoring at 6 sites off Maui as a proxy for relative whale abundance between 2014 and 2019. Daily root-mean-square sound pressure levels (RMS SPLs) were calculated to compare variations in low-frequency acoustic energy (0-1.5 kHz). After 2014/15, the overall RMS SPLs decreased between 5.6 and 9.7 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 during the peak of whale season (February and March), reducing ambient acoustic energy from chorusing by over 50%. This change in song levels co-occurred with a broad-scale oceanic heat wave in the northeast Pacific termed the 'Blob,' a major El Nino event in the North Pacific, and a warming period in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation cycle. Although it remains unclear whether our observations reflect a decrease in population size, a change in migration patterns, a shift in distribution to other areas, a change in the behavior of males, or some combination of these, our results indicate that continued monitoring and further studies of humpback whales throughout the North Pacific are warranted to better understand the fluctuations occurring in this recently recovered population and other populations that continue to be endangered or threatened.

AB  - The patterns of movement of the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus (Linnaeus, 1758)) in the Mediterranean Sea are still a matter of debate. Feeding aggregations are well known in the Corso-Liguro-Provencal Basin from July to September, but little is known for the autumn and winter seasons. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was implemented in the Ligurian Sea to overcome this gap and to investigate the temporal and spatial variation of fin whale acoustic presence. From July to December 2011, five autonomous recorders were deployed at between 700 and 900 m depths. Fin whale calls were automatically detected almost every day, with higher vocalization rates in October, November, and December. Furthermore, daily vocalization rates were higher during light hours, and closer to the coast. These outcomes suggest that not all the individuals migrate, staying in the area also during autumn for feeding or breeding purposes. The dial cycle of vocalization might be related to feeding activities and zooplankton vertical migration, whereas the proximity to the coast can be explained by the morphology of the area that promotes the upwelling system. Although this work only represents a six-month period, certainly it suggests the need for a larger spatial and temporal PAM effort, crucial for species management and for mitigating possible impact of anthropogenic activities at the basin level.

AB  - This study presents non-song vocalizations of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from two migratory areas off the Western Australian coast: Geographe Bay and Port Hedland. A total of 220 sounds were identified as non-song sounds in 193 h of recordings reviewed. Of those, 68 were measured and qualitatively classified into 17 groups using their spectral features. One group (HW-02) had a high level of variation in terms of spectral slope. However, further classification using statistical classification methods was not possible because of the small sample size. Non-song sound frequencies varied from 9 Hz to 6 kHz, with the majority of sounds under 200 Hz. The duration of non-song sounds varied between 0.09 and 3.59 s. Overall, the use of spectral features allowed general classification of humpback whale sounds in a low sample size scenario that was not conducive to using quantitative methods. However, for highly variable groups, quantitative statistical classification methods (e.g., random forests) are needed to improve classification accuracy. The identification and accurate classification of a species' acoustic repertoire is key to effectively monitor population status using acoustic techniques and to better understand the vocal behavior of the species. The results of this study improve the monitoring of humpback whales by standardizing the classification of sounds and including them in the species' repertoire. The inclusion of non-song sounds in passive acoustic monitoring of humpback whales will add females and calves to the detection counts of otherwise only singing males.

AB  - Fin whale song is a ubiquitous low-frequency pulsing that has been recorded in every ocean basin. In recent years, the complexity of fin whale song has been realized. In the North Atlantic, this song is made up of two low-frequency note types (A and B notes) and one higher-frequency note type (upsweeps). The A and B notes are produced with both singlet and doublet inter-note intervals. These song patterns are interwoven throughout an individual's song and have been observed to shift over time, both gradually and suddenly. Like many baleen whales, the population size of fin whales is poorly defined. Passive acoustic monitoring has been suggested as a way to estimate abundance if a cue rate or calling rate can be determined. In this study, we used recordings from 119 fin whale tracks from 2013-2023 generated from passive acoustic recorders in the North Atlantic to define fin whale song patterns in this ocean basin, identify changes in these song patterns over time, and calculate cue rates. The fin whales recorded sang in 4 distinct patterns. Inter-note intervals were 25 s for A-A singlets, 13 s for B-B singlets, 12/20 s for B-B doublets, and 10/11 s for A-B doublets. B-B doublet inter-note intervals significantly increased from May 2019-April 2023 and A-B inter-note intervals showed an intra-annual increasing trend that reset each summer. Fin whale song in the North Atlantic also often includes higher frequency upsweep notes immediately prior to B notes. While A and B note peak frequency was steady over these years, upsweep peak frequency significantly decreased, continuing a similar trend that has been observed over 30 years. Despite these changes, the dominant song pattern remained consistent and cue rate for actively singing whales was relatively stable, which is in contrast to patterns observed in the North Pacific. Many of these nuances in fin whale singing behavior are newly described herein, and these findings are vital for monitoring baseline behavior, behavioral trends over time, and ultimately estimating abundance of a poorly understood species.

AB  - In this paper, a study is carried out for detecting North Atlantic Right Whale upcalls with measurements from passive acoustic monitoring devices. Preprocessed spectrograms of upcalls are subjected to two different tasks, one of which is based on extraction of time-frequency features from upcall contours, and the other that employs a Local Binary Pattern operator to extract salient texture features of the upcalls. Then several classifiers are used to evaluate the effectiveness of both the contour-based and texture-based features for upcall detection. Detection results reveal that popular classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and TreeBagger can achieve high detection rates. Furthermore, using LBP features for call detection shows improved accuracy of about 3% to 4% over time-frequency features when an identical classifier is used.

CP  - OCEANS 2009 - Europe Conference
AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) has been used to gain insight into their presence and behavior. Many of their calls have been shown to be detectable through spectrogram correlation due to the low variation in these stereotyped calls. In this work, we describe rule based classifiers for tonal B and D calls using the pitch/frequency contour information obtained from a contour extractor. B calls can be detected by spectrogram correlation, but the D calls are highly variable and are therefore difficult to detect using spectrogram kernel methods. Experiments on four hours of evaluation data from different field seasons show that 91.3% of B calls and 85.8% of D calls were correctly retrieved. For both types of calls, less than 2% of the retrieved calls were false positives.

AB  - Marine seismic surveys are under increasing scrutiny because of concern that they may disturb or otherwise harm marine mammals and impede their communications. Most of the energy from seismic surveys is low frequency, so concerns are particularly focused on baleen whales. Extensive mitigation efforts accompany seismic surveys, including visual and acoustic monitoring, but the possibility remains that not all animals in an area can be observed and located. One potential way to improve mitigation efforts is to utilize the seismic hydrophone streamer to detect and locate calling baleen whales. This study describes a method to localize low frequency sound sources with data recoded by a streamer. Beamforming is used to estimate the angle of arriving energy relative to sub-arrays of the streamer which constrains the horizontal propagation velocity to each sub-array for a given trial location. A grid search method is then used to minimize the time residual for relative arrival times along the streamer estimated by cross correlation. Results from both simulation and experiment are shown and data from the marine mammal observers and the passive acoustic monitoring conducted simultaneously with the seismic survey are used to verify the analysis.

AB  - Given new distribution patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis) population in recent years, an improved understanding of spatio-temporal movements are imperative for the conservation of this species. While so far visual data have provided most information on NARW movements, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was used in this study in order to better capture year-round NARW presence. This project used PAM data from 2004 to 2014 collected by 19 organizations throughout the western North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, data from 324 recorders (35,600 days) were processed and analyzed using a classification and detection system. Results highlight almost year-round habitat use of the western North Atlantic Ocean, with a decrease in detections in waters off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina in summer and fall. Data collected post 2010 showed an increased NARW presence in the mid-Atlantic region and a simultaneous decrease in the northern Gulf of Maine. In addition, NARWs were widely distributed across most regions throughout winter months. This study demonstrates that a large-scale analysis of PAM data provides significant value to understanding and tracking shifts in large whale movements over long time scales.

AB  - Many organizations collect large passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data sets that need to be efficiently and reliably analyzed. To determine appropriate methods for effective analysis of big PAM data sets, we undertook a literature review of baleen whale PAM analysis methods. Methodologies from 166 studies (published between 2000-2019) were summarized, and a detailed review was performed on the 94 studies that recorded more than 1,000 hr of acoustic data ("big data"). Analysis techniques for extracting baleen whale information from PAM data sets varied depending on the research observed. A spectrum of methodologies was used and ranged from manual analysis of all acoustic data by human experts to completely automated techniques with no manual validation. Based on this assessment, recommendations are provided to encourage robust research methods that are comparable across studies and sectors, achievable across research groups, and consistent with previous work. These include using automated techniques when possible to increase efficiency and repeatability, supplementing automation with manual review to calculate automated detector performance, and increasing consistency in terminology and presentation of results. This work can be used to facilitate discussion for minimum standards and best practices to be implemented in the field of marine mammal PAM.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is the method of choice to detect whales and dolphins that are acoustically active and to monitor their underwater behavior. The NATO Science and Technology Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation has recently implemented a compact passive acoustic monitor (CPAM), consisting of three arrays of two hydrophones each that are combined in a fixed three-dimensional arrangement and that may be towed at depths of more than 100m. With its volumetric configuration, the CPAM is capable of estimating the three-dimensional direction vector of arriving sounds and under certain conditions on relative geometry between the whale and hydrophone array, the CPAM may also estimate the range to echolocating animals. Basic ranging methods assume constant sound speed and apply straightforward geometry to obtain depth and distance to the sound source. Alternatively, ray-tracing based methods may be employed to integrate the information provided by real sound speed profiles. Both ranging methods combine measurements of sound arrival angles and surface reflection delays and are easily implemented in real-time applications, whereby one could promote the ray-tracing approach as the preferred method because it may integrate real sound speed profiles.

AB  - Cetacean tourism and vessel traffic have grown considerably around the world in recent decades. At Akaroa Harbor, Aotearoa New Zealand, recreational vessel traffic, dolphin tourism, and cruise ship presence increased substantially between 2008 and 2020. We examined the relationship between vessel traffic parameters and the presence of Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) during the austral summer 2019-2020, using automated vessel tracking and autonomous passive acoustic monitoring. Data were collected between December 2019 and May 2020, including the entirety of the first COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Generalized additive models revealed that increasing levels of motor vessel traffic, the presence of cruise ships, and high levels of dolphin tour vessel traffic resulted in decreases in acoustic detections of dolphins. Our findings suggest that Hector's dolphins at Akaroa Harbor were displaced from core habitat in response to each of these vessel traffic parameters. We recommend that managers use immediately actionable tools to reduce the impacts of vessels on these dolphins.

AB  - The easily identifiable, high-amplitude echolocation signals produced by sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus make the species ideal for long-term passive acoustic monitoring. Sperm whale signals were manually identified in the recordings from high-frequency acoustic recording packages monitoring 13 deep-water locations across the central and western North Pacific Ocean from 2005 to 2013, constituting the longest passive acoustic study of sperm whales to date. The species was detected at all of the sites, with the highest detection rate at Ladd Seamount (>18% of analyzed periods) and the lowest rates at equatorial sites (<1 % of analyzed periods). Generalized additive models and generalized estimating equations were used to produce explanatory models to assess temporal and geographic patterns. The model variables included diel phase, lunar day, day of the year, year, and site. The site-specific variability in detection rates was high across the North Pacific, but there were also common patterns, including a seasonal trend, with decreased detections during the summer or fall, and a diel trend, with increased detections at night. There appeared to be a seasonal movement pattern, with minimum detection rates occurring later in the year at more northerly sites. The nocturnal pattern was seen across all data sets but was not strong at equatorial locations. Although lunar cycles were important at many sites, there was no consistent trend at any spatial scale. Overall, this analysis confirms the broad distribution of sperm whales across the North Pacific and highlights the subtle temporal patterns in their acoustic activity, which may be related to shifts in animal behavior or movement.

AB  - Freshwater cetaceans are among the data deficient and now recognized as the most threatened group of marine mammals. Large scale studies are required to be done on an urgent basis to ensure reasonable chance of survival for these species. A detailed analysis of the freshwater habitats globally, indicate tropical shallow environment (important for the survival of the freshwater cetaceans). Visual surveys being employed for abundance estimates have significant limitations and acoustic surveys have recently been identified as effective alternative and could complement the visual surveys for conservation efforts. However, two major issues can be prominent such as shallow water sound propagation and noise pollutions. It is well known that shallow waters result in multiple interaction of the acoustic signal with the surface and the bottom prior to being received at the hydrophone receiver. The tropical waters further cause random surface and bottom behaviour resulting in substantial site specific underwater channel fluctuations being coupled to the desired marine mammal signal. Thus, the acoustic survey efforts in the tropical shallow habitats are highly sensitive to the local conditions and demand efforts to mitigate the underwater channel fluctuations while pursuing analysis efforts on the received signal. Increasing population in these regions has resulted in unregulated waterborne activities linked to economic growth. Such activities have caused significant increase in the ambient noise in these habitats. The effectiveness of acoustic sensors is further limited by the high ambient noise in the habitat and could also impact survival chances of these critically endangered species. This work attempts to put in perspective the challenges of acoustic surveys in tropical shallow habitats and provide a way ahead for effective passive acoustic monitoring of the freshwater cetaceans globally.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of underwater sounds is an emerging discipline that can be used to guarantee that anthropogenic noise meets acceptable limits, to detect the presence of cetacean species, and to ensure sustainable exploitation of our oceans and seas. In this scenario, graphical representation techniques play a key role in helping to reveal seasonal structures of human made noises. Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs. All of this is applied to data from deployments in two marine protected areas in order to provide an acoustic panorama and identify seasonal events. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Risk Function for Behavioral Disruption of Blainville's Beaked Whales (<i>Mesoplodon densirostris</i>) from Mid-Frequency Active Sonar
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - There is increasing concern about the potential effects of noise pollution on marine life in the world's oceans. For marine mammals, anthropogenic sounds may cause behavioral disruption, and this can be quantified using a risk function that relates sound exposure to a measured behavioral response. Beaked whales are a taxon of deep diving whales that may be particularly susceptible to naval sonar as the species has been associated with sonar-related mass stranding events. Here we derive the first empirical risk function for Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) by combining in situ data from passive acoustic monitoring of animal vocalizations and navy sonar operations with precise ship tracks and sound field modeling. The hydrophone array at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Bahamas, was used to locate vocalizing groups of Blainville's beaked whales and identify sonar transmissions before, during, and after Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar operations. Sonar transmission times and source levels were combined with ship tracks using a sound propagation model to estimate the received level (RL) at each hydrophone. A generalized additive model was fitted to data to model the presence or absence of the start of foraging dives in 30-minute periods as a function of the corresponding sonar RL at the hydrophone closest to the center of each group. This model was then used to construct a risk function that can be used to estimate the probability of a behavioral change (cessation of foraging) the individual members of a Blainville's beaked whale population might experience as a function of sonar RL. The function predicts a 0.5 probability of disturbance at a RL of 150dBrms re mu Pa (CI: 144 to 155) This is 15dB lower than the level used historically by the US Navy in their risk assessments but 10 dB higher than the current 140 dB step-function.

AB  - Data from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of Navy training ranges can be used to test predictions of marine mammal responsiveness to naval sonar from experimental behavioral response studies. Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) vocalizations were detected, classified, localized, and associated into individual tracks from data collected on bottom-mounted hydrophones on the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility located off Kauai, Hawaii. Data were analyzed from before, during, and after naval undersea warfare training activities in February 2014 and February 2017. The spatial distribution of acoustically derived whale tracks was modelled using "latitude," "longitude," "depth," "year," and "phase" (Before, During, and After) as covariates. It was found that, as well as inter-annual variability across all phases, the distribution of calling whales changed in both years, with fewer tracks in the vicinity of the center of ship activity in the During phase compared with the Before phase. This redistribution of calls extended for approximately five days after the end of the training activity in both years. As the data are from PAM, it is unknown whether this change in the probability of acoustic presence across the range is a result of whales moving away from the range or ceasing calling, or perhaps a combination of both. The expectation from experimental studies is that minke whales will exhibit avoidance in response to naval sonar activity. We conclude that this is a probable explanation for the results reported here, particularly given the nature of the redistribution (an increase in some areas distant from the center of ship activity coincident with a decrease near the center) and the time taken for the distribution observed in the Before phase to re-establish in the After phase of both years.

AB  - Passive acoustic surveys were conducted to assess the vocal behavior of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the designated critical calving habitat along the shallow coastal waters of southeastern United States. Underwater vocalizations were recorded using autonomous buoys deployed in close proximity to surface active groups (SAGs). Nine main vocalization types were identified with manual inspection of spectrograms, and standard acoustic descriptors were extracted. Classification trees were used to examine the distinguishing characteristics of calls and quantify their variability within the SAG vocal repertoire. The results show that descriptors of frequency, bandwidth, and spectral disorder are the most important parameters for partitioning the SAG repertoire, contrary to duration-related measures. The reported source levels and vocalization statistics provide sound production data vital to inform regional passive acoustic monitoring and conservation for this endangered species.

AB  - Pygmy blue whales in the South-east Indian Ocean migrate from the southern coast of Australia to Indonesia, with a significant part of their migration route passing through areas subject to oil and gas production. This study aimed at improving our understanding of the spatial extent of the distribution, migration and foraging areas, to better inform impact assessment of anthropogenic activities in these regions. Using a combination of passive acoustic monitoring of the NW Australian coast (46 instruments from 2006 to 2019) and satellite telemetry data (22 tag deployments from 2009 to 2021) we quantified the pygmy blue whale distribution and important areas during their northern and southern migration. We show extensive use of slope habitat off Western Australia and only minimal use of shelf habitat, compared to southern Australia where use of the continental shelf and shelf break predominates. In addition, movement behaviour estimated by a state-space model on satellite tag data showed that in general pygmy blue whales off Western Australia were mostly engaged in migration, interspersed with relatively short periods (median = 28 h, range = 2 - 1080 h) of low move persistence (slow movement with high turning angles), which is indicative of foraging. Using the spatial overlap of time and number of whales in area analysis of the satellite tracking data (top 50% of grid cells) with foraging movement behaviour, we quantified the spatial extent of pygmy blue whale high use areas for foraging and migration. We compared these areas to the previously described areas of importance to foraging and migrating whales (Biologically Important Areas; BIAs). In some cases these had good agreement with the most important areas we calculated from our data, but others had only low (5%) to moderate (15%) overlap. Month was the most important variable predicting the number of pygmy blue whale units and number of singers (acting as indices of pygmy blue whale density). Whale density was highest in the southern part of the NW Australian coast and whales were present there between April-June, and November-December, a pattern also confirmed by the satellite tracking data. Available data indicated pygmy blue whales spent up to 124 days in Indonesian waters (34% of annual cycle). Since this area may also be the calving ground for this population, inter-jurisdictional management is necessary to ensure their full protection.

AB  - Blainvilles beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) were detected through passive acoustic monitoring recordings of the hydrophones at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) off Kauai, Hawaii, from 2011 through 2013. Group vocal period (GVP) detections were analyzed for temporal (intra- and inter-annual and diel) and spatial (depth, slope, and range extent) patterns. A habitat model was developed using those parameters as predictor variables in Blainvilles beaked whale foraging dive distributions. No monthly or annual trends in GVP rates were found, but there was some diel periodicity found in GVP rates related to the lunar cycle. In addition, a strong relationship was found between bathymetric features and GVP rates, with most dives occurring over steep slopes and depths between 2,000 and 3,000 m. While GVPs occurred across the range throughout each year, they were concentrated in those areas of preferred habitat. GVP rates were also compared against Navy training activity to assess whether foraging behavior was affected by active sonar or explosive sounds. Similar to other Navy ranges, biannual multi-day training events did decrease GVP rates, but all of the other training activity did not appear to affect GVP rates over sampling periods of a week to a month. These results are the first description of baseline foraging behavior for Blainvilles beaked whales at PMRF and provide some insight into the habitat use patterns related to both the natural environment and anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Until the 1990s, beaked whales were one of the least understood groups of large mammals. Information on northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus) and Baird's beaked whales (Berardius bairdii) was available from data collected during whaling, however, little information existed on the smaller species other than occasional data gleaned from beach-cast animals. Recent research advances have been plentiful. Increasing global survey effort, together with morphometric and genetic analyses have shown at least 22 species in this group. Longitudinal field studies of at least four species (H. ampullatus, B. bairdii, Ziphius cavirostris, Mesoplodon densirostris) have become established over the last three decades. Several long-term studies support photo-identification catalogs providing insights into life history, social structure and population size. Tag-based efforts looking at diving, movements and acoustics have provided detail on individual behavior as well as population structure and ranges. Passive acoustic monitoring has allowed long-term and seasonal monitoring of populations. Genetic studies have uncovered cryptic species and revealed contrasting patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity amongst the few species examined. Conservation concern for these species was sparked by mass strandings coincident with military mid-frequency sonar use. Fat and gas emboli have been symptomatic indicators of mortalities related to sonar exposure, suggesting that their vulnerability stems from the physiological exertion of extreme diving for medium-sized whales. Behavioral response experiments have now shown that beaked whales appear to cease foraging and delay their return to foraging and/or leave the area in association with exposure to mid-frequency signals at low acoustic levels. Future priorities for these species will be to (1) continue field-studies to better understand smaller-scale habitat use, vital rates and social structure; (2) develop better detection methods for larger-scale survey work; (3) improve methodology for monitoring energetics, individual body condition and health; (4) develop tools to better understand physiology; (5) use recent genetic advances with improved sample databanks to re-examine global and local beaked whale relationships; (6) further quantify anthropogenic impacts (both sonar and other noise) and their population consequences (7) apply acquired data for realistic mitigation of sonar and other anthropogenic impacts for beaked whale conservation.

AB  - To date, the majority of studies investigating marine mammal distribution and behavior take a single-species perspective, which is often driven by the logistic difficulties of collecting appropriate data at sea. Passive acoustic monitoring, provided recording tools exhibit sufficient bandwidth, has the potential to provide insights into community structure as devices operate autonomously simultaneously collecting data on baleen, pinniped and toothed whale acoustic presence. Data can provide information on local species diversity, residency times and co-occurrence. Here, we used multi-year passive acoustic data from 6 sites in the Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean, to explore how local marine mammal community compositions develop over time and in relation to sea-ice. Diversity peaked in austral late spring and early summer, shortly before seasonal sea-ice break-up. The effective number of species exhibited little variation over time, reflecting that species remain in Antarctic waters throughout austral winter. Community composition showed almost complete seasonal overturn, indicating that species replace each other throughout the year. For all 6 sites, community dissimilarity increased with increasing temporal distance, reflecting temporal trends in community composition beyond seasonality. Several species exhibited significant positive or negative co-occurrence patterns over time. These seasonal associations were consistent across all 5 oceanic sites, but partly inversed at the Western Antarctic Peninsula recording site. This study shows that the application of biodiversity metrics to passive acoustic monitoring data can foster insights into the timing of behaviors and community composition, which can boost the interpretation of responses in the light of ongoing environmental changes.

AB  - Under the EU Habitats Directive, cetacean species must be maintained at favourable conservation status in European waters. Whether this is achieved via protected area designation, curtailment of activities such as fishing or construction, or time restrictions on noise, it is dependent on understanding the temporal patterns in occurrence. Our ability to study this is often limited by the relatively short time-series of data available to researchers. This study uses nine years of passive acoustic monitoring data paired with environmental covariates to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of harbour porpoise and dolphin species using generalised estimating equations-generalised linear models (GEE-GLMs). This long-term time-series included periods of increased disturbance due to construction of an underwater gas pipeline in the area, enabling us to investigate the effect of construction on species occurrence. Harbour porpoise and dolphins occurred in every season, with detections peaking in winter. We found a negative association between dolphins and porpoises throughout the year. Inter-annual variation in occurrence was evident, with a cyclical bi-annual pattern highlighted for both species suggesting a complex pattern of movement. Construction activity had a significant negative effect on the presence of porpoise but not dolphins. However, no long-term decrease in detection rates of porpoise was recorded. This study highlights the importance of understanding what factors influence cetacean occurrence as well as the temporal scale of disturbance effects for planning and management of construction activities in coastal areas.

AB  - Underwater passive acoustic monitoring systems record many hours of audio data for marine research, making fast and reliable non-causal signal detection paramount. Such detectors assist in reducing the amount of labor required for signal annotations, which often contain large portions devoid of signals.Cetacean vocalization detection based on spectral entropy is investigated as a means of vocalization discovery. Previous techniques using spectral entropy mostly consider time-frequency enhancement of the entropy measure, and utilize the short time Fourier transform (STFT) as its time-frequency (TF) decomposition. Spectral entropy methods also requires the user to set a detection threshold manually, which call for knowledge of the produced entropy measures.This paper considers median filtering as a simple, effective way to provide temporal stabilization to the entropy measure, and considers the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as an alternative TF decomposition. Kmeans clustering is used to determine the threshold required to accurately separate the signal/no-signal entropy measures, resulting in a one-dimensional, two-class classification problem. The class means are used to perform pseudo-probabilistic soft class assignment, which is a useful metric in algorithmic development. The effect of median filtering, signal-to-noise ratio and the chosen TF decomposition are investigated. The accuracy and specificity measures of the proposed detection technique are simulated using a pulsed frequency modulated sweep, corrupted by a sample of ocean noise.The results show that median filtering is particularly effective for low signal-to-noise ratios. Both the STFT and CWT prove to be effective TF analyses for signal detection purposes, each presenting with different advantages and drawbacks. The simulated results provide insight into configuring the proposed detector, which is compared to a conventional STFT-based spectral entropy detector using manually annotated humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) songs recorded in False Bay, South Africa, July2021. The proposed method shows a significant improvement in detection accuracy and specificity, while also providing a more interpretable detection threshold setting via soft class assignment, providing a detector for use in development of adaptive algorithms.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is an effective technique for long-term monitoring of the soundscape in marine protected areas. Ocean noise is a key concern for the U.S. Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and has been identified as a research priority. The Sanctuary Soundscape Monitoring Project ("SanctSound") was implemented to support efforts to address ocean noise across seven U.S. sanctuaries using a comprehensive and standardized approach. In this study, acoustic recordings were collected in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary during the humpback whale seasons (November-May) from 2018-2022. Data encompassed 14 deployments across four sites in the main Hawaiian Islands: HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, Maui, O'ahu, and KauaModified Letter Turned Commai. The soundscape was dominated by biological sources, most prominently the seasonal detection of humpback whale song. Third octave level monthly medians ranged from 70.4-105 dB re 1 mu Pa across sites with distinct peaks from January to April particularly at both HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai and Maui sites. Overall, we reported relatively low vessel detection rates, with Maui having the highest daily average of vessel detections (x = 19.16). No COVID-19 impact could be observed acoustically using soundscape metrics which was likely due to the dominance of humpback whale chorusing. However, vessel detections and AIS data revealed a reduction in vessel activity after the onset of the pandemic at the Maui and HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai sites. This study demonstrates that standardized metrics are a useful tool for obtaining long-term, baseline soundscape levels to understand the various contributions to the underwater soundscape and potential changes within marine protected areas in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai.

TI  - Using line acceleration to measure false killer whale (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>) click and whistle source levels during pelagic longline depredation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

KW  - OCEAN
AB  - False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) depredate pelagic longlines in offshore Hawaiian waters. On January 28, 2015 a depredation event was recorded 14m from an integrated GoPro camera, hydrophone, and accelerometer, revealing that false killer whales depredate bait and generate clicks and whistles under good visibility conditions. The act of plucking bait off a hook generated a distinctive 15Hz line vibration. Two similar line vibrations detected at earlier times permitted the animal's range and thus signal source levels to be estimated over a 25-min window. Peak power spectral density source levels for whistles (4-8 kHz) were estimated to be between 115 and 130 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz @ 1m. Echolocation click source levels over 17-32 kHz bandwidth reached 205 dB re 1 mu Pa @ 1m pk-pk, or 190 dB re 1 mu Pa @ 1m (root-mean-square). Predicted detection ranges of the most intense whistles are 10 to 25km at respective sea states of 4 and 1, with click detection ranges being 5 times smaller than whistles. These detection range analyses provide insight into how passive acoustic monitoring might be used to both quantify and avoid depredation encounters. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring, when coupled with automated signal recognition software, allows researchers to perform simultaneous monitoring at large spatial and temporal scales. This technique has been widely used to monitor cetaceans, bats, birds, and anurans but rarely applied to monitor primates. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of passive acoustic monitoring and automated signal recognition software for detecting the presence and monitoring the roaring behavior of the Black and Gold Howler Monkey (Alouatta caraya) over a complete annual cycle at one site in the Brazilian Pantanal. The diel pattern of roaring activity was unimodal, with high vocal activity around dawn. The howler monkey showed a clear seasonal pattern of roaring activity, with most of the roars detected during the wet season (74.9%, peak activity during November and December). The maximum vocal activity occurred during the period of maximum flowering and fruit production in the study area, suggesting a potential role of roaring in defending major feeding sites, which is in agreement with the findings of previous studies on the species. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that roaring may serve different purposes. Vocal activity was negatively associated with relative air humidity, which might be related to lower vocal activity on wetter and rainy days, while vocal activity was not related to minimum air temperature. Automated signal recognition software allowed us to detect the species in 89% of the recordings in which it was vocally active, but with a reduced time cost, since the time investment for data analyses was 2% of recording time. The good performance of the recognizer might be related to the long and loud roars of the howler monkey. Further research should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of automated signal recognition for detecting the calls of different species of primates and under different environmental conditions.

AB  - The F-POD, an echolocation-click logging device, is commonly used for passive acoustic monitoring of cetaceans. This paper presents the first assessment of the error-rate of fully automated analysis by this system, a description of the F-POD hardware, and a description of the KERNO-F v1.0 classifier which identifies click trains. Since 2020, twenty F-POD loggers have been used in the BlackCeTrends project by research teams from Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Turkiye, and Ukraine with the aim of investigating trends of relative abundance in populations of cetaceans of the Black Sea. Acoustic data from this project analysed here comprises 9 billion raw data clicks in total, of which 297 million were classified by KERNO-F as Narrow Band High Frequency (NBHF) clicks (harbour porpoise clicks) and 91 million as dolphin clicks. Such data volumes require a reliable automated system of analysis, which we describe. A total of 16,805 Detection Positive Minutes (DPM) were individually inspected and assessed by a visual check of click train characteristics in each DPM. To assess the overall error rate in each species group we investigated 2,000 DPM classified as having NBHF clicks and 2,000 DPM classified as having dolphin clicks. The fraction of NBHF DPM containing misclassified NBHF trains was less than 0.1% and for dolphins the corresponding error-rate was 0.97%. For both species groups (harbour porpoises and dolphins), these error-rates are acceptable for further study of cetaceans in the Black Sea using the automated classification without further editing of the data. The main sources of errors were 0.17% of boat sonar DPMs misclassified as harbour porpoises, and 0.14% of harbour porpoise DPMs misclassified as dolphins. The potential to estimate the rate at which these sources generate errors makes possible a new predictive approach to overall error estimation.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is widely used for detection and localization of marine mammals. Typically, pressure sensors are used, although several studies utilized acoustic vector sensors (AVSs), that measure acoustic pressure and particle velocity and can estimate azimuths to acoustic sources. The AVSs can localize sources using a reduced number of sensors and do not require precise time synchronization between sensors. However, when multiple animals are calling concurrently, automated tracking of individual sources still poses a challenge, and manual methods are typically employed to link together sequences of measurements from a given source. This paper extends the method previously reported by Tenorio-Halle, Thode, Lammers, Conrad, and Kim [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151(1), 126-137 (2022)] by employing and comparing two fully-automated approaches for azimuthal tracking based on the AVS data. One approach is based on random finite set statistics and the other on message passing algorithms, but both approaches utilize the underlying Bayesian statistical framework. The proposed methods are tested on several days of AVS data obtained off the coast of Maui and results show that both approaches successfully and efficiently track multiple singing humpback whales. The proposed methods thus made it possible to develop a fully-automated AVS tracking approach applicable to all species of baleen whales.

AB  - The associations between feeding activities and environmental variables inform animal feeding tactics that maximize energetic gains by minimizing energy costs while maximizing feeding success. Relevant studies in aquatic animals, particularly marine mammals, are scarce due to difficulties in the observation of feeding behaviors in aquatic environments. This data scarcity concurrently hinders ecosystem-based fishery management in the context of small toothed-cetacean conservation. In the present study, a passive acoustic monitoring station was deployed in an East Asian finless porpoise habitat in Laizhou Bay to investigate potential relationships between East Asian finless porpoises and their prey. The data revealed that porpoises were acoustically present nearly every day during the survey period. Porpoise detection rates differed between spring and autumn in concert with activities of fish choruses. During spring, fish choruses were present throughout the afternoon, and this was the time when porpoise vocalizations were the most frequently detected. During autumn, when fish choruses were absent, porpoise detection rates decreased, and diurnal patterns were not detected. The close association between fish choruses and finless porpoise activities implies an "eavesdropping" feeding strategy to maximize energetic gains, similar to other toothed cetaceans that are known to engage similar feeding strategies. Underwater noise pollution, particularly those masking fish choruses, could interrupt finless porpoises' feeding success. Fisheries competing soniferous fishes with finless porpoise could impact finless porpoise viability through ecosystem disruption, in addition to fishing gear entanglement.

AB  - The recent identification of the bio-duck call as Antarctic minke whale (AMW) vocalization allows the use of passive acoustic monitoring to retrospectively investigate year-round spatial-temporal patterns in minke whale occurrence in ice-covered areas. Here, we present an analysis of AMW occurrence patterns based on a 9-year passive acoustic dataset (2008-2016) from 21 locations throughout the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea). AMWs were detected acoustically at all mooring locations from May to December, with the highest presence between August and November (bio-duck calls present at more than 80% of days). At the southernmost recording locations, the bio-duck call was present up to 10 months of the year. Substantial inter-annual variation in the seasonality of vocal activity correlated to variation in local ice concentration. Our analysis indicates that part of the AMW population stays in the Weddell Sea during austral winter. The period with the highest acoustic presence in the Weddell Sea (September-October) coincides with the timing of the breeding season of AMW in lower latitudes. The bio-duck call could therefore play a role in mating, although other behavioural functions of the call cannot be excluded to date.

AB  - The source properties and radiation patterns of animal vocalisations define, along with propagation and noise conditions, the active space in which these vocalisations can be detected by conspecifics, predators, prey, and by passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). This study reports the 4 pi (360 degrees horizontal and vertical) beam profile of a free-swimming, trained harbour porpoise measured using a 27-element hydrophone array. The forward echolocation beam is highly directional, as predicted by a piston model, and is consistent with previous measurements. However, at off-axis angles greater than +/- 30 degrees, the beam attenuates more rapidly than the piston model and no side lobes are present. A diffuse back beam is also present with levels about -30 dB relative to the source level. In PAM, up to 50% of detections can be from portions of the beam profile with distorted click spectra, although this drops substantially for higher detection thresholds. Simulations of the probability of acoustically detecting a harbour porpoise show that a traditional piston model can underestimate the probability of detection compared to the actual three-dimensional radiation pattern documented here. This highlights the importance of empirical 4 pi measurements of beam profiles of toothed whales, both to improve understanding of toothed whale biology and to inform PAM.

AB  - Humpback whale song chorusing dominates the marine soundscape in Hawai'i during winter months, yet little is known about spatio-temporal habitat use patterns of singers. We analysed passive acoustic monitoring data from five sites off Maui and found that ambient noise levels associated with song chorusing decreased during daytime hours nearshore but increased offshore. To resolve whether these changes reflect a diel offshore-onshore movement or a temporal difference in singing activity, data from 71 concurrently conducted land-based theodolite surveys were analysed. Non-calf pods (n = 3082), presumably including the majority of singers, were found further offshore with increasing time of the day. Separately, we acoustically localized 217 nearshore singers using vector-sensors. During the day, distances to shore and minimum distances among singers increased, and singers switched more between being stationary and singing while travelling. Together, these findings suggest that the observed diel trends in humpback whale chorusing off Maui represent a pattern of active onshore-offshore movement of singers. We hypothesize that this may result from singers attempting to reduce intraspecific acoustic masking when densities are high nearshore and avoidance of a loud, non-humpback, biological evening chorus offshore, creating a dynamic of movement of singers aimed at increasing the efficiency of their acoustic display.

AB  - This paper contributes to documenting a change in the distribution of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (NARWs) that occurred in the 2010s, when the whales largely abandoned their traditional summering grounds in the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy/Scotian shelf. Data from a year-round passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) network in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were exploited to build the time series of NARW incursions into this inland sea of the Northwest Atlantic, from June 2010 to November 2018. NARWs visited the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence every year from June to January, until ice freeze-up. The earliest detections were made at the end of April and the latest in mid-January. Call occurrence peaked between August and the end of October. NARW contact calls were not detected at the most upstream station at Les Escoumins, in the Lower St. Lawrence estuary, or at the northeastern connection of Belle Isle Strait with the Atlantic, which was monitored from November 2010 to November 2011. The mean daily occurrence of NARWs in the feeding grounds off Gaspe quadrupled after 2015 compared to 2011-2014. Long-term continuous PAM data provided invaluable information to document this marine mammal distribution shift.

AB  - Quantitatively describing the acoustic repertoire of a species is important for establishing effective passive acoustic monitoring programs and developing automated call detectors. This process is particularly important when the study site is remote and visual surveys are not cost effective. Little is known about the vocal behavior of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) in New Zealand. The aim of this study was to describe and quantify their entire vocal repertoire on calving grounds in the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands. Over three austral winters (2010-2012), 4349 calls were recorded, measured, and classified into 10 call types. The most frequently observed types were pulsive, upcall, and tonal low vocalizations. A long tonal low call (<= 15.5 s duration) and a very high call (peak frequency similar to 750 Hz) were described for the first time. Random Forest multivariate analysis of 28 measured variables was used to classify calls with a high degree of accuracy (82%). The most important variables for classification were maximum ceiling frequency, number of inflection points, duration, and the difference between the start and end frequency. This classification system proved to be a repeatable, fast, and objective method for categorising right whale calls and shows promise for other vocal taxa. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Considering the success of mobile computing, real-time identification of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) data is now an emerging possibility. Despite computational evolution, analysis of raw acoustic data by complex algorithms requires considerably computing effort, therefore, consuming overly battery power. As battery power is a low resource in many environments, such as the sea, a very simple time-domain signal similarity filter is proposed in this paper. To accomplish that, the filter uses a richer representation of time-domain data created by symbolic data analysis. Taking this new data type and assuming environmental noise as a stationary process, a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test is applied to detect signal similarity over time. To evaluate overall processing time, a dataset of raw acoustic data acquired from PAM was used. In addition, to endorse accuracy and no data loss, all data were visually and acoustically searched for sperm whale clicks.

AB  - Mitigation of threats posed to marine mammals by human activities can be greatly improved with a better understanding of animal occurrence in real time. Recent advancements have enabled low-power passive acoustic systems to be integrated into long-endurance autonomous platforms for persistent near real-time monitoring of marine mammals via the sounds they produce. Here, the integration of a passive acoustic instrument capable of real-time detection and classification of low-frequency (LF) tonal sounds with a Liquid Robotics wave glider is reported. The goal of the integration was to enable monitoring of LF calls produced by baleen whales over periods of several months. Mechanical noises produced by the platform were significantly reduced by lubricating moving parts with polytetrafluoroethylene, incorporating rubber and springs to decelerate moving parts and shock mounting hydrophones. Flow noise was reduced with the development of a 21-element hydrophone array. Surface noise produced by breaking waves was not mitigated despite experimentation with baffles. Compared to a well-characterized moored passive acoustic monitoring buoy, the system greatly underestimated the occurrence of sei, fin, and North Atlantic right whales during a 37-d deployment, and therefore is not suitable in its current configuration for use in scientific or management applications for these species at this time.

AB  - Evaluating changes in the collective behavior of a population can be an indirect method for inferring organismal responses to changing environmental conditions. Apex predators, such as the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), can provide valuable insights into the ecosystem processes of the deep sea, where little direct observation can be made. Sperm whales are often difficult to observe at sea, as they inhabit deep, offshore waters and spend most of their lives beneath the surface. However, sperm whales are extremely amenable to passive acoustic monitoring, as their vocalizations are well-studied, highly distinguishable, produced regularly, and can be detected at relatively long ranges (>10 km). Sperm whales produce distinct clicks in two behavioral contexts (social interaction or foraging/prey capture); thus, we can use acoustic detection of these vocalizations to infer patterns of large-scale, collective behavior, which is similar to studying calling frogs or insects indicating their reproductive phonology. We recorded behaviorally-specific sperm whale vocalizations at three sites in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in July 2010 and 2011. We used these recordings to construct population-level time budgets, an empirical collective metric of behavior, based on the ratio of hours in a day with social clicks to the hours in a day with foraging clicks, and represented this as an "acoustic activity index." Our index showed significant differences in the proportions of social and foraging behavior across the range of sperm whales in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, and the proportion of social activity increased by more than a factor of two from 2010 to 2011. These differences support previous evidence of differential habitat use by sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico, and suggest possible changes in environmental conditions between years. Thus, the acoustic activity index may provide a powerful way to evaluate changes in behavior and link them to changing ecological conditions. This novel application of bioacoustics to constructing time budgets and creating a behaviorally-based index at the population scale can serve as an indicator of ecological change, and greatly enhance our ability to understand the behavior and ecology of many acoustically active species.

AB  - We successfully developed an extension of the OBIS-SEAMAP database, a global biogeographic database specializing in marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles, to integrate passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data with other commonly collected data types (i.e. line-transect visual sightings, animal telemetry, and photo-identification). As part of this effort, we made significant improvements in mapping and visualization tools for PAM data, including spatially and temporally interactive summary statistics, diel plots, temporal effort representation, and the unique rendering of PAM data to distinguish them from other data types. In this paper, we summarize technical challenges we overcame, report the methodologies and implementation of the integration, and conduct case studies using visual sightings and PAM data from bowhead whales and Risso's dolphins to demonstrate how the integrated database facilitates in-depth ecological assessments that form the foundation for spatially-explicit conservation efforts.

AB  - One of the best ways of studying animals that produce signals in underwater environments is to use passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Acoustic monitoring is used to study marine mammals in oceans, and gives us information for understanding cetacean life, such as their behaviour, movement or reproduction. Automated analysis for captured sound is almost essential because of the large quantity of data. A deep learning approach was chosen for this task, since it has proven great efficiency for answering such problematics. This study focused on the orcas (Orcinus orca) of northern Vancouver Island, Canada, in collaboration with the NGO Orcalab which developed a multihydrophone recording station around Hanson Island to study orcas. The acoustic station is composed of 5 hydrophones and extends over 50 km2 of ocean. Since 2016 we are continuously streaming the hydrophone signals to our laboratory at Toulon, France, yielding nearly 50 TB of synchronous multichannel recordings. The objective for this research is to do a preliminary analysis of the collected data and demonstrate influence of environmental factors (tidal, moon phase and daily period) on the orcas' acoustic activities.

AB  - This article describes an automatic detector for marine mammal vocalizations. Even though there has been previous research on optimizing automatic detectors for specific calls or specific species, the detection of any type of call by a diversity of marine mammal species still poses quite a challenge-and one that is faced more frequently as the scope of passive acoustic monitoring studies and the amount of data collected increase. Information (Shannon) entropy measures the amount of information in a signal. A detector based on spectral entropy surpassed two commonly used detectors based on peak-energy detection. Receiver operating characteristic curves were computed for performance comparison. The entropy detector performed considerably faster than real time. It can be used as a first step in an automatic signal analysis yielding potential signals. It should be followed by automatic classification, recognition, and identification algorithms to group and identify signals. Examples are shown from underwater recordings in the Western Canadian Arctic. Calls of a variety of cetacean and pinniped species were detected. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Understanding the marine soundscape is of growing importance to the National Marine Sanctuaries. In the center of Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a new Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) project has begun. Using the power and communications infrastructure of the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) cabled observatory, we deployed a broadband, digital, omnidirectional hydrophone on Smooth Ridge, near the MARS node (36 degrees 42.75'N, 122 degrees 11.21'W; depth 891 m). The system has been recording almost continuously since 28 July 2015. Natural biological sound (biophony) dominated long-term spectral average results at frequencies below 50 Hz, showing seasonal patterns in baleen whale vocalizations. Prevalence of blue whale vocalizations during August through October 2015 was succeeded by prevalence of fin whale vocalizations during November 2015 through January 2016. Diel variations (stronger signal at night) were evident for both species. In the high-frequency range, beaked whale clicks have been detected and represent a focus for advancing automated detection and classification methods. Biophonic richness in this soundscape was also indicated by human-expert analysis results for a one-week period, during which biological sound events were detected 86% of the time. Examination of natural physical sound (geophony) has included rainfall and the relationship between wind speed and ambient sound. The first 10 months of data showed that sound levels at 2 kHz followed Wenz curve predictions for wind speeds above 5 m/s. Examination of human-made sound (anthrophony) has included noise from vessel traffic and explosions detonated underwater during fishery operations. This new PAM project is providing extensive information on biophony, geophony, and anthrophony in this deep soundscape, information that is essential to understanding and managing acoustic habitat of the Sanctuary.

TI  - Acoustic behavior of beaked whales, with implications for acoustic monitoring

CP  - Oceans 2006 Conference
AB  - Beaked whales (Cetacea: Ziphiidea) of the genera Ziphius and Mesoplodon have been reported to mass strand during naval sonar exercises, and the ability to mitigate such negative effects is of increasing importance. Beaked whales dive for long periods and am. difficult to sight at the surface. We discuss new results suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring for beaked whales holds promise for detecting their presence. A new non-invasive acoustic recording tag was attached to beaked whales of two species, 3 Mesoplodon densirostris and 7 Ziphius cavirostris. High-frequency clicks were recorded for about 30 min every 2-4 hours during deep dives of all tagged whales. The tagged whales only clicked at depths below 200 in, down to a maximum depth near 2000 in. During each foraging dive, both species produced thousands of directional, ultrasonic clicks with no significant energy below 20 kHz. The clicks are produced in trains with mean interclick intervals near 0.4 s. Individual clicks are frequency modulated pulses with durations of 200-300 mu sec and center frequencies around 40 kHz, -10 dB bandwidths of 20-30 kHz. The sound beam for Ziphius is narrow with an estimated directionality index of more than 25 dB, source levels up to 214 dBpp re 1 mu Pa at 1 m. Given knowledge of the source level, frequency range, and directionality of beaked whale clicks, along with the precise orientation and location of beaked whales clicking during foraging dives, it is possible to model the "acoustic footprint" of foraging dives. These data can be used to estimate the probability of detecting the presence of beaked whales by listening. Critical parameters include the density of sensors and the listening time needed to achieve adequate detection probability. Using the observed dive behavior of K, tagged beaked whales of genera Ziphius and Mesoplodon, we worked with the NATO Undersea Research Center to develop a simulation of detector performance for arrays of hydrophones at variable depths between 100 and 1400 in. We demonstrate that for continuous listening for at least the 2-4 hour interval between the start of deep dives, high detection probability could be achieved with acoustic sensors spaced a few km apart. The greatest problem for beaked whale detectors is likely to be false alarms from biological and physical acoustic transients (such as dolphin clicks), and monitoring efforts will need to trade off probability of false alarm against maximizing detection probability. While results may be somewhat poorer in realistic noise conditions and with practical detectors, there appears to be considerable potential for the acoustic detection of beaked

AB  - Since 2003, a collaborative effort (SEASWAP) between fishers, scientists, and managers has researched how Alaskan sperm whales locate demersal longline fishing activity and then depredate sablefish from gear. Sperm whales constantly produce relatively low-frequency biosonar signals whenever foraging; therefore, over the past decade, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become a basic tool, used for both measuring depredation activity and accelerating field tests of potential depredation countermeasures. This paper reviews and summarizes past published PAM research on SEASWAP, and then provides a detailed example of how PAM methods are currently being used to test countermeasures. The review covers two major research thrusts: (i) identifying acoustic outputs of fishing vessels that provide long-distance "cues" that attract whales to fishing activity; and (ii) validating whether distinctive "creak" sounds can be used to quantify and measure depredation rates, using both bioacoustic tags and statistical comparisons between visual and acoustic depredation estimates during federal sablefish surveys. The latter part of the paper then provides an example of how PAM is being used to study a particular potential countermeasure: an "acoustic decoy" which transmits fishing vessel acoustic cues to attract animals away from true fishing activity. The results of an initial 2011 field trial are presented to show how PAM was used to design the decoy signals and monitor the efficacy of the deployment. The ability of PAM to detect both whale presence and depredation behaviour has reduced the need to deploy researchers or other specialists on fishing cruises. Instead, volunteer fishers can deploy "user-friendly" acoustic recorders on their gear, greatly facilitating the testing of various deterrents, and providing the industry and regulators a convenient and unobtrusive tool for monitoring both the scale and long-term spread of this behaviour across the Alaskan fishery.

AB  - Cetacean abundance estimation often relies on distance sampling methods using shipboard visual line-transect surveys, which assumes that all animals on the trackline are detected and that the detection of animals decreases with increasing distance from the trackline. Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) typically employs a secondary visual observation team and may be used to identify the fraction of animals detected on the trackline when it is suspected that animals may have been missed. For species that are difficult to detect using visual observation methods, such as deep-diving species or those with cryptic surfacing behavior, this secondary team may be prone to the same limitations in detection as the primary observation team and alternative modes of detection may improve estimates. Here we examine the potential use of passive acoustic detection as a secondary platform for MRDS of rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) during a combined visual and acoustic shipboard line-transect survey. The average trackline detection probability for rough-toothed dolphins was less than one for both the trial configuration (for the visual team) and independent observer configuration (average p(0) 0.45 for the visual team) and independent observer configuration (average p(0) 0.37 for the visual, p (0) 0.77 for the acoustic and p(0) 0.84 for both teams combined). This study, while limited in scope, strongly suggests that passive acoustic methods may be an effective alternative for estimating p(0) for some cetaceans species.

AB  - Characterizing population structure and dynamics is critical for the conservation of endangered species. Monitoring sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus is especially difficult because it requires monitoring different latitudes to capture the dynamics of most populations. Since their remarkable sexual dimorphism in body size is reflected in their sounds, passive acoustic monitoring presents an opportunity to capture contiguous patterns in time, space, and over large scales. We show that the echolocation repetition rate (measured as inter-click interval, ICI) as a proxy for body length is a suitable approach for large-scale acoustic monitoring. Body length has previously been estimated from the time interval between pulses (IPI) within sperm whale echolocation clicks. These estimates can only be achieved when whales are oriented toward the recorder or directly facing away, resulting in sparse data. A representative subsample of data demonstrated that ICI and IPI are linearly correlated, allowing conversion of ICI distributions into likely body length categories. This approach was applied to three monitoring sites in the Gulf of Mexico (2010-2017), where sperm whale population structure and male movements were poorly understood. We identified three classes: large animals between 12-15 m (ICI between 0.72 and 1 sec), presumed to correspond to adult males, and small animals below 12 m (ICI between 0.44 and 0.64 sec) likely pertaining to social groups (mixed groups with adult females and their offspring), and the third class with mid-sized animals (ICI between 0.64 and 0.83 sec) believed to contain adult females or sub-adult males. Our results revealed spatial and seasonal variability of the population structure including possible male presence throughout the year and migratory patterns of the population. This approach provides a means to efficiently characterize the putative population structure of sperm whales to understand the population's geographical dynamics and population status, which is relevant under rapidly changing habitat conditions.

AB  - The vocal repertoire of the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) is poorly documented, with no published information about acoustic signals from South Atlantic Ocean populations. We conducted passive acoustic monitoring and recording of S. attenuata population in the Santos Basin, Brazil, using a towed hydrophone array during line-transects surveys. Our monitoring yielded whistle samples derived from eight groups of S. attenuata, from which we selected 155 whistles for further analysis. Approximately 48% of the whistles presented ultrasonic frequency values, with maximum frequencies up to 31.1 kHz. Across the sample, the number of steps ranged from 0 to 20 and inflection points ranged from 0 to 8. On average, end frequencies were higher than start frequencies, and whistles generally presented wide frequency ranges, with an average of 11.3 kHz. The most predominant whistle contour category was "ascending-descending." Our study provides new information regarding the acoustic repertoire of this poorly documented species and will aid efforts for using acoustics to identify and monitor cetaceans in this region.

AB  - Navy sonar has been associated with a number of marine mammal stranding events worldwide. As a result determining the effects of anthropoge nise on marine mammals is currently an active area of research. The developemnt methods to detect and localixe the animals in their native environments is key to advance this reearch and our understanding .This paper presents a collection of algorithms for automated passive acoustic detection, classification and localization of vocalizing marine mammals in open ocean environments. The toool set known as M3R (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges) uses the large fields of wide-bandwidth bottom-mounted hydrophones that are part of the U.S Navy undersea ranges to listen for vocalizing whales. M3R employs time-frequency analysis to passively detect whale vocalizations; It then aligns detections among neighboring hydrophones to determine the difference in times of arrival (TDOA) of each vocalization. Sets of TDOA are then used to determine 2-D or 3-D position points using hyperbolic localization techniques. An M3R system is capable of continuous automated real-time monitoring of over 200 wide-bandwidth hydrophones covering 2,000+ km(2) of open ocean M3R is typically used in a collaborative fashion to localize animals in support of tagging exercises visual surveys and behavioural response experiments.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring, a non-invasive technique, is increasingly used to study animal populations and habitats at much larger spatial and temporal scales than standard methods. However, easy to apply tools for reliable detection and classification of signals of interest among hundreds or even thousands of hours of recording are still lacking. We introduce the r package soundClass, a tool to train convolutional neural networks, and employ them to classify sound events in recordings. soundClass provides a sound event classification pipeline, from annotating recordings to automating trained networks usage in real-life situations. We illustrate the package functionality on bat echolocation calls, bird songs and whale echolocation clicks, showing that the package can be used to train networks for several types of sound events, taxonomic groups and environments; and exemplify its application. This tool facilitates the creation and usage of trained networks and was developed with a strong focus on graphical user interfaces to be used by non-specialist scientists in statistics and programming.

AB  - Population growth and economic development in Latin America has led to an increase in seismic surveying to find new marine hydrocarbon reserves. However, most countries along the Pacific, Atlantic, and Caribbean lack the standards to minimize the impact of seismic exploration on marine organisms. We searched primary and secondary literature in major databases and consulted international authorities and oil companies to provide scientific evidence of the effects of seismic surveying on fish and cetaceans in order to propose minimum guidelines to reduce disturbance to marine organisms in Latin America. The results suggest that seismic surveys can disrupt basic life-cycle activities such as movement, communication, and feeding. Typical outcomes include sub-lethal effects such as escape behavior, habituation, temporary loss of hearing, and changes in vocalization behavior. In order to mitigate these impacts, we propose that oil companies must provide authorities with an environmental impact assessment that includes survey data, array specifications, and acoustic array properties before a hydrocarbon exploration license can be granted. Standard mitigation measures such as exclusion zones, marine mammal observers, and passive acoustic monitoring must be implemented to prevent potential adverse effects. Appropriate legislation and regulations must be designed and implemented, and environmental authorities should be privy to all activities by seismic vessels. Besides relevant regulations and continued monitoring, further investigation must be conducted to evaluate the impact of these activities on marine organisms. The adoption of these proposed minimum guidelines is highly re commended to minimize seismic surveying impact on fish and cetaceans in Latin American countries.

AB  - The development of risk assessments for the exposure of protected populations to noise from coastal construction is constrained by uncertainty over the nature and extent of marine mammal responses to man-made noise. Stakeholder concern often focuses on the potential for local displacement caused by impact piling, where piles are hammered into the seabed. To mitigate this threat, use of vibration piling, where piles are shaken into place with a vibratory hammer, is often encouraged due to presumed impact reduction. However, data on comparative responses of cetaceans to these different noise sources are lacking. We studied the responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to both impact and vibration pile driving noise during harbor construction works in northeast Scotland, using passive acoustic monitoring devices to record cetacean activity and noise recorders to measure and predict received noise levels. Local abundance and patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins were also compared with a five-year baseline. The median peak-to-peak source level estimated for impact piling was 240 dB re 1 lPa (single-pulse sound exposure level [SEL] 198 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s), and the r.m.s. source level for vibration piling was 192 dB re 1 lPa. Predicted received broadband SEL values 812 m from the piling site were markedly lower due to high propagation loss: 133.4 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s (impact) and 128.9 dB re 1 lPa2 s (vibration). Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises were not excluded from sites in the vicinity of impact piling or vibration piling; nevertheless, some small effects were detected. Bottlenose dolphins spent a reduced period of time in the vicinity of construction works during both impact and vibration piling. The probability of occurrence of both cetacean species was also slightly less during periods of vibration piling. This work provides developers and managers with the first evidence of the comparative effects of vibration and impact piling on small cetaceans, enabling more informed risk assessments, policy frameworks, and mitigation plans. In particular, our results emphasize the need for better understanding of noise levels and behavioral responses to vibration piling before recommending its use to mitigate impact piling.

AB  - Increasing sound in the ocean from human activity potentially threatens marine animals that use sound to communicate, detect prey, avoid predators and function within their ecosystem. The detection and classification of sound produced by marine animals, such as whales and fish, is an important component in noise mitigation strategies, while also providing valuable insights into their ecology. Traditionally, visual surveys are conducted to assess how these animals utilize a specific area, often underestimating the number of individuals as they don't spend much time at the surface. Long-term passive acoustic monitoring efforts have become more prevalent to monitor such animals. The large datasets collected can be impractical to manually process, necessitating the development of automated detection methods, which often produce mixed results owing to the broad frequency range and variable duration of many biological sounds. Here we describe a novel approach for automated detection of underwater biophonic sounds employing hidden Markov models (HMM). Acoustic data was collected at a single listening station in Hauraki Gulf, from October 2014 to April 2016. HMM detection models were developed for Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) that were used as a model organism because they are notoriously hard to study with traditional visual surveys and produce a characteristic call. Bryde's whale calls also directly overlap the sounds of anthropogenic activity, in particular the sound of vessels transiting to the busiest port in New Zealand; therefore monitoring whale calls is of utmost importance when confronting increasing sound in the ocean. Vocalizations were detected with a sensitivity of 77% and false positive rate of 23%. Bryde's whale vocalizations were detected on 11% of all recordings. Overall, there were significantly more detections during summer (n = 1716) than winter (n = 447), and significantly more during the day (n = 1991) compared to night (n = 1264). This study shows the feasibility of using HMMs on long-term acoustic datasets. The method has the potential to be used for a wide range of soniferous animals who, like the Bryde's whale, also produce unique sounds. The detection method would be particularly useful for mitigation and management strategies of species that are difficult to detect using traditional visual methods.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for observing soniferous species in remote marine environments over long periods of time, which can inform conservation planning and wildlife management. In this study, we collected seven examine the seasonal presence of four species of marine mammals and unidentified fish species, examine drivers of underwater sound levels, and quantify underwater noise from vessel traffic. Bearded seals were vocally present from mid-March to early July. Ringed seals were present in every month. Beluga whales were present from early July until September. Bowhead whales were detected from April to August, and fish were detected from February to July. Underwater sound levels were dampened by the presence of landfast sea ice and increased with wind speed. Increased bearded seal calls also caused increased sound levels. The only vessel detected was the research vessel that recovered the acoustic recorder. Underwater sound levels were much lower in Minto Inlet compared to other areas in the region, and it appears to be an important site for many marine mammals where forage fish species, primarily Arctic cod, are abundant at depth. These results are in line with Minto Inlet being identified as an important area by the community of Ulukhaktok. At present, anthropogenic impact on this area appears to be very low, but further monitoring is required to determine if any management measures are necessary to maintain these low levels.

AB  - During dedicated surveys for the Critically Endangered eastern stock of North Pacific right whales Eubalaena japonica (NPRW) in the Bering Sea, focal follows (FFs) were combined with passive acoustic monitoring to correlate vocal activity with dive behavior. During FFs, impulsive gunshot calls (hereafter 'gunshots'), similar to those produced by other right whale populations, were localized to male and female NPRWs. The timing of gunshots correlated strongly with diving behavior observed during the FFs. Log survivorship analysis of inter-blow intervals showed a bout criterion interval of 40 s, separating the data into shorter surfacings and longer dives. For both, gunshots were skewed closer to the end of the sequence (modal gunshot to blow times: 5 s for dives, 7 s for surfacings) than the beginning (modal blow to gunshot times: 22 s for dives, 13 s for surfacings). Gunshots were more commonly produced during dives than surfacings. Mean gunshot calling rate during FFs was 133.0 calls h(-1) (range: 38.9-425.0). Other NPRW calls, including upcalls, the predominant call used to identify right whales acoustically, were not detected during the FFs. To determine comparative call detection rates, an additional 180 h of non-FF recordings were analyzed. Gunshots were detected similar to 50 times more frequently than upcalls (mean: 228.3 vs. 4.3 calls h(-1), respectively), with a maximum gunshot calling rate of 835.7 calls h(-1). This is the first study to definitively attribute gunshots to NPRW, and demonstrates the importance of including gunshots in passive acoustic studies, which will greatly increase NPRW detectability while supporting more accurate determinations of their spatio-temporal distribution.

AB  - A decade of visual and acoustic detections of marine megafauna around offshore Oil & Gas (O&G) installations in the North and Irish Seas are presented. Marine megafauna activity was monitored visually and acoustically by Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) qualified and experienced Marine Mammal Observers (MMO) and Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) Operators respectively, with real-time towed PAM in combination with industry standard software, PAMGuard. Monitoring was performed during routine O&G industrial operations for underwater noise mitigation purposes, and to ensure adherence to regulatory guidelines. Incidental sightings by off-effort MMOs and installation crew were also reported. Visual and acoustic monitoring spanned 55 non-consecutive days between 2004 and 2014. A total of 47 marine mammal sightings were recorded by MMOs on dedicated watch, and 10 incidental sightings of marine megafauna were reported over 10 years. Species included: harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), white beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), common seal (Phoca vitulina), grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and, basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). Passive Acoustic Monitoring was conducted on two occasions in 2014; 160 PAM hours over 12 days recorded a total of 308 individual clicks identified as harbour porpoises. These appear to be the first such acoustic detections obtained from a North Sea drilling rig whilst using a typically configured hydrophone array designed for towing in combination with real-time PAMGuard software. This study provides evidence that marine megafauna are present around mobile and stationary offshore O&G installations during routine operational activities. On this basis, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for decommissioning O&G platforms should be carried-out on a case-by-case basis, and must include provisions for hitherto overlooked marine megafauna.

AB  - When implementing conservation strategies involving passive acoustic monitoring, an accurate description of signal properties is crucial, especially when studying threatened and elusive vocalizing species. Misrepresentation of detected sounds can result in information loss or misclassification of species, thus compromising the management process. Distortion of the time-frequency features depends on the characteristics of acoustic propagation through sea water, sensitivity and sampling frequency of the acquisition system and distance between cetacean source and the receiving sensor (hydrophone). This study examined how the sampling frequency and the distance from the source affect the properties of burst pulsed sounds emitted by short-beaked common dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea and how the signal is modified in relation to the recording scenarios. Burst pulses were collected at 300 000 samples/s, and down-sampled at 192 000, 96 000, 48 000 and 44 100. Fifteen acoustic parameters were automatically measured. The median values were measured and compared among the signals sampled at different rates. Finally, a transmission loss model was applied to explore the variation of the power spectrum density during click propagation through seawater. The results showed that, even if higher sampling rates are a more accurate match with the original signal, some parameters (number of clicks, inter-click-interval and maximum peak) measured at 96 000 and 192 000 Hz did not display significant differences compared with 300 000 Hz, except for the frequency parameters. The transmission loss model also showed that the highest frequency components strongly attenuate within 800 m from the source. These results suggest that high recording distances and lower sampling rates do not allow an accurate analysis of burst pulsed signals. However, taking into account data storage limitations, recording at the highest frequency is not always required for an accurate description of signals and the outcomes of this study improve the accuracy of passive acoustic monitoring systems, thus enhancing the potential for conservation of short-beaked common dolphins.

AB  - Baseline knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for cetacean management and conservation. Such knowledge is particularly important in areas where gillnet fishing occurs, as the Upper Gulf of California, which increases the probability of bycatch of cetaceans. In this area, the vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) has been widely studied, but the knowledge of other cetaceans is scarce and based on traditional visual survey methods. We used data collected by an array of acoustic click detectors (C-PODs) during the summers 2011 to 2015 to analyze the distribution of dolphins in the Vaquita Refuge in the Upper Gulf of California. We recorded 120,038 echolocation click trains of dolphins during 12,371 days of recording effort at 46 sampling sites. Based on simultaneous visual and acoustic data, we estimated a false positive acoustic detection rate of 19.4%. Dolphin acoustic activity varied among sites, with higher activity in the east of the Vaquita Refuge. Acoustic activity was higher at night than during the day. We used negative binomial generalized linear models to study the count of clicks of dolphins in relation to spatial, temporal, physical, biological and anthropogenic explanatory variables. The best model selected for the response variable included sampling site, day-night condition, and vertical component of tide speed. Patterns in the spatial distribution of predicted acoustic activity of dolphins were similar to the acoustic activity observed per sampling season. Higher acoustic activity was predicted at night, but the tide speed variable was not relevant under this condition. Acoustic activity patterns could be related to the availability of prey resources since echolocation click trains are associated with foraging activities of dolphins. This is the first study of the distribution of dolphins in Mexico using medium-term systematic passive acoustic monitoring, and the results can contribute to better management to the natural protected area located in the Upper Gulf of California.

AB  - We present results of the first simultaneous visual and acoustic surveys for Amazon River dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), undertaken in Yarinacocha Lagoon, Ucayali, Peru (length = 20 km, area = 12 km(2)). A total of 324 Sotalia observations and 44 Inia observations were recorded in boat-based transects. Based upon total survey effort, we estimated Sotalia had a mean density +/- SE of 1.98 +/- 4.6 ind km(-2) and an overall abundance of 34 individuals (95% CI: 28 to 40). Average density for Inia was 0.2 +/- 1.2 ind km(-2) with overall abundance estimated at 3 individuals (95% CI: 0 to 8). Visual surveys observed more Sotalia individuals during earlier hours of the day and during the dry season. Preliminary acoustic surveys undertaken with C-POD passive acoustic monitoring devices indicated a diel pattern in detections of cetacean vocalization with more diurnal activity and with detections ceasing from midnight until 10: 00 AM. This work highlights the possibility of monitoring both river dolphin species through visual and acoustic surveys to generate baseline information on abundance trends and distribution patterns in the Ucayali region, an area with high levels of human disturbance.

AB  - In recent years, Taiwan's government has focused on policies regarding offshore wind farming near the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin habitat, where marine mammal observation is a critical consideration. The present research developed an algorithm called National Taiwan University Passive Acoustic Monitoring (NTU_PAM) to assist marine mammal observers (MMOs). The algorithm performs whistle detection processing and whistle localization. Whistle detection processing is based on image processing and whistle feature extraction; whistle localization is based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) method. To test the whistle detection performance, we used the same data to compare NTU_PAM and the widely used software PAMGuard. To test whistle localization, we designed a real field experiment where a sound source projected simulated whistles, which were then recorded by several hydrophone stations. The data were analyzed to locate the moving path of the source. The results show that localization accuracy was higher when the sound source position was in the detection region composed of hydrophone stations. This paper provides a method for MMOs to conveniently observe the migration path and population dynamics of cetaceans without ecological disturbance.

AB  - To investigate the potential impacts of naval mine neutralization exercises (MINEX) on odontocete cetaceans, a long-term passive acoustic monitoring study was conducted at a US Navy training range near Virginia Beach, USA. Bottom-moored acoustic recorders were deployed in 2012-2016 near the epicentre of MINEX training activity and were refurbished every 2-4 months. Recordings were analysed for the daily presence/absence of dolphins, and dolphin acoustic activity was quantified in detail for the hours and days before and after 31 MINEX training events. Dolphins occurred in the area year-round, but there was clear seasonal variability, with lower presence during winter months. Dolphins exhibited a behavioural response to underwater detonations. Dolphin acoustic activity near the training location was lower during the hours and days following detonations, suggesting that animals left the area and/or reduced their signalling. Concurrent acoustic monitoring farther away from the training area suggested that the radius of response was between 3 and 6 km. A generalized additive model indicated that the predictors that explained the greatest amount of deviance in the data were the day relative to the training event, the hour of the day and circumstances specific to each training event.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has proven a powerful tool for the study of marine mammals, allowing for documentation of biologically relevant factors such as movement patterns or animal behaviors while remaining largely non-invasive and cost effective. From 2008-2019, a set of PAM recordings covering the frequency band of most toothed whale (odontocete) echolocation clicks were collected at sites off the islands of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, KauaModified Letter Turned Commai, and Pearl and Hermes Reef. However, due to the size of this dataset and the complexity of species-level acoustic classification, multi-year, multi-species analyses had not yet been completed. This study shows how a machine learning toolkit can effectively mitigate this problem by detecting and classifying echolocation clicks using a combination of unsupervised clustering methods and human-mediated analyses. Using these methods, it was possible to distill ten unique echolocation click 'types' attributable to regional odontocetes at the genus or species level. In one case, auxiliary sightings and recordings were used to attribute a new click type to the rough-toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis. Types defined by clustering were then used as input classes in a neural-network based classifier, which was trained, tested, and evaluated on 5-minute binned data segments. Network precision was variable, with lower precision occurring most notably for false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens, across all sites (35-76%). However, accuracy and recall were high (>96% and >75%, respectively) in all cases except for one type of short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus, call class at KauaModified Letter Turned Commai and Pearl and Hermes Reef (recall >66%). These results emphasize the utility of machine learning in analysis of large PAM datasets. The classifier and timeseries developed here will facilitate further analyses of spatiotemporal patterns of included toothed whales. Broader application of these methods may improve the efficiency of global multi-species PAM data processing for echolocation clicks, which is needed as these datasets continue to grow.

AB  - An autonomous surface vehicle known as a wave glider, instrumented with a low-power towed hydrophone array and embedded digital signal processor, is demonstrated as a viable low-noise system for the passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals. Other key design elements include high spatial resolution beamforming on a 32-channel towed hydrophone array, deep array deployment depth, vertical motion isolation, and bandwidth-efficient real-time acoustic data transmission. Using at-sea data collected during a simultaneous deployment of three wave glider-based acoustic detection systems near Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in September 2019, the capability of a low-frequency towed hydrophone array to spatially reject noise and to resolve baleen whale vocalizations from anthropogenic acoustic clutter is demonstrated. In particular, mean measured array gain of 15.3 dB at the aperture design frequency results in a post-beamformer signal-to-noise ratio that significantly exceeds that of a single hydrophone. Further, it is shown that with overlapping detections on multiple collaborating systems, precise localization of vocalizing individuals is achievable at long ranges. Last, model predictions showing a 4x detection range, or 16x area coverage, advantage of a 32-channel towed array over a single hydrophone against the North Atlantic right whale upcall are presented for the continental shelf environment south of Martha's Vineyard.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used for studying marine mammals, leading to the accumulation of large acoustic datasets. Analyzing these datasets becomes impractical without automated detection and classification software. Detectors and classifiers based on deep neural networks have shown great potential, but their performance is often limited by the availability of sufficient quantities of annotated training samples, and their application restricted to the specific acoustic environment(s) from which their training data were collected. We address these limitations by employing transfer learning, a deep learning concept whereby knowledge from a source domain is transferred to a target domain. Specifically, we considered two different underwater acoustic environments as the source and target domains. The objective was to use a deep neural network that had been trained in one environment with abundant annotated training samples, and optimize its performance in the other environment where the annotated training samples were limited. Training and testing were conducted using three acoustic datasets containing North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls. Experiments show that adapting a trained model to the new environment led to a substantial improvement in recall from 70% to 85%, while maintaining a low false-positive rate of less than 5 per hour. The methodology is implemented as an opensource Python tool to facilitate the creation of more tailored deep learning-based acoustic detectors and classifiers for North Atlantic right whale vocalizations and other stereotyped marine mammal calls.

AB  - 1. Understanding habitat requirements for species at risk is crucial for effective conservation management, even though the location and extent of vital habitats may be unknown for rare or elusive species.2. In the case of marine species, determining important habitat often relies on limited occurrence data or extrapolation from species distribution models (SDMs). SDMs predict habitat by associating species records with environmental variables, assuming a functional ecological relationship.3. This study focuses on northern bottlenose whales (NBW; Hyperoodon ampullatus) and Sowerby's beaked whales (SBW; Mesoplodon bidens) in the western North Atlantic. As both NBW and SBW are at risk in Canada, the objective was to identify the extent and function of important habitats to guide conservation efforts.4. The analysis mapped all available geographic occurrence data and used passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data to inform the development of ensemble SDMs to predict potential habitat and assess the persistence of realized habitat use.5. Important habitats for NBW and SBW were found primarily concentrated along the continental shelf edges, at an average depth of 1200 m +/- 460 SD. All habitat areas support foraging and movement and critical life history functions for both species.6. The Gully and other submarine canyons off eastern Nova Scotia emerged as important areas for both species, validating the existing Critical Habitat for NBW. However, spatial-temporal patterns diverged on either side of this region. North-eastern Newfoundland was identified as the next closest area of near-year-round presence for NBW, whereas the south-western Scotian Shelf region, Georges Bank and the Fundian Channel supported persistent foraging by SBW.7. By integrating multiple data sources (sightings, acoustic detections and SDMs) and demonstrating the temporal persistence of habitat use by NBW and SBW, this study provides valuable insights for identifying, protecting and managing important habitat for beaked whales.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), particularly autonomous platforms, offers many advantages in monitoring phonating deep-diving marine mammals in oceanic environment. Relevant data can be obtained day and night continuously over long durations and in any weather conditions. It provides a cost-efficient solution with greater detection ranges when compared to traditional large research vessel and aerial visual surveys requiring keeping expert observers on station for long periods of time and relying on good visibility and calm seas. Therefore, PAM is becoming a preferred tool to assess population dynamics trends and health of deep-water marine mammal stocks. However the large volumes of collected data require robust automatic detection and classification algorithms to identify marine mammals in recordings. As for beaked whales, one of the challenging automatic processing goals is the identification of different species to advance our understanding of their role in the marine ecosystem. At present, traditional detection and classification methods employ searches for acoustic events above a user-defined signal-to-noise ratio threshold in the frequency band of interest and further rely on an experienced operator's manual inspection for species classification and removal of false positives. Current passive monitoring data collection systems yield large volumes of acoustic data, therefore a manual classification approach becomes very time-consuming and impractical. This paper focuses on developing a multi-stage automatic classifier for beaked whale species. The proposed method utilizes unsupervised machine clustering of signal attributes extracted from potential detection events flagged by an energy-band detector. The proposed algorithm was benchmarked against a manually annotated workshop dataset and applied to acoustic data collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The algorithm classifies beaked whale species in automatic mode with minimal operator involvement only at the validation stage. When compared with the manually annotated classification dataset, the proposed method achieved a recall rate of 82.8% for Cuvier's and 77.9% for Gervais' species in automatic mode. New insights on habitat use by different species of beaked whales in the Gulf of Mexico were gained when using the species-specific classifier. The high spatial resolution acoustic monitoring results showed that the habitat preferences of two dominating beaked whale species in the Gulf of Mexico support the habitat division (ecological niche) hypothesis.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring was used to document the presence of singing humpback whales off the coast of Northern Angola, and opportunistically test for the effect of seismic survey activity in the vicinity on the number of singing whales. Two Marine Autonomous Recording Units (MARUs) were deployed between March and December 2008 in the offshore environment. Song was first heard in mid June and continued through the remaining duration of the study. Seismic survey activity was heard regularly during two separate periods, consistently throughout July and intermittently in mid-October/ November. Numbers of singers were counted during the first ten minutes of every hour for the period from 24 May to 1 December, and Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were used to assess the effect of survey day (seasonality), hour (diel variation), moon phase and received levels of seismic survey pulses (measured from a single pulse during each ten-minute sampled period) on singer number. Application of GAMMs indicated significant seasonal variation, which was the most pronounced effect when assessing the full dataset across the entire season (p<0.001); however seasonality almost entirely dropped out of top-ranked models when applied to a reduced dataset during the July period of seismic survey activity. Diel variation was significant in both the full and reduced datasets (from p<0.01 to p<0.05) and often included in the top-ranked models. The number of singers significantly decreased with increasing received level of seismic survey pulses (from p<0.01 to p<0.05); this explanatory variable was included among the top ranked models for one MARU in the full dataset and both MARUs in the reduced dataset. This suggests that the breeding display of humpback whales is disrupted by seismic survey activity, and thus merits further attention and study, and potentially conservation action in the case of sensitive breeding populations.

AB  - Marine passive acoustic monitoring can be used to study biological, geophysical, and anthropogenic phenomena in the ocean. The wide range of characteristics from geophysical, biological, and anthropogenic sounds sources makes the simultaneous automatic detection and classification of these sounds a significant challenge. Here, we propose a single Hidden Markov Model-based system with a Deep Neural Network (HMM-DNN) for the detection and classification of low-frequency biological (baleen whales), geophysical (earthquakes), and anthropogenic (air guns) sounds. Acoustic data were obtained from the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization station off Juan Fernandez, Chile (station HA03) and annotated by an analyst (498 h of audio data containing 30,873 events from 19 different classes), and then divided into training (60%), testing (20%), and tuning (20%) subsets. Each audio frame was represented as an observation vector obtained through a filterbank-based spectral feature extraction procedure. The HMM-DNN training procedure was carried out discriminatively by setting HMM states as targets. A model with Gaussian Mixtures Models and HMM (HMM-GMM) was trained to obtain an initial set of HMM target states. Feature transformation based on Linear Discriminant Analysis and Maximum Likelihood Linear Transform was also incorporated. The HMM-DNN system displayed good capacity for correctly detecting and classifying events, with high event-level accuracy (84.46%), high weighted average sensitivity (84.46%), and high weighted average precision (89.54%). Event-level accuracy increased with higher event signal-to-noise ratios. Event-level metrics per class also showed that our HMM-DNN system generalized well for most classes but performances were best for classes that either had a high number of training exemplars (e.g., generally above 50) and/or were for classes of signals that had low variability in spectral features, duration, and energy levels. Fin whale and Antarctic blue whale song and air guns performed particularly well.

AB  - Monitoring Arctic wildlife is important due to the increasing potential impact of environmental and industrial changes. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be an important tool for wildlife management through observations of several species simultaneously along with abiotic elements such as industrial activity. Here, we use PAM methods to monitor the occurrence of marine mammals over an 8-month period (Oct 2012-May 2013) in Scott Inlet, Nunavut. When marine mammals were present, we investigated possible environmental correlates. Sea ice coverage strongly influenced detections of marine mammal sounds: narwhals and bowhead whales were only present before full ice cover occurred in the fall, while bearded seals and walruses could only be detected after ice formation. Tidal phase, time of the day, water temperature at 300 m depth, and air temperature all influenced detections of narwhal clicks. This PAM study provides a baseline measure for the presence of marine mammals over the fall to spring in Scott Inlet. Long-term PAM in the same location would allow us to document changes in the phenology of marine mammals at this site in relation to environmental changes.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a useful technique for monitoring marine mammals. However, the quantity of data collected through PAM systems makes automated algorithms for detecting and classifying sounds essential. Deep learning algorithms have shown great promise in recent years, but their performance is limited by the lack of sufficient amounts of annotated data for training the algorithms. This work investigates the benefit of augmenting training datasets with synthetically generated samples when training a deep neural network for the classification of North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls. We apply two recently proposed augmentation techniques, SpecAugment and Mixup, and show that they improve the performance of our model considerably. The precision is increased from 86% to 90%, while the recall is increased from 88% to 93%. Finally, we demonstrate that these two methods yield a significant improvement in performance in a scenario of data scarcity, where few training samples are available. This demonstrates that data augmentation can reduce the annotation effort required to achieve a desirable performance threshold.

AB  - A paucity of information on the basic biology and ecology of Cook Inlet beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas remains a decade after the species was listed as endangered in 2008. The causes of its continued decline remain unclear. This lack of knowledge limits our understanding of, and ability to manage, potential threats impeding the recovery of this endangered population. Seasonal distribution and foraging ecology, particularly during winter, are currently among the most basic gaps in knowledge. Therefore, we conducted a year-round passive acoustic monitoring program from 2008-2013, monitoring 13 locations within the belugas' critical habitat. We identified seasonal occurrence patterns across years at most locations. Detections were higher in the upper inlet during summer, peaking in known concentration areas. The occurrence of whales in the upper inlet when ice coverage peaked during winter was more prevalent than previously suggested. We documented seasonal differences in foraging habitat preference, with foraging behavior more prevalent during summer, particularly near upper inlet rivers, than during winter. Foraging peaks coincided with the presence of different anadromous fish runs from spring to fall. Low levels of feeding activity in winter suggest a lack of feeding aggregation areas, feeding in non-monitored offshore waters, or increased effort on benthic prey. These results represent a substantial contribution to our knowledge of Cook Inlet beluga seasonal distribution and foraging ecology, which will strengthen conservation and management strategies and thus more effectively promote recovery of this endangered population.

AB  - The diversity of animal acoustic signals has evolved due to multiple ecological processes, both biotic and abiotic. At the level of communities of signaling animals, these processes may lead to diverse outcomes, including partitioning of acoustic signals along multiple axes (divergent signal parameters, signaling locations, and timing). Acoustic data provides information on the organization, diversity and dynamics of an acoustic community, and thus enables study of ecological change and turnover in a non-intrusive way. In this review, we lay out how community bioacoustics (the study of acoustic community structure and dynamics), has value in ecological monitoring and conservation of diverse landscapes and taxa. First, we review the concepts of signal space, signal partitioning and their effects on the structure of acoustic communities. Next, we highlight how spatiotemporal ecological change is reflected in acoustic community structure, and the potential this presents in monitoring and conservation. As passive acoustic monitoring gains popularity worldwide, we propose that the analytical framework of community bioacoustics has promise in studying the response of entire suites of species (from insects to large whales) to rapid anthropogenic change.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring for cetaceans mainly employ fixed-location methods or point transect samplings; an acoustic survey from a moving platform to conduct line transects is less common. In this study, acoustic capture-recapture by combining a double-observer method with line transect sampling was performed to observe Yangtze finless porpoises. Two acoustic devices were towed with the distance between them varying 0.5 to 89.5 m. The conditional probabilities that both devices would detect the porpoises within the same time window were calculated. In a 1-s time window, it became smaller as the distance between the devices increased, approaching zero when the distance between them was more than 50 m. It was considered that the devices with less than 50m distance detected the same signals from the same animals, which means the identical detection. When the distance between them is too great, the recapture rate is reduced and the incidence of false matching may increase. Thus, a separation distance of around 50m between two devices in acoustic capture-recapture of Yangtze finless porpoises was recommended. Note that the performance of the double detections can change depending on the particular device used and on animal behaviors such as vocalizing interval, ship avoidance.

AB  - The growing interest in generating electrical power from tidal currents using tidal turbine generators raises a number of environmental concerns, including the risk that marine mammals might be injured or killed through collision with rotating turbine blades. To understand this risk, information on how marine mammals use tidal rapid habitats and in particular, their underwater movements and dive behaviour is required. Porpoises, which are the most abundant small cetacean at most European tidal sites, are difficult animals to tag, and the limited size of tidal habitats means that any telemetered animal would be likely to spend only a small proportion of time within them. Here, an alternative approach is explored, whereby passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used to obtain fine scale geo-referenced tracks of harbour porpoises in tidal rapid areas. Large aperture hydrophone arrays are required to obtain accurate locations of animals from PAM data and automated algorithms are necessary to process the large quantities of acoustic data collected on such systems during a typical survey. Methods to automate localisation, including a method to match porpoise detections on different hydrophones and separate different vocalising animals, and an assessment of the localisation accuracy of the large aperture hydrophone array are presented.

AB  - Detecting whistle events is essential when studying the population density and behavior of cetaceans. After eight months of passive acoustic monitoring in Xiamen, we obtained long calls from two Tursiops aduncus individuals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with an unbiased gammatone multi-channel Savitzky-Golay for smoothing dynamic continuous background noise and interference from long click trains. The algorithm uses the method of least squares to perform a local polynomial regression on the time-frequency representation of multi-frequency resolution call measurements, which can effectively retain the whistle profiles while filtering out noise and interference. We prove that it is better at separating out whistles and has lower computational complexity than other smoothing methods. In order to further extract whistle features in enhanced spectrograms, we also propose a set of multi-scale and multi-directional moving filter banks for various whistle durations and contour shapes. The final binary adaptive decisions at frame level for whistle events are obtained from the histograms of multi-scale and multi-directional spectrograms. Finally, we explore the entire data set and find that the proposed scheme achieves the highest frame-level F-1-scores when detecting T. aduncus whistles than the baseline schemes, with an improvement of more than 6%.

AB  - Discrimination of bioacoustic signals to the species or population level is critical for using passive acoustic monitoring to study cetacean ecology. Risso's dolphins off southern California have distinctive peaks and notches in their echolocation clicks, but it was unknown whether Risso's dolphins from other geographic areas have similarly distinctive click spectra and whether populations are acoustically distinct. This study investigates using clicks for species and population identification by characterizing the spectral structure of Risso's dolphin echolocation clicks recorded over wide-ranging geographic regions including the U.S. waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and North Pacific Ocean; and international waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. All recordings with Risso's dolphin clicks exhibited the spectral peak and notch pattern described off southern California, indicating the presence of peak banding patterns is useful for species discrimination. Geographic regions were a significant explanatory factor for variability in the frequencies of click spectral peaks, with relatively higher frequency peaks and notches found off Hawaii compared to California waters and off the southeast U.S. compared to the Gulf of Mexico. In the North Atlantic Ocean, a latitudinal cline in frequencies was evident. Potential causes of acoustic variation within and among acoustic encounters are evaluated.

AB  - Knowledge of fine-scale seasonal and diel activity patterns of animals provides insights into habitat utilization dynamics and informs conservation action planning against potential human impacts. Such information is particularly important for riverine cetaceans, such as the Yangtze finless porpoise, which is threatened by habitat loss and disturbances by a variety of human activities. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques were used to survey the seasonal and diel activities of the Yangtze finless porpoise in two natural habitat patches of the Anqing Yangtze Finless Porpoise Natural Reserve, and in one highly disturbed area adjacent to the reserve. In the two natural habitat patches, significantly higher detection rates of porpoises were observed during autumn and winter. The detection rates during autumn and winter were significantly higher at night than during daytime, whereas during spring and summer the diel difference in porpoise detection rates was not statistically significant. In the highly disturbed habitat, the porpoise detection rates were significantly lower than those in the two natural habitats. Although seasonal differences in porpoise detection rates were not statistically significant, diel detection rates were significantly different in autumn and winter. Information on seasonal patterns of porpoise activities suggested strengthening monitoring and law enforcement during autumn and winter, during the period in which diel activity patterns implied a potential conservation gap during nighttime. Extremely low levels of porpoise activities in port areas implied an ecological impact of coastal engineering on megafauna viability through the alteration of habitat functionality. To provide information on animal occurrences and activities and to minimize the bias of 'false-absence' from visual surveys, the census survey design should consider both visual and PAM techniques. In seasons when occurrences of river cetaceans and habitat use are increasing, heightened conservation monitoring and law enforcement efforts are required, particularly during nighttime.

AB  - In situ time series measurements of ocean ambient noise, have been made in deep waters of the Arabian Sea, using an autonomous passive acoustic monitoring system deployed as part of the Ocean Moored buoy network in the Northern Indian Ocean (OMNI) buoy mooring operated by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), in Chennai during November 2018 to November 2019. The analysis of ambient noise records during the spring (April-June) showed the presence of dolphin whistles but contaminated by unwanted impulsive shackle noise. The frequency contours of the dolphin whistles occur in narrow band in the range 4-16 kHz. However, the unwanted impulsive shackle noise occurs in broad band with the noise level higher by similar to 20 dB over the dolphin signals, and it reduces the quality of dolphin whistles. A wavelet based threshold denoising technique followed by a subtraction method is implemented. Reduction of unwanted shackle noise is effectively done and different dolphin whistle types are identified. This wavelet denoising approach is demonstrated for extraction of dolphin whistles in the presence of challenging impulsive shackle noise. Furthermore, this study should be useful for identifying other cetacean species when the signal of interest is interrupted by unwanted mechanical noise.

AB  - The Critically Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis entered a population decline around 2011. To save this species without closing the ocean to human activities requires detailed information about its intra-annual density patterns that can be used to assess and mitigate human-caused risks. Using 2.9 million km of visual line-transect survey effort from the US Atlantic and Canadian Maritimes conducted in 2003-2020 by 11 institutions, we modeled the absolute density (ind. km-2) of the species using spatial, temporal, and environmental covariates at a monthly time step. We accounted for detectability differences between survey platforms, teams, and conditions, and corrected all data for perception and availability biases, accounting for platform differences, whale dive behavior, group composition, and group size. We produced maps of predicted density and evaluated our results using independently collected passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Densities correlated positively (r = 0.46, rho = 0.58, tau = 0.46) with acoustic detection rates obtained at 492 stationary PAM recorders deployed across the study area (mean recorder duration = 138 d). This is the first study to quantify the concurrence of visual and acoustic observations of the species in US waters. We summarized predictions into mean monthly density and uncertainty maps for the 2003-2009 and 2010-2020 eras, based on the significant changes in the species' spatial distribution that began around 2010. The results quantify the striking distribution shifts and provide effort- and bias-corrected density surfaces to inform risk assessments, estimations of take, and marine spatial planning.

AB  - This study addresses the problem of determining optimal design of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems for detecting and localizing whale calls in real-time in variable-noise environments. The performance of various PAM system is assessed using the detection theory and simulation modeling applied to the context of North Atlantic right whale (NARW) upcalls in feeding grounds and noisy shipping corridor of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Realistic simulations are performed using an estimated NARW upcall source level (SL), the actual shipping traffic, measured local fleet ship SLs, and transmission loss (TL) from a regional 2.5-D propagation model accounting for the bathymetric and environmental structures. The comparisons consider single-hydrophone and hydrophone-array PAM systems, mounted on buoys, gliders, or cabled to shore and three families of NARW upcall detectors. The targeted performance is a low false-alarm rate of 1 per day and a detection probability > 0.5. The time-frequency-based detector offers the best trade-off between detection performance and robustness against NARW upcall variability. The effective detection ranges are similar to 15 times lower with single-hydrophone systems compared to hydrophone-arrays, whose beamforming enhances the signal in the upcall direction while damping interfering discrete noise from nearby transiting ships in other directions. Detecting and localizing NARWs in the large target areas (>10000-km(2) scale) is possible with a few well-located arrays of 10-20 hydrophones, which appears as the optimal cost/performance trade-off.

AB  - Automatic algorithms for the detection and classification of sound are essential to the analysis of acoustic datasets with long duration. Metrics are needed to assess the performance characteristics of these algorithms. Four metrics for performance evaluation are discussed here: receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, detection-error-trade-off (DET) curves, precision-recall (PR) curves, and cost curves. These metrics were applied to the generalized power law detector for blue whale D calls [Helble, Ierley, D'Spain, Roch, and Hildebrand (2012). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 131(4), 2682-2699] and the click-clustering neural-net algorithm for Cuvier's beaked whale echolocation click detection [Frasier, Roch, Soldevilla, Wiggins, Garrison, and Hildebrand (2017). PLoS Comp. Biol. 13(12), e1005823] using data prepared for the 2015 Detection, Classification, Localization and Density Estimation Workshop. Detection class imbalance, particularly the situation of rare occurrence, is common for long-term passive acoustic monitoring datasets and is a factor in the performance of ROC and DET curves with regard to the impact of false positive detections. PR curves overcome this shortcoming when calculated for individual detections and do not rely on the reporting of true negatives. Cost curves provide additional insight on the effective operating range for the detector based on the a priori probability of occurrence. Use of more than a single metric is helpful in understanding the performance of a detection algorithm. (C) 2022 Author(s).

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a widely used technique for studying the distribution and habitat use of cetaceans. The C-POD, an acoustic sensor with an onboard automated click detector, has been deployed in diverse acoustic environments, but studies verifying its offshore detection rates and factors affecting detection probability are scarce. To empirically evaluate the performance of C-PODs in detecting bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), C-PODs were deployed alongside archival acoustic recorders 12-30 km offshore in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The C-POD and acoustic recordings, post-processed using PAMGUARD software, were compared for a period of 6852 h. C-POD false positive rates were very low (mean 0.003%), and positive hourly detection accuracy was very high (mean 99.6%). Analysis of the acoustic environment and dolphin click characteristics revealed that true positive detections by C-PODs were significantly more likely to occur when PAMGUARD detected more clicks and there was increased high frequency noise (>20 kHz), likely from distant or unclassified clicks. C-PODs were found to be reliable indicators of dolphin presence at hourly or greater time scales.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is commonly used to generate information on the distribution, abundance, and behavior of cetacean species. In African waters, the utilization of PAM lags behind most other continents. This study examines whether the whistles of three coastal delphinid species (Delphinus delphis, Tursiops truncatus, and Tursiops aduncus) commonly encountered in the southern African subregion can be readily distinguished using both statistical analysis of standard whistle parameters and the automated detection and classification software PAMGuard. A first account of whistles recorded from D. delphis from South Africa is included. Using PAMGuard, classification to species was high with an overall mean correct classification rate of 87.3%. Although lower, high rates of correct classification were also found (78.4%) when the two T. aduncus populations were included separately. Classification outcomes reflected patterns observed in standard whistle parameters. Such acoustic discrimination may be useful for confirmation of morphologically similar species in the field. Classification success was influenced by training and testing the classifier with data from different populations, highlighting the importance of locally collected acoustic data to inform classifiers. The small number of sampling populations may have inflated the classification success, therefore, classification trials using a greater number of species are recommended.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) relate species information to environmental conditions to predict potential species distributions. The majority of SDMs are static, relating species presence information to long-term average environmental conditions. The resulting temporal mismatch between species information and environmental conditions can increase model inference's uncertainty. For SDMs to capture the dynamic species-environment relationships and predict near-real-time habitat suitability, species information needs to be spatiotemporally matched with environmental conditions contemporaneous to the species' presence (dynamic SDMs). Implementing dynamic SDMs in the marine realm is highly challenging, particularly due to species and environmental data paucity and spatiotemporally biases. Here, we implemented presence-only dynamic SDMs for four migratory baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean (SO): Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin, and humpback whales. Sightings were spatiotemporally matched with their respective daily environmental predictors. Background information was sampled daily to describe the dynamic environmental conditions in the highly dynamic SO. We corrected for spatial sampling bias by sampling background information respective to the seasonal research efforts. Independent model evaluation was performed on spatial and temporal cross-validation. We predicted the circumantarctic year-round habitat suitability of each species. Daily predictions were also summarized into bi-weekly and monthly habitat suitability. We identified important predictors and species suitability responses to environmental changes. Our results support the propitious use of dynamic SDMs to fill species information gaps and improve conservation planning strategies. Near-real-time predictions can be used for dynamic ocean management, e.g., to examine the overlap between habitat suitability and human activities. Nevertheless, the inevitable spatiotemporal biases in sighting data from the SO call for the need for improving sampling effort in the SO and using alternative data sources (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring) in future SDMs. We further discuss challenges of calibrating dynamic SDMs on baleen whale species in the SO, with a particular focus on spatiotemporal sampling bias issues and how background information should be sampled in presence-only dynamic SDMs. We also highlight the need to integrate visual and acoustic data in future SDMs on baleen whales for better coverage of environmental conditions suitable for the species and avoid constraints of using either data type alone.

AB  - Environmental and ecological factors can trigger changes in the acoustic repertoire of cetaceans. This study documents the first use of a well-established passive acoustic monitoring device (C-POD) to analyze echolocation sounds and behavior of franciscana dolphins in different habitats: estuary [Babitonga Bay (BB)] and open sea [Itapiruba Beach (IB)]. A total of 10 924 click trains were recorded in BB and 6 093 in IB. An inter-click interval < 10 ms (so called "feeding buzzes") was used as a proxy for foraging activity. The main difference in the acoustic parameters between the two habitats was related to the frequency spectrum, with higher maximum and lower modal and minimum click frequencies in BB, and a train frequency range of 17 kHz, against 10 kHz in IB. Also, the click emission rate (clicks/s) was almost 20% higher in BB. Both studied habitats showed a high proportion of feeding buzzes (BB = 68%; IB = 58%), but with a higher probability of occurrence in BB (p < 0.001) and at night (p < 0.001) in both habitats. The C-PODs showed great potential to monitor occurrence, bioacoustics parameters, and echolocation behavior of franciscana dolphins. Longer-term temporal and spatial monitoring are necessary for elucidating several issues raised in this study. (c) 2021 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two-stage classification strategies in detecting north Atlantic right whale upcalls. Time-frequency measurements of data from passive acoustic monitoring devices are evaluated as images. Vocalization spectrograms are preprocessed for noise reduction and tone removal. First stage of the algorithm eliminates non-upcalls by an energy detection algorithm. In the second stage, two sets of features are extracted from the remaining signals using contour-based.and texture based methods. The former is based on-extraction of time-frequency features from upcall contours, and the latter employs a Local Binary Pattern operator to extract distinguishing texture features of the upcalls. Subsequently evaluation phase is carried out by using several classifiers to assess the effectiveness of both the contour-based and texture-based features for upcall detection. Comparing ROC curves of machine learning algorithms obtained from Cornell University's dataset reveals that LBP features improved performance accuracy up to 43% over time-frequency features. Classifiers such as the Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and TreeBagger achieve highest upcall detection rates with LBP features.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas, have a graded call system; call types exist on a continuum making classification challenging. A description of vocalizations from the eastern Beaufort Sea beluga population during its spring migration are presented here, using both a non-parametric classification tree analysis (CART), and a Random Forest analysis. Twelve frequency and duration measurements were made on 1019 calls recorded over 14 days off Icy Cape, Alaska, resulting in 34 identifiable call types with 83% agreement in classification for both CART and Random Forest analyses. This high level of agreement in classification, with an initial subjective classification of calls into 36 categories, demonstrates that the methods applied here provide a quantitative analysis of a graded call dataset. Further, as calls cannot be attributed to individuals using single sensor passive acoustic monitoring efforts, these methods provide a comprehensive analysis of data where the influence of pseudo-replication of calls from individuals is unknown. This study is the first to describe the vocal repertoire of a beluga population using a robust and repeatable methodology. A baseline eastern Beaufort Sea beluga population repertoire is presented here, against which the call repertoire of other seasonally sympatric Alaskan beluga populations can be compared.

AB  - Marine mammals use sound for communication and echolocation within their ecosystems. The detection of these sounds is an important aspect of signal processing, such that we can estimate the spatial position and direction of arrival of these mammals, and have an understanding of their ecology. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is widely used to understand marine mammal movement and vocal repertoire. In PAM, datasets are accumulated over days, months or years. Thus, it is impracticable to manually analyse the datasets because it is very large. This motivated the development of automated sound detection techniques for marine mammals, which most often varies depending on the vocal duration, frequency range and call type. In this paper, continuous recordings of Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni edeni) short pulse calls (< 3.1s long) were collected on a weekly basis from December 2018 to April 2019 on sighting of the individual in a single site in the endmost South-West of South Africa. The sound, previously not documented off South Africa, was observed on visual confirmation of the presence of inshore Brydes's whale. In addition, the paper develops and analyses two automated template-based detection algorithms for this short pulse call, employing dynamic time warping (DTW) and linear predictive coding (LPC) techniques. These proposed template-based detectors are novel, as they have not being previously used in Bryde's whale sound detection in the literature. When applied to the continuous recordings of the short pulse calls, the DTW-based and LPC-based detection algorithms obtained a sensitivity of 96.04% and 97.14% respectively for high signal-tonoise ratio (about 10dB above the ambient sound). Otherwise, for low SNR, the DTW-based and LPC-based detection algorithms obtained a sensitivity of 94.98% and 96.00% respectively. These detection algorithms exhibit low computational time complexity and can be modified to analyse the movement of obscure but vocal marine species instead of manual identification.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a well-established tool for researching the occurrence, movements, and ecology of a wide variety of marine mammal species. Advances in hardware and data collection have exponentially increased the volumes of passive acoustic data collected, such that discoveries are now limited by the time required to analyze rather than collect the data. In order to address this limitation, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify humpback whale song in over 187,000 h of acoustic data collected at 13 different monitoring sites in the North Pacific over a 14-year period. The model successfully detected 75 s audio segments containing humpback song with an average precision of 0.97 and average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.992. The model output was used to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of humpback song, corroborating known seasonal patterns in the Hawaiian and Mariana Islands, including occurrence at remote monitoring sites beyond well-studied aggregations, as well as novel discovery of humpback whale song at Kingman Reef, at 5(circle) North latitude. This study demonstrates the ability of a CNN trained on a small dataset to generalize well to a highly variable signal type across a diverse range of recording and noise conditions. We demonstrate the utility of active learning approaches for creating high-quality models in specialized domains where annotations are rare. These results validate the feasibility of applying deep learning models to identify highly variable signals across broad spatial and temporal scales, enabling new discoveries through combining large datasets with cutting edge tools.

Geographic variation in the types and parameters of sounds makes regional assessment of vocal behaviour necessary. We describe the acoustic repertoire of a small population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting Walvis Bay, Namibia from recordings made over 59 encounters (72h) between 2009 and 2012. The characteristics of burst pulse (BP) sounds, low-frequency narrow-band (LFN) sounds, brays, whistles and chirps are described. The BP sounds identified were generated at 150-1050 pulses per second, and most were short, lasting less than 1s in duration. Bottlenose dolphins from Walvis Bay produce the lowest frequency LFN sounds described for the species. Whistles ranged in frequency from 1.58 to 23.24kHz, and the mean acoustic parameters were within the range of those described from other geographic regions. Chirps were identified infrequently and usually as single occurrences. Although several sound types were often produced in close temporal succession, we found little evidence of stereotyped bray production, even during recordings of animals feeding. Our results demonstrate geographic variation in both the characteristics and sound types used by bottlenose dolphins and highlight the importance of regional data collection as a pre-curser to passive acoustic monitoring programmes.

AB  - Assessments of the impact of offshore energy developments are constrained because it is not known whether fine-scale behavioural responses to noise lead to broader-scale displacement of protected small cetaceans. We used passive acoustic monitoring and digital aerial surveys to study changes in the occurrence of harbour porpoises across a 2000 km(2) study area during a commercial two-dimensional seismic survey in the North Sea. Acoustic and visual data provided evidence of group responses to air gun noise from the 470 cu inch array over ranges of 5-10 km, at received peak-to-peak sound pressure levels of 165-172 dB re 1 mu Pa and sound exposure levels (SELs) of 145-151 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s(-1). However, animals were typically detected again at affected sites within a few hours, and the level of response declined through the 10 day survey. Overall, acoustic detections decreased significantly during the survey period in the impact area compared with a control area, but this effect was small in relation to natural variation. These results demonstrate that prolonged seismic survey noise did not lead to broader-scale displacement into suboptimal or higher-risk habitats, and suggest that impact assessments should focus on sublethal effects resulting from changes in foraging performance of animals within affected sites.

AB  - All animals sleep and it is essential for maintaining optimal brain function. However, cetaceans engage in the unusual practice of unihemispherical sleep, where only half of their brain sleeps at a time, due to their constant need for movement and breathing. Most studies of sleep in cetaceans have occurred in captivity. However, tagging devices have now developed to the point where the data collected from wild animals can be assessed against published criteria for defining sleep behaviourally. Seven acoustic and behavioural data loggers were deployed on harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, in Danish waters between May 2010 and August 2011 and stayed on the animals between 53 and 72 h, recording 1884 to 2755 valid dives per animal. Parabolic dives with significantly reduced bioacoustic activity and a stereotyped behavioural pattern were identified as potential sleeping periods. The recordings for nearly half of the parabolic dives were found to contain no vocalization (echolocation clicks), significantly more than other dive types. Of the remaining parabolic dives, the click rate was, when normalized to their individual means, also significantly lower than detected in other dive types. Additionally, parabolic dives were shallow compared to all other dive types, and found to have a stereotypic low-energy profile. They were also found to contain fewer rolls and incorporate a lower vertical descent rate than most other dive types. If the data are representative, harbour porpoises spend a small, but meaningful amount of their diving time engaged in parabolic dives and thus potentially sleeping. All animals have a fundamental need for undisturbed sleep. These quiet periods thus need to be considered in studies of anthropogenic effects, but also those employing passive acoustic monitoring techniques, as well as in efforts to reduce incidental bycatch in fisheries, given the associated periods of reduced environmental awareness.

AB  - Soundscape ecology in the context of physical oceanographic features is an emerging area of research revealing interactions between physically, biologically and anthropogenically driven sounds and their sources. Sound-scapes can shape and reveal distributions of a range of species, from fish larvae to whales, within marine eco-systems. The northern Indian Ocean is a region of high environmental variability driven by seasonally reversing monsoonal winds. The mid-oceanic islands within these waters consist of steep slopes forming a crucial interface between shallow reef and deep oceanic habitats. Studies on soundscape are limited in these waters. The aim of this study was to characterize major sound sources off the southern and northern side of the Kavaratti atoll in Lakshadweep islands, India, located at the northern part of the Laccadive-Maldives-Chagos Ridge. A first look at shallow water soundscapes are provided here using passive acoustic monitoring, and how they correlate with satellite-derived oceanographic variables. Geophonic and biophonic sources across different frequency bands are identified with three major choruses - a dusk fish chorus, a midnight chorus that is speculated to be produced by myctophids, and a snapping shrimp night chorus. Low frequency biophonic choruses peaked in inter-monsoon months (January to March), while low frequency geophonic sound levels peaked during monsoon months (June to October) and increased with wind speed. The dusk fish chorus and the midnight chorus (at the south site) decreased with increasing sea surface salinity, while the snapping shrimp chorus (at the south site) increased with increasing sea surface salinity. Snapping shrimp chorus levels increased with decreasing wind speed. The dusk fish chorus peaked during full and waning moon, and the midnight and snapping shrimp choruses peaked during new moon periods. The sources and patterns described in this study will help compare with future soundscape and sound pressure level measurements within this region. This will be useful in the context of a changing climate and for planning future developmental projects on the islands. Reef choruses link with peak larval recruitment, spawning, or feeding activities, and further investigation into the peak calling times reported here will help uncover the function of choruses. Expanding the collection of passive acoustic monitoring data and oceanographic measurements over longer timescales will significantly advance 'soundscape oceanography'.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a cost-effective method for monitoring cetacean populations compared with techniques such as aerial and ship-based surveys. The Cetacean POrpoise Detector (C-POD) has become an integral tool in monitoring programs globally for over a decade, providing standardized metrics of occurrence that can be compared across time and space. However, the phasing out of C-PODs following the development of the new Full waveform capture POD (F-POD) with increased sensitivity, improved train detection, and reduced false-positive rates represents an important methodological change in data collection, particularly when being introduced into existing monitoring programs. Here, we compare the performance of the C-POD with that of its successor, the F-POD, co-deployed in a field setting for 15 months, to monitor harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). While similar temporal trends in detections were found for both devices, the C-POD detected only 58% of the detection-positive minutes (DPM), recorded by the F-POD. Differences in detection rates were not consistent through time making it difficult to apply a correction factor or directly compare results obtained from the two PODs. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to test whether these differences in detection rates would have an effect on analyses of temporal patterns and environmental drivers of occurrence. No differences were found in seasonal patterns or the environmental correlates of porpoise occurrence (month, diel period, temperature, environmental noise, and tide). However, the C-POD failed to detect sufficient foraging rates to identify temporal patterns in foraging behavior, which were shown by the F-POD. Our results suggest that the switch to F-PODs will have little effect on determining broad-scale seasonal patterns of occurrence but may improve our understanding of fine-scale behaviors such as foraging. We highlight how care must be taken interpreting F-POD results as indicative of increased occurrence when used in time-series analysis.

AB  - The study of sound in the natural environment provides interesting information for researchers and policy makers driving conservation policies in our society. The soundscape characterises the biophony, anthrophony and geophony of a particular area. The characterisation of these different sources can lead to changes in ecosystems and we need to identify these parameters in order to make the right decision in relation to the natural environment. These values could be extrapolated and potentially help different areas of ecoacoustic research. Technological advances have enabled the passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of animal populations in their natural environment. Recordings can be made with little interference, avoiding anthropogenic effects, making it a very effective method for some species such as cetaceans and other marine species in addition to underwater noise studies. Passive acoustic monitoring can be used for population census, but also to understand the effect of human activities on animals. However, recording data over long periods of time requires large storage and processing capacity to handle all the acoustic events generated. In the case of marine environments, the installation of sensors and instruments can be costly in terms of money and maintenance effort. In addition, if they are placed offshore, a data communication problem arises with coverage and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a low-cost instrument to monitor the soundscape of a marine area using ecoacoustic indices. The instrument is called MASE and provides three echo-acoustic indices at 10 min intervals that are available in real time, which drastically reduces the volume of data generated. It has been operating uninterruptedly for a year and a half since its deployment, except during maintenance periods. MASE has been able to operate uninterruptedly, and maintain an adequate temperature inside while preserving its structural integrity for long periods of time. This has allowed the monitoring and characterisation of the soundscape of the test area in Gando Bay, Gran Canaria Island (Spain) without the need for human intervention to access the data on the instrument itself. Thanks to its integration with an external server, this allows the long-term monitoring of the soundscape, and it is possible to observe changes in the soundscape. In addition, the instrument has made it possible to compare the period of acoustic inactivity during confinement and the return of anthropogenic acoustic activity at sea.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring with widely-dispersed hydrophones has been suggested as a costeffective method to monitor population densities of echolocating marine mammals. This requires an estimate of the area around each receiver over which vocalizations are detected-the "effective detection area" (EDA). In the absence of auxiliary measurements enabling estimation of the EDA, it can be modelled instead. Common simplifying model assumptions include approximating the spectrum of clicks by flat energy spectra, and neglecting the frequency-dependence of sound absorption within the click bandwidth (narrowband assumption), rendering the problem amenable to solution using the sonar equation. Here, it is investigated how these approximations affect the estimated EDA and their potential for biasing the estimated density. EDA was estimated using the passive sonar equation, and by applying detectors to simulated clicks injected into measurements of background noise. By comparing model predictions made using these two approaches for different spectral energy distributions of echolocation clicks, but identical click source energy level and detector settings, EDA differed by up to a factor of 2 for Blainville's beaked whales. Both methods predicted relative density bias due to narrowband assumptions ranged from 5% to more than 100%, depending on the species, detector settings, and noise conditions.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is an important tool in marine mammal studies. However, logistics and finances frequently constrain the number and servicing schedules of acoustic recorders, requiring a trade-off between deployment periods and sampling continuity, i.e., the implementation of a subsampling scheme. Optimizing such schemes to each project's specific research questions is desirable. This study investigates the impact of subsampling on the accuracy of two common metrics, acoustic presence and call rate, for different vocalization patterns (regimes) of baleen whales: (1) variable vocal activity, (2) vocalizations organized in song bouts, and (3) vocal activity with diel patterns. To this end, above metrics are compared for continuous and subsampled data subject to different sampling strategies, covering duty cycles between 50% and 2%. The results show that a reduction of the duty cycle impacts negatively on the accuracy of both acoustic presence and call rate estimates. For a given duty cycle, frequent short listening periods improve accuracy of daily acoustic presence estimates over few long listening periods. Overall, subsampling effects are most pronounced for low and/or temporally clustered vocal activity. These findings illustrate the importance of informed decisions when applying subsampling strategies to passive acoustic recordings or analyses for a given target species. (C) 2015 Author(s).

AB  - The Cumberland Sound (Nunavut, Canada) beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)) population has been designated as threatened and updated biological information about summer distribution is required for a sound recovery plan. Variation in aerial survey counts are speculated to occur due to movement of belugas in and out of the fiord, and there is still uncertainty related to their distribution within key summer habitat. To address these knowledge gaps, non-invasive passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems were deployed in August of 2010 and 2011. An automated detector was used to determine presence/absence and quantify calls by recorder site. Results were verified by partial manual analysis of 20% of the files. The detector had a minimum accuracy of 85% for presence/ absence and 42% for call quantification. Belugas were detected primarily at the uppermost site of Clearwater Fiord, with detections subsiding with increasing proximity to the fiord entrance. Diel variation in call patterns were quantified at two separate sites in different years, but no correlation was observed between tidal cycles and number of detections. This study indicates that Cumberland Sound beluga may prefer sites at the head of Clearwater Fiord. Further research is required to identify which environmental variables contribute to this observed summer distribution.

AB  - Acoustically equipped deep-water mobile autonomous platforms can be used to survey for marine mammals over intermediate spatiotemporal scales. Direct comparisons to fixed recorders are necessary to evaluate these tools as passive acoustic monitoring platforms. One glider and two drifting deep-water floats were simultaneously deployed within a deep-water cabled hydrophone array to quantitatively assess their survey capabilities. The glider was able to follow a pre-defined track while float movement was somewhat unpredictable. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 20 Hz pulses were recorded by all hydrophones throughout the two-week deployment. Calls were identified using a template detector, which performed similarly across recorder types. The glider data contained up to 78% fewer detections per hour due to increased low-frequency flow noise present during glider descents. The glider performed comparably to the floats and fixed recorders at coarser temporal scales; hourly and daily presence of detections did not vary by recorder type. Flow noise was related to glider speed through water and dive state. Glider speeds through water of 25 cm/s or less are suggested to minimize flow noise and the importance of glider ballasting, detector characterization, and normalization by effort when interpreting glider-collected data and applying it to marine mammal density estimation are discussed.

AB  - The impact of shipping noise on marine life and quality of marine mammal habitats in oceans and coastal environments has become a major concern worldwide. Background noise can also limits detection of marine mammal sounds in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems. Characterisation of this noise over long time periods and estimates of the exposure of the different marine mammal groups are still very fragmentary and limited to only a few locations. This paper presents such observations for a part of a busy seaway of North America, the St. Lawrence Seaway, which cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and crosses several cetaceans and pinnipeds feeding areas. Noise was continuously recorded for a 5-month period in summer 2005 by an AURAL autonomous hydrophone deployed close to the bottom in the 300-m deep seaway. The maximum received noise level in the 20 Hz-0.9 kHz band reached 136 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms. The median level of 112 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms was exceeded 50% of the time due to transiting merchant ships. Median spectral level tracks the reference curve for heavy traffic in oceans and 50% of the noise is within a +/- 6 dB envelope around it. Strong spectral lines were common at low frequencies and in the 400-800 Hz band. M-weighting functions applied for the three groups of cetaceans and pinnipeds indicate wideband median levels varying from 106 to 112 dB-M re 1 mu Pa-rms surrounded by a +/- 5 dB two-quartile interval. Higher values are expected for animals frequenting the sound channel at intermediate depths. As expected, the highest M-weighting levels correspond to low-frequency specialists and pinnipeds. Criteria for assessing the behavioural and physiological impacts of long term exposure of marine mammals to such shipping noise levels need to be worked out.

AB  - In bioacoustics, passive acoustic monitoring of animals living in the wild, both on land and underwater, leads to large data archives characterized by a strong imbalance between recorded animal sounds and ambient noises. Bioacoustic datasets suffer extremely from such large noise-variety, caused by a multitude of external influences and changing environmental conditions over years. This leads to significant deficiencies/problems concerning the analysis and interpretation of animal vocalizations by biologists and machine-learning algorithms. To counteract such huge noise diversity, it is essential to develop a denoising procedure enabling automated, efficient, and robust data enhancement. However, a fundamental problem is the lack of clean/denoised ground-truth samples. The current work is the first presenting a fully-automated deep denoising approach for bioacoustics, not requiring any clean ground-truth, together with one of the largest data archives recorded on killer whales (Orcinus Orca) - the Orchive. Therefor, an approach, originally developed for image restoration, known as Noise2Noise (N2N), was transferred to the field of bioacoustics, and extended by using automatic machine-generated binary masks as additional network attention mechanism. Besides a significant cross-domain signal enhancement, our previous results regarding supervised orca/noise segmentation and orca call type identification were outperformed by applying ORCA-CLEAN as additional data preprocessing/enhancement step.

AB  - The distribution of odontocetes on a daily scale is largely driven by bottom-up processes that in turn influence foraging opportunities. Environmental variables such as bathymetry may help indicate productive foraging regions and serve as useful tools when assessing dolphin spatial and temporal patterns. To begin to understand daily spatial patterns of different odontocete species relative to heterogeneous benthic habitat, passive acoustic monitoring was conducted near an understudied basin of the Hawaiian Islands, the MauiNui region (Maui, Lana'i, Kaho' olawe, Moloka'i). Results showed that the acoustic activity of smaller species was stronger at night than day, particularly closer to shelf waters. In contrast, the acoustic activity of less common larger species tended not to follow a diel pattern, except at sites of a moderate proximity to shelf waters. These findings support previous research showing that smaller odontocetes, such as spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris), track and feed upon the daily vertically migrating mesopelagic boundary community at night, while larger odontocetes, such as false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), may forage across most of the region during both the day and night. This information will help inform best management practices that account for interspecies variation in use of the Maui Nui basin.

AB  - Increased knowledge about marine mammal seasonal distribution and species assemblage from the South Orkney Islands waters is needed for the development of management regulations of the commercial fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in this region. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data were collected during the autumn and winter seasons in two consecutive years (2016, 2017), which represented highly contrasting environmental conditions due to the 2016 El Nino event. We explored differences in seasonal patterns in marine mammal acoustic presence between the two years in context of environmental cues and climate variability. Acoustic signals from five baleen whale species, two pinniped species and odontocete species were detected and separated into guilds. Although species diversity remained stable over time, the ice-avoiding and ice-affiliated species dominated before and after the onset of winter, respectively, and thus demonstrating a shift in guild composition related to season. Herein, we provide novel information about local marine mammal species diversity, community structure and residency times in a krill hotspot. Our study also demonstrates the utility of PAM data and its usefulness in providing new insights into the marine mammal habitat use and responses to environmental conditions, which are essential knowledge for the future development of a sustainable fishery management in a changing ecosystem.

AB  - Marine animals use sound for communication, navigation, predator avoidance, and prey detection. Thus the rise in acoustic energy associated with increasing human activity in the ocean has potential to impact the lives of marine animals. Thirty years ago marine bioacoustics primarily focused on evaluating effects of human-generated sound on hearing and behavior by testing captive animals and visually observing wild animals. Since that time rapidly changing electronic and computing technologies have yielded three tools that revolutionized how bioacousticians study marine animals. These tools are (1) portable systems for measuring electrophysiological auditory evoked potentials, (2) miniaturized tags equipped with positioning sensors and acoustic recording devices for continuous short-term acoustical observation rather than intermittent visual observation, and (3) passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems for remote long-term acoustic observations at specific locations. The beauty of these breakthroughs is their direct applicability to wild animals in natural habitats rather than only to animals held in captivity. Hearing capabilities of many wild species including polar bears, beaked whales, and reef fishes have now been assessed by measuring their auditory evoked potentials. Miniaturized acoustic tags temporarily attached to an animal to record its movements and acoustic environment have revealed the acoustic foraging behavior of sperm and beaked whales. Now tags are being adapted to fishes in effort to understand their behavior in the presence of noise. Moving and static PAM systems automatically detect and characterize biological and physical features of an ocean area without adding any acoustic energy to the environment. PAM is becoming a powerful technique for understanding and managing marine habitats. This paper will review the influence of these transformative tools on the knowledge base of marine bioacoustics and elucidation of relationships between marine animals and their acoustic environment, leading to a new, rapidly growing field of marine acoustic ecology.

AB  - The detection and classification of Mysticetes' vocalisations have evoked the attention of researchers over the years because of their relevance to the marine ecosystem. These vocalisations are gathered employing different passive acoustic monitoring techniques. The vocalisation datasets are accumulated over a period; thus, they are large and cannot be easily analysed manually. Consequently, efficient machine learning (ML) tools such as the hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used extensively to automatically detect and classify these huge vocalisation datasets. As with most ML tools, the detection efficiency of the HMMs depend on the adopted feature extraction technique. Feature extraction techniques such as the Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), linear predictive coefficient (LPC), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) have been adopted with the HMMs to detect different Mysticetes' vocalisations. This article introduces the method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) as a feature extraction technique that can be adopted with the HMMs for the detection of Mysticetes' vocalisations. The DMD has emerged as a robust tool for analysing the dynamics of non-stationary and non-linear signals. It is a completely data-driven tool that decomposes a signal over a certain period of time into relevant modes. Here, these spatial-temporal modes are reconstructed mathematically to form reliable feature vectors of the decomposed vocalisation signals. The performance of the proposed DMD-HMM detection technique is demonstrated using the acoustic datasets of two different Mysticetes' vocalisations: Humpback whale songs and Inshore Bryde's whale short pulse calls. In both species, the proposed DMD-HMM exhibits superior sensitivity and false discovery rate performances as compared to the MFCC-HMM, LPC-HMM, and EMD-HMM detection methods. Likewise, this proposed DMD-HMM detection method can be extended to other Mysticetes' that produce characteristics sounds.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a promising method for surveying wildlife populations that are easier to detect acoustically than visually. When animal vocalisations can be uniquely identified on an array of sensors, the potential exists to estimate population density through acoustic spatial capture-recapture (ASCR). However, sound classification is imperfect, and in some situations, a high proportion of sounds detected on just a single sensor ('singletons') are not from the target species. We present a case study of bowhead whale calls (Baleana mysticetus) collected in the Beaufort Sea in 2010 containing such false positives. We propose a novel extension of ASCR that is robust to false positives by truncating singletons and conditioning on calls being detected by at least two sensors. We allow for individual-level detection heterogeneity through modelling a variable sound source level, model inhomogeneous call spatial density, and include bearings with varying measurement error. We show via simulation that the method produces near-unbiased estimates when correctly specified. Ignoring source-level variation resulted in a strong negative bias, while ignoring inhomogeneous density resulted in severe positive bias. The case study analysis indicated a band of higher call density approximately 30 km from shore; 59.8% of singletons were estimated to have been false positives.

AB  - This work examines the impact of the dynamic soundscape on estimates of the signal detection area (DA) of passive acoustic monitoring stations. The range of signal detection was investigated at three site locations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System (CTBTO IMS). Transmission loss to each hydrophone was computed using the OASIS Peregrine parabolic equation model for a source within the upper 300 m of the water column to be consistent with the hypothesized location of vocalizing baleen whales. Seasonal, monthly, and daily soundscape measurements were incorporated into the sonar equation to estimate the variability in signal DA as a function of sound level and time As a comparison, the seasonal analysis was repeated with a constant noise level to quantify the extent of variability due solely to changes in the seasonal sound speed profile. The greatest DA variability was observed at the Wake Island location in the Pacific Ocean where only a maximum of 18% of the 71 to 85% difference in DA estimates across seasons was attributable to changes in the sound speed profile. Differences in the daily DA estimate distributions as a function of frequency and location illustrate the impact of local sound field dynamics on the overall soundscape and the resulting signal detection range.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is an important tool for studying marine mammals. Ocean bottom seismometer networks provide data sets of opportunity for studying blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) which vocalize extensively at seismic frequencies. We describe methods to localize calls and obtain tracks using the B call of northeast Pacific blue whale recorded by a large network of widely spaced ocean bottom seismometers off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The first harmonic of the B call at similar to 15 Hz is detected using spectrogram cross-correlation. The seasonality of calls, inferred from a dataset of calls identified by an analyst, is used to estimate the probability that detections are true positives as a function of the strength of the detection. Because the spacing of seismometers reaches 70 km, faint detections with a significant probability of being false positives must be considered in multi-station localizations. Calls are located by maximizing a likelihood function which considers each strong detection in turn as the earliest arrival time and seeks to fit the times of detections that follow within a feasible time and distance window. An alternative procedure seeks solutions based on the detections that maximize their sum after weighting by detection strength and proximity. Both approaches lead to many spurious solutions that can mix detections from different B calls and include false detections including misidentified A calls. Tracks that are reliable can be obtained iteratively by assigning detections to localizations that are grouped in space and time, and requiring groups of at least 20 locations. Smooth paths are fit to tracks by including constraints that minimize changes in speed and direction while fitting the locations to their uncertainties or applying the double difference relocation method. The reliability of localizations for future experiments might be improved by increasing sampling rates and detecting harmonics of the B call.

AB  - Multi-sensor observations, integrated across time and space, may bridge knowledge gaps in ecosystem dynamics, one aspect of which is species co-occurrence. In the present work, we combined data streams from 2 acoustic technologies; passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and acoustic telemetry (AT) jointly installed under the LifeWatch project. We made use of existing long-term data series from studies on single-species dynamics, to investigate the co-occurrence of multiple species: European seabass, Atlantic cod and cetaceans (harbour porpoise and dolphins), in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Common co-occurrence analyses were applied to a combined PAM and AT hourly presence-absence matrix at different spatial and temporal resolutions. The fish species were in the presence of harbour porpoise at least one-third (seabass) to nearly half (cod) of the time they were detected. At a seasonal resolution, we did not observe probabilities of occupancy to be higher or lower than what is expected by chance, while we could discern patterns of co-occurrence when using an hourly resolution. Analyses done at an hourly resolution showed that porpoises have a significantly higher probability of co-occurrence with cod or seabass during autumn and winter nights. Developing these large-scale networks of integrated acoustic instruments while considering species co-occurrences would further expand data applicability. Considering co-occurrence in ecological research is a step towards ecosystem-based management of our oceans.

AB  - Incidental mortality (bycatch) in gillnet fisheries is a major threat to many cetacean populations. Acoustic alarms or pingers are a widely adopted management tool used to deter dolphins and porpoises from nets; however, their efficacy is largely species- and fishery-dependent. As such, results from experimental trials may have limited transferability to poorly studied species or fisheries. Here, we investigated the effect of pingers on the behaviour of Burmeister's porpoise Phocoena spinipinnis in the vicinity of the Peruvian small-scale driftnet fleet. Over a 4 yr period (2009-2012), 116 control (without pingers) and 94 experimental (with pingers) fishing sets were observed, and porpoise acoustic activity around nets was recorded using passive acoustic loggers (C-PODs). We modelled variation in detection rates as a function of pinger use and habitat covariates, and found that in regions of preferred habitat associated with cooler (17-18 degrees C), shallow waters (within the 100 m isobath), the use of pingers lead to an 86% reduction in porpoise activity around nets. Our results suggest that pingers are likely to be particularly effective at deterring Burmeister's porpoises from fishing nets, and given the vast capacity of this and other fleets in the region, may substantially reduce mortality. This study also emphasizes the potential of passive acoustic monitoring to determine the effectiveness of bycatch mitigation measures, both for species for which visual observations are scarce, and also in regions where gathering statistically meaningful bycatch rates is logistically challenging.

AB  - Acoustic monitoring of cetaceans was conducted using two buoyancy-driven AUVs in a deep-water canyon north of the Navy's QUTR range off the Washington coast in April 2015. The two AUVs operated were the acoustically-equipped QUEphone, which is an APEX (TM)-based acoustic profiler float from Teledyne Webb, and the Seaglider (TM) from Kongsberg. A passive acoustic monitoring device, WISPR, from Embedded Ocean Systems (EOS) was installed on both AUVs. With one 512-GB CF card and level-2 Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), WISPR recorded sound continuously for 12 days at a 125 kHz sampling rate with 16-bit resolution. The Sealider's record showed high levels of flow noise below 100 Hz during ascent, 16 dB higher than during the descent. The Seaglider's CTD generated 1-sec long line noise at 53.37 kHz at 5 to 10 sec intervals, while the Seaglider's mass shifter generated 3-sec long band-limited noise below 10 kHz. The QUEphone's acoustic record was generally quieter than the Seaglider primarily due to the fact that it is nearly stationary platform with less mechanical and electrical components to generate system noise. Despite higher system noise levels, the Seaglider detected twice as many calls/clicks resulting from its ability to actively stay in the target area where the population density of marine mammals was higher, while the QUEphone drifted away from the target area with the prevailing ocean currents.

AB  - Simple Summary Death-related behaviors have been often observed in cetaceans, frequently with a female caregiver (presumed mother) supporting a dead calf by carrying, lifting, or sinking it, generally accompanied by other escorting individuals. However, how cetaceans experience death and if their behavior could be compared to human grieving is still largely unknown, as well as their acoustic production in such contexts. This report describes two cases of an adult common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) supporting a dead newborn and associated acoustic behavior in the Tiber River estuary area (Rome, Mediterranean Sea, Italy). In both cases, a main supporter (putative mother) was observed interacting with the carcass of a newborn by lifting (case 1) and sinking it (case 2), always escorted by another adult individual. Several vocalizations were recorded, including a signature whistle (a tonal sound with a repeated, stereotyped, individual-specific frequency modulation pattern) in the first case, likely emitted by the putative mother to seek aid from other individuals. This result appears reasonable since bottlenose dolphins are a highly vocal species, that communicates mainly through acoustic signals. These observations confirm the occurrence of death-related supportive behavior in bottlenose dolphins and report a preliminary description of associated vocalizations, providing additional information on this largely unknown topic. Epimeletic behavior toward dead calves has been frequently reported in cetaceans, mostly with females (presumed mothers) showing supportive behaviors such as carrying, lifting, or sinking, often assisted by "escort" individuals. However, information on acoustic production in such contexts is scarce. This report describes two observations of epimeletic behavior toward dead newborns in bottlenose dolphins and associated acoustic production. Data were collected at the Tiber River estuary (Rome, Mediterranean Sea, Italy) with one hydrophone for passive acoustic monitoring and two digital cameras. In both cases, an individual (presumed mother) acting as the main supporter and directly interacting with the carcass by lifting it (case 1) or sinking it (case 2) was observed. Another adult individual (escort) was present in both encounters showing standing-by and excitement behaviors (case 1) and supportive behavior (case 2). In both encounters, whistles, pulsed sounds, and bray-call elements were recorded. The consistent vocal activity observed likely conveyed context-specific information. A signature whistle in the first encounter was also recorded, likely emitted by the putative mother as a distress call. This report confirms the occurrence of epimeletic behavior in bottlenose dolphins and reports a preliminary description of the acoustic production when a dead calf is involved, providing additional information on this largely unknown topic.

AB  - Marine habitat heterogeneity underpins species distribution and can be generated through interactions between physical and biological drivers at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used worldwide to study potential impacts of marine industrial activities on cetaceans, but understanding of animals' site use at small spatiotemporal scales (< 1 km, < 1 day) remains limited. Small-scale variability in vocalising harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) distribution within two Scottish marine renewable energy development (MRED) sites was investigated by deploying dense arrays of C-POD passive acoustic detectors at a wave energy test site (the European Marine Energy Centre [Billia Croo, Orkney]) and by a minor tidal-stream site (Scarba [Inner Hebrides]). Respective arrays consisted of 7 and 11 moorings containing two C-PODs each and were deployed for up to 55 days. Minimum inter mooring distances varied between similar to 300-600 m. All C-POD data were analysed at a temporal resolution of whole minutes, with each minute classified as 1 or 0 on the basis of presence/absence of porpoise click trains (Porpoise-Positive Minutes/PPMs). Porpoise detection rates were analysed using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) with Generalised Estimation Equations (GEES).
   Although there were many porpoise detections (wave test site: N=3,432; tidal-stream site: N=17,366), daily detection rates varied significantly within both arrays. Within the wave site array (< 1 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 43 to 14.8 PPMs/day. Within the tidal stream array (< 2 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 10.3 to 49.7 PPMs/day. GAM-GEE model results for individual moorings within both arrays indicated linkages between porpoise presence and small-scale heterogeneity among different environmental covariates (e.g., tidal phase, time of day). Porpoise detection rates varied considerably but with coherent patterns between moorings only several hundred metres apart and within hours. These patterns presumably have ecological relevance.
   These results indicate that, in energetically active and heterogeneous areas, porpoises can display significant spatiotemporal variability in site use at scales of hundreds of metres and hours. Such variability will not be identified when using solitary moored PAM detectors (a common practice for site-based cetacean monitoring), but may be highly relevant for site-based impact assessments of MRED and other coastal developments. PAM arrays encompassing several detectors spread across a site therefore appear to be a more appropriate tool to study site-specific cetacean use of spatiotemporally heterogeneous habitat and assess the potential impacts of coastal and nearshore developments at small scales.

AB  - Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are highly social Arctic toothed whales with large vocal repertoires and similar acoustic profiles. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) that uses multiple hydrophones over large spatiotemporal scales has been a primary method to study their populations, particularly in response to rapid climate change and increasing underwater noise. This study marks the first acoustic comparison between wild belugas and narwhals from the same location and reveals that they can be acoustically differentiated and classified solely by echolocation clicks. Acoustic recordings were made in the pack ice of Baffin Bay, West Greenland, during 2013. Multivariate analyses and Random Forests classification models were applied to eighty-one single-species acoustic events comprised of numerous echolocation clicks. Results demonstrate a significant difference between species' acoustic parameters where beluga echolocation was distinguished by higher frequency content, evidenced by higher peak frequencies, center frequencies, and frequency minimums and maximums. Spectral peaks, troughs, and center frequencies for beluga clicks were generally > 60 kHz and narwhal clicks < 60 kHz with overlap between 40-60 kHz. Classification model predictive performance was strong with an overall correct classification rate of 97.5% for the best model. The most important predictors for species assignment were defined by peaks and notches in frequency spectra. Our results provide strong support for the use of echolocation in PAM efforts to differentiate belugas and narwhals acoustically.

AB  - A simple passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) setup was used to localize and track beluga whales underwater in three dimensions (3D) in a fiord. In June 2009, beluga clicks were recorded from a cabled hydrophone array in a regularly frequented habitat in Eastern Canada. Beluga click energy was concentrated in the 30-50 kHz frequency band. The click trains detected on several hydrophones were localized from their time difference of arrivals. Cluster analysis linked localizations into tracks based on criteria of spatial and temporal proximity. At close ranges from the array, the localized click-train series allowed three-dimensional tracking of a beluga during its dive. Clicks within a train spanned a large range of durations, inter-click intervals, source levels and bandwidths. Buzzes sometimes terminated the trains. Repeated click packets were frequent. All click characteristics are consistent with oblique observations from the beam axis, and ordered variation of the source pattern during a train, likely resulting from a scan of angles from the beam axis, was observed before click trains indicated focusing of the echolocation clicks in one direction. The click-train series is interpreted as echolocation chasing for preys during a foraging dive. Results show that a simple PAM system can be configured to passively and effectively 3D track wild belugas and small odontocetes in their regularly frequented habitat. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Narwhal acoustic phonation is embedded in the icy cacophony of one of the noisiest soundscapes in the ocean. The high susceptibility of the narwhal to climate change highlights the need for further efforts to document baseline descriptions of the sounds it produces, especially given the potential anthropogenic impacts on their habitats. However, observations are rare, and narwhal acoustic behavior and habitats are poorly understood (attributed to both the skittish nature of hard-to-approach narwhals and the difficult access to remote and often dangerous glacier fjords). Here, we provide acoustic measurements in a narwhal summering ground in glacial fjords in Northwest Greenland that were mainly collected during Inuit hunting expeditions. This unique observational strategy near a key narwhal hot spot allowed the acquisition of supervised near-source recordings of narwhal vocalizations, which confirms the animal's presence within several hundred meters of an actively calving Bowdoin Glacier. We accurately describe the acoustic signals and noise related to the cetacean, environmental, and anthropogenic sources, show previously unreported signals and their properties, report elevated background noise levels near the calving front, and discuss the general soundscape features of a glacier fjord. The baseline information presented here should encourage long-term follow-up acoustic monitoring in the area and provides an important reference for comparisons with future conditions and other regions. We also anticipate that our work will be a starting point both for the development of criteria to distinguish pulsed calls from terminal buzzes and for a thorough discussion of the dual use of passive acoustic monitoring in traditional hunting practices.

AB  - The Yangtze River exhibits a high biodiversity and plays an important role in global biodiversity conservation. As the world's busiest inland river in regard to shipping, little attention has been paid to underwater noise pollution. In 2017, the underwater noise level in 25 riverside locations along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River mainly at night time were investigated by using passive acoustic monitoring method. Approximately 88% and 40% of the sampled sites exhibit noise levels exceeding the underwater acoustic thresholds of causing responsiveness and temporary threshold shift, respectively, in cetacean. Noise pollution may impose a high impact on fish with physostomous swim bladders and Weberian ossicles, such as silver carp, bighead carp, goldfish and common carp, whereas it may affect fish with physoclistous swim bladders and without Weberian ossicles, such as lake sturgeon and paddlefish, to a lesser extent. Noise levels reductions of approximately 10 and 20 dB were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively, of the Yangtze River over the 2012 level. The green development mode of the ongoing construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, including the development of green shipping lanes, ports, ships and transportation organizations, may account for the alleviated underwater noise pollution. Follow-up noise mitigation endeavors, such as the extension of ship speed restrictions and the study and implementation of the optimal navigation speed in ecologically important areas, are required to further reduce the noise level in the Yangtze River to protect local porpoises and fish.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used for many vocal species. However, few studies have quantified the fraction of vocalisations captured, and how animal distance and sound source level affect detection probability. Quantifying the detection probability or effective detection area (EDA) of a recorder is a prerequisite for designing and implementing monitoring studies, and essential for estimating absolute density and abundance from PAM data. We tested the detector performance of cetacean click loggers (C-PODs) using artificial and recorded harbour porpoise clicks played at a range of distances and source levels. Detection rate of individual clicks and click sequences (or click trains) was calculated. A Generalised Additive Model (GAM) was used to create a detection function and estimate the effective detection radius (EDR) and EDA for both types of signals. Source level and distance from logger influenced the detection probability. Whilst differences between loggers were evident, detectability was influenced more by the deployment site than within-logger variability. Maximum distance for detecting real recorded porpoise clicks was 566 m. Mean EDR for artificial signals with source level 176 dB re 1 mu Pa @ 1m was 187 m., and for a recorded vocalisation with source level up to 182 dB re 1 mu Pa was 188 m. For detections classified as harbour porpoise click sequences the mean EDR was 72 m. The analytical methods presented are a valid technique for estimating the EDA of any logger used in abundance estimates. We present a practical way to obtain data with a cetacean click logger, with the caveat that artificial playbacks cannot mimic real animal behaviour and are at best able to account for some of the variability in detections between sites, removing logger and propagation effects so that what remains is density and behavioural differences. If calibrated against real-world EDAs (e.g., from tagged animals) it is possible to estimate site-specific detection area and absolute density. We highlight the importance of accounting for both biological and environmental factors affecting vocalisations so that accurate estimates of detection area can be determined, and effective monitoring regimes implemented.

AB  - High-throughput environmental sensing technologies are increasingly central to global monitoring of the ecological impacts of human activities. In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.

AB  - The acoustic performance and behaviour of free-ranging cetaceans requires investigation under natural conditions to understand how wild animals use sound. This is also useful to develop quantitative evaluation techniques for passive acoustic monitoring. There have been limited studies on the acoustics of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin; nevertheless, this species is of particular concern because of the anthropogenic activity in the coastal habitats. In the present study, we used a four-hydrophone array to estimate the apparent source levels (ASLs) of biosonar sequences (click trains), of this species in San-Niang Bay, China. As the dolphins approached the array, 173 click trains were found to meet the criteria of on-axis sounds produced within 60 m of the equipment. In total, 121 unclipped click trains were used for the ASL estimation. The qualified click trains contained 36.3 +/- 32.5 clicks, lasting for 1.5 +/- 1.5 s, with average inter-click intervals (ICIs) of 51.2 +/- 38.3 ms. Average ICIs showed a bimodal distribution, with a cut-off at 20 ms. Short-range click trains, with short ICIs of,20 ms on average, were characterized by smaller ASLs, relatively stable ICIs and a shorter click train duration. The mean back-calculated ASL for humpback dolphins with an approximately maximum body size of 2.5 m was 181.7 +/- 7.0 dB re 1 mu Pa at a distance of 1.6-57.2 m. This value was comparable to that recorded for other dolphins of similar body size, although the ASL estimates obtained in this study might be conservative.

AB  - An automated algorithm for passive acoustic detection of blue whale D-calls was developed based on established deep learning methods for image recognition via the DenseNet architecture. The detector was trained on annotated acoustic recordings from the Antarctic, and performance of the detector was assessed by calculating precision and recall using a separate independent dataset also from the Antarctic. Detections from both the human analyst and automated detector were then inspected by an independent judge to identify any calls missed by either approach and to adjudicate whether the apparent false-positive detections from the automated approach were actually true positives. A final performance assessment was conducted using double-observer methods (via a closed-population Huggins mark-recapture model) to assess the probability of detection of calls by both the human analyst and automated detector, based on the assumption of false-positive-free adjudicated detections. According to our double-observer analysis, the automated detector showed superior performance with higher recall and fewer false positives than the original human analyst, and with performance similar to existing top automated detectors. To understand the performance of both detectors we inspected the time-series and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detections for the test dataset, and found that most of the advantages from the automated detector occurred at low and medium SNR.

AB  - Various methods for estimating animal density from visual data, including distance sampling (DS) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR), have recently been adapted for estimating call density using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data, e.g., recordings of animal calls. Here we summarize three methods available for passive acoustic density estimation: plot sampling, DS, and SECR. The first two require distances from the sensors to calling animals (which are obtained by triangulating calls matched among sensors), but SECR only requires matching (not localizing) calls among sensors. We compare via simulation what biases can arise when assumptions underlying these methods are violated. We use insights gleaned from the simulation to compare the performance of the methods when applied to a case study: bowhead whale call data collected from arrays of directional acoustic sensors at five sites in the Beaufort Sea during the fall migration 2007-2014. Call detections were manually extracted from the recordings by human observers simultaneously scanning spectrograms of recordings from a given site. The large discrepancies between estimates derived using SECR and the other two methods were likely caused primarily by the manual detection procedure leading to non-independent detections among sensors, while errors in estimated distances between detected calls and sensors also contributed to the observed patterns. Our study is among the first to provide a direct comparison of the three methods applied to PAM data and highlights the importance that all assumptions of an analysis method need to be met for correct inference.

AB  - Understanding drivers of habitat use and selection of mobile species is critical for understanding the impacts of climate change and formulating management plans. Eastern Beaufort Sea beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas form large summering aggregations in the warm, fresh waters of the Mackenzie Estuary, Northwest Territories, Canada; however, the environmental factors driving spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use within the estuary are not fully understood. We used passive acoustic monitoring to record beluga presence during their summer aggregation (June-August) at known congregation areas and locations with unique oceanographic features in Kugmallit Bay in the Mackenzie River Estuary, while simultaneously recording environmental and oceanographic data. The effectiveness of hydrophones at determining beluga presence/absence was validated using shore-based observations. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the influence of environmental conditions on presence/absence of belugas. Results indicate that temporal patterns of habitat use varied by location, and were influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, and wind speed. Belugas did not frequent commonly used locations during periods with high-speed winds and moved farther into the estuary during periods of cold oceanic influxes. This study provides support for hypotheses that belugas use the location for moulting or to provide a thermal advantage for young belugas. This information can be used to inform decisions by northern communities and policy makers, thus aiding in management of the Beaufort Sea beluga population.

AB  - To develop a passive acoustic monitoring system for diversity detection and thereby adapt to the challenges of a complex marine environment, this study harnesses the advantages of empirical mode decomposition in analyzing nonstationary signals and introduces energy characteristics analysis and entropy of information theory to detect marine mammal vocalizations. The proposed detection algorithm has five main steps: sampling, energy characteristics analysis, marginal frequency distribution, feature extraction, and detection, which involve four signal feature extraction and analysis algorithms: energy ratio distribution (ERD), energy spectrum distribution (ESD), energy spectrum entropy distribution (ESED), and concentrated energy spectrum entropy distribution (CESED). In an experiment on 500 sampled signals (blue whale vocalizations), in the competent intrinsic mode function (IMF2) signal feature extraction function distribution of ERD, ESD, ESED, and CESED, the areas under the curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.4621, 0.6162, 0.3894, and 0.8979, respectively; the Accuracy scores were 49.90%, 60.40%, 47.50%, and 80.84%, respectively; the Precision scores were 31.19%, 44.89%, 29.44%, and 68.20%, respectively; the Recall scores were 42.83%, 57.71%, 36.00%, and 84.57%, respectively; and the F1 scores were 37.41%, 50.50%, 32.39%, and 75.51%, respectively, based on the threshold of the optimal estimated results. It is clear that the CESED detector outperforms the other three detectors in signal detection and achieves efficient sound detection of marine mammals.

AB  - To understand the biosonar click characteristics of Ganges river dolphins (adults, young adults, and calves) in a wild environment along with periodic visual observations, an ongoing program for long-term in situ monitoring has been carried out using a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) system. During monitoring phase 4 (2012), migrating Ganges river dolphin groups with small calves were visually observed, and click trains having a short interclick interval (ICI: from 6 to 12 ms) were concurrently found from the acoustic data corresponding to the period. Click trains having a short ICI have also been observed in other small-toothed whales during foraging and socializing activities (called buzz) (Thoms, Moss, & Vater, 2004; Simard & Mann, 2008). For analysis of the short ICI click trains produced by the Ganges river dolphins, an advanced technique that automatically detects and discriminates a short ICI click train from other click sequences during the selected periods of data recorded by a PAM system was developed. For a robust algorithm, a smaller mean ICI caused by overlapping click trains from multiple dolphins that fulfill the range of ICI values that may get incorrectly labeled as short ICI click train was considered to judiciously detect a reliable click train. By applying the selected parameters and ICI values (default or given), the performance of the proposed technique was demonstrated using sample data. The results showed the reliability of the technique for the extraction of a variety of short ICI click trains from other click trains.

AB  - Two populations of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) migrate annually between their summering grounds in the eastern Chukchi and eastern Beaufort Seas, and overwintering areas in the Bering Sea. To contribute to the understanding of migratory streams of this highly vocal species, we investigated temporal peaks in acoustic detections from 4-year-long (2010-2011) recorders located in the northeastern Chukchi (inshore and offshore), western Beaufort, and northern Bering Seas. Beluga calls were detected throughout summer (July-August) in the western Beaufort; other studies suggest these animals are likely from the eastern Chukchi population. In autumn (September-November), calls were detected in the western Beaufort and northeastern Chukchi, which were likely from both the eastern Beaufort and eastern Chukchi populations. A strong peak at the inshore northeastern Chukchi site occurred in late-November; this peak is likely to be from the eastern Chukchi population. During spring, beluga calls were detected in the northeastern Chukchi and western Beaufort in two distinct vocal peaks (early-and late-May). The timing was consistent with the hypothesis that both vocal peaks were caused by the eastern Beaufort population. This suggests that migration of populations can be discriminated when temporal differences between vocal peaks are large enough to be identified as independent events. Our study results complement and support the population identity of peaks suggested by satellite telemetry, aerial surveys, and other acoustical studies. Passive acoustic monitoring improves our understanding of the migratory timing of beluga populations for management and conservation in a region undergoing rapid change.

AB  - Offshore wind energy development is rapidly ramping up in United States (U.S.) waters in order to meet renewable energy goals. With a diverse suite of endangered large whale species and a multitude of other protected marine species frequenting these same waters, understanding the potential consequences of construction and operation activities is essential to advancing responsible offshore wind development. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) represents a newer technology that has become one of several methods of choice for monitoring trends in the presence of species, the soundscape, mitigating risk, and evaluating potential behavioral and distributional changes resulting from offshore wind activities. Federal and State regulators, the offshore wind industry, and environmental advocates require detailed information on PAM capabilities and techniques needed to promote efficient, consistent, and meaningful data collection efforts on local and regional scales. PAM during offshore wind construction and operation may be required by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management through project-related permits and approvals issued pursuant to relevant statutes and regulations. The recommendations in this paper aim to support this need as well as to aid the development of project-specific PAM Plans by identifying minimum procedures, system requirements, and other important components for inclusion, while promoting consistency across plans. These recommendations provide an initial guide for stakeholders to meet the rapid development of the offshore wind industry in United States waters. Approaches to PAM and agency requirements will evolve as future permits are issued and construction plans are approved, regional research priorities are refined, and scientific publications and new technologies become available.</p>

AB  - Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are typically dispersed throughout their circumtropical range, but the species is also known to aggregate in specific coastal areas. Accurate site descriptions associated with these aggregations are essential for the conservation of R. typus, an Endangered species. Although aggregations have become valuable hubs for research, most site descriptions rely heavily on sightings data. In the present study, visual census, passive acoustic monitoring, and long range satellite telemetry were combined to track the movements of R. typus from Shib Habil, a reef-associated aggregation site in the Red Sea. An array of 63 receiver stations was used to record the presence of 84 acoustically tagged sharks (35 females, 37 males, 12 undetermined) from April 2010 to May 2016. Over the same period, identification photos were taken for 76 of these tagged individuals and 38 were fitted with satellite transmitters. In total of 37,461 acoustic detections, 210 visual encounters, and 33 satellite tracks were analyzed to describe the sharks' movement ecology. The results demonstrate that the aggregation is seasonal, mostly concentrated on the exposed side of Shib Habil, and seems to attract sharks of both sexes in roughly equal numbers. The combined methodologies also tracked 15 interannual homing-migrations, demonstrating that many sharks leave the area before returning in later years. When compared to acoustic studies from other aggregations, these results demonstrate that R. typus exhibits diverse, site-specific ecologies across its range. Sightings-independent data from acoustic telemetry and other sources are an effective means of validating more common visual surveys.

AB  - Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is emerging as a solution for monitoring species and environmental change over large spatial and temporal scales. However, drawing rigorous conclusions based on acoustic recordings is challenging, as there is no consensus over which approaches are best suited for characterizing marine acoustic environments. Here, we describe the application of multiple machine-learning techniques to the analysis of two PAM datasets. We combine pre-trained acoustic classification models (VGGish, NOAA and Google Humpback Whale Detector), dimensionality reduction (UMAP), and balanced random forest algorithms to demonstrate how machine-learned acoustic features capture different aspects of the marine acoustic environment. The UMAP dimensions derived from VGGish acoustic features exhibited good performance in separating marine mammal vocalizations according to species and locations. RF models trained on the acoustic features performed well for labeled sounds in the 8 kHz range; however, low- and high-frequency sounds could not be classified using this approach. The workflow presented here shows how acoustic feature extraction, visualization, and analysis allow establishing a link between ecologically relevant information and PAM recordings at multiple scales, ranging from large-scale changes in the environment (i.e., changes in wind speed) to the identification of marine mammal species.

AB  - 1. The affordability, storage and power capacity of compact modern recording hardware have evolved passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of animals and soundscapes into a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for research and ecological management particularly useful for bats and toothed whales that orient and forage using ultrasonic echolocation. The use of PAM at large scales hinges on effective automated detectors and species classifiers which, combined with distance sampling approaches, have enabled species abundance estimation of toothed whales. But standardized, user-friendly and open access automated detection and classification workflows are in demand for this key conservation metric to be realized for bats.
   2. We used the PAMGuard toolbox including its new deep learning classification module to test the performance of four open-source workflows for automated analyses of acoustic datasets from bats. Each workflow used a different initial detection algorithm followed by the same deep learning classification algorithm and was evaluated against the performance of an expert manual analyst.
   3. Workflow performance depended strongly on the signal-to-noise ratio and detection algorithm used: the full deep learning workflow had the best classification accuracy (<= 67%) but was computationally too slow for practical large-scale bat PAM. Workflows using PAMGuard's detection module or triggers onboard an SM4BAT or AudioMoth accurately classified up to 47%, 59% and 34%, respectively, of calls to species. Not all workflows included noise sampling critical to estimating changes in detection probability over time, a vital parameter for abundance estimation. The workflow using PAMGuard's detection module was 40 times faster than the full deep learning workflow and missed as few calls (recall for both similar to 0.6), thus balancing computational speed and performance.
   4. We show that complete acoustic detection and classification workflows for bat PAM data can be efficiently automated using open-source software such as PAMGuard and exemplify how detection choices, whether pre-or post-deployment, hardware or software-driven, affect the performance of deep learning classification and the downstream ecological information that can be extracted from acoustic recordings. In particular, understanding and quantifying detection/classification accuracy and the probability of detection are key to avoid introducing biases that may ultimately affect the quality of data for ecological management.

AB  - Fine-scale information on the occurrence of coastal cetaceans is required to support regulation of offshore energy developments and marine spatial planning. In particular, the EU Habitats Directive requires an understanding of the extent to which animals from Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) use adjacent waters, where survey effort is often sparse. Designing survey regimes that can be used to support these assessments is especially challenging because visual sightings are expected to be rare in peripheral parts of a population's range. Consequently, even intensive visual line-transect surveys can result in few encounters. Static passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) provides new opportunities to extend survey effort by using echolocation click detections to quantify levels of occurrence of coastal dolphins, but this does not provide information on species identity. In NE Scotland, assessments of proposed offshore energy developments required information on spatial patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins in waters in and next to the Moray Firth SAC. Here, we illustrate how this can be achieved by integrating data from broad-scale PAM arrays with presence-only data from visual surveys. Generalized estimating equations were used with PAM data to model the occurrence of dolphins in relation to depth, distance to coast, slope, and sediment, and to predict the spatial variation in the cumulative occurrence of all dolphin species across a 4 x 4 km grid of the study area. Classification tree analysis was then applied to available visual sightings data to estimate the likely species identity of dolphins sighted in each grid cell in relation to local habitat. By multiplying these probabilities, it was possible to provide advice on spatial variation in the probability of encountering bottlenose dolphins from this protected population at a regional scale, complementing data from surveys that estimate average density or overall abundance within a region.

AB  - The harbour porpoise is the only resident cetacean species in the German Baltic Sea. Within the last several decades this harbour porpoise stock declined drastically, causing deep concern about its status. Plans of the German government for proposing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to implement Natura 2000 and for assessing the impact of offshore windmill constructions on the marine environment led to an increased research effort on the harbour porpoise in German waters. For the first nine, long-term passive acoustic monitoring has been conducted in the German Baltic Sea from the Kiel Bight to the Pomeraman Bay From August 2002 to December 2005. Porpoise detectors (T-PODs) have been installed five to seven metres below the water surface at up to 42 measuring positions throughout the investigated area, registering the exact times of echolocation signals of passing harbour porpoises. The proportion of monitored days with porpoise detection in each quarter of the years has been analysed. A correlation of the results with the longitude of the measuring position revealed a significant decrease from west to cast in the percentage of days with porpoise detections. Comparison of data gathered in the first quarters with the third quarters of the monitoring years displayed a seasonal variation with fewer days of porpoise detections in winter time than in summer time. Nevertheless, harbour porpoises have been detected year-round at most of the measuring positions in the German Baltic Sea. The present study clearly indicates a regular use of the German Baltic Sea by harbour porpoises with a geographical and seasonal variation in the usage of the German Baltic Sea. The larger numbers of harbour porpoise detections III spring to autumn compared with winter suggests that the German Baltic Sea is an important breeding and mating area for these animals.

AB  - The Baltic Proper harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is currently listed as critically endangered (CR), with the Static Acoustic Monitoring of the Baltic Sea Harbor Porpoise (SAMBAH) project concluding that only similar to 500 individuals remain. This population has a distribution that spans the waters of nine countries, making regular abundance estimates and management action challenging. Given the continued decline of other depleted porpoises, namely the vaquita (Phocoena sinus), the question is often raised about whether management action would even have a positive impact, or whether it is too late for population recovery. When abundance estimates are sparse over time, monitoring programs at key sites are likely to serve as the best indication of population trends, and may provide an early indication of changes at the population level. We compared passive acoustic monitoring data from 12 stations that were utilized both in the SAMBAH project (2011-2013) and as a part of the Swedish National Monitoring Program (2017-2020) to determine trends in detection rates. There was a 29% increase in mean daily detection rate during May-October (over the breeding season) between the two study periods. At the three stations with the highest number of detections, log linear regression revealed a yearly increase of 2.4% between 2011 and 2019 (-4.4-9.6, 95% CI). This may be indicative of the beginnings of population recovery, or simply an indication that the decline has stalled. The rate of increase is still well below what is likely to be possible for porpoise populations, and unlikely to buffer against any potential increase in pressures in the future. We therefore call for urgent management action to remove threats and protect this CR population, the only resident cetacean in the Baltic region, in order to give it the best chance of recovery.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring techniques provide a useful alternative to visual surveys for monitoring of marine mammals since they are less affected by adverse weather conditions. An autonomous unmanned Wave Glider, equipped with a towed hydrophone and recording system was used to collect acoustic data in the Brazilian offshore waters of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean between 6 and 25 February 2016. Nearly continuous data were obtained during this period (light and dark hours) for the 750 km traveled. There were 165,130 high-frequency detections in 31 encounters, including 1789 whistles, 389 burst-pulse sounds, and 162,952 echolocation clicks. A total of 705 low-frequency tonal signals were recorded in 5 encounters. Although high-frequency detections occurred at all hours of the day, the majority occurred during dark hours. Low-frequency detections were not evenly spread through all hours of the day, with the majority of them occurring during dark hours. High-frequency and low-frequency detections represented 26% and 3% of the recording hours, respectively. Duration, the number of emissions, and ocean depth varied among acoustic encounters. Encounters composed by high-frequency sounds were separated into seven different groups, probably different species. One of the encounters presented whistles that were previously recorded in the Rio de Janeiro Coast for Steno bredanensis (Rough-toothed dolphins). All of the low-frequency encounters were composed of a type of Balaenoptera brydei (Bryde's whales) call. This type of data collection is un-precedented for the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean and highlighted the use of the sampled area by delphinids on different days and different times of the day, including the dark hours.

AB  - Six years have passed since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Work is still ongoing to assess and repair the economic and property damage caused by the accident, which was considered to be the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. An estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the sea over an 87-day period after the initial explosion.
   The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) awarded funding to The Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center - Gulf Ecological Monitoring and Modeling (LADC-GEMM) consortium to study the long-term impact of the oil spill on population levels of deep-diving marine mammals. The GEMM project is using some very interesting -some might say avant-garde- technology for collecting acoustic data, especially for marine mammal sounds.
   In 2007, LADC-GEMM conducted a two-week baseline survey in this region of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2010, following the oil spill, LADC was funded by NSF and collaborated with Greenpeace to conduct further surveys. The aim now is to estimate and compare the abundance of the marine mammals after the spill and to understand the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on marine mammal populations.
   In June 2015 as part of this project, ASV provided two vehicles (C-Enduro and C-Worker) to carry out Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in the Gulf of Mexico. The C-Worker and C-Enduro cruised at a speed of approximately 3 knots using a combination of solar, wind and diesel-powered engines. The ASVs were joined by AUVs (Automatic Underwater Vehicles-gliders and EARs (Environmental acoustic recording system) buoys. Data collected during the experiment and other acoustic surveys in the area will contribute in future monitoring efforts to better understand how the spill affected different species in the long-term.
   Both ASV's were fitted with towed hydrophone arrays to record marine mammal sounds. C-Worker deployed the array on a cable 220 m in length and C-Enduro towed a smaller cable 55 m in length. Both arrays contained two omni-directional broadband hydrophones and preamplifiers which enabled bearing estimates to vocalizing marine mammals to be calculated from time-of-arrival differences.
   The autonomous PAM system was configured to detect species from their acoustic phonations over a range of 20 Hz to 160 kHz. These would include the low frequency calls of Bryde's whales, the broadband regular click patterns of sperm whales, higher frequency clicks and whistles of several different dolphin species, and the high frequency echolocation pulse trains of beaked whales, pygmy and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia).
   Autonomous systems are relatively quiet platforms for PAM in comparison with conventional research vessels. They can offer a considerable reduction in operating costs and HSE exposure, and improved operational flexibility. In many cases it has been found that tasks are performed more accurately when using an ASV as opposed to conventional methods. Large survey vessels produce a significant noise signature that can mask weak/distant marine mammal sounds. The use of ASVs provide a novel approach and quiet platform to improve signal response and expand the range of frequencies and distances that can be effectively monitored from a towed survey.

AB  - Since 2016, the Taiwan government has started the Thousand Wind Turbines Project, the goal of which is to build one thousand offshore wind turbines and provide 5.6GW power by the year 2025. On July 2nd, 2015, The Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, R.O.C announced there would be 36 potential zones for wind farms in the Taiwan Strait near the seacoast. However, most of these potential zones are close to the habitat of the critically endangered species, Sousa Chinensis. To avoid the hearing damage (temporary threshold shift and permanent threshold shift) caused by the noise of construction, including pile driving noise and operating noise, the observation of cetaceans around the construction site throughout the period of piling is important. The traditional method of observation is that the marine mammal observer (MMO) works on the vehicle and searches for the cetaceans with his naked eyes. Yet this method becomes inefficient and restricted whenever the cetacean breaks the water surface. Therefore, this research provides an advanced method using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and multiple unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to enhance the efficiency of observation.
   In this research, the whole system was built in C++ and Python as well as two popular open-source middleware - ROS (Robot Operating System) and MOOS-IvP, both of which are software for robotics and have a similar architecture to develop applications. More precisely, MOOS-IvP is software for autonomous marine vehicles. In order to make good use of the coordination of ROS and MOOS-IvP, this research built a bridge of communication connecting the two. The robotic USV system consists of two computers, namely, the front seat and the back seat. The front seat, installed in a vehicle, works by receiving the data from sensors and controlling the motors. The back seat, an additional computer connected with the front seat, is in charge of mission management, making decisions based upon the data from the front seat and commands the front seat where to move.
   Each of the two unmanned surface vehicles, equipped with two hydrophones under the ship hull, are used to localize the underwater acoustic source in this research. The two-channel hydrophone data is used to calculate the bearing angle of USV from an underwater acoustic source through the time difference of arrival method (TDOA). TDOA utilizes the receiving time of the first arrival of the acoustic wave to get the time difference between two hydrophones. Through such time difference, plus sound speed, and the distance between two hydrophones, the bearing angle can be approximatively estimated. Besides, the source localization can also be estimated by the intersection of two bearing lines from each USV.
   The whole system and algorithm were tested at Shimen Reservoir, Taoyuan, Taiwan. The water depth of the reservoir was around 12 meters, and an underwater acoustic projector was placed at the water depth of 5 meters to project an artificial chirp signal similar to the whistling sounds emitted by Sousa Chinensis. Two USVs surveyed a certain area to acquire the acoustic data. After acquiring the data, USV sent the result of the bearing angle to the shoreside computer, which would then estimate the source position by combining the results from both USVs.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a powerful method to study the occurrence, movement and behavior of echolocating odontocetes (toothed whales) in the wild. However, in areas occupied by more than one species, echolocation clicks need to be classified into species. The present study investigated whether the echolocation clicks produced by small, at-risk, resident sympatric populations of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in Menai Bay, Zanzibar, East Africa, could be classified to allow species specific monitoring. Underwater sounds of S. plumbea and T. aduncus groups were recorded using a SoundTrap 202HF in January and June-August 2015. Eight acoustic parameters, i.e. -10 dB duration, peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies, and -3 dB, -10 dB and root-mean-squared bandwidth, were used to describe and compare the two species' echolocation clicks. Statistical analyses showed that S. plumbea clicks had significantly higher peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies compared to T. aduncus, whereas duration and bandwidth parameters were similar for the two species. Random Forest (RF) classifiers were applied to determine parameters that could be used to classify the two species from echolocation clicks and achieved 28.6% and 90.2% correct species classification rates for S. plumbea and T. aduncus, respectively. Both species were classified at a higher rate than expected at random, however the identified classifiers would only be useful for T. aduncus monitoring. The frequency and bandwidth parameters provided most power for species classification. Further study is necessary to identify useful classifiers for S. plumbea. This study represents a first step in acoustic description and classification of S. plumbea and T. aduncus in the western Indian Ocean region, with potential application for future acoustic monitoring of species-specific temporal and spatial occurrence in these sympatric species.

AB  - Northward range shifts are increasingly being identified in mobile animals that are responding to climate change. Range shifts are consequential to animal ecology, ecosystem function, and conservation goals, yet for many species these cannot be characterised without means of synoptically measuring their distribution. The distribution of critically endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis; NARW) north of 45 degrees N has been largely unknown due to a lack of systematic monitoring. The objectives of this study were to characterize the spatial and temporal variation in NARW acoustic occurrence in the northern portion of their foraging range. In addition, we sought to identify relevant NARW migratory corridors and explore potential previously unidentified high-use habitats beyond the highly surveyed Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL). To achieve this, passive acoustic monitoring data were collected and analyzed from 67 moorings and 13 gliders deployed (across 38 recording stations) throughout the Atlantic Canadian continental shelf, between 42 degrees N and 58 degrees N during 2015 through 2017. The results support that while a portion of the population has moved northward into the GSL, this shift was constrained to temperate latitudinal ranges < 52 degrees N during the study period. NARWs were not detected in the Labrador Sea and Newfoundland Shelf, despite their preferred prey occurring in those areas. NARWs were present on the Scotian Shelf (45 degrees N) nearly year-round, but only from May through December in the Cabot Strait (50 degrees N). These results indicate that the northern range of the population is probably influenced by energetic requirements to minimize the distance between suitable foraging habitat and low latitude calving grounds, rather than an absence of suitable foraging conditions in high latitude waters, or other environmental or physiological factors. This work provides critical information to conserve the species and mitigate human-induced risks.

AB  - Cue counting is a method developed for estimating vocally active wildlife density by dividing the density of cues (number of cues per unit area surveyed per unit time) by the average cue rate (ACR) at which individuals vocalize. It has been used successfully to estimate whale density using passive acoustic monitoring, but its efficacy has had limited testing in birds. We tested whether cue counting can be used to infer bird abundance using autonomous recording units and estimated the minimum effort required to obtain a reliable cue rate at individual and population levels. We recorded Dupont's Lark (Chersophilus duponti) vocalizations at 31 sites where traditional field censuses were also performed. We estimated the ACR using three methodologies: directional recordings, recordings from an online database of bird sounds (xeno-canto), and behavioral field studies. The ACRs estimated using directional recordings and behavioral field studies were similar, and bird numbers were over and underestimated by 0.8 and 10%, respectively (74-77% of the sampling sites were well estimated). However, the ACR estimated using xeno-canto recordings was much higher than those estimated using the other two methods, and bird numbers were underestimated by 41%. We also performed a cost-effectiveness assessment of the number of individuals and recording durations needed to optimize the estimation of a reliable ACR. We found that ACR estimates were more efficient if long (25 min) recordings were used when < 4 males were recorded, whereas 5-min recordings were more efficient for >= 20 males. We conclude that cue counting can be useful to infer bird density around recorders but requires an accurate measure of the ACR. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of passive cue counting on a large number of species and under different circumstances.

AB  - Aim: Species distribution models (SDMs) are essential tools in ecology and conservation. However, the scarcity of visual sightings of marine mammals in remote polar areas hinders the effective application of SDMs there. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data provide year-round information and overcome foul weather limitations faced by visual surveys. However, the use of PAM data in SDMs has been sparse so far. Here, we use PAM-based SDMs to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of the critically endangered Antarctic blue whale in the Weddell Sea.Location: The Weddell Sea.Methods: We used presence-only dynamic SDMs employing visual sightings and PAM detections in independent models. We compared the two independent models with a third combined model that integrated both visual and PAM data, aiming at leveraging the advantages of each data type: the extensive spatial extent of visual data and the broader temporal/environmental range of PAM data.Results: Visual and PAM data prove complementary, as indicated by a low spatial overlap between daily predictions and the low predictability of each model at detections of other data types. Combined data models reproduced suitable habitats as given by both independent models. Visual data models indicate areas close to the sea ice edge (SIE) and with low-to-moderate sea ice concentrations (SIC) as suitable, while PAM data models identified suitable habitats at a broader range of distances to SIE and relatively higher SIC.Main Conclusions: The results demonstrate the potential of PAM data to predict year-round marine mammal habitat suitability at large spatial scales. We provide reasons for discrepancies between SDMs based on either data type and give methodological recommendations on using PAM data in SDMs. Combining visual and PAM data in future SDMs is promising for studying vocalized animals, particularly when using recent advances in integrated distribution modelling methods.

AB  - In the Arctic, in-situ measurement of the upper water column properties (e.g., salinity and temperature) has been a challenge because of the seasonal sea ice coverage. A Long-term Acoustic Real-Time Sensor for Polar Areas (LARA) was developed, field-tested in the shallow water off Oregon and its performance evaluated. The LARA utilizes a commercially available underwater profiler winch from NiGK, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors, and a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems. The sensor section consists of two modules: 1) a satellite antenna with a temperature and depth sensor (TD) and 2) a sensor buoy with a controller, a CTD, and a PAM. Using the two vertically separated temperature and pressure sensors, it is capable of detecting the presence of sea ice by sensing the oceanographic conditions in the upper water column. In addition, using the acoustic sensors, (1) surface wind speed can be estimated from the ambient noise level and (2) enable monitoring of marine mammal calling activity. The winch can be fully controllable from the sensor buoy by acoustic commands. It is capable of aborting an ascent in case sea ice coverage or a high sea state was detected. Although the sea ice detection algorithm could not be tested in Oregon waters, the LARA successfully repeated 94 profiles and transmitted CTD and acoustic detections data via satellite. The wind speed estimates by the PAM were in good agreement with the nearby buoy data. The PAM recorded various biological signals from 10 Hz to 60 kHz including vocalizations of fin, humpback, sperm whales and calls of Pacific white-sided dolphins. The system is capable of repeating 365 profiles or one profile per day for 1 year making it suitable for collecting high-resolution water column data in the extreme weather and water conditions of the Arctic.

AB  - In this paper, the conceptual design and practical construction of a wind propelled Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV), for marine research are described. The ASPire (Autonomous Sailing Platform) will be deployed for collecting marine sensor data (i.e., Conductivity, Temperature and Density (CTD) measurements) and for passive-acoustic monitoring (PAM) of harbor porpoise in the vicinity of the Aland Islands in the Baltic Sea. The construction of hull and rig is presented, along with propulsion methods and energy harvesting strategies. Supplementary electronics, sensors, control systems, communication methods and obstacle avoidance strategies are also described. The ASV design includes several novel features, four are mentioned here.
   1) The perhaps most notable feature is the rig with a free rotating rigid wingsail. The rig has two servo wings, one in front of, and one behind the main wing. To our knowledge, this is the first design of a surface vessel that uses such a three- surface configuration for wind propulsion.
   2) Another novel feature of the ASPire is the single-axis solar tracker developed for the purpose of increasing the amount of harvested solar energy. The solar panel is angled based on the position and heading of the ASV as well as the time of day.
   3) A windvane self steering device is furthermore used to keep the ASV at a straight course relative to the wind in an energy efficient manner. Although the design of the windvane is well known, its use in an autonomous vessel has not been explored.
   4) A forward-looking Thermal Imaging Camera (TIC) is utilized for obstacle detection. This approach is currently under-explored for ASV.
   The ASPire is suited for operation in shallow waters. It is sufficiently large for carrying payload needed for marine sensor measurements and monitoring of high-frequency cetaceans such as harbor porpoise. One further advantage of wind propulsion for audio measurement is the possibility to operate without contributing noise from propulsion engines.

AB  - Simple Summary Marine mammal welfare research of professionally managed species has primarily focused on enrichment, habitat usage, and activity, as well as the impacts of human-oriented training sessions. However, the importance of sound in the welfare of marine mammals has rarely been mentioned. In this review, methods for acoustic welfare monitoring are discussed, including hearing tests, the incorporation of listening systems to monitor noise and communication, and cataloguing vocalizations in various health contexts. Examples from the US Navy Marine Mammal program are provided, as well as opportunities for facilities to initiate acoustic welfare monitoring. Suggested future directions of study, such as research examining the impact of sound on cognition, are also discussed. Research evaluating marine mammal welfare and opportunities for advancements in the care of species housed in a professional facility have rapidly increased in the past decade. While topics, such as comfortable housing, adequate social opportunities, stimulating enrichment, and a high standard of medical care, have continued to receive attention from managers and scientists, there is a lack of established acoustic consideration for monitoring the welfare of these animals. Marine mammals rely on sound production and reception for navigation and communication. Regulations governing anthropogenic sound production in our oceans have been put in place by many countries around the world, largely based on the results of research with managed and trained animals, due to the potential negative impacts that unrestricted noise can have on marine mammals. However, there has not been an established best practice for the acoustic welfare monitoring of marine mammals in professional care. By monitoring animal hearing and vocal behavior, a more holistic view of animal welfare can be achieved through the early detection of anthropogenic sound sources, the acoustic behavior of the animals, and even the features of the calls. In this review, the practice of monitoring cetacean acoustic welfare through behavioral hearing tests and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), passive acoustic monitoring, such as the Welfare Acoustic Monitoring System (WAMS), as well as ideas for using advanced technologies for utilizing vocal biomarkers of health are introduced and reviewed as opportunities for integration into marine mammal welfare plans.
