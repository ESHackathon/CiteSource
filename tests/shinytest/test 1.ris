AB  - Understanding the vocal behavior of cetaceans is an important component of many passive acoustic applications. This study quantifies the vocal behavior of acoustic subgroups of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) from the Hawaiian Archipelago. The acoustic subgroups (N = 523) exhibit diverse vocal behavior that varies between encounters. Overall, 29% of acoustic subgroups only echolocate, 16% only whistle, and 55% emit both types of vocalizations. These results contribute important information for developing automated passive acoustic cetacean tracking, localization, and classification techniques, and thus, support future cetacean monitoring and assessment efforts.

AB  - Cetaceans spend most of their time below the surface of the sea, highlighting the importance of passive acoustic monitoring as a tool to facilitate understanding and mapping their year-round spatial and temporal distributions. To increase our limited knowledge of cetacean acoustic detection patterns for the east and west coasts of Gwaii Haanas, a remote protected area on Haida Gwaii, BC, Canada, acoustic datasets recorded off SGang Gwaay (Sep 2009-May 2011), Gowgaia Slope (Jul 2017-Jul 2019), and Ramsay Island (Aug 2018-Aug 2019) were analyzed. Comparing overlapping periods of visual surveys and acoustic monitoring confirmed presence of 12 cetacean species/species groups within the study region. Seasonal patterns were identified for blue, fin, humpback, grey and sperm whale acoustic signals. Killer whale and delphinid acoustic signals occurred year-round on both coasts of Haida Gwaii and showed strong diel variation. Cuvier's, Baird's, beaked whale and porpoise clicks, were identified in high-frequency recordings on the west coast. Correlations between environmental factors, chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature, and cetacean acoustic occurrence off Gwaii Haanas were also examined. This study is the first to acoustically monitor Gwaii Haanas waters for an extended continuous period and therefore serves as a baseline from which to monitor future changes.

AB  - Passive acoustic methods are in widespread use to detect and classify cetacean species; however, passive acoustic systems often suffer from large false detection rates resulting from numerous transient sources. To reduce the acoustic analyst workload, automatic recognition methods may be implemented in a two-stage process. First, a general automatic detector is implemented that produces many detections to ensure cetacean presence is noted. Then an automatic classifier is used to significantly reduce the number of false detections and classify the cetacean species. This process requires development of a robust classifier capable of performing inter-species classification. Because human analysts can aurally discriminate species, an automated aural classifier that uses perceptual signal features was tested on a cetacean data set. The classifier successfully discriminated between four species of cetaceans-bowhead, humpback, North Atlantic right, and sperm whales-with 85% accuracy. It also performed well (100% accuracy) for discriminating sperm whale clicks from right whale gunshots. An accuracy of 92% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 were obtained for the relatively challenging bowhead and humpback recognition case. These results demonstrated that the perceptual features employed by the aural classifier provided powerful discrimination cues for inter-species classification of cetaceans.

AB  - Long-term distribution data for cetaceans are lacking, inhibiting the ability of management bodies to assess trends and react appropriately. Such is true even along the US Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) where previous passive acoustic monitoring programs have laid the groundwork for monitoring cetacean occurrence over a multidecadal scale. Here, we continue and expand the scope of previous acoustic programs, providing a synopsis of the monthly cetacean acoustic occurrence from late 2017 to late 2020. Acoustic data were collected using bottom-mounted autonomous recorders located at seven stations along the OCS in depths of 212-900 m. Automated cetacean vocalization detector-classifiers were applied, and the resulting automated detections directed the manual review of a subset of the data by analysts. Only manual detections informed the occurrence results. Six baleen whale species and at least eight toothed whale species occurred in the region with diversity increasing in winter. In considering previous monitoring program results, we found evidence that some mysticete whales are spending less time in the region annually, confirmed that some species occur farther offshore than previously reported, and identified two previously unreported areas utilized by beaked whales. For effective species management, these findings must be considered, and monitoring programs continued.

AB  - Autonomous acoustic recorders have advanced our understanding of cetaceans, providing information for better models of species distribution, behavior, ecology, and conservation. For over a decade, Acoustic Recording Packages (ARPs), and its broader-bandwidth successor, High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP), have been used for Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) providing high-fidelity, long-term acoustic data sets for cetacean studies. Some of these studies are summarized below showing a wide range of applications and results including species signal characterization, seasonal and daily presence patterns, geographic and habitat use, population density and abundance estimations, acoustic stimuli behavioral response, and swimming behavior via array tracking. Species studied include low-frequency baleen whales and high-frequency dolphins and beaked whales.

AB  - Simple Summary Little effort has been made to conserve cetaceans in the Miaodao Archipelago, which is hindered by a lack of baseline data on their species and distribution patterns. Using a passive acoustic monitoring technique, we found a decrease in cetacean diversity; the East Asian finless porpoise is the sole cetacean species that can be reliability detected in this area, and their distribution exhibits seasonally patterns. Further research and conservation measures are needed to protect cetaceans in this area. Once an important cetacean habitat, the Miaodao Archipelago has been altered by human-induced disturbances over several decades. While cetacean diversity is known to have decreased, no recent data on species diversity around Miaodao are known to exist. Capitalizing on the high vocal activity of cetaceans, three passive acoustic surveys, including towed and stationary types, were undertaken to detect the presence of species-specific vocalizations in May 2021, October 2021, and July 2022, as most cetacean sightings occurred during May and August in recent years. The results revealed that the East Asian finless porpoise is the sole cetacean species that can be reliably observed around the archipelago, as no other species were detected. The acoustic data also revealed potentially clumped distributions of finless porpoises with some seasonal variation. While not acoustically detected during any of the surveys, humpback whales, minke whales, and killer whales have been visually sighted in the region. The lack of acoustic detection of these species suggests that they are likely to be temporary visitors to the region, or at least exhibit strong seasonality in their presence within the region. These new data provide the latest snapshot of cetacean presence around the Miaodao Archipelago that can help inform future research and conservation.

AB  - Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory's monitoring and mitigation program during an academic seismic study in April-June 2004 was the largest cetacean survey undertaken to date in the southeast Caribbean Sea. A total of 10,007 km (904 h) of visual observations occurred from the seismic vessel R/V Maurice Ewing and from the support vessel R/V Seward Johnson II. In addition, 7375 km (846 h) of passive acoustic monitoring for vocalizing cetaceans occurred from the Ewing via a towed 250-m hydrophone array. Approximately 1293 cetaceans in 46 groups were seen from the two vessels, and 78 acoustic detections were made. Nine cetacean species were identified of which the long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis), Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis), and bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) were sighted most frequently. The striped dolphin (S. coeruleoalba), spinner dolphin (S. longirostris), pantropical spotted dolphin (S. attenuata), short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) were also identified during visual surveys. Only the sperm whale was positively identified by acoustic monitoring alone. At least 17 sperm whale detections (visual and/or acoustic) were made around the islands and atolls of the Venezuelan Archipelago near and beyond the 1000-m depth contour. Overall cetacean density in intermediate-depth water (100 to 1000 m deep) was five times greater than in deep (>1000 m) water. This study addresses previous data gaps on the occurrence of cetaceans in shelf and offshore waters across a wide area of the southeast Caribbean Sea in spring.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed line array of hydrophones is a standard method for localizing cetaceans during line-transect cetacean abundance surveys. Perpendicular distances estimated between localized whales and the trackline are essential for abundance estimation using acoustic data. Uncertainties in the acoustic data from hydrophone movement, sound propagation effects, errors in the time of arrival differences, and whale depth are not accounted for by most two-dimensional localization methods. Consequently, location and distance estimates for deep-diving cetaceans may be biased, creating uncertainty in abundance estimates. Here, a model-based localization approach is applied to towed line array acoustic data that incorporates sound propagation effects, accounts for sources of error, and localizes in three dimensions. The whale's true distance, ship trajectory, and whale movement greatly affected localization results in simulations. The localization method was applied to real acoustic data from two separate sperm whales, resulting in three-dimensional distance and depth estimates with position bounds for each whale. By incorporating sources of error, this three-dimensional model-based approach provides a method to address and integrate the inherent uncertainties in towed array acoustic data for more robust localization.

AB  - The eastern Atlantic Ocean is considered to provide important breeding and wintering habitats for several migratory cetacean species. The spatio-temporal distributions and migratory behaviors of cetaceans off southern Africa are nevertheless still poorly understood. This study investigated the temporal patterns of acoustic occurrence of baleen whales in a presumed baleen whale breeding area off Namibia using passive acoustic recordings collected between November 2011 and May 2013. Our results show seasonal acoustic presence of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, fin whales Balaenoptera physalus and Antarctic minke whales B. bonaerensis from November to January and from June to August. Their acoustic absence from February to May possibly indicates that most animals migrated to other areas (presumably in higher latitudes) in austral summer to feed. By contrast, Antarctic blue whales B. musculus intermedia were acoustically present throughout the recording period, indicating that part of the population remains at lower latitudes year-round. Our findings support the presumed ecological importance of the oceanic area off Namibia, providing (part of) a suitable cetacean wintering and, possibly, breeding range or migratory corridor. Furthermore, the occurrence of Antarctic blue and minke whales off Namibia, concurrent with their reported acoustic presence in high-latitude feeding areas, adds to growing evidence that baleen whale migration is not obligate but much more dynamic than has long been assumed.

AB  - A variety of cetacean species inhabit the productive waters offshore of Washington State, USA. Although the general presence of many of these species has been documented in this region, our understanding of fine-scale habitat use is limited. Here, passive acoustic monitoring was used to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of ten cetacean species at three locations offshore of Washington. Between 2004 and 2013, a total of 2845 days of recordings were collected from sites on the continental shelf and slope, and in a submarine canyon. Acoustic presence was higher for all species at sites farther offshore. Detections were highest during the fall and winter for blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), likely related to reproductive behavior, while minke whales (B. acutorostrata) were only detected on two days. Odontocetes showed temporal separation, with sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) detections highest in spring, Risso's (Grampus griseus) and Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) highest in summer, and Stejneger's beaked whales (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), and the BW37V signal type highest in winter or spring. There was interannual variation in detections for most mysticete species, which may be linked to oceanographic conditions: blue and fin whale detections increased during 2007 and 2008, and fin and humpback whale detections increased in 2011. These results inform our understanding of cetacean behavior and habitat use in this region and may aid in the development of conservation strategies suited to the dynamic conditions that drive cetacean distribution.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an optimal method for detecting and monitoring cetaceans as they frequently produce sound while underwater. Cue counting, counting acoustic cues of deep-diving cetaceans instead of animals, is an alternative method for density estimation, but requires an average cue production rate to convert cue density to animal density. Limited information about click rates exists for sperm whales in the central North Pacific Ocean. In the absence of acoustic tag data, we used towed hydrophone array data to calculate the first sperm whale click rates from this region and examined their variability based on click type, location, distance of whales from the array, and group size estimated by visual observers. Our findings show click type to be the most important variable, with groups that include codas yielding the highest click rates. We also found a positive relationship between group size and click detection rates that may be useful for acoustic predictions of group size in future studies. Echolocation clicks detected using PAM methods are often the only indicator of deep-diving cetacean presence. Understanding the factors affecting their click rates provides important information for acoustic density estimation. (c) 2024 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - 1. The New York Bight is an extremely busy maritime region, with extensive shipping traffic and commercial fishing activity. It is part of the migratory ranges of a number of cetacean species, and includes threats from ship strikes, noise exposure, and line entanglements. Previous cetacean surveys of the Bight offer limited information on cetacean occurrence and distribution in the region, having been restricted to visual sightings with limited temporal coverage. 2. A passive acoustic monitoring survey was conducted over a 258-day period to broaden understanding of the seasonal occurrences of blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), and North Atlantic right (Eubalaena glacialis) whales during late summer, autumn, winter, and early spring. Stationary acoustic recorders were positioned near the entrance to New York Harbour and as a linear transect extending from Long Island to the continental shelf edge. 3. Blue, fin, and right whales were detected on 11%, 100%, and 16% of the survey days, respectively. Blue whales were detected offshore during January, February, and March. Fin whales were detected offshore every day, and less often near-shore. Right whales occurred sporadically during every month, but were most often detected at near-shore recorders between late February and mid-May. 4. Based on the acoustic data alone, it is unclear exactly how these species are using this habitat, although it is clear that they occur in the area longer than was previously thought. Thus, management practices should incorporate this extended seasonal presence to mitigate any effects on the whales from shipping and fishing activities.

AB  - Knowledge of cetacean occurrence and behaviour in southern African waters is limited, and passive acoustic monitoring has the potential to address this gap efficiently. Seasonal acoustic occurrence and diel-vocalizing patterns of sperm whales in relation to environmental conditions are described here using passive acoustic monitoring data collected off the west coast of South Africa. Four autonomous acoustic recorders (AARs) were deployed on 3 oceanographic moorings from July 2014 to January 2017. Sperm whale clicks were detected year round in most recording sites, with peaks in acoustic occurrence in summer and late winter through spring. Diel-vocalizing patterns were detected in winter, spring and summer. Higher percentages of sperm whale clicks were recorded by AARs deployed at 1100 m water depth compared to those concurrently deployed at 850 and 4500 m, likely inferring that the whales exhibited some preference to water depths around 1100 m. Acoustic propagation modelling suggested a maximum detection range of 83 km in winter for sperm whale clicks produced at 1100 m. Random forest models classified daylight regime, sea surface height anomaly and month of the year as the most important predictors of sperm whale acoustic occurrence. The continuous acoustic occurrence of sperm whales suggests that the study area supports large biomasses of prey to sustain this species' food requirements year round. This is the first study to describe the seasonal acoustic occurrence and diel-vocalizing patterns of sperm whales off the west coast of South Africa, extending knowledge of the species previously available only through whaling records.

AB  - The use of commercial echosounders for scientific and industrial purposes is steadily increasing. In addition to traditional navigational and fisheries uses, commercial sonars are used extensively for oceanographic research, benthic habitat mapping, geophysical exploration, and ecosystem studies. Little is known about the effects of these acoustic sources on marine animals, though several studies have already demonstrated behavioural responses of cetaceans to shipboard echosounders. Some species of cetaceans are known to be particularly sensitive to acoustic disturbance, including beaked whales. In 2011 and 2013, we conducted cetacean assessment surveys in the western North Atlantic in which a suite of Simrad EK60 echosounders was used to characterize the distribution of prey along survey tracklines. Echosounders were alternated daily between active and passive mode, to determine whether their use affected visual and acoustic detection rates of beaked whales. A total of 256 groups of beaked whales were sighted, and 118 definitive acoustic detections were recorded. Regression analyses using generalized linear models (GLM) found that sea state and region were primary factors in determining visual sighting rates, while echosounder state was the primary driver for acoustic detections, with significantly fewer detections (only 3%) occurring when echosounders were active. These results indicate that beaked whales both detect and change their behaviour in response to commercial echosounders. The mechanism of this response is unknown, but could indicate interruption of foraging activity or vessel avoidance, with potential implications for management and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Advances in mobile autonomous platforms for oceanographic sensing, including gliders and deep-water profiling floats, have provided new opportunities for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of cetaceans. However, there are few direct comparisons of these mobile autonomous systems to more traditional methods, such as stationary bottom moored recorders. Cross-platform comparisons are necessary to enable interpretation of results across historical and contemporary surveys that use different recorder types, and to identify potential biases introduced by the platform. Understanding tradeoffs across recording platforms informs best practices for future cetacean monitoring efforts. This study directly compares the PAM capabilities of a glider (Seaglider) and a deep-water profiling float (QUEphone) to a stationary seafloor system (High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package, or HARP) deployed simultaneously over a 2 week period in the Catalina Basin, California, United States. Two HARPs were deployed 4 km apart while a glider and deep-water float surveyed within 20 km of the HARPs. Acoustic recordings were analyzed for the presence of multiple cetacean species, including beaked whales, delphinids, and minke whales. Variation in acoustic occurrence at 1-min (beaked whales only), hourly, and daily scales were examined. The number of minutes, hours, and days with beaked whale echolocation clicks were variable across recorders, likely due to differences in the noise floor of each recording system, the spatial distribution of the recorders, and the short detection radius of such a high-frequency, directional signal type. Delphinid whistles and clicks were prevalent across all recorders, and at levels that may have masked beaked whale vocalizations. The number and timing of hours and days with minke whale boing sounds were nearly identical across recorder types, as was expected given the relatively long propagation distance of boings. This comparison provides evidence that gliders and deep-water floats record cetaceans at similar detection rates to traditional stationary recorders at a single point. The spatiotemporal scale over which these single hydrophone systems record sounds is highly dependent on acoustic features of the sound source. Additionally, these mobile platforms provide improved spatial coverage which may be critical for species that produce calls that propagate only over short distances such as beaked whales.

T2  - PACIFIC SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata (Lacepede), have been considered a rare species in Hawaiian waters due to limited sightings during visual and aerial surveys. However, Our research suggests that they are more common than previously considered. In spring 2005, a combined visual-acoustic survey, of cetaceans in Hawaiian waters resulted in the sighting of a minke whale within 22 kin of Kaua'i. Minke whale vocalizations were also detected at several other locations near Kaua'i and O'ahu. These 2005 reports are the first from nearshore (<50 kin) Hawaiian waters despite years of previous shipboard and aerial surveys. The lack of historical sightings is likely due to misidentification or the inability to detect these animals during poor sighting conditions. We recommend that future cetacean surveys in Hawaiian waters include a passive acoustic component to increase the likelihood of detecting minke whales.

AB  - Mediterranean cetacean populations face many threats from increased human activities, such as ship traffic, overfishing, bycatch, chemical pollution, marine litter and underwater noise. Here, we investigated cetacean diversity using acoustic recorders installed in static and dynamic devices in the central Mediterranean Sea, where a floating offshore wind farm will soon be developed. Therefore, acoustic recorders were installed in a seafloor mooring and in a wave glider. Acoustic data from the seafloor mooring were acquired from 18th February to 27th April 2022, with 50% duty cycle and 192 kHz sampling rate. A total of 9,473 acoustic files of 300 sec (69 days, similar to 790 hours, similar to 1 TB) were collected. Subsequently, a wave glider was launched in the same area from 10th to 25th October 2022. Acoustic data were acquired continuously with the same sampling rate used previously, storing a total of 2,974 recordings of 460 sec (15 days, similar to 380 hours, similar to 360 GB). In this study, a preliminary data analysis involved spectrogram visualization and audio listening of a subsample of both datasets, at broadband and low-frequency, to identify cetacean vocalizations and anthropogenic noise sources. The acoustic signals of delphinids, sperm whale, fin whale and different anthropogenic noise sources were identified in the study area. Passive acoustics resulted a powerful tool to monitor cetacean diversity using both static and dynamic devices, providing valuable information for the establishment of conservation actions in a poorly investigated area of the Mediterranean basin.

AB  - Cetaceans are prone to collisions with fast vessels, and in areas of high cetacean and vessel density such as ill the Canary Islands, the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is of great concern. Sperm whales are highly vocal and can be localized with passive sonar, but, when at or near the surface they tend to stop vocalizing, i.e. when they are most at risk. Regrettably, ship-borne active solutions have proven inefficient due to the short detection range and the ships' high-speeds. Our objective in this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of all original passive sonar solution that would use vocalizing whale clicks at depth as acoustic sources to detect silent whales. This solution could be a non-invasive complementary component of a more complex passive localization whale anti-collision system. To meet this aim, a simulation tool for 3D acoustic propagation was designed in which a wideband Nx2D ray solution of the wave equation simulates a passive solution consisting of all arbitrary number of active acoustic sources, all illuminated object, and a receiver, all positioned in a three-dimensional space with arbitrary bathymetry. Both curved and straight ray Solutions were implemented, the latter providing, greater computational speeds at the expense of temporal and angular precision. The software recreates the resulting sound mixture of direct, reverberated and target back-scattered signals arriving at the array sensors for any array configuration, any, number of sources and one target. Simulations show the application of the concept for the Canary Islands, with a detection range upper bound of the order of one kilometre.

AB  - Passive acoustic tracking provides an unobtrusive method of studying the movement of sound-producing animals in the marine environment where traditional tracking methods may be costly or infeasible. We used passive acoustic tracking to characterize the fine-scale movements of singing humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground. Male humpback whales produce complex songs, a phenomenon that is well documented in tropical regions during the winter breeding season, but also occurs at higher latitudes during other times of year. Acoustic recordings were made throughout 2009 using an array of autonomous recording units deployed in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Song was recorded during spring and fall, and individual singing whales were localized and tracked throughout the array using a correlation sum estimation method on the time-synchronized recordings. Tracks were constructed for forty-three song sessions, revealing a high level of variation in movement patterns in both the spring and fall seasons, ranging from slow meandering to faster directional movement. Tracks were 30 min to 8 h in duration, and singers traveled distances ranging from 0.9 to 20.1 km. Mean swimming speed was 2.06 km/h (SD 0.95). Patterns and rates of movement indicated that most singers were actively swimming. In one case, two singers were tracked simultaneously, revealing a potential acoustic interaction. Our results provide a first description of the movements of singers on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground, and demonstrate the utility of passive acoustic tracking for studying the fine-scale movements of cetaceans within the behavioral context of their calls. These methods have further applications for conservation and management purposes, particularly by enhancing our ability to estimate cetacean densities using passive acoustic monitoring.

AB  - 1. Research in the western Mediterranean has shown that sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) are present as small, globally distinct populations that face numerous threats.
   2. The eastern Mediterranean is not well studied, and few surveys have investigated the composition of cetacean communities. In this study, visual-acoustic surveys were conducted off the coast of Israel during April-May 2022 to characterize the cetacean community.
   3. Sperm whales (three encounters), Cuvier's beaked whales (one encounter), bottlenose dolphins (one encounter (Tursiops truncatus)) and unidentified delphinids (17 encounters) were acoustically detected.
   4. Sperm whales were foraging similar to 10 km off Haifa, at 370-1220 m deep and social vocalizations (codas) corresponded to the Mediterranean dialect. One immature male that was photographed is known from 12 previous encounters in the Ligurian Sea, indicating a west-east movement of approximately 2800 km.
   5. Automated passive acoustic monitoring of narrow, relatively shallow areas such as the Sicily Channel could provide an opportunity to reduce mortality of individuals making long-distance movements within Mediterranean basins. Israeli waters provide habitat for cetaceans, with two threatened subpopulations-sperm and Cuvier's beaked whales-that are negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities, including those that introduce underwater noise. More data are needed on densities of these deep-water species, and an evaluation of the threats faced in the wider Levantine basin.

AB  - Information on the species diversity and habitat use of cetaceans can help us to understand the community ecology of marine top predators. Passive acoustic monitoring has been widely applied in the cetacean research in recent years since cetacean vocalizations can be effectively detected through automatic detection methods. However, species identification based on tonal sounds remains challenging due to the high intra-specific variation. In order to examine the seasonal changing pattern of species diversity and species-specific occurrence, we applied an automatic detection and classification algorithm on the acoustic recordings collected from the marine cable hosted observatory (MACHO) off the northeastern Taiwan. The representative frequencies of cetacean tonal sounds within 4.5-48 kHz were detected by the local-max detector. Twelve statistical feature vectors were extracted based on the distribution of representative frequency and were used in the discriminant function analysis to classify four cetacean groups. The correct classification rate was 72.2% based on the field recording collected from onboard surveys. Analysis on one-year MACHO recordings revealed that the species diversity was highest in winter and spring. In addition, different patterns of seasonal occurrence were observed between different cetacean groups. Short finned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins were the most common species, they mainly occurred in winter and summer. False killer whales were mostly detected in winter and spring. On the contrary, smaller delphinids, such as spinner dolphins, spotted dolphins, and Fraser's dolphins were mainly detected in summer. Bottlenose dolphins represent the least common species. The current results show that the seasonal occurrence of multiple cetacean species can be effectively monitored by a marine observatory. In the future, the biodiversity, species-specific habitat use, and inter-specific interaction of cetaceans can be investigated through an underwater acoustic monitoring network.

AB  - Within a soundscape, anthropogenic sound often dominates frequency ranges used by various species, leading to signal overlap and potential communication masking. The acoustic niche hypothesis predicts species will avoid competition by vocalizing at unique bandwidths. To evaluate the extent of anthropogenic overlap, it's helpful to understand acoustic niches across time. This study aims to assess the co-occurrence of cetaceans and anthropogenic activities, presenting simple and accessible visualizations of the temporal and spectral overlap. Continuous passive acoustic recordings from 10 Hz to 100 kHz were collected near three deep-water canyons (Heezen, Oceanographer, and Nantucket) along the continental shelf break of Georges Bank between April 2015 and March 2016. Daily presence was documented for five mysticete species (North Atlantic right, fin, blue, sei, humpback), five odontocete species and/or groups combined according to primary frequency ranges (delphinids, sperm whales, Kogia spp, Sowerby's, and Cuviers'/True's/Gervais' beaked whales), and four anthropogenic activities (airgun noise, broadband ship noise, echosounders, and explosions). At each site, cetacean and anthropogenic sources were found to be significant contributors. Individual cetacean species/groups were present from 2% to 100% of days across sites, with delphinids, sperm whales, and fin whales detected most consistently. Airgun noise, the most frequently detected anthropogenic signal, ranged from 50% to 91% of days across all sites, followed by broadband ship noise (15-65% of days), echosounders (1-14% of days), and one explosion detected at Oceanographer Canyon. This approach allows for broad comparison of species and anthropogenic activity, providing understanding of variability in acoustic overlap and potential masking between sites.

AB  - UNESCO World Natural Heritage sites are established to ensure the long-term conservation of natural areas. Nemuro Strait in northern Japan is adjacent to the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage Site, and attracts various trophic levels of marine species, including marine mammals. Although the coexistence of humans and marine mammals is an important issue in this area, the temporal habitat use of cetaceans in this area is unknown. Here, we document seasonal and diel changes in cetacean vocalizations collected using passive acoustic recording devices during November 2012-March 2014. Killer whale calls occurred in spring and summer, and sperm whale clicks were detected in summer. Pacific white-sided dolphin calls were recorded in summer and late fall. No cetaceans were recorded during the sea ice period in February and March. The dolphin calls and unknown click trains were significantly more frequent at night. In contrast, marginal diel changes in killer whale calls were detected. Our results suggest that the majority of cetaceans utilize Nemuro Strait at night during the ice-free period, and we provide new insights into the habitat use and diversity of marine mammals in the Strait.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be used to monitor acoustic presence and behaviour of cetaceans, providing continuous, long-term, and seasonally unbiased data. The efficiency of PAM methods, however, depends on the ability to detect and correctly interpret acoustic signals. The upcall is the most prevalent vocalization of the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) and is commonly used as a basis for PAM studies on this species. However, previous studies report difficulties to distinguish between southern right whale upcalls and similar humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) vocalizations with certainty. Recently, vocalizations comparable to southern right whale upcalls were detected off Elephant Island, Antarctica. In this study, these vocalizations were structurally analyzed, and call characteristics were compared to (a) confirmed southern right whale vocalizations recorded off Argentina and (b) confirmed humpback whale vocalizations recorded in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean. Based on call features, detected upcalls off Elephant Island could be successfully attributed to southern right whales. Measurements describing slope and bandwidth were identified as the main differences in call characteristics between species. With the newly gained knowledge from this study, additional data can be analyzed providing further insight into temporal occurrence and migratory behaviour of southern right whales in Antarctic waters.

AB  - Sperm whales have been identified under Marine Bioregional Plans as key features in the Great Australian Bight (GAB). Although commercial whaling of sperm whales in Australian waters ceased in 1978 there is no evidence of recovery of sperm whale populations. Information on the current distribution and abundance of sperm whales in the region, which is also an important area for human activities including fishing, oil and gas exploration and tourism, is very limited. We undertook a systematic visual and passive acoustic vessel based survey in the central eastern GAB. The visual detection rate of sperm whales from the survey was 1.4 individuals per 1000 km with an acoustic density of 0.21 individuals per 1000 km(2). We combined these sightings and detection data with historical and contemporary whaling and sightings data to identify critical habitat for sperm whales in the region. Using Maximum entropy modelling, suitable sperm whale habitat was predicted over the continental shelf break, but more specifically, over sub-marine canyons. Baseline information on the abundance and distribution of sperm whales, and other cetacean species, in the GAB are required to provide information to management agencies and regulators in order to assess and mitigate risks. The potential impacts of increased noise from shipping, seismic surveys and construction on cetacean species in the region need to be considered.

AB  - The distribution, abundance, and habitat of cryptic cetacean species such as beaked whales and dwarf/pygmy sperm whales (Kogia spp.) are challenging to study due to their long dive times and/or very limited surface behavior. Even less is known in minimally studied and remote regions, including the Mariana Archipelago and parts of the broader western Pacific. In 2018, we deployed a network of eight Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders (DASBRs) on the west side of the Mariana Archipelago with the goal of examining the distribution and habitat of beaked whales and Kogia spp. in this region using passive acoustic monitoring. Concurrently, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data were collected within the drift area and combined with satellite oceanographic data to build Ensemble Random Forest Models to identify specific oceanographic features that determine the distribution of these species. DASBRs deployed at locations ranging from 13 degrees N to 18 degrees N generally drifted from east to west between the Mariana Archipelago and the West Mariana Ridge. Spectral and temporal characteristics of echolocation signals were used to identify the presence of beaked whales and Kogia spp. species. This dataset contained frequency modulated (FM) pulses characteristic of Longman's (Indopacetus pacificus), Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), and Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) beaked whales, as well as the unidentified beaked whale FM pulse known as the "BWC," along with narrow-band high frequency clicks from Kogia spp. The detection rate was substantially higher for all species on the five tracks in the region north of 15.5 degrees N than for those drifts occurring farther south. Species distribution models suggest that differences in the oceanographic characteristics between the northern and southern regions may impact foraging opportunities, possibly explaining the specific ecological niche for these species within this water mass. This is the first study of the distribution of cryptic cetacean species within the wider Mariana Archipelago region. We demonstrate that autonomous drifting acoustic recorders, combined with environmental sampling and remote satellite data are a powerful tool for studying the habitat dependent distribution of cryptic cetacean species.

AB  - Acoustic technologies have been applied in order to investigate and monitor underwater sound and have promoted achievements on the understanding of animal biology, behavior and ecology. Whales and dolphins produce sounds, which are unique, compared to other sounds in the marine environment. Passive acoustic surveys using a towed hydrophone array have become more accessible and widely used to explore patterns of occurrence, identifying critical habitats for several species of cetaceans and inferring about potential noise impacts over the populations. In this chapter we present characterization of acoustic signals produced by nine different cetacean species obtained form acoustic surveys. The species have species-specific qualities in their whistles and clicks. Acoustic methods can also offer population size estimates and identification of population structure.

AB  - Understanding environmental drivers of species' behavior is key for successful conservation. Within cetacean research, studies focused on understanding such drivers often consider local conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature), but rarely include large-scale, long-term parameters such as climate indices. Here we make use of long-term passive acoustic monitoring data to examine relationships between eight classes of toothed whales and climate indices, specifically El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, as well as local surface conditions (temperature, salinity, sea surface height) at two sites in the Hawaiian Archipelago. We find that El Nino Southern Oscillation most influenced cetacean detections at monitored sites. In many cases, detection patterns matched well with combinations of one or more climate indices and surface conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering climate indices in efforts to understand relationships between marine top predators and environmental conditions.
   The El Nino Southern Oscillation is the primary climate index influencing detections of eight classes of toothed whales at two sites in the Hawaiian Archipelago, according to an analysis of surface conditions, climate indices and long-term passive acoustic monitoring data.

AB  - Defining the appropriate scale over which to conduct a study in the marine environment is critical to achieving appropriate scientific, management, mitigation and conservation objectives. This paper focuses on applications of passive acoustic technologies over a range of spatial and temporal scales. It is divided into sections dealing with archival and real-time passive acoustic sensor applications. Each section assesses the principles behind using the respective technology and provides recent examples of research and management applications for marine mammals and fish. The section on archival sensors highlights the need for continued development of automated acoustic detectors to assess large data sets. Case studies are presented of detectors developed for determining seasonal occurrence and distribution of haddock sounds and humpback whale vocalizations. Also presented are studies of other applications using archival sensors: tracking singing humpback whales in Brazil, using vocalizations to assess the reproductive strategies of Arctic bearded seals and assessing regional variability in call patterns for North Atlantic right whales. The section on real-time passive acoustic sensors focuses on real-time buoys and towed arrays. Case studies presented include a real-time buoy system used for monitoring endangered North Atlantic right whales and a stationary autonomous array providing real-time access to Antarctic acoustic data. The value of using towed arrays for real-time applications is also assessed, and a case study is provided on the use of towed arrays to improve abundance estimates of North Pacific cetaceans and to better understand vocalization behaviors.

FX  - We thank B. Southall, D. Nowacek and H. Browman for the insight and innovation which made this theme section on passive acoustics possible. An immense number of people contributed to making the case studies in this manuscript happen. However, the hardware and software that were predominately used in these case studies was developed at the Bioacoustics Research Program at Cornell University, without which passive acoustics would not be what it is today. The hardware and software for the towed array studies are the result of a collaborative effort between J. Barlow, J. Oswald, D. K. Mellinger and S. Rankin. Funding for these case studies was received from Abrolhos National Marine Park, Animal Behavior Society, Brazilian Government (CAPES PhD Fellowship to R.S.S.L.), Brazilian Navy, Canon National Parks Science Scholars Program, Cornell University Lab of Ornithology, European Union Marie Curie Postdoctoral, Instituto Baleia Jubarte, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.

AB  - Passive acoustic detectors are widely used for monitoring distribution of cetaceans. Autonomous visual methods are less frequently employed; they are limited to detections during daylight and good weather, but offer potential advantages due to certainty of species' identification and longevity of deployment. To compare performance of acoustic and visual methods, temporal changes in distribution of southern right whales, Eubalaena australis, were monitored in the remote sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands (50 degrees 31' S, 166 degrees 16' E). A time-lapse camera was deployed for 2 years from August 2010, taking an image every 70 min. The presence of whales was scored for each image taken during daylight (n = 8295). A passive acoustic recorder was deployed in August 2011, recording for 3.75 min every hour until battery life expired after 10 months. Each recording (n = 6978) was aurally reviewed. Both methods revealed a similar seasonal distribution; maximum detection rates were in the austral winter and no whales were detected in January or February. However, at the peak of right whale occurrence, the proportion of samples with whales detected was much higher for the acoustic recorder (93.9% in August) than the time-lapse camera (14.8%). A generalised additive model fitted to the visual data revealed significant effects of sea state and visibility. Acoustic detection rates were higher, probably because detection range is greater, and less affected by weather. The solar-powered time-lapse camera system, however, functioned effectively for much longer. We discuss the relative merits of visual and acoustic detectors and attempt to draw conclusions about their efficacy for different focal species and monitoring locations.

AB  - Although the wider Eastern Tropical Pacific has been systematically surveyed during summer/fall, relatively little effort has focused on shelf and slope waters of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Such data are useful for establishing baseline information and assessing potential changes in cetacean occurrence and distribution relative to natural (e.g., El Nifio-Southern Oscillation, climate change) and anthropogenic factors. A visual acoustic survey for cetaceans occurred as part of a monitoring and mitigation program during an academic geophysical seismic study off Nicaragua and Costa Rica, during November-December 2004. Approximately 2 067 cetaceans representing at least seven species were seen in 75 groups during 373 h (3416 km) of daytime observations from the seismic research vessel (R/V) Maurice Ewing. The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) were the most frequently sighted species (30 % of all groups sighted); both were seen in shelf waters < 100 m deep and in slope waters. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus; 10 % of sightings) was the third most frequently sighted species and was only seen in water > 100 m deep. In addition, sightings were made of spinner dolphins (S. longirostris), short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), and unidentified dolphins and whales. Unconfirmed sightings of a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and a pod of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) were also recorded. An additional six groups of dolphins (50 % confirmed to species, all pantropical spotted dolphins) were made during 187 h (1549 km) of observation effort during darkness, two of which were detected within 30 m of the vessel bow using a night vision device. A total of 217 cetacean detections occurred during 633 h of passive acoustic monitoring. A small concentration of 12 humpback whales was seen in eight groups, and two humpbacks were recorded singing in the Gulf of Fonseca on 9 December 2004. To our knowledge, such concentrations of humpback whales, particularly singing humpbacks, have not been previously reported in this specific area. In addition, a humpback mother-calf pair, likely from the Northern Hemisphere population, was seen off Northern Costa Rica on 25 November 2004. Although cetacean sighting rates were significantly different during seismic and non-seismic periods even when corrected for differential detection probability related to sea conditions, our survey results do provide information to address previous data gaps on cetacean occurrence in shelf and slope waters off the Pacific coast of Central America during late fall.

AB  - The distribution and seasonal movements of sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus are poorly understood in the western North Atlantic Ocean, despite a long history of human exploitation of the species. Cetacean surveys in this region are typically conducted during the summer, when weather conditions are amenable for visual observation, resulting in a seasonal bias in species occurrence data. In the present study, we conducted multi-year passive acoustic monitoring to assess year-round sperm whale occurrence along the continental slope between Florida and New England, USA. Between 2011 and 2015, we collected 2037 d of recordings using bottom-mounted recorders deployed at 5 sites. We analyzed these recordings for sperm whale echolocation clicks, which were detected commonly between New England and North Carolina, but infrequently off the coast of Florida. In the northern half of the study region, we observed distinct seasonal patterns in the daily prevalence of sperm whale clicks, with a winter peak in occurrence off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, followed by an increase later in the spring at sites further north. South of Cape Hatteras, seasonal patterns were less apparent. We detected sperm whale clicks during all hours of the day throughout the study area, and did not observe strong diel patterns. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive year-round baseline on the occurrence of sperm whales across multiple recording sites, demonstrating the utility of passive acoustic monitoring to assess patterns in sperm whale occurrence across broad spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Although four species of odontocete and four species of baleen whale have been recorded in Prydz Bay, their vocalizations have been rarely investigated. Underwater vocalizations were recorded during March 2017 in Prydz Bay, Antarctica. Bio-duck sounds, downsweeps, inverted "u" shape signals, whistles, pulsed sounds, and broadband clicks were recorded. Bio-duck sounds and downsweeps were associated with Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) based on visual observations. Similarities between inverted "u" shape signals, biphonic calls, and clicks with vocalizations previously described for killer whales (Orcinus orca) lead us believe the presence of Antarctic killer whales. According to sound structures, signal characteristics, and recording location, Antarctic type C killer whales were the most probable candidates to produce these detected calls. These represent the first detection of inverted "u" shape signals in Antarctic waters, and the first report of Antarctic killer whale in Prydz Bay based on passive acoustic monitoring. The co-existence of Antarctic minke and killer whales may imply that minke whales can detect differences between the sounds of mammal-eating and fish-eating killer whales. Our descriptions of these underwater vocalizations contribute to the limited body of information regarding the distribution and acoustic behavior of cetaceans in Prydz Bay.

TI  - Beaked whale (<i>Mesoplodon densirostris</i>) passive acoustic detection in increasing ambient noise

KW  - ECHOLOCATION CLICKS
KW  - SOUND
AB  - Passive acoustic detection is being increasingly used to monitor visually cryptic cetaceans such as Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) that may be especially sensitive to underwater sound. The efficacy of passive acoustic detection is traditionally characterized by the probability of detecting the animal's sound emissions as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. The probability of detection can be predicted using accepted, but not necessarily accurate, models of the underwater acoustic environment. Recent field studies combining far-field hydrophone arrays with on-animal acoustic recording tags have yielded the location and time of each sound emission from tagged animals, enabling in-situ measurements of the probability of detection. However, tagging studies can only take place in calm seas and so do not reflect the full range of ambient noise conditions under which passive acoustic detection may be used. Increased surface-generated noise from wind and wave interaction degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of animal sound receptions at a given distance leading to a reduction in probability of detection. This paper presents a case study simulating the effect of increasing ambient noise on detection of M. densirostris foraging clicks recorded from a tagged whale swimming in the vicinity of a deep-water, bottom-mounted hydrophone array.

AB  - Sowerby's beaked whale is a deep-diving cetacean species specialized to live in the deep waters of the North Atlantic, including offshore Irish waters. Sightings of Sowerby's beaked whales in this area are infrequent and a substantial increase in our knowledge of their presence comes from recent static acoustic monitoring (SAM) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). However, most information on this species has been derived from stranding records, which provide opportunistic insights into this elusive species' cryptic life history. Here we report on the live stranding of a 1200 mm long neonate and an adult 5 m female Sowerby's beaked whale in July 2015 and on the stranding of a 4.9 m pregnant female in September 2020 with a 495 mm long male foetus in the south-west of Ireland. These stranding events provide an important insight into the reproductive life history of this species and provide further evidence that Sowerby's beaked whales calve in offshore Irish waters.

AB  - The temporal occurrence of deep diving cetaceans in the Josephine Seamount High Seas Marine Protected Area (JSHSMPA), south-west Portugal, was monitored using a passive acoustic recorder. The recorder was deployed on 13 May 2010 at a depth of 814m during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation cruise "Sirena10" and recovered on 6 June 2010. The recorder was programmed to record 40 s of data every 2 min. Acoustic data analysis, for the detection and classification of echolocation clicks, was performed using automatic detector/classification systems: M3R (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges), a custom MATLAB program, and an operator-supervised custom MATLAB program to assess the classification performance of the detector/classification systems. M3R CS-SVM algorithm contains templates to detect beaked whales, sperm whales, blackfish (pilot and false killer whales), and Risso's dolphins. The detections of each group of odontocetes was monitored as a function of time. Blackfish and Risso's dolphins were detected every day, while beaked whales and sperm whales were detected almost every day. The hourly distribution of detections reveals that blackfish and Risso's dolphins were more active at night, while beaked whales and sperm whales were more active during daylight hours.

AB  - Distribution models are needed to understand spatiotemporal patterns in cetacean occurrence and to mitigate anthropogenic impacts. Shipboard line-transect visual surveys are the standard method for estimating abundance and describing the distributions of cetacean populations. Ship-board surveys provide high spatial resolution but lack temporal resolution and seasonal coverage. Stationary passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) employs acoustic sensors to sample point locations nearly continuously, providing high temporal resolution in local habitats across days, seasons and years. To evaluate whether cross-platform data synthesis can improve distribution predictions, models were developed for Cuvier's beaked whales, sperm whales, and Risso's dolphins in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico using two different methods: generalized additive models and neural networks. Neural networks were able to learn unspecified interactions between drivers. Models that incorporated PAM datasets out-performed models trained on visual data alone, and joint models performed best in two out of three cases. The modeling results suggest that, when taken together, multiple species distribution models using a variety of data types may support conservation and management of Gulf of Mexico cetacean populations by improving the understanding of temporal and spatial species distribution trends.

AB  - A number of marine mammal species travel off Rausu, Shiretoko as feeding and breeding habitats, providing resources for tourism. However, seasonal sea ice and severe weather conditions have restricted visual observations of marine mammals off Rausu except for daytime observations between spring and fall. To compensate for this lack of information, fixed passive acoustic recording devices were deployed to monitor the presence of marine mammals during November 2012-March 2014. Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) burst pulsed calls in July, November, and December; ribbon seal (Histriophoca fasciata) downsweeps in February and March; killer whale (Orcinus orca) pulsed calls from April to August; and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) clicks in July and August were detected. Cetacean species were possibly involved in foraging since their pulsed calls or clicks were often detected during foraging. In contrast, ribbon seals were possibly involved in breeding behaviours as seal vocalizations are likely related to breeding activities. This passive acoustic monitoring will provide new insights into the ecology of diverse marine mammals off Rausu.

AB  - Acoustic survey methods can be used to estimate density and abundance using sounds produced by cetaceans and detected using hydrophones if the probability of detection can be estimated. For passive acoustic surveys, probability of detection at zero horizontal distance from a sensor, commonly called g(0), depends on the temporal patterns of vocalizations. Methods to estimate g(0) are developed based on the assumption that a beaked whale will be detected if it is producing regular echolocation clicks directly under or above a hydrophone. Data from acoustic recording tags placed on two species of beaked whales (Cuvier's beaked whale-Ziphius cavirostris and Blainville's beaked whale-Mesoplodon densirostris) are used to directly estimate the percentage of time they produce echolocation clicks. A model of vocal behavior for these species as a function of their diving behavior is applied to other types of dive data (from time-depth recorders and time-depth-transmitting satellite tags) to indirectly determine g(0) in other locations for low ambient noise conditions. Estimates of g(0) for a single instant in time are 0.28 [standard deviation (s.d.) = 0.05] for Cuvier's beaked whale and 0.19 (s.d. = 0.01) for Blainville's beaked whale.

AB  - The Arctic Ice Monitoring (AIM) observatory has been maintained on the Chukchi Plateau at 75.1 & DEG; N 168.0 & DEG; W nearly continuously since 2003. The AIM site consists of a submerged mooring that, since October 2008, has been instrumented with a passive acoustic recorder to sample ambient sound, with a focus on marine mammal detections in the High Arctic. Year-long data sets for 2009, 2012, and 2014-2020 were analyzed for the presence of signals from Arctic species including bowhead and beluga whales, bearded seals, and walrus. Calls from subarctic ribbon seals were commonly detected in autumn months, suggesting they have expanded their distribution much further northward. Killer whale calls were detected in recent years providing evidence that they have moved further north into the Pacific Arctic. No other subarctic cetaceans were heard. Year-round passive acoustic sampling of sounds produced by marine mammals over a decadal timescale has enhanced our understanding of how climate-driven changes in biodiversity are affecting even the very High Arctic.

AB  - We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetacean species in the Gulf of Alaska region. BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the known ranges of small and resident populations. This National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA)-led effort uses structured expert elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA's BIAs for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for these BIAs came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification data; and/or prey studies. A total of 20 BIAs were identified, delineated, and scored for six species: beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Of the 20 total BIAs, there were two small and resident populations, one migratory, and 17 feeding areas; no reproductive BIAs were identified. An additional five watch list areas were identified, a new feature to the second version of BIAs. In addition to more comprehensive narratives and maps, the BIA II products improve upon the first version by creating metadata tables and incorporating a scoring and labeling system which improves quantification and standardization of BIAs within and across regions. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans.

AB  - Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are a cosmopolitan species but are only found in ice-free regions of the ocean. It is unknown how their distribution might change in regions undergoing rapid loss of sea ice and ocean warming like Baffin Bay in the eastern Canadian Arctic. In 2014 and 2018, sperm whales were sighted near Eclipse Sound, Baffin Bay: the first recorded uses of this region by sperm whales. In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of sperm whales near Eclipse Sound using visual and acoustic data. We combine several published open-source, data sets to create a map of historical sperm whale presence in the region. We use passive acoustic data from two recording sites between 2015 and 2019 to investigate more recent presence in the region. We also analyze regional trends in sea ice concentration (SIC) dating back to 1901 and relate acoustic presence of sperm whales to the mean SIC near the recording sites. We found no records of sperm whale sightings near Eclipse Sound outside of the 2014/2018 observations. Our acoustic data told a different story, with sperm whales recorded yearly from 2015 to 2019 with presence in the late summer and fall months. Sperm whale acoustic presence increased over the 5-year study duration and was closely related to the minimum SIC each year. Sperm whales, like other cetaceans, are ecosystem sentinels, or indicators of ecosystem change. Increasing number of days with sperm whale presence in the Eclipse Sound region could indicate range expansion of sperm whales as a result of changes in sea ice. Monitoring climate change-induced range expansion in this region is important to understand how increasing presence of a top-predator might impact the Arctic food web.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers considerable potential for density estimation of cryptic cetaceans, such as beaked whales. However, comparative studies on the accuracy of PAM density estimates from these species are lacking. Concurrent, low-cost drifting PAM, with SoundTraps suspended at 200 m depth, and land-based sightings, were conducted off the Canary Islands. Beaked whale density was estimated using a cue-count method, with click production rate and the probability of click detection derived from digital acoustic recording tags (DTags), and distance sampling techniques, adapted to fixed-point visual surveys. Of 32 870 detections obtained throughout 206 h of PAM recordings, 68% were classified as "certain" beaked whale clicks. Acoustic detection probability was 0.15 [coefficient variation (CV) 0.24] and click production rate was 0.46 clicks s(-1) (CV 0.05). PAM density estimates were in the range of 21.5 or 48.6 whales per 1000 km(2) [CV 0.50 or 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.7-22.4 or 47-50.9), depending on whether "uncertain" clicks were considered. Density estimates from concurrent sightings resulted in 33.7 whales per 1000 km(2) (CV 0.77, 95% CI 8.9-50.5). Cue-count PAM methods under application provide reliable estimates of beaked whale density, over relatively long time periods and in realistic scenarios, as these match the concurrent density estimates obtained from visual observations.

AB  - Passive acoustic technologies and associated algorithms that detect, classify and localize marine mammals are becoming the preferred means of performing scientific investigations in the Marine Mammal Risk Mitigation (MMRM) project at the NATO Undersea Research Centre. During the last nine years, this robust scientific program has investigated, among other aspects, the habitat and behavior of the primary species of concern, Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris). The SIRENA '08 sea trial, conducted from 17 May to 18 June 2008 in the Alboran Sea, was the most recent sea trial in a series of such campaigns that supported the MMRM project. Operations aboard the NRV Alliance were divided into three phases; during phases 1 (19 - 27 May) and 2 (29 May - 6 June), line-transect surveys were performed using acoustic and visual methods to determine the presence and absence of cetaceans. During phase 3 (8 - 16 June), focal follow and tagging of Cuvier's beaked whales and long-finned pilot whales (Globicephela melas) were performed. Glider operations and visual observations were also performed from a shore station during all three phases. Several non-acoustic tools and techniques were used, tested and evaluated during SIRENA '08; however, this paper will focus on the passive acoustic technologies employed on the cruise.

AB  - Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications.

AB  - Visual observations of the marine biodiversity can be difficult in specific areas for different reasons, including weather conditions or a lack of observers. In such conditions, passive acoustics represents a potential alternative approach. The objective of this work is to demonstrate how information about marine biodiversity can be obtained via detailed analysis of the underwater acoustic environment. This paper presents the first analysis of the Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon (SPM) archipelago underwater acoustic environment. In order to have a better knowledge about the marine biodiversity of SPM, acoustic recordings were sampled at different time periods to highlight seasonal variations over several years. To extract information from these acoustic recordings, standard soundscape and ecoacoustic analysis workflow was used to compute acoustic metrics such as power spectral density, third-octave levels, acoustic complexity index, and sound pressure levels. The SPM marine acoustic environment can be divided into three main sound source classes: biophony, anthrophony, and geophony. Several cetacean species were encountered in the audio recordings including sperm whales (which were detected by visual observations and strandings of 3 males in 2014), humpback, and blue whales.

AB  - Aim: Understanding cetacean species' distributions and population structure over space and time is necessary for effective conservation and management. Geographic differences in acoustic signals may provide a line of evidence for population-level discrimination in some cetacean species. We use acoustic recordings collected over broad spatial and temporal scales to investigate whether global variability in echolocation click peak frequency could elucidate population structure in Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris), a cryptic species well-studied acoustically.Location: North Pacific, Western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.Time period: 2004-2021.Major taxa studied: Blainville's beaked whale.Methods: Passive acoustic data were collected at 76 sites and 150 cumulative years of data were analysed to extract beaked whale echolocation clicks. Using an automated detector and subsequent weighted network clustering on spectral content and interclick interval of clicks, we determined the properties of a primary cluster of clicks with similar characteristics per site. These were compared within regions and across ocean basins and evaluated for suitability as population-level indicators.Results: Spectral averages obtained from primary clusters of echolocation clicks identified at each site were similar in overall shape but varied in peak frequency by up to 8 kHz. We identified a latitudinal cline, with higher peak frequencies occurring in lower latitudes.Main conclusions: It may be possible to acoustically delineate populations of Blainville's beaked whales. The documented negative correlation between signal peak frequency and latitude could relate to body size. Body size has been shown to influence signal frequency, with lower frequencies produced by larger animals, which are subsequently more common in higher latitudes for some species, although data are lacking to adequately investigate this for beaked whales. Prey size and depth may shape frequency content of echolocation signals, and larger prey items may occur in higher latitudes, resulting in lower signal frequencies of their predators.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring systems are used to study cetaceans through the sounds they produce. Among them, toothed whales emit sequences of acoustic impulses having a rhythmic pattern. As they generally live in pods, click trains from several individuals are often interleaved and recorded together with additional natural or anthropogenic impulsive sources. This paper presents an algorithm that uses the rhythmic properties of odontocete click trains for detecting rhythmic impulse trains embedded in other impulse sounds and de-interleaving click trains from simultaneous clicking odontocetes. The contributions of the article are: (1) a method to detect the presence/absence of rhythmic click trains and to characterize the time - Inter Click Interval (ICI) pattern of click trains; (2) an analytical analysis of the performances of this method (jitter, length of click trains); (3) the demonstration of its efficiency on real data with wild beluga whales recorded in Canada.

AB  - Fixed passive acoustic monitoring can be used for long-term recording of vocalizing cetaceans. Both presence monitoring and animal density estimation requires the call rates and sound source levels of vocalizations produced by single animals. In this study, blue whale calls were recorded using acoustic bio-logging systems in Skjalfandi Bay off Husavik, Northeast Iceland, in June 2012. An accelerometer was attached to individual whales to monitor diving behavior. During 21 h recording two individuals, 8 h 45 min and 13 h 2 min, respectively, 105 and 104 lunge feeding events and four calls were recorded. All recorded calls were down-sweep calls ranging from 105 to 48Hz. The sound duration was 1-2 s. The source level was estimated to be between 158 and 169 dB re 1 mu Pa rms, assuming spherical sound propagation from the possible sound source location to the tag. The observed sound production rates and source levels of individual blue whales during feeding were extremely small compared with those observed previously in breeding grounds. The feeding whales were nearly acoustically invisible. The function of calls during feeding remains unknown. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), used for antisubmarine warfare (ASW), has been associated with multiple beaked whale (BW) mass stranding events. Multinational naval ASW exercises have used MFAS offshore of the Mariana Archipelago semi-annually since 2006. We report BW and MFAS acoustic activity near the islands of Saipan and Tinian from March 2010 to November 2014. Signals from Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), and a third unidentified BW species, were detected throughout the recording period. Both recorders documented MFAS on 21 August 2011 before two Cuvier's beaked whales stranded on 22-23 August 2011. We compared the history of known naval operations and BW strandings from the Mariana Archipelago to consider potential threats to BW populations. Eight BW stranding events between June 2006 and January 2019 each included one to three animals. Half of these strandings occurred during or within 6 days after naval activities, and this co-occurrence is highly significant. We highlight strandings of individual BWs can be associated with ASW, and emphasize the value of ongoing passive acoustic monitoring, especially for beaked whales that are difficult to visually detect at sea. We strongly recommend more visual monitoring efforts, at sea and along coastlines, for stranded cetaceans before, during and after naval exercises.

KW  - SOUNDS
AB  - The sea is home to a myriad of marine animal species, many of which use sound as a primary means of communication, navigation and foraging. Of particular interest are the Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) of the cetacean family. Massive commercial whaling prior to 1960 brought the species close to extinction and its population still remains very low. Passive acoustic monitoring of baleen whales has recently been used to provide long-term information about their presence and behavior, and provides an attractive complement to traditional visual based monitoring. In this work we present a frequency domain based algorithm developed for extracting the frequency contours of the dominant harmonic in tonal calls of blue whales (B and D cans). The algorithm uses a two pass approach to contour extraction. In the first pass, partial candidate contours are formed, followed by a second pass which uses the partial information to construct complete contours. When evaluated on a one hour labeled recording, the algorithm had 90% recall and 76% precision.

AB  - A single-hydrophone ocean glider was deployed within a cabled hydrophone array to demonstrate a framework for estimating population density of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) from a passive acoustic glider. The array was used to estimate tracks of acoustically active whales. These tracks became detection trials to model the detection function for glider-recorded 360-s windows containing fin whale 20-Hz pulses using a generalized additive model. Detection probability was dependent on both horizontal distance and low-frequency glider flow noise. At the median 40-Hz spectral level of 97 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz, detection probability was near one at horizontal distance zero with an effective detection radius of 17.1 km [coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.13]. Using estimates of acoustic availability and acoustically active group size from tagged and tracked fin whales, respectively, density of fin whales was estimated as 1.8 whales per 1000 km(2) (CV = 0.55). A plot sampling density estimate for the same area and time, estimated from array data alone, was 1.3 whales per 1000 km(2) (CV = 0.51). While the presented density estimates are from a small demonstration experiment and should be used with caution, the framework presented here advances our understanding of the potential use of gliders for cetacean density estimation.(c) 2022 Acoustical Society of America. https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0014793

AB  - Northern Hemisphere blue and fin whales are regular summer migrants to Arctic waters. Given the profound changes the Arctic is currently undergoing due to global warming, changes in habitat use and distribution of these migratory species are predicted. In this study, 3 passive acoustic recorders, 2 in Fram Strait about 95 km apart and 1 north of the Svalbard Archipelago (Atwain), were used to investigate the spatial and temporal vocal occurrence of these species in the Northeast Atlantic High Arctic. Acoustic data were available for 7 years for western Fram Strait (WFS), 2.5 years for central Fram Strait (CFS) and 3 years for Atwain. At both Fram Strait locations, most blue whale call detections occurred from August through October, though recently (2015-2018) in WFS a clear increase in blue whale call rates was detected in June/July, suggesting an expansion of the seasonal occurrence of blue whales. In WFS, fin whale calls were detected intermittently, at low levels, almost year-round. In CFS, fin whale calls were more frequent but occurred mainly from July through December. At Atwain, blue whale detections commenced in July, both species were recorded in September/October and fin whale calls extended into November. Results from this study provide novel long-term baseline information about the occurrence of blue and fin whales at extreme northerly locations, where traditional ship-based survey methods are seasonally limited. Continued sampling will support investigation of how environmental change influences cetacean distribution and habitat use.

AB  - Due to recent advances in passive acoustic monitoring techniques, beaked whales are now more effectively detected acoustically than visually during vessel-based (e.g. line-transect) surveys. Beaked whales signals can be discriminated from those of other cetaceans by the unique characteristics of their echolocation clicks (e.g. duration >175 mu s, center frequencies between 30 and 40 kHz, inter-click intervals between 0.2 and 0.4 s and frequency upsweeps). Furthermore, these same characteristics make these signals ideal candidates for testing automated detection and classification algorithms. There are several different beaked whale automated detectors currently available for use. However, no comparative analysis of detectors exists. Therefore, comparison between studies and datasets is difficult. The purpose of this study was to test, validate, and compare algorithms for detection of beaked whales in acoustic line-transect survey data. Six different detection algorithms (XBAT, Ishmael, PAMGUARD, ERMA, GMM and FMCD) were evaluated and compared. Detection trials were run on three sample days of towed-hydrophone array recordings collected by NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) during which were confirmed visual sightings of beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon peruvianus). Detections also were compared to human verified acoustic detections for a subset of these data. In order to measure the probabilities of false detection, each detector was also run on three sample recordings containing clicks from another species: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). Qualitative and quantitative comparisons and the detection performance of the different algorithms are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea provides habitat for globally threatened cetaceans. The Hellenic Trench is an Important Marine Mammal Area, providing core habitat for sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus and Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris. Surveys have characterized distributions of these species in near-shore areas (< 2000 m deep). Sparse survey effort in deeper waters during winter has allowed speculation that it is not an important habitat in winter. We used passive acoustic monitoring from towed arrays to document cetaceans during summer and winter, covering 18 366 km of trackline off the Peloponnese and Crete. We confirmed the acoustic presence of 5 odontocetes: sperm whales (n = 49 encounters; mean depth (<(x)over bar>): 3360 m; range (R): 1250 to 4210 m), Cuvier's beaked whales (n = 4; (x) over bar: 3070 m; R: 1970 to 3770 m), Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus (n = 5; (x) over bar: 3340 m; R: 2250 to 4440 m), striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba (n = 2; (x) over bar: 2980 m; R: 2490 to 3470 m) and rough-toothed dolphins Steno bredanensis (n = 1; 3650 m). We also encountered 224 unidentified delphinids, including a potential blackfish (3020 m). We confirmed that these species are present in the Hellenic Trench throughout the year. Given the impact of multiple threats on sperm and Cuvier's beaked whales in the Hellenic Trench, we suggest that policymakers follow the precautionary approach in managing human activities in the area. Ongoing seismic surveys, hydrocarbon extraction and uncontrolled shipping could have potentially negative effects on these species at the population level and we advise caution in permitting such activities in future.

AB  - Several groups of Sowerby's beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens) were encountered on July 4, 2011, during a shipboard cetacean survey conducted off the eastern seaboard of the United States. Acoustic recordings were collected using a three-element towed hydrophone array. Many echolocation clicks were recorded during the encounter, but no tonal sounds were detected. A total of 2969 echolocation clicks were included in analyses of frequency and temporal characteristics. A Gaussian mixture model with four mixtures was fitted to the histogram of peak frequencies; four subsets of clicks were designated. The majority of clicks (n=2048) contained a median peak frequency of 33 kHz, while the others contained a median peak frequency of 25 kHz (n=324), 51 kHz (n=304), or 67 kHz (n=293). Most clicks did not contain a clear frequency-modulated upsweep, though some clicks exhibited a slight sweep from 30-36 kHz. Seven burst pulses were detected in the encounter, two of which were of high enough quality for detailed analysis. The acoustic characteristics of Sowerby's beaked whales have not previously been described; the current study will facilitate incorporation of these data into passive acoustic monitoring programs in the North Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - Observations of cetaceans during the winter are difficult, if not impossible in some locations, yet their presence, habitat use, and behaviour during this period are important for conservation and management. Typically, observations come from vessel surveys, with citizen science networks increasingly adding significant sighting data. In compliment to this, acoustic data collection systems can be deployed to collect information remotely over long periods, and in almost any conditions. Here we describe how the combination of these data collection techniques works to fill knowledge gaps, with data from a wellestablished citizen science network, and a single passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) recorder integrated to identify killer whale presence during winter months in Clayoquot Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
   Together these data show the overwinter use of Clayoquot Sound by killer whales is greater than previously thought. During the study period, February 21 to April 25, 2015, the citizen science network noted 14 visual encounters ranging from Amphitrite Point to Hot Spring Cove, Vancouver Island. The PAM recorded 17 acoustic encounters within the 10 km detection radius of the recorder, deployed off Siwash Point, Flores Island. This included 15 encounters not recorded by the visual network. Both resident and Bigg's (transient) transient whale groups were recorded, although analysis of vocalizations determined that the majority of the encounters recorded acoustically were of northern resident killer whales. This may be a function of life history, with Bigg's killer whales typically noted to be less acoustically active, or could represent greater site use by this group. This first use of acoustic monitoring over the winter, complemented with visual data, can establish a better understanding of year-round use of this area by killer whales and has broader application to other sites.

AB  - In the frame of the European Sea-floor Observatory Network (ESONET) and in preparation of the Demonstration Mission Listening to the Deep-Ocean Environment (LIDO) algorithms for the automated real-time detection, classification and localisation of cetaceans have been developed.
   Such Passive Acoustic Monitoring techniques have the potential to play a key role in cetaceans' conservation for they allow a non-invasive study of their behaviour, a better knowledge of their population dynamics, and a better understanding of their dynamic relationship with their environment. This paper investigates the development of efficient and accurate techniques to be used as the basis of a localisation module for an automated real-time Passive Acoustic Monitoring system.
   An opportunity to assess the capabilities of the developed localisation modules was given by recordings collected with a bottom-mounted (around 2080 m depth) tetrahedral compact hydrophone array located offshore the port of Catania (Sicily) during the NEMO-ONDE campaign in the years 2005-2006 by INFN and CIBRA [2]. A well-known class of methods for acoustic source localisation is based on time differences of arrival (TDOA). Its capabilities have shown to be useful even in adverse situations (i.e., few sensors, high noise levels and/or poor calibration). A second class of methods, the space-time methods, originated in underwater applications such as sonar but reached its most significant achievements over the last 20 years in digital communications with recent progress in the treatment of broad-band signals. These developments are here revisited under the scope of the localisation and tracking of cetacean vocalisations.
   Various broadband space-time methods were implemented and allowed to map the sound radiated during the detected clicks and to consequently localise both sperm whales and vessels. Hybrid methods were also developed which improved the robustness of space-time methods to noise and reverberation and reduced processing time. In most cases, the small variance obtained for these estimates lessened the necessity of additional statistical clustering. Even though not independently confirmed by sightings, the tracks derived in the proposed frame can be considered to be consistent with the known movements of sperm whales and vessels.

AB  - Experimental research has shown that beaked whales exhibit strong avoidance reactions to naval active sonars used during antisubmarine warfare training exercises, including cessation of echolocation and foraging activity. Behavioural responses to sonar have also been linked to strandings and mortality. Much of the research on the responses of beaked whales and other cetaceans to naval active sonar has occurred on or near U.S. naval training ranges, and the impacts of sonar in other regions remain poorly understood, particularly as these impacts, including mortality, are likely to go unobserved in offshore areas. In September 2016 the multinational naval exercise 'CUTLASS FURY 2016' (CF16) was conducted off eastern Canada. We used passive acoustic recordings collected in the region to quantify the occurrence and characteristics of sonar signals, measure ambient noise levels, and assess changes in the acoustic activity of beaked and sperm whales. The number of hours per day with echolocation clicks from Cuvier's beaked whales and sperm whales were significantly reduced during CF16, compared to the pre-exercise period in 2016 (sperm whales) and to control data from 2015 (both species). Clicks from an unidentified Mesoplodont beaked whale species, sporadically detected prior to CF16, were absent during the exercise and for 7 days afterward. These results suggest that beaked and sperm whales ceased foraging in the vicinity of CF16 and likely avoided the affected area. Such disturbance may have energetic, health, and fitness consequences.

AB  - The development and broad use of passive acoustic monitoring techniques have the potential to help assessing the large-scale influence of artificial noise on marine organisms and ecosystems. Deep-sea observatories have the potential to play a key role in understanding these recent acoustic changes. LIDO (Listening to the Deep Ocean Environment) is an international project that is allowing the real-time long-term monitoring of marine ambient noise as well as marine mammal sounds at cabled and standalone observatories. Here, we present the overall development of the project and the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques to provide the scientific community with real-time data at large spatial and temporal scales. Special attention is given to the extraction and identification of high frequency cetacean echolocation signals given the relevance of detecting target species, e.g. beaked whales, in mitigation processes, e.g. during military exercises.

AB  - Oceanographic features and physical processes in the ocean can create regions where prey, and therefore predators, may accumulate. Beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas are the most numerous cetacean in the Arctic. In the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, they prefer continental slope habitat in summer and autumn, presumably because such areas provide enhanced foraging opportunities. Passive acoustic detections of beluga whale calls, current velocity measurements, historical wind records, and 29 yr of beluga whale observations from aerial surveys were used to explore the hypothesis that the foraging success of beluga whales in Barrow Canyon and along the western Beaufort Sea slope is enhanced when the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) is well-developed and flows east-northeastward and is diminished when the flow of the ACC and its shelf break extension are reversed. Aerial sightings of beluga whales, average observed beluga whale group size, and hours with whale vocalizations were more common when the ACC was well-developed and flowed east-northeastward. When the ACC flow is strong, it is separated from Arctic basin waters by a well-defined front that promotes aggregation of prey species. We speculate that the greater numbers of animals per group sighted and hours with recorded vocalizations may be indicative of enhanced foraging opportunities for beluga whales.

CP  - IEEE Workshop and Exhibition on New Trends for Environmental Monitoring using Passive Systems (PASSIVE'08)
AB  - This paper discusses on estimating the behavior of a sperm whale using hydrophones recordings thanks to a set of features extracted from a real-time passive underwater acoustic tracking algorithm for multiple emitting whales. Acoustic localization permits to study whales' behavior in deep water (several hundreds of meters) without infering with the environment. Here, we use a real-time multiple tracking algorithm, which provides a localization of one or several sperm whales. Thanks to the positions coordinates and the audio files, we are able to automatically label the signal and to extract different features such as the speed, energy of the clicks, Inter-Click-Interval (ICI)... These features allow us to cross-analyse the whale behavior (foraging, hunting, ingestion) and to see the influence of each parameters and the dependency between them. Finally, we generate a XML file for description and efficient access of deep ocean sound records for cetacean studies, which leads to index and structure the audio files. Thus, the behavior study is facilitated choosing and accessing the corresponding index in the recording. The complete method is processed on real data from the NUWC1 and the AUTEC(2). As an illustration, we process the algorithm on a one whale case and study the correlation between the features and the whale behavior during the diving.

AB  - For vocal animals with distinctive calls, passive acoustic monitoring can be used to infer presence, distribution, and abundance provided that the calls and calling behaviour are known. Key to enabling quantitative acoustic surveys are calibrated recordings of identified species from which the source parameters of the sounds can be estimated. Obtaining such information from free-ranging aquatic animals such as toothed whales requires multi-element hydrophone arrays, the use of which is often constrained by cost, the logistical challenge of long cables, and the necessity for attachment to a boat or mooring in order to digitise and store multiple channels of high-sample rate audio data. Such challenges are compounded when collecting recordings or tracking the diving behaviour of deep-diving animals for which the array must be deployed at depth. Here we report the development of an autonomous drifting deep-water vertical passive acoustic array that uses readily available off-the-shelf components. This lightweight portable array can be deployed quickly and repeatedly to depths of up to 1000 m from a small boat. The array comprises seven ST-300 HF SoundTrap autonomous recorders equally spaced on an 84 m electrical-mechanical cable. The single-channel digital sound recordings were configured to allow for synchronisation in post-processing using an RS-485 timing signal logged by all channels every second. We outline how to assemble the array, and provide software for time-synchronising the acoustic recorders. To demonstrate the utility of the array, we present an example of short-finned pilot whale clicks localised on the deep-water (700 m) array configuration. This array method has broad applicability for the cost-effective study of source parameters, acoustic ecology, and diving behaviour of deep diving toothed whales, which are valuable not only to understand the sensory ecology of deep-diving cetaceans, but also to improve passive acoustic monitoring for conservation and management.

AB  - Simple Summary The MARCET project (MAC/1.1b/149) aims to monitor the health status of resident cetaceans in Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) of particular interest for whale-watching in Macaronesia. This study, performed in the Canary Islands, Spain, used an autonomous surface vehicle (Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;)) to detect cetacean species using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). The automatic detections, via an acoustic acquisition system (Pambuoy), were compared with human detections for the same period. Although automatic detections were lower than human detections, this experiment has allowed the intercomparison of these two techniques, the system's performance, and its improvement by system re-setting. The present work, carried out with a close cooperation between biology, engineering, and oceanography, will integrate with veterinary sciences. The evaluation of ocean ecosystems, cetacean health, and human activities by means of advanced technologies will provide a novel and integrative One Health approach to current and future studies. Within the MARCET European project and community framework, a Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;) SV2 vehicle was deployed, equipped with a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) device, in a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). The soundscape was continuously recorded from 23 July 2018 until 30 July 2018 and was primarily used for marine mammal sound detection. This study aims to compare these automatically embedded detections from the Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;) with human expert detections. Furthermore, it provides an assessment of the performance of the automatic detector and discusses the use of this type of technology to monitor wildlife, particularly cetaceans. The MARCET project and this study are only possible due to the multidisciplinary integration of veterinary sciences, ecological, zoological, and biological knowledge and mechanical, communication, and electronics engineering. It represents an excellent example of new technologies, capacities, skills, and cutting-edge knowledge where veterinary science education and training should progressively be involved to contribute to the surveillance and control of ocean health.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is crucial to expanding the knowledge of beaked whales, including the northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) and Sowerby's beaked whale (Mesoplodon bidens). Existing descriptions of clicks produced by these species are limited by sample size, number of individuals recorded, and geographic scope. Data from multiple encounters in the western North Atlantic are used to provide a quantitative description of clicks produced by these species. Recordings from nine encounters with northern bottlenose whales in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were analyzed (N = 2239 clicks). The click type described had a median peak frequency of 25.9 kHz (10th-90th percentile range: 22.9-29.3 kHz), and a median inter-click interval (ICI) of 402 ms (N = 1917, 10th-90th percentile range: 290-524 ms). Recordings from 18 Sowerby's beaked whale encounters from Nova Scotia were analyzed (N = 762 clicks). The click type described had a median peak frequency of 65.8 kHz (10th-90th percentile range: 61.5-76.5 kHz), and a median ICI of 237 ms (N = 677, 10th-90th percentile range: 130-315 ms). These results will contribute to the development of methods to detect and classify beaked whale clicks to the species level, improving the effectiveness of PAM and enhancing scientific understanding and conservation efforts for cryptic and at-risk cetaceans.

AB  - For over two decades, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) methods have been successfully employed around the world for studying aquatic megafauna. PAM-driven studies in Indian waters have so far been relatively very scarce. Furthermore, cetacean populations inhabiting the north western Indian Ocean are far less studied than those in many other regions around the world. This work likely constitutes the first systematic study of the vocal repertoire of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at a near-shore site along the western coast of India. Analysis of the observed vocalizations provides an insight into the behaviour of the species. This is significant as it assists in developing a better understanding of the habitat use of the non-migratory Arabian Sea humpback whale population. In contrast, other breeding populations such as those around the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Australia have been relatively well studied. Underwater passive acoustic data were collected during March 2017 using an autonomous logger at a shallow-water site off the eastern edge of Grande Island off the coast of Goa. Humpback whale vocalizations were found to occur over multiple days in the recordings. Time-frequency contours of individual units of vocalization were extracted with the aid of an automatic detection technique and the characteristics of the units were measured. Further, successive units were analysed for formation of phrases and themes. Reconstruction of putative songs from the identified units and themes was not possible due to the limitations imposed by the nature of data collection. Detailed analyses of units, phrases and themes are presented.

TI  - Effects of duty cycle on passive acoustic monitoring metrics: The case of blue whale songs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

KW  - RECORDINGS
AB  - Long-term fixed passive acoustic monitoring of cetacean populations is a logistical and technological challenge, often limited by the battery capacity of the autonomous recorders. Depending on the research scope and target species, temporal subsampling of the data may become necessary to extend the deployment period. This study explores the effects of different duty cycles on metrics that describe patterns of seasonal presence, call type richness richness, and daily call rate of three blue whale acoustics populations in the Southern Indian Ocean. Detections of blue whale calls from continuous acoustic data were subsampled with three different duty cycles of 50%, 33%, and 25% within listening periods ranging from 1 min to 6 h. Results show that reducing the percentage of recording time reduces the accuracy of the observed seasonal patterns as well as the estimation of daily call rate and call call type richness. For a specific duty cycle, short listening periods (5-30 min) are preferred to longer listening periods (1-6 h). The effects of subsampling are greater the lower the species' vocal activity or the shorter their periods of presence. These results emphasize the importance of selecting a subsampling scheme adapted to the target species. (c) 2024 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) emits a typical short acoustic signal, defined as a "click", almost continuously while diving. It is produced in different time patterns to acoustically explore the environment and communicate with conspecifics. Each emitted click has a multi-pulse structure, resulting from the production of the sound within the sperm whale's head. A Stable Inter Pulse Interval (Stable IPI) can be identified among the pulses that compose a single click. Applying specific algorithms, the measurement of this interval provides useful information to assess the total length of the animal recorded. In January 2005, a cabled hydrophone array was deployed at a depth of 2,100 m in the Central Mediterranean Sea, 25 km offshore Catania (Ionian Sea). The acoustic antenna, named OvDE (Ocean noise Detection Experiment), was in operation until November 2006. OvDE provided real time acoustic data used to perform Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) of cetacean sound emissions. In this work, an innovative approach was applied to automatically measure the Stable IPI of the clicks, performing a cepstrum analysis to the energy (square amplitude) of the signals. About 2,100 five-minute recordings were processed to study the size distribution of the sperm whales detected during the OvDE long term deep-sea acoustic monitoring. Stable IPIs were measured in the range between 2.1 ms and 6.4 ms. The equations of Gordon (1991) and of Growcott (2011) were used to convert the IPIs into measures of size. The results revealed that the sperm whales recorded were distributed in length from about 7.5 m to 14 m. The size category most represented was from 9 m to 12 m (adult females or juvenile males) and specimens longer than 14 m (old males) seemed to be absent.

AB  - Long-term passive acoustic monitoring of cetaceans is frequently limited by the data storage capacity and battery life of the recording system. Duty cycles are a mechanism for subsampling during the recording process that facilitates long-term passive acoustic studies. While duty cycles are often used, there has been little investigation on the impact that this approach has on the ability to answer questions about a species' behavior and occurrence. In this study, the effects of duty cycling on the acoustic detection of southern resident killer whales (SRKW) (Orcinus orca) were investigated. Continuous acoustic data were subsampled to create 288 subsampled datasets with cycle lengths from 5 to 180 min and listening proportions from 1% to 67%. Duty cycles had little effect on the detection of the daily presence of SRKW, especially when using cycle lengths of less than an hour. However, cycle lengths of 15-30 min and listening proportions of at least 33% were required to accurately calculate durations of acoustic bouts and identify those bouts to ecotype. These results show that the optimal duty cycle depends on the scale of the research question and provide a framework for quantitative analysis of duty cycles for other marine species.

AB  - Acoustic signalling is the predominant form of communication among cetaceans. Understanding the behavioural state of calling individuals can provide insights into the specific function of sound production; in turn, this information can aid the evaluation of passive monitoring datasets to estimate species presence, density, and behaviour. Antarctic minke whales are the most numerous baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean. However, our knowledge of their vocal behaviour is limited. Using, to our knowledge, the first animal-borne audio-video documentation of underwater behaviour in this species, we characterize Antarctic minke whale sound production and evaluate the association between acoustic behaviour, foraging behaviour, diel patterns and the presence of close conspecifics. In addition to the previously described downsweep call, we find evidence of three novel calls not previously described in their vocal repertoire. Overall, these signals displayed peak frequencies between 90 and 175 Hz and ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 s on average (90% duration). Additionally, each of the four call types was associated with measured behavioural and environmental parameters. Our results represent a significant advancement in understanding of the life history of this species and improve our capacity to acoustically monitor minke whales in a rapidly changing Antarctic region.

AB  - From October 2011 to May 2012, we conducted the first marine mammal surveys of Okinawan waters, using line-transect vessel surveys and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). We obtained 913 km of visual survey effort, and 1,039 cumulative hours of PAM data from around the island. Only a single on-effort sighting was made (of two common bottlenose dolphins [Tursiops truncatus]) during visual surveys, and acoustic detection rates were generally low, with the exception of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) observations during their winter/spring breeding season. The apparent low density of at least some marine mammals observed in Okinawan waters may be due to the depletion of coastal populations. We believe this could result from many decades of heavy and largely-uncontrolled hunting of small cetaceans in waters around the island.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has been an effective tool to study cetaceans in remote regions of the Arctic. Here, we advance methods to acoustically identify the only two Arctic toothed whales, the beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhal (Monodon monoceros), using echolocation clicks. Long-term acoustic recordings collected from moorings in Northwest Greenland were analyzed. Beluga and narwhal echolocation signals were distinguishable using spectrograms where beluga clicks had most energy >30 kHz and narwhal clicks had a sharp lower frequency limit near 20 kHz. Changes in one-third octave levels (TOL) between two pairs of one-third octave bands were compared from over one million click spectra. Narwhal clicks had a steep increase between the 16 and 25 kHz TOL bands that was absent in beluga click spectra. Conversely, beluga clicks had a steep increase between the 25 and 40 kHz TOL bands that was absent in narwhal click spectra. Random Forest classification models built using the 16 to 25 kHz and 25 to 40 kHz TOL ratios accurately predicted the species identity of 100% of acoustic events. Our findings support the use of echolocation TOL ratios in future automated click classifiers for acoustic monitoring of Arctic toothed whales and potentially for other odontocete species.

AB  - Cetaceans are ecologically important marine predators, and designating individuals to distinct populations can be challenging. Passive acoustic monitoring provides an approach to classify cetaceans to populations using their vocalizations. In the Hawaiian Archipelago, three genetically distinct, sympatric false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) populations coexist: a broadly distributed pelagic population and two island-associated populations, an endangered main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) population and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) population. The mechanisms that sustain the genetic separation between these overlapping populations are unknown but previous studies suggest that the acoustic diversity between populations may correspond to genetic differences. Here, we investigated whether false killer whale whistles could be correctly classified to population based on their characteristics to serve as a method of identifying populations when genetic or photographic-identification data are unavailable. Acoustic data were collected during line-transect surveys using towed hydrophone arrays. We measured 50 time and frequency parameters from whistles in 16 false killer whale encounters identified to population and used those measures to train and test random forest classification models. Random forest models that included three populations correctly classified 42% of individual whistles overall and resulted in a low kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.15, indicating low agreement between models, and the true population. Whistles from the MHI population showed the highest correct classification rate (52%) compared to pelagic and NWHI whistles (42 and 36%, respectively). Pairwise random forest models classifying pelagic and MHI whistles proved slightly more accurate (62% accuracy, kappa = 0.24), though a similar pelagic-NWHI model did not (56% accuracy, kappa = 0.12). Results suggest that the time-frequency whistle characteristics are not suitable to confidently classify encounters to a specific false killer whale population, although certain features of whistles produced by the endangered MHI population allow for overall higher classification accuracy. Inclusion of other vocalization types, such as echolocation clicks, and alternative whistle variables may improve correct classification success for these sympatric populations.

AB  - Entanglement in net fisheries (static and drift) is the largest known cause of direct anthropogenic mortality to many small cetacean species, including harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), in UK waters. Despite this, little is known about the behaviour of small cetaceans in proximity to nets. We have developed a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) system for tracking the fine-scale three-dimensional (3D) movements of echolocating cetaceans around actively fishing nets by localising their acoustic clicks. The system consists of two compact four-channel acoustic recorders with sample-synchronised sensor packages that use 3D motion tracking technology to accurately calculate log orientation, depth, water temperature and ambient light level. Two recorders were used in tandem, with each one attached to and floating above the net floatline. The system can be deployed during normal fishing operations by a trained researcher or experienced fisheries observer. Recordings were analysed in PAMGuard software and the 3D positions of echolocating animals in the vicinity of the system were calculated using an acoustic particle filter-based localisation method. We present findings from four deployments in UK waters (each 1-2 days in duration) in which 12 distinct harbour porpoise encounters yielded a sufficient number of detected clicks to track their movements around the net. The tracks show a variety of behaviours, including multiple instances of animals actively foraging in close proximity to the fishing net. We show that a relatively inexpensive PAM system, which is practical to deploy from active fishing vessels, is capable of providing highly detailed data on harbour porpoise behaviour around nets. As harbour porpoises are the one of the most difficult species to localise, this methodology is likely to be suitable for elucidating the behaviour of many other toothed whale species in a variety of situations.

AB  - We present a passive acoustic method for estimating the density of echolocating cetaceans that dive synchronously, based on isolation of dive starts using a field of distributed bottom-mounted hydrophones. The method assumes that all dive starts of the target species within a defined area are detected, and that independent estimates of dive rate and group size are available. We apply the method to estimate the density of Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas during the time of a multi-ship active sonar exercise. Estimated densities for the 65 h before the exercise, 68 h during, 65 h after, and the final 43 h monitored were 16.99 (95% Cl 13.47-21.43), 4.76(3.78-6.00), 8.67(6.87-10.94), and 24.75 (19.62-31.23) respectively, illustrating a possible avoidance reaction. Results for the 65 h before were compared with those from the click count density estimation algorithm developed by Marques et al. [Marques T, Thomas L, Ward J, DiMarzio N, Tyack P. Estimating cetacean population density using fixed passive acoustic sensors. An example with Blainville's beaked whales. J Acoust Soc Am 2009;125(4):1982-1994]. The click count-based estimate was 19.23 animals/1000 km(2) (95% CI 12.69-29.13)-similar (13% higher), but with higher variance (CV 21% for click count method versus 12% for the dive count method). We discuss potential reasons for the differences, and compare the utility of the two methods. For both, obtaining reliable estimates of the factors that scale the measured quantity (dive starts or detected clicks) to density is the key hurdle. Defining the area monitored in the dive count method can also be problematic, particularly if the array is small. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The recently named Rice's whale in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most endangered whales in the world, and improved knowledge of spatiotemporal occurrence patterns is needed to support their recovery and conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring methods for determining spatiotemporal occurrence patterns require identifying the species' call repertoire. Rice's whale call repertoire remains unvalidated though several potential call types have been identified. This study uses sonobuoys and passive acoustic tagging to validate the source of potential call types and to characterize Rice's whale calls. During concurrent visual and acoustic surveys, acoustic-directed approaches were conducted to obtain visual verifications of sources of localized sounds. Of 28 acoustic-directed approaches, 79% led to sightings of balaenopterid whales, of which 10 could be positively identified to species as Rice's whales. Long-moan calls, downsweep sequences, and tonal-sequences are attributed to Rice's whales based on these matches, while anthropogenic sources are ruled out. A potential new call type, the low-frequency downsweep sequence, is characterized from tagged Rice's whale recordings. The validation and characterization of the Rice's whale call repertoire provides foundational information needed to use passive acoustic monitoring for better understanding and conservation of these critically endangered whales.

AB  - The Naval Undersea Warfare Center has been funded by the Office of Naval Research Environmental Requirements Advanced Technology (ERAT) program to create a multi-disciplinary program to conduct Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Undersea Ranges((MR)-R-3). The objective is to supplement extensive undersea range and signal processing hardware with state of the art passive marine mammal detection, localization and tracking algorithms. This system will provide the opportunity to determine the number of acoustically active species within an instrumented, open ocean area and to evaluate baseline behavior. The initial system will be demonstrated at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), Andros Island, Bahamas. Many of the existing assets at AUTEC will be leveraged, including the data collected by the ongoing marine mammal monitoring program. Undersea range coverage at AUTEC includes a steep island slope feature that may serve as a feeding habitat for several cetaceans including the sperm whale (Physter macrocephalus), short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and several species of dolphins. The development of a database of marine mammal recordings at AUTEC is currently underway using five-minute recordings taken once every half hour. The (MR)-R-3 program is increasing the rate of acoustic data collection at AUTEC and evaluating the ability to passively track the location of various species based on features of the transient acoustic marine mammal calls.

AB  - Passive acoustic surveys are becoming increasingly popular as a means of surveying for cetaceans and other marine species. These surveys yield large amounts of data, the analysis of which is time consuming and can account for a substantial proportion of the survey budget. Semi-automatic processes enable the bulk of processing to be conducted automatically while allowing analyst time to be reserved for validating and correcting detections and classifications. Existing modules within the Passive Acoustic Monitoring software PAMGuard were used to process a large (25.4 Terabyte) dataset collected during towed acoustic ship transits. The recently developed 'Multi-Hypothesis Tracking Click Train Detector' and the 'Whistle and Moan Detector' modules were used to identify occasions within the dataset at which vocalising toothed whales (odontocetes) were likely to be acoustically present. These putative detections were then reviewed by an analyst, with false positives being corrected. Target motion analysis provided a perpendicular distance to odontocete click events enabling the estimation of detection functions for both sperm whales and delphinids. Detected whistles were assigned to the lowest taxonomical level possible using the PAMGuard 'Whistle Classifier' module. After an initial tuning process, this semi-automatic method required 91 hr of an analyst's time to manually review both automatic click train and whistle detections from 1,696 hr of survey data. Use of the 'Multi-Hypothesis Tracking Click Train Detector' reduced the amount of data for the analyst to search by 74.5%, while the 'Whistle and Moan Detector' reduced data to search by 85.9%. In total, 443 odontocete groups were detected, of which 55 were from sperm whale groups, six were from beaked whales, two were from porpoise and the remaining 380 were identified to the level of delphinid group. An effective survey strip half width of 3,277 and 699 m was estimated for sperm whales and delphinids respectively. The semi-automatic workflow proved successful, reducing the amount of analyst time required to process the data, significantly reducing overall project costs. The workflow presented here makes use of existing modules within PAMGuard, a freely available and open-source software, readily accessible to acoustic analysts.

AB  - To achieve effective management and understanding of risks associated with increasing anthropogenic pressures in the ocean, it is essential to successfully and efficiently collect data with high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are an example of technological advances with potential to provide improved information on ocean processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of a low -power AUV buoyancy glider for performing long endurance biological and environmental data acquisition in Northern Norway. We deployed a passive acoustic sensor system onboard a SeagliderTM to investigate presence and distribution of cetaceans while concurrently using additional onboard sensors for recording environmental features (temperature, salinity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a). The hydrophone recorded over 108.6 h of acoustic data during the spring months of March and April across the continental shelf break and detected both baleen and odontocete species. We observed a change in cetacean detections throughout the survey period, with humpback whale calls dominating the soundscape in the first weeks of deployment, coinciding with the migration toward their breeding grounds. From mid-April, sperm whales and delphinids were the predominant species, which coincided with increasing chlorophyll a fluorescence values associated with the spring phytoplankton blooms. Finally, we report daily variations in background noise associated with fishing activities and traffic in the nearby East Atlantic shipping route. Our results show that gliders provide excellent platforms for collecting information about ecosystems with minimal disturbance to animals, allowing systematic observations of our ocean biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics in response to natural variations and industrial activities.

AB  - The Gulf of Alaska is an important habitat for a diverse array of marine mammals, many of which were severely depleted by historical whaling. To study current cetacean distributions in this region, passive acoustic monitoring was used to detect species-specific call types between 2011 and 2015 at five locations spanning the continental shelf, slope, and offshore seamounts. Spatial and temporal detection patterns were examined for nine species to compare differences in behavior and habitat use. Mysticetes showed seasonal increases in calling that indicated possible behavioral shifts between feeding and breeding in blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales, and matched known migration timing of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Interannual changes in blue and fin whale calling may relate to the marine heat wave that began in 2013 and lasted through the end of the monitoring period. Odontocete detections revealed unique spatial distributions, with killer whales (Orcinus orca) most common on the continental shelf and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) most common on the continental slope, where detections occurred year-round. Beaked whales showed both spatial and temporal separation: Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii) detections were highest at Quinn Seamount in the spring, Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) at Pratt Seamount in winter, and Stejneger's (Mesoplodon stejnegeri) on the continental slope in the fall. The year-round presence of many species highlights the ecological importance of the Gulf of Alaska and the spatiotemporal information reported here should inform future conservation efforts.

AB  - Methods are developed for estimating the size/density of cetacean populations using data from a set of fixed passive acoustic sensors. The methods convert the number of detected acoustic cues into animal density by accounting for (i) the probability of detecting cues, (ii) the rate at which animals produce cues, and (iii) the proportion of false positive detections. Additional information is often required for estimation of these quantities, for example, from an acoustic tag applied to a sample of animals. Methods are illustrated with a case study: estimation of Blainville's beaked whale density over a 6 day period in spring 2005, using an 82 hydrophone wide-baseline array located in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas. To estimate the required quantities, additional data are used from digital acoustic tags, attached to five whales over 21 deep dives, where cues recorded on some of the dives are associated with those received on the fixed hydrophones. Estimated density was 25.3 or 22.5 animals/1000 km(2), depending on assumptions about false positive detections, with 95% confidence intervals 17.3-36.9 and 15.4-32.9. These methods are potentially applicable to a wide variety of marine and terrestrial species that are hard to survey using conventional visual methods. (c) 2009 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Globally, the Indian Ocean appears to have the greatest blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus ssp) acoustic diversity, with at least four acoustic populations from three defined sub-species. To understand how these different populations use this region as habitat, we first need to characterize their spatial and seasonal distributions. Here, we build on previous passive acoustic monitoring studies and analyze a passive acoustic dataset spanning large temporal (9 years) and spatial (3-9 sites covering more than 12 million km(2) of potential acoustic habitat in the southwest Indian Ocean) scales. A novel detection algorithm was employed to investigate the long-term presence of Antarctic blue whale and SEIO and SWIO pygmy blue whale calls. We found that Antarctic and pygmy blue whales have completely different spatial and seasonal distribution in the southern Indian Ocean. Antarctic blue whales are heard almost year-round on the whole array, with great inter-annual variability. The two pygmy blue whales share a highly stable seasonal acoustic presence, but their geographical distributions overlap at only a few central Indian Ocean sites. However, Antarctic and pygmy blue whale acoustic co-occurrence is common, especially in sub-tropical waters. These temporal and spatial distributions strengthen our understanding of seasonal occurrence and habitat use of distinct populations of blue whales in the southern Indian Ocean. A better comprehension of the ecology of Indian Ocean blue whales will require interdisciplinary studies to examine the drivers of the variability seen from passive acoustic studies.

AB  - Habitat use by the endangered Mediterranean sperm whale subpopulation remains poorly understood, especially in winter. The sustained presence of oceanographic autonomous underwater vehicles in the area presents an opportunity to improve observation effort, enabling collection of valuable sperm whale distribution data, which may be crucial to their conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring loggers were deployed on vertically profiling oceanographic gliders surveying the north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2012-2013 and June 2014. Sperm whale echolocation `usual click' trains, characteristic of foraging activity, were detected and classified from the recordings, providing information about the presence of sperm whales along the glider tracks. Widespread presence of sperm whales in the north-western Mediterranean Sea was confirmed. Winter observations suggest different foraging strategies between the Ligurian Sea, where mobile and scattered individuals forage at all times of day, and the Gulf of Lion, where larger aggregations target intense oceanographic features in the open ocean such as fronts and mixing events, with reduced acoustic presence at dawn. This study demonstrates the ability to successfully observe sperm whale behaviour from passive acoustic monitoring gliders. We identified possible mission design changes to optimize data collected from passive acoustic monitoring glider surveys and significantly improve sperm whale population monitoring and habitat use.

AB  - We integrated existing published and unpublished information to delineate Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for fin, gray, North Pacific right, and humpback whales, and belugas in U.S. waters of the Gulf of Alaska. BIAs are delineated for feeding, migratory corridors, and small and resident populations. Supporting evidence for these BIAs came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; traditional ecological knowledge; photo-and genetic-identification data; whaling data, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents; prey studies; and anecdotal information from fishermen. The geographic extent of the BIAs in this region ranged from approximately 900 to 177,000 km(2). Information gaps identified during this assessment include (1) reproductive areas for fin, gray, and North Pacific right whales; (2) detailed information on the migration routes of all species; (3) detailed information on the migratory timing of all species except humpback whales; and (4) cetacean distribution, density, and behavior in U.S. Gulf of Alaska waters off the continental shelf. To maintain their utility, these BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.

AB  - Noise pollution in the marine environment is an emerging but serious concern. Its implications are less well understood than other global threats and largely undetectable to everyone but the specialist. In addition, the assessment of the acoustic impact of artificial sounds in the sea is not a trivial task, certainly because there is a lack of information on how the marine organisms process and analyze sounds and how relevant these sounds are for the balance and development of the populations. Further, this possible acoustic impact not only concerns the hearing systems but may also affect other sensory or systemic levels and result equally lethal for the animal concerned. If we add that the negative consequences of a short or long term exposure to artificial sounds may not be immediately observed one can understood how challenging it is to obtain objective data allowing an efficient control of the introduction of anthropogenic sound in the sea. To answer some of these questions, the choice to investigate cetaceans and their adaptation to an aquatic environment is not fortuitous. Cetaceans, because of their optimum use of sound as an ad-hoc source of energy and their almost exclusive dependence on acoustic information, represent not only the best bio-indicator of the effects of noise pollution in the marine environment, but also a source of data to improve and develop human underwater acoustic technology. Here, we present how the characteristics and performance of the sperm whale mid-range biosonar can be used to develop a mitigation solution based on passive acoustics and ambient noise imaging to prevent negative interactions with human activities by monitoring cetacean movements in areas of interest.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become a popular method for studying both marine mammal behavior and distribution, especially among cetaceans. The Antarctic minke whale ( Balaenoptera bonaerensis ) occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, and our knowledge concerning its vocal behavior is very limited. Along the coast of Uruguay, minke whales constitute one of the species with the most stranding data collected. Until now, sounds of Antarctic minke whales had never been recorded off the Uruguayan coast. Two different bio-duck call types were recorded along the Atlantic Ocean and the Rio de la Plata River coasts by employing PAM stations off the coast of Uruguay in five different positions. One call was recorded off the Atlantic coast, and the four other calls were recorded along the Rio de la Plata River, including the classic bio-duck call. In addition to the aforementioned bio-duck call, evidence of a novel call, the bio-duck pulse train, was found. This call was produced in an environment very different from the oceanic environment. The bioduck pulse train has never been described in previous works, making the findings of the present work all the more novel.

AB  - Acoustic bio-sonar characteristics of non-marine toothed whales are very critical for any conservation efforts using passive acoustic monitoring. The acoustic surveys have now been recognized as effective methods for freshwater cetaceans monitoring and abundance estimation compared to the traditional visual surveys. These species have been declared as data deficient by the IUCN and acoustic surveys present themselves as the relatively cost-effective approach. Irrawaddy dolphins Orcaella brevirostris referred to as facultative freshwater cetaceans because they occupy both fresh-and near-shore marine waters are among the cetaceans at greatest risk to population extirpation and perhaps extinction. Their vulnerability stems from habitat requirements that are coupled to marine and freshwater habitats subjected to intense human intervention. The bio-sonar characteristics of these species are highly sensitive to their habitat and the Irrawaddy dolphins are spread across varied environments over distant geographic locations. A good understanding of their acoustic bio-sonar characteristics across habitats can potentially provide significant conservation inputs. The two habitats considered in this work are contrasting in their origin and evolution. The first is the rivers systems of the Sundarbans mangrove forest with a deltaic habitat and second is the Chilika Lagoon with rain water and high tide fed habitat. Detailed analysis of the Sundarbans Irrawaddy dolphins were reported in 2013 with well-defined acoustic signal parameters. The authors have applied the same parameters for a comprehensive comparison of the species in the two habitats with a critical review on the correlation of the habitat features and the acoustic bio-sonar characteristics. Long term recording of the dolphin clicks in the Chilika lagoon have been analyzed and compared with the Sunderbans results available in the open literature. The acoustic parameters and their physical correlation with the animal behaviour and the habitat status have been presented. Multiple parameters such as centroid frequency, peak frequency, signal source level, bandwidth, duration of clicks, inter-click interval etc have been considered for the study.

AB  - Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) inhabit a wide variety of ecosystems including both low- and high-latitude areas. Understanding the habitat selection of humpback whale populations is key for humpback whale stock management and general ecosystem management. In the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (ASSO), the investigation of baleen whale distribution by sighting surveys is temporally restricted to the austral summer. The implementation of autonomous passive acoustic monitoring, in turn, allows the study of vocal baleen whales year-round. This study describes the results of analysing passive acoustic data spanning 12 recording positions throughout the ASSO applying a combination of automatic and manual analysis methods to register humpback whale acoustic activity. Humpback whales were present at nine recording positions with higher acoustic activities towards lower latitudes and the eastern and western edges of the ASSO. During all months, except December (the month with the fewest recordings), humpback whale acoustic activity was registered in the ASSO. The acoustic presence of humpback whales at various locations in the ASSO confirms previous observations that part of the population remains in high-latitude waters beyond austral summer, presumably to feed. The spatial and temporal extent of humpback whale presence in the ASSO suggests that this area may be used by multiple humpback whale breeding populations as a feeding ground.

AB  - Recent observations of cetacean mass strandings, coincident with anthropogenic sounds emissions, have raised concerns on the potential environmental impact of underwater noise. Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) was reported in all the cited stranding events. Within the NATO Marine Mammal Risk Mitigation project (MMRM), multiple interdisciplinary sea trials have been conducted in the Mediterranean Sea with the objective of developing tools and procedures to mitigate the impact of underwater sound emissions. During these cruises, visual observations, passive acoustic detections and environmental data were collected. The aim of this study was to evaluate "a priori" predictions of Cuvier's beaked whale presence in the Alboran Sea, using models developed in the Ligurian Sea that employ bathymetric and chlorophyll features as predictors. The accuracy of these predictions was found adequate and elements are given to account for the uncertainties associated to the use of models developed in areas different from their calibration site.

AB  - The study of humpback whale song using passive acoustic monitoring devices requires bioacousticians to manually review hours of audio recordings to annotate the signals. To vastly reduce the time of manual annotation through automation, a machine learning model was developed. Convolutional neural networks have made major advances in the previous decade, leading to a wide range of applications, including the detection of frequency modulated vocalizations by cetaceans. A large dataset of over 60 000 audio segments of 4 s length is collected from the North Atlantic and used to fine-tune an existing model for humpback whale song detection in the North Pacific (see Allen, Harvey, Harrell, Jansen, Merkens, Wall, Cattiau, and Oleson (2021). Front. Mar. Sci. 8, 607321). Furthermore, different data augmentation techniques (time-shift, noise augmentation, and masking) are used to artificially increase the variability within the training set. Retraining and augmentation yield F-score values of 0.88 on context window basis and 0.89 on hourly basis with false positive rates of 0.05 on context window basis and 0.01 on hourly basis. If necessary, usage and retraining of the existing model is made convenient by a framework (AcoDet, acoustic detector) built during this project. Combining the tools provided by this framework could save researchers hours of manual annotation time and, thus, accelerate their research.

AB  - Understanding the seasonal movements and distribution patterns of migratory species over ocean basin scales is vital for appropriate conservation and management measures. However, assessing populations over remote regions is challenging, particularly if they are rare. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus spp) are an endangered species found in the Southern and Indian Oceans. Here two recognized subspecies of blue whales and, based on passive acoustic monitoring, four "acoustic populations" occur. Three of these are pygmy blue whale (B. m. brevicauda) populations while the fourth is the Antarctic blue whale (B. m. intermedia). Past whaling catches have dramatically reduced their numbers but recent acoustic recordings show that these oceans are still important habitat for blue whales. Presently little is known about the seasonal movements and degree of overlap of these four populations, particularly in the central Indian Ocean. We examined the geographic and seasonal occurrence of different blue whale acoustic populations using one year of passive acoustic recording from three sites located at different latitudes in the Indian Ocean. The vocalizations of the different blue whale subspecies and acoustic populations were recorded seasonally in different regions. For some call types and locations, there was spatial and temporal overlap, particularly between Antarctic and different pygmy blue whale acoustic populations. Except on the southernmost hydrophone, all three pygmy blue whale acoustic populations were found at different sites or during different seasons, which further suggests that these populations are generally geographically distinct. This unusual blue whale diversity in sub-Antarctic and sub-tropical waters indicates the importance of the area for blue whales in these former whaling grounds.

AB  - Automated methods were developed to detect fin whale calls recorded by an array of ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) deployed off the Portuguese coast between 2007 and 2008. Using recordings collected on a single day in January 2008, a standard seismological method for estimating earthquake location from single instruments, the three-component analysis, was used to estimate the relative azimuth, incidence angle, and horizontal range between each OBS and detected calls. A validation study using airgun shots, performed prior to the call analysis, indicated that the accuracy of the three-component analysis was satisfactory for this preliminary study. Point transect sampling using cue counts, a form of distance sampling, was then used to estimate the average probability of detecting a call via the array during the chosen day. This is a key step to estimating density or abundance of animals using passive acoustic data. The average probability of detection was estimated to be 0.313 (standard error: 0.033). However, fin whale density could not be estimated due to a lack of an appropriate estimate of cue (i.e., vocalization) rate. This study demonstrates the potential for using a sparse array of widely spaced, independently operating acoustic sensors, such as OBSs, for estimating cetacean density.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) with autonomous bottom-moored recorders is widely used to study cetacean occurrence, distribution and behaviors, as it is less affected by factors that limit other observation methods (e.g., vessel, land and aerial-based surveys) such as inclement weather, sighting conditions, or remoteness of study sites. During the winter months in Hawai'i, humpback whale male song chorusing becomes the predominant contributor to the local soundscape and previous studies showed a strong seasonal pattern, suggesting a correlation with relative whale abundance. However, the relationship between chorusing levels and abundance, including non-singing whales, is still poorly understood. To investigate how accurately acoustic monitoring of singing humpback whales tracks their abundance, and therefore is a viable tool for studying whale ecology and population trends, we collected long-term PAM data from three bottom-moored Ecological Acoustic Recorders off west Maui, Hawaii during the winter and spring months of 2016-2021. We calculated daily medians of root-mean-square sound pressure levels (RMS SPL) of the low frequency acoustic energy (0-1.5 kHz) as a measure of cumulative chorusing intensity. In addition, between December and April we conducted a total of 26 vessel-based line-transect surveys during the 2018/19 through 2020/21 seasons and weekly visual surveys (n = 74) from a land-based station between 2016 and 2020, in which the location of sighted whale pods was determined with a theodolite. Combining the visual and acoustic data, we found a strong positive second-order polynomial correlation between SPLs and abundance (land: 0.72 <= R-2 <= 0.75, vessel: 0.81 <= R-2 <= 0.85 for three different PAM locations; Generalized Linear Model: p(land) MUCH LESS-THAN 0.001, p(vessel) MUCH LESS-THAN 0.001) that was independent from recording location (p(land) = 0.23, p(vessel) = 0.9880). Our findings demonstrate that PAM is a relatively low-cost, robust complement and alternative for studying and monitoring humpback whales in their breeding grounds that is able to capture small-scale fluctuations during the season and can inform managers about population trends in a timely manner. It also has the potential to be adapted for use in other regions that have previously presented challenges due to their remoteness or other limitations for conducting traditional surveys.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be an effective tool for studying marine fauna in coral reefs and other ecosystems. We analyzed PAM data from 2006 to 2009 at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. We measured received sound pressure levels (SPL) over time within different frequency bands from 0 to 20 kHz, and used automated and manual techniques to detect parrotfish scrapes and cetacean vocalizations. SPLs were greatest overall in the snapping-shrimp-dominated bands above 2.5 kHz, and they increased at night and decreased during cold months. In frequency bands <1.5 kHz, containing mainly fish sounds (and seasonal whale song), SPL peaked at dawn and dusk. Humpback whale song was detected in December through April; occurrence was greater during 2008-2009 than 2006-2007, possibly reflecting an increase in whale density near FFS. Parrotfish bite sounds were detected year-round, and parrotfish foraged most actively during the afternoon. Dolphins were detected on 12-64 % of days per month, with low levels of activity during the day that increased in late afternoon and were highest at night. More frequent detections of dolphins in February/March 2007, October 2008, and February/March 2009 may correspond to pulses of food availability via the mesopelagic prey community. Minke whale "boing" sounds were detected from late October, with one or two peaks in the December-March period; during March 2009 minke whale calls were present nearly every day. The results provide the first long-term record of minke whales in the NWHI, and show the potential of PAM on remote coral reefs to monitor patterns over time of many trophic levels, from herbivores to apex predators.

AB  - The economic relevance of Mysticetes has prompted marine ecologists and biologists to investigate this suborder of cetaceans. Mysticetes produce distinct vocal repertoires, which are recorded to analyse the behaviour of the species within its ecology. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a standard technique for tracking Mysticete movement and vocalisation. PAM collects enormous datasets over a long period, making it practically impossible to analyse with typical visual examination methods. Machine learning (ML) techniques such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) have made automatic recognition and analysis of extensive sound recordings possible. Nevertheless, the performance of ML tools is determined by the adopted feature extraction technique. Hence, this article introduces the method of principal component analysis (PCA) as a performance-efficient alternative feature extraction technique for detecting Mysticete vocalisations using HMM. Performance of the developed PCA-HMM detector is compared with state-of-the-art detectors using two different Mysticete vocalisations (Humpback whale songs and Bryde's whale short pulses). In both species, results show that the PCA-HMM detector has the best performance and is more suitable for use in real-time application since it exhibits less computational time complexity.

AB  - We integrated existing published and unpublished information to delineate Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for bowhead, fin, gray, North Pacific right, and humpback whales and belugas in U.S. waters of the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea. Supporting evidence for these BIAs came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; traditional ecological knowledge; photo-and genetic-identification data; and whaling data, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents. The geographic extent of the BIAs in this region ranged from approximately 1,200 to 373,000 km(2). Information gaps identified during this assessment include (1) reproductive areas for all species; (2) detailed information on the migration routes and timing of all species; and (3) cetacean distribution, density, and behavior in U.S. Bering Sea waters off the continental shelf. To maintain their utility, these BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.

AB  - The growing availability of long-term and large-scale passive acoustic recordings open the possibility of monitoring the vocal activity of elusive oceanic species, such as fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), in order to acquire knowledge on their distribution, behavior, population structure and abundance. Fin whales produce low-frequency and high-intensity pulses, both as single vocalizations and as song sequences (only males) which can be detected over large distances. Numerous distant fin whales producing these pulses generate a so-called chorus, by spectrally and temporally overlapping single vocalizations. Both fin whale pulses and fin whale chorus provide a distinct source of information on fin whales present at different distances to the recording location. The manual review of vast amounts of passive acoustic data for the presence of single vocalizations and chorus by human experts is, however, time-consuming, often suffers from low reproducibility and in its entirety, it is practically impossible. In this publication, we present and compare robust algorithms for the automatic detection of fin whale choruses and pulses which yield good performance results (i.e., false positive rates < 3% and true positive rates > 76%) when applied to real-world passive acoustic datasets characterized by vast amounts of data, with only a small proportion of the data containing the target sounds, and diverse soundscapes from the Southern Ocean.

AB  - The U.S. Navy maintains several instrumented ranges equipped with large arrays of bottom-mounted hydrophones that are typically used to track undersea vehicles. The major ranges include the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) located in the Bahamas, the Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE) located off San Clemente Island, and the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) located off the western side of Kauai, HI. Each of these ranges provides tracking arrays covering an area in excess of 1200 km(2). These hydrophone arrays are being used to develop marine mammal passive acoustic detection, classification, localization, and density estimation methods. Hardware systems installed at all three facilities allow real-time monitoring of vocalizing marine mammals. Using these systems, Blainville's beaked whales have been detected at AUTEC and PMRF. Cuvier's beaked whales have been detected at SCORE and to a lesser extent at AUTEC. These "sonar sensitive" species are present despite the repeated use of sonar. Based on passive acoustics, the movement of these species in response to sonar has been documented. By combining passive acoustic beaked whale and sonar data with AUTEC ship track data, a risk function for Blainville's beaked whales was developed. In addition, by combining hydrophone with recording tag data, the beam pattern and source level of Blainville's beaked whale were measured along with the system's detection function. This enabled the development of passive acoustic density estimation algorithms. These algorithms are being applied to the long-term, in situ monitoring of beaked whale population at all three facilities.

AB  - The occurrence and distribution of sperm whales in New Zealand waters is mainly known from whaling records or opportunistic sightings by the public and a systematic estimation of the abundance and distribution has never been conducted. In this study, we investigated the foraging activity and occurrence of sperm whales off the Eastern coast of New Zealand using passive acoustic monitoring techniques. Three acoustic recorders were moored to the ocean floor at different locations on the east side of the North and South Island to collect passive acoustic data from June 2016 until August 2017. A total of 53,823 echolocation click trains were recorded and analyzed to understand the spatial and temporal variation of sperm whale foraging activity. No difference in the foraging activity was found between night-time and day-time periods at any of the locations. Click train detections increased toward the south, suggesting increased foraging activity near Kaikoura. At each station, sperm whale foraging activity varied by month.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is one of the most effective and widely used methods for marine mammal detection and population density estimation. In most cases, it is associated with an inevitably large volume of raw acoustic data, making analysis exclusively by human experts challenging and extremely time-demanding. We present a neural network algorithm for detection of tonal signals produced by toothed cetaceans which allocates time intervals with high likelihood of marine mammal signal presence in underwater sound recordings. The proposed model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) of the ResNet152 architecture used as a backbone with additional linear layers. The input data for the model are spectrograms of short segments of underwater sound recordings. Training of the network was performed on a benchmark dataset of bottlenose dolphin whistles labeled by human experts. Analysis of the performance metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) showed the proposed model's superiority in comparison to widely used acoustic energy-based approaches. In virtue of the model's versatility, we believe that it can be successfully used for detection of tonal signals of other species characterized by producing tonal acoustic signals. This assumption was confirmed by preliminary results of the application of the developed CNN to a large archive of the White Sea beluga whale recordings.

AB  - Noise pollution in the marine environment is an emerging but serious concern. Its implications are less well understood than other global threats and largely undetectable to everyone but the specialist. In addition, the assessment of the acoustic impact of artificial sounds in the sea is not a trivial task, Certainly because there is a lack of information on how the marine organisms process and analyse sounds and how relevant these sounds are for the balance and development of the populations. Further, this possible acoustic impact not only concerns the hearing systems but may also affect other sensory or systemic levels and result equally lethal for the animal concerned. If we add that the negative consequences of a short or long term exposure to artificial sounds may not be immediately observed one can understood how challenging it is to obtain objective data allowing an efficient control of the introduction of anthropogenic Sound in the sea. To answer some of these questions, the choice to investigate cetaceans and their adaptation to an aquatic environment is not fortuitous. Cetaceans, because of their optimum use Of Sound as an ad-hoc Source of energy and their almost exclusive dependence on acoustic information, represent not only the best bio-indicator of the effects of noise pollution in the marine environment, but also a source of data to improve and develop human underwater acoustic technology. Here, we present how the characteristics and performance of the sperm whale mid-range biosonar can be used to develop a mitigation solution based on passive acoustics and ambient noise imaging to prevent negative interactions with human activities by monitoring cetacean movements in areas of interest, e.g. deep-sea observatories.

AB  - Estimating the detection probability of small cetaceans using either visual or acoustic surveys is difficult because they do not surface or vocalise continuously and can be imperceptible to an observer or hydrophone. Animals seen at the surface may have lower vocalisation rates, while submerged individuals may be more vocally active. This study aims to estimate visual, acoustic and combined detection probability by using Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) methodology. We used vessel-based visual sightings and acoustic data (based on click identification) collected simultaneously during the ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative in summer 2018 onboard the R/V Song of the Whale. This study focused on small cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea, including the most commonly-encountered species, the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). We identified duplicate events between visual and acoustic platforms using a decision tree based on time and distance thresholds to estimate g(0) (the detection probability on the trackline) for small cetaceans. A total of 30 duplicate events were identified from 107 and 109 events identified by the visual and acoustic platforms respectively. We tested the models with two key functions. With a hazard-rate key function, the g(0) was estimated at 0.52 (CV=21.0%) for both platforms combined, 0.29 (CV=25.6%) for the visual platform and 0.32 (CV=25.1%) for the acoustic platform. With a half-normal key function, g(0) was estimated at 0.51 (CV = 21.7%) for both platforms combined, 0.29 (CV = 25.6%) for the visual platform and 0.33 (CV = 23.2%) for the acoustic platform. Our results illustrate that passive acoustic monitoring can be used as an independent platform in MRDS to estimate the detection probability. Our estimate of g(0) was well below 1, far from the perfect detection commonly assumed for abundance estimation. Without correction for detection biases, total abundance would be underestimated by a factor of two when using both acoustic and visual data. This highlights the importance of using dual-platform surveys to estimate detection probability in order to improve abundance estimates and conservation efforts.

KW  - TUTORIAL
AB  - An Increase in the study of cetaceans' sounds has motivated the development of different automated sound detection and classification techniques. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is extensively used to study these cetaceans' sounds over a period to understand their daily activities within their ecosystem. Using PAM, the gathered sound datasets are usually large and impractical to manually analyse and detect. Thus, hidden Markov models (HMM) is one of the popular tools used to automatically detect and classify these cetaceans' sounds. Nonetheless, HMM rely heavily on the employed feature extraction method such as Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and linear predictive coding (LPC). In most cases, the more reliable the extracted feature vector from the known sound label, the higher the sensitivity of the HMM. Although these aforementioned feature extraction methods are widely used, their design is based on filters and requires windowing, fast Fourier transforms (FFT), and logarithm operations. Consequently, this increases the computational time complexity of the HMM. Here, we describe a selective time domain feature extraction method that can be easily adapted with the HMM. This proposed feature extraction method uses a combination of some simple but robust parameters such as the mean, relative amplitude and relative power/energy (MAP), which are selected based on empirical observations of the call to be detected. The performance of this proposed MAP-HMM was verified using the acoustic dataset of continuous recordings of an inshore Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera) short pulse calls collected in a single site in False bay, South-West of South Africa. Aside from exhibiting a low computational complexity, the proposed MAP-HMM offers superior sensitivity and false discovery rate performances in comparison to the LPCHMM and MFCC-HMM.

AB  - The long-term monitoring of long-lived animals often requires individual identification. For cetaceans, this identification may be based on morphological characters observable from a boat such as shape, spots and cuts of the back, fluke and dorsal fins. However, for some species such as the sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), this approach may be challenging as individuals display a rather uniform skin pigmentation. They also do not very often show their fluke, complicating individual identification from a boat. Immature sperm whales that usually have an unharmed fluke may be excluded from photo-identification catalogues. Within the framework of the Maubydick project, focusing on the long-term monitoring of sperm-whales in Mauritius, passive underwater observation and video recording were used to identify long-lasting body markers (e.g. sex, ventral white markings, cut-outs of fins). A catalogue of 38 individuals (six adult males, 18 adult females and 14 immatures) enabled observers to record some nearly-daily, and yearly resightings. Advantages and disadvantages of this method are presented here. Such catalogues represent a robust baseline for conducting behavioural, genetic and acoustic studies in social species. Benefits of such newly acquired knowledge are of primary importance to implement relevant conservation plans in the marine realm.

AB  - The "ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative" (ASI) is a pilot programme aimed at establishing an integrated and coordinated monitoring system for cetaceans across the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic (hereafter "ACCOBAMS") area. Conducted in coordination with Mediterranean coastal countries, it supports the implementation of European and regional policies, in particular the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Ecosystem Approach process. In summer 2018, a synoptic survey was conducted across the Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area, combining visual monitoring from aircrafts with visual and passive acoustic monitoring from vessels. Species density and abundance were estimated through design-based approach in a line-transect sampling framework. Based on data arising from the aerial survey only, uncorrected design-based abundance was obtained for striped (N=426,744, CV=0.13), common (N=65,359, CV=0.4), bottlenose (N=63,333, CV=0.17), and Risso ' s dolphins (N=26,006, CV=0.3), Cuvier's beaked whales (N=2,929, CV=0.4) and long-finned pilot whales (N=5,540 CV=0.4). A merged category of either striped or common dolphins resulted in 212,828 individuals (CV=0.26). Fin whales abundance of 1,749 animals (CV=0.3) was corrected for both availability and perception biases and resulted in 3,282 (CV=0.31). The ASI survey offers an overall picture of the distribution and abundance of cetaceans throughout the Mediterranean basin, providing robust estimates to be considered as a baseline for future regional systematic monitoring programmes. The ASI survey is the first step towards establishing a long-term monitoring program across the entire ACCOBAMS area, and, as such, it sets the basis for further future basin-wide monitoring efforts using systematic, shared, coordinated and comparable methods. The information gathered will further enhance knowledge on cetacean status, facilitating the development of informed conservation and mitigation measures, as well as supporting the implementation of international obligations. Furthermore, the outcomes of this survey will support both place- and threat-based conservation efforts in the ACCOBAMS area, through the identification of Important Marine Mammal Areas and Cetacean Critical Habitats. Here the results of the ASI survey are presented and discussed alongside proposed management and conservation actions aimed at ensuring the persistence of cetacean populations in the region.

TI  - Acoustic and visual survey of humpback whale (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) distribution in the eastern and southeastern Caribbean Sea
T2  - CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) historically ranged throughout the eastern and southeastern Caribbean Sea during the winter months. Commercial whaling from the 1820s to the early 1900s depleted the population. A combined passive acoustic and visual survey for humpback whales was conducted to assess the current winter distribution of this species in areas where it was exploited to depletion, and to evaluate the effectiveness of using passive acoustic survey methods to detect and locate humpback whales. Visual surveys were conducted independently but simultaneously with acoustic surveys to compare both detection methods. Humpback whale song was detected throughout the entire survey area, indicating that the species continues to occupy its historical range. A total of 31 sightings were made (n = 46 individuals, including three calves). In contrast, at least 78 unique acoustic detections of different singing males was made. The greater number of whales detected acoustically demonstrated the advantage of passive acoustic methods over visual methods for detecting male singing humpback whales; however, some sightings were not detected acoustically, demonstrating that visual methods are superior for detecting non-vocalizing whales. The number of whales detected indicates that the abundance of humpbacks in the eastern and southeastern Caribbean Sea is considerably lower than it was during the 19(th) century whaling period, and much lower than present day abundance in the primary wintering areas in the northeastern Greater Antilles.

AB  - We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetaceans in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region. BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the known ranges of small and resident populations. This effort, the second led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA's BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for BIA II came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification data; whaling data, including stomach and fecal contents; prey studies; and genetics. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, the BIA II products incorporate a scoring and labeling system, which will improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans. In the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region, a total of 19 BIAs were identified, delineated, and scored for seven species, including bowhead, North Pacific right, gray, humpback, fin, and sperm whales, and belugas. These include one hierarchical BIA for belugas that consists of one localized "child" BIA within an overarching "parent" BIA. There were 15 feeding, 3 migratory, and 1 small and resident population BIAs; no reproductive BIAs were identified. In some instances, information existed about a species' use of a particular area and time, but the information was insufficient to confidently delineate the candidate BIA; in those cases, the candidate BIA was added to a watch list. A total of 22 watch list areas were identified and delineated for 10 species, including all species mentioned above and minke whales, harbor porpoises, and Dall's porpoises. There were 15 feeding, 4 migratory, 2 reproductive, and 1 small and resident population watch list areas. Some BIAs and watch list areas were transboundary between the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region and the Arctic region.

AB  - We examined recordings from a 15-month (May 2009-July 2010) continuous acoustic data set collected from a bottom-mounted passive acoustic recorder at a sample frequency of 6 kHz off Portland, Victoria, Australia (38 degrees 33'01 '' S, 141 degrees 15'13 '' E) off southern Australia. Analysis revealed that calls from both subspecies were recorded at this site, and general additive modeling revealed that the number of calls varied significantly across seasons. Antarctic blue whales were detected more frequently from July to October 2009 and June to July 2010, corresponding to the suspected breeding season, while Australian blue whales were recorded more frequently from March to June 2010, coinciding with the feeding season. In both subspecies, the number of calls varied with time of day; Antarctic blue whale calls were more prevalent in the night to early morning, while Australian blue whale calls were detected more often from midday to early evening. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we show that each subspecies adopts different seasonal and daily call patterns which may be related to the ecological strategies of these subspecies. This study demonstrates the importance of passive acoustics in enabling us to understand and monitor subtle differences in the behavior and ecology of cryptic sympatric marine mammals.

AB  - The importance of seamounts as foraging hotspots for cetaceans depends on interactions between ocean flow and topographical features that concentrate prey. However, the oceanographic processes driving these aggregations are still unclear. Here, we analyzed two months of passive acoustic recordings from two remote seamounts in the Northeast Atlantic, Atlantis and Irving, in relation to regional oceanography and estimates of prey biomass. Delphinids and sperm whales were detected in both seamounts with higher foraging activity at night, indicating feeding on diel migrating prey. There were more detections of delphinids and sperm whales at Atlantis than at Irving. These two seamounts lie in different oceanographic settings created by the Azores Current that separates colder and less saline water masses in the north (Atlantis seamount) from warmer and more saline waters in the south (Irving seamount). Irving seamount is only affected by transient features like eddies that enhance productivity for short time periods. These conditions translate into more productive waters at Atlantis seamount than at Irving, as shown by predicted prey biomasses that ultimately attract top predators. Comparative studies such as this one can help to explain the main drivers of presence of top predators at seamounts.

AB  - Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) face threats from diminishing sea ice and increasing anthropogenic activities in the Arctic. Passive acoustic monitoring is the most effective means for monitoring their distribution and population trends, based on the detection of their calls. Passive acoustic monitoring, however, is influenced by the sound propagation environment and ambient noise levels, which impact call detection probability. Modeling and simulations were used to estimate detection probability for bowhead whale frequency-modulated calls in the 80-180 Hz frequency band with and without sea ice cover and under various noise conditions. Sound transmission loss for bowhead calls is substantially greater during ice-covered conditions than during open-water conditions, making call detection similar to 3 times more likely in open-water. Estimates of daily acoustic detection probability were used to compensate acoustic detections for sound propagation and noise effects in two recording datasets in the northeast Chukchi Sea, on the outer shelf and continental slope, collected between 2012 and 2013. The compensated acoustic density suggests a decrease in whale presence with the retreat of sea ice at these recording sites. These results highlight the importance of accounting for effects of the environment on ambient noise and acoustic propagation when interpreting results of passive acoustic monitoring.

AB  - There is widespread evidence that small-scale fisheries (SSF) bycatch threatens many populations of small cetaceans, yet conservation efforts are often limited by a lack of basic knowledge regarding their abundance, distribution, and habitat use. Here, we used passive acoustic monitoring from an SSF platform-of-opportunity to better characterize the distribution and habitat use of small cetaceans in northern Peru, focussing on the little-known Burmeister's porpoise Phocoena spinipinnis. From 2009 to 2012, acoustic click detectors (C-PODs) were attached to fishing nets for the duration of 116 fishing sets (30 fishing trips). Dolphins (unspecified delphinids) and porpoises were recorded around 71 and 22% of fishing sets, respectively. The probability of occurrence and buzzing behavior (a proxy for foraging), and time spent, were linked to both static and dynamic environmental variables to examine the drivers of habitat use. Dolphin activity was spread evenly throughout the fishing area and was not linked to any habitat variables. In contrast, porpoises were detected in neritic waters, and habitat models performed well, identifying preferences for shallow (<200 m depth) and cooler (17-18 degrees C) waters, close (<50 km) to shore. The high bycatch rate of small cetaceans in Peruvian SSF gave us the unique opportunity to investigate the link between bycatch and cetacean activity around vessels. We found a positive relationship between the likelihood of a bycatch event and acoustic presence for both dolphins and porpoises, however as we did not know the timing of entanglement, we could not link vocalization rates to mortality events. Nonetheless, as small cetaceans (particularly dolphins) frequently encounter fishing boats, the likelihood of entanglements may be reduced through effective efforts to alert animals to the presence of the net, either acoustically (using acoustic alarms) or visually. This study demonstrates that passive acoustic monitoring from a fisheries platform can provide insights into the distribution and habitat use of small cetaceans at relatively low cost, and is likely to be suitable in regions with low monitoring effort and high fishing pressure.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals is common, and it is now possible to estimate absolute animal density from acoustic recordings. The most appropriate density estimation method depends on how much detail about animals' locations can be derived from the recordings. Here, a method for estimating cetacean density using acoustic data is presented, where only horizontal bearings to calling animals are estimable. This method also requires knowledge of call signal-to-noise ratios, as well as auxiliary information about call source levels, sound propagation, and call production rates. Results are presented from simulations, and from a pilot study using recordings of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) calls from Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) hydrophones at Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean. Simulations replicating different animal distributions showed median biases in estimated call density of less than 2%. The estimated average call density during the pilot study period (December 2007-February 2008) was 0.02 calls hr(-1) km(2) (coefficient of variation, CV: 15%). Using a tentative call production rate, estimated average animal density was 0.54 animals/1000 km(2) (CV: 52%). Calling animals showed a varied spatial distribution around the northern hydrophone array, with most detections occurring at bearings between 90 and 180 degrees.

AB  - Despite frequent records from other parts of the North Atlantic, minke whales have never been acoustically recorded in the North Sea. This study investigated the detectability of pulse trains previously associated with this species in other regions, in acoustic data from ten sites along the east coast of Scotland. Since preliminary results confirmed pulse train presence, subsequently, an automated detector was applied to these data to record the seasonal and diel presence of minke whale pulse trains. Minke whales were detected from May to November, with most detections occurring in June, July and October. No acoustic detections were made in December, January or in the month of April, whilst no data were available for February and March. This pattern of acoustic presence supports available visual data and suggested an absence of minke whales from the study area during winter. Minke whale acoustic presence showed a statistically significant diel pattern, with a detection peak during night time. This study established the acoustic detectability of minke whales in the North Sea and highlights the potential of using passive acoustic monitoring to study the seasonal presence and spatial distribution of minke whales in the North Sea and wider Northeast Atlantic.

AB  - Low-frequency acoustic signals generated by baleen whales can propagate over vast distances, making the assignment of calls to specific individuals problematic. Here, we report the novel use of acoustic recording tags equipped with high-resolution accelerometers to detect vibrations from the surface of two tagged fin whales that directly match the timing of recorded acoustic signals. A tag deployed on a buoy in the vicinity of calling fin whales and a recording from a tag that had just fallen off a whale were able to detect calls acoustically but did not record corresponding accelerometer signals that were measured on calling individuals. Across the hundreds of calls measured on two tagged fin whales, the accelerometer response was generally anisotropic across all three axes, appeared to depend on tag placement and increased with the level of received sound. These data demonstrate that high-sample rate accelerometry can provide important insights into the acoustic behavior of baleen whales that communicate at low frequencies. This method helps identify vocalizing whales, which in turn enables the quantification of call rates, a fundamental component of models used to estimate baleen whale abundance and distribution from passive acoustic monitoring.

AB  - Beaked whales have been reported to mass strand as result of naval sonar exercises and the ability to mitigate such negative effects is of increasing importance. We present results that suggest that passive acoustic detection of beaked whales is feasible using broadband hydrophone arrays towed at shallow depths. In particular, the presence of delayed surface reflections is an important classification cue indicating that the received sound had been generated by a whale foraging at depth. This contextual information can easily be visualized by time-delay estimation techniques. We show that the use of non-acoustic contextual information of a deep diving foraging whale provides a promising approach to improving the classification performance of a passive acoustic detector of beaked whales.

AB  - The incidental mortality of cetaceans in commercial fisheries is a matter of international concern and whilst some by-catch may occur in almost any type of fishery the threat from gillnets has attracted particular criticism. The causes of this phenomena are complex and effective solutions elusive. Acoustic alarm devices, based on noise-makers developed in Canada to reduce the incidence of humpback whale collisions with static nets and traps, have recently been shown to be beneficial in reducing harbour porpoise by-catch in bottom set gillnets. In Britain the development of passive sonar reflectors, 'cats eyes', optimised to match dolphin echolocation signals, have been demonstrated to make gillnet-like structures detectable to echolocating wild bottlenose dolphins at ranges between 50 and 170 m. These reflecting devices induce avoidance behaviour once detected and have not been observed to attract animals towards them. This paper discusses limitations, both behavioural and acoustic, that need to be appreciated when attempting to develop effective by-catch mitigation methods.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a common method for detection of endangered North Atlantic right whales. This study reports on the acoustic behavior of right whales on the winter calving grounds to assess their acoustic detectability in this habitat. In addition to known call types, previously undescribed low amplitude short broadband signals were detected from lactating females with calves. The production of higher amplitude tonal calls occurred at lower rates for lactating females than from other age/sex classes suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may be less effective in detecting mother-calf pairs in this critical habitat area.

AB  - Sperm whales are an ideal species to study using passive acoustic technology because they spend the majority of their time underwater and produce echolocation clicks almost continuously while foraging. Passive acoustic line transect data collected between June and August 2016 were used to estimate a depth-corrected acoustic abundance and study the dive behaviour of foraging sperm whales in the western North Atlantic Ocean. 2D localizations (n = 699) were truncated at a slant range of 6500 m and combined with the multipath arrivals of surface reflected echoes to calculate 3D localizations (n = 274). Distance sampling using depth-corrected perpendicular distances resulted in a 10.5% change in the acoustic abundance estimate (2199 whales, CV = 14.6%) compared to uncorrected slant ranges (1969 whales, CV = 14.1%), and a detection function that was a better fit for the data. Sperm whales exhibited multiple foraging strategies, with bottom phases occurring at depths of 400-800, 800-1200, or > 1200 m, accounting for an average 39.2, 49.5, or 44.9% of the total recorded dive time, respectively. These results suggest that estimating 3D localizations using acoustic line transect data improves acoustic abundance estimation and can be used to answer population level questions about foraging ecology.

AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the North Pacific consistently range as far north as the Bering Sea. While occasional sightings of fin whales occur north of the Bering Strait, they are rarely documented north of 67A degrees N. However, a recent increase in passive acoustic monitoring has shown that fin whales are more prevalent in the Chukchi Sea than previously thought. During a 2012 field survey in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea, fin whale calls were detected on a DiFAR sonobuoy deployed at 71.575A degrees N, 157.823A degrees W, 50 km off Barrow near the mouth of Barrow Canyon. On August 27, 2012, approximately 30 fin whale downsweep calls were detected over an hour and a half, at bearings of approximately 270-290A degrees from the sonobuoy. Since only one sonobuoy was deployed, in situ localization of the calls was not possible. Post hoc range estimates using a combination of modal dispersion techniques, nonlinear time-domain warping, and geoacoustic inversion resulted in a source range estimate of less than 5 km. This location is approximately 280 and 365 km northeast of the previous closest acoustic detection and confirmed visual sighting of a fin whale, respectively. These results represent the farthest northeast record of fin whale calls in the Alaskan Arctic and illustrate the importance of continued passive acoustic monitoring in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - The appropriate use and interpretation of passive acoustic data for monitoring the Critically Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis (hereafter right whale) rely on knowledge of their calling behavior and how it varies with respect to time, space, demographics, and observed behavior. To assess such relationships in a habitat of increased management importance, sonobuoys (disposable drifting hydrophones) were deployed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, to record sounds from aggregating right whales during visual aerial surveys in the summers (June through August) of 2017 (n = 8), 2018 (n = 13), and 2019 (n = 16). Upcalls, gunshots, and various mid-frequency (250-800 Hz) tonal calls were compared to demographics and observed behaviors of concurrently observed right whales using correlation matrices, linear regressions, and generalized linear models. Our results show that (1) call rates increased from June to August for all call types; (2) calling rates were associated negatively with observed foraging behavior and positively with observed socializing behavior; (3) upcalls were occasionally produced at higher rates (>20 calls h-1) when in association with gunshots and tonal calls; (4) acoustic monitoring did not always detect right whale presence at fine timescales (2-6 h), but presence estimates were improved when multiple calls types were considered; and (5) calling rates were too variable to provide reliable density estimates of observed right whales. These results have important implications for the interpretation of passive acoustic monitoring in this habitat and provide evidence that some whale behaviors (e.g. socializing) may be reliably inferred from acoustics alone.

AB  - Managing interactions between human activities and marine mammals often relies on an understanding of the real-time distribution or occurrence of animals. Visual surveys typically cannot provide persistent monitoring because of expense and weather limitations, and while passive acoustic recorders can monitor continuously, the data they collect are often not accessible until the recorder is recovered. We have developed a moored passive acoustic monitoring system that provides near real-time occurrence estimates for humpback, sei, fin and North Atlantic right whales from a single site for a year, and makes those occurrence estimates available via a publicly accessible website, email and text messages, a smartphone/tablet app and the U.S. Coast Guard's maritime domain awareness software. We evaluated this system using a buoy deployed off the coast of Massachusetts during 2015-2016 and redeployed again during 2016-2017. Near real-time estimates of whale occurrence were compared to simultaneously collected archived audio as well as whale sightings collected near the buoy by aerial surveys. False detection rates for right, humpback and sei whales were 0% and nearly 0% for fin whales, whereas missed detection rates at daily time scales were modest (12%-42%). Missed detections were significantly associated with low calling rates for all species. We observed strong associations between right whale visual sightings and near real-time acoustic detections over a monitoring range 30-40 km and temporal scales of 24-48 hr, suggesting that silent animals were not especially problematic for estimating occurrence of right whales in the study area. There was no association between acoustic detections and visual sightings of humpback whales. The moored buoy has been used to reduce the risk of ship strikes for right whales in a U.S. Coast Guard gunnery range, and can be applied to other mitigation applications.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring was used to detect the sounds of rarely sighted Antarctic blue and fin whales to investigate their seasonal occurrence (as presence or absence of whale calls) and behaviour (as determined from call rates) in the Benguela ecosystem. Data were collected using autonomous acoustic recorders deployed on oceanographic moorings for 16.26 months off the west coast of South Africa in 2014 and 2015. Satellite derived environmental variables were used as predictors of whale acoustic occurrence and behaviour. Migratory Antarctic blue and fin whales were acoustically present in South African waters between May and August with call occurrence peaks in July whereas some fin whales extended their presence to November. No whale calls were recorded in summer for either species, suggesting whales use the Benguela ecosystem as an overwintering ground and migration route. Antarctic blue whales produced both their characteristic Z-call and their feeding associated D-call. Fin whales produced calls characteristic of animals from the eastern Antarctic fin whale acoustic population. Random forest models identified environmental variables such as sea surface temperature anomaly, sea surface height, wind speed, months of the year, Ekman upwelling index and log-transformed chlorophyll-a as the most important predictors of call occurrence and call rates of blue and fin whales. Here we present the first acoustic recordings of Antarctic blue and fin whales in the Benguela ecosystem, and provide preliminary information to investigate seasonal abundance and distribution of these large baleen whale populations. This work demonstrates the feasibility of cost-effectively monitoring Antarctic top-consumer baleen whales in the Benguela ecosystem.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are top predators throughout the world's oceans. In the North Pacific, the species is divided into three ecotypes-resident (fish-eating), transient (mammal-eating), and offshore (largely shark-eating)-that are genetically and acoustically distinct and have unique roles in the marine ecosystem. In this study, we examined the year-round distribution of killer whales in the northern Gulf of Alaska from 2016 to 2020 using passive acoustic monitoring. We further described the daily acoustic residency patterns of three killer whale populations (southern Alaska residents, Gulf of Alaska transients, and AT1 transients) for one year of these data. Highest year-round acoustic presence occurred in Montague Strait, with strong seasonal patterns in Hinchinbrook Entrance and Resurrection Bay. Daily acoustic residency times for the southern Alaska residents paralleled seasonal distribution patterns. The majority of Gulf of Alaska transient detections occurred in Hinchinbrook Entrance in spring. The depleted AT1 transient killer whale population was most often identified in Montague Strait. Passive acoustic monitoring revealed that both resident and transient killer whales used these areas much more extensively than previously known and provided novel insights into high use locations and times for each population. These results may be driven by seasonal foraging opportunities and social factors and have management implications for this species.

AB  - The echolocation signals of most beaked whale species are still unknown. In fact, out of the 22 species comprising the family Ziphiidae, only the echolocation pulses for 7 species have been clearly described. This study describes two distinct beaked whale echolocation signals recorded in the Cook Strait region using passive acoustic technology. These signals differ from previously described Ziphiid species clicks. A description of the time-frequency characteristics of the two signals is provided. Understanding the characteristics of these signals is necessary to correctly identify species from their echolocation signals and enables future monitoring of beaked whales using passive acoustics techniques.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has become an increasingly prevalent tool for estimating density of marine mammals, such as beaked whales, which vocalize often but are difficult to survey visually. Counts of acoustic cues (e.g., vocalizations), when corrected for detection probability, can be translated into animal density estimates by applying an individual cue production rate multiplier. It is essential to understand variation in these rates to avoid biased estimates. The most direct way to measure cue production rate is with animal-mounted acoustic recorders. This study utilized data from sound recording tags deployed on Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris, 19 deployments) and Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris, 16 deployments) beaked whales, in two locations per species, to explore spatial and temporal variation in click production rates. No spatial or temporal variation was detected within the average click production rate of Blainville's beaked whales when calculated over dive cycles (including silent periods between dives); however, spatial variation was detected when averaged only over vocal periods. Cuvier's beaked whales exhibited significant spatial and temporal variation in click production rates within vocal periods and when silent periods were included. This evidence of variation emphasizes the need to utilize appropriate cue production rates when estimating density from passive acoustic data. (C) 2017 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring adds to knowledge of whale presence and distribution over space and time. The gray whale (Eschrictius robustus) undertakes an annual migration between remote feeding and breeding locales, with its highly sonorous nature suggesting employment of low-frequency calls to be inherent to travel behaviours, perhaps aiding navigation and social cohesion. We consider whether these calling behaviours can be used to better understand the process of migration, where call presence and relative abundance might represent a means to track the progress of migrating whales. Passive acoustic recordings made on the west coast of Vancouver Island, a mid-way point of gray whale migration, were first analysed for abundance over time to examine the progression of migration. Then the acoustic record was compared to shore-based recordings undertaken from Point Vincente, California to better assess their use as a census tool. The timing in peaks of calling, particularly of far-ranging moan-like calls, and shore counts showed a high degree of congruence when considered with a lag time of 8 days to account for travel time between the two survey locations. This suggests that passive acoustic monitoring could complement the long running and shore-based counts in recording annual population movement, and add to our understanding of gray whales on poorly known segments of their migration route or at times when visual observations are not possible.

AB  - Little is known of the movements and seasonal occurrence of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of South Africa and the Antarctic, populations once brought to near extinction by historic commercial whaling. We investigated the seasonal occurrence and diel-vocalizing pattern of humpback whale songs off the west coast of South Africa (migration route and opportunistic feeding ground) and the Maud Rise, Antarctica (feeding ground), using passive acoustic monitoring data collected between early 2014 and early 2017. Data were collected using acoustic autonomous recorders deployed 200-300 m below the sea surface in waters 855, 1,118 and 4,400 m deep. Acoustic data were manually analyzed for humpback whale vocalizations. While non-song calls were never identified, humpback whale songs were detected from June through December in South African waters, with a peak in percentage of acoustic occurrence around September/October in the austral spring. In Antarctic waters, songs were detected from March through May and in July (with a peak occurrence in April) where acoustic occurrence of humpback whales was negatively correlated to distance to the sea ice extent. Humpback whales were more vocally active at night than in the day at all recording sites. Detection range modelling indicates that humpback whale vocalizations could be detected as far as 18 and 45 km from recorders in South African and Antarctic waters, respectively. This study provides a multi-year description of the offshore acoustic occurrence of humpback whales off the west coast of South Africa and Maud Rise, Antarctica, regions that should continue to be monitored to understand these recovering populations.

AB  - Humpback whales are thought to undertake annual migrations between their low latitude breeding grounds and high latitude feeding grounds. However, under specific conditions, humpback whales sometimes change their migratory destination or skip migration overall. Here we document the surprising persistent presence of humpback whales in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during five years (2011, 2012, 2013, 2017, and 2018) using passive acoustic data. However, in the El Nino years 2015 and 2016, humpback whales were virtually absent. Our data show that humpback whales are systematically present in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and suggest that these whales are particularly sensitive to climate oscillations which have profound effects on winds, sea ice extent, primary production, and especially krill productivity. Schall et al. use passive acoustic recordings of humpback whale calls to report the presence of humpback whales in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean between 2011 and 2018. This serves as the first long-term report of humpback whales on a Southern Ocean feeding ground, and their notable absence during the El Nino years of 2015 and 2016 indicates that the inter-annual variability in their acoustic presence is driven by large-scale climate variability.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are one of several baleen whale species in the Northwest Atlantic that coexist with vessel traffic and anthropogenic noise. Passive acoustic monitoring strategies can be used in conservation management, but the first step toward understanding the acoustic behavior of a species is a good description of its acoustic repertoire. Digital acoustic tags (DTAGs) were placed on humpback whales in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary to record and describe the non-song sounds being produced in conjunction with foraging activities. Peak frequencies of sounds were generally less than 1 kHz, but ranged as high as 6 kHz, and sounds were generally less than 1 s in duration. Cluster analysis distilled the dataset into eight groups of sounds with similar acoustic properties. The two most stereotyped and distinctive types ("wops" and "grunts") were also identified aurally as candidates for use in passive acoustic monitoring. This identification of two of the most common sound types will be useful for moving forward conservation efforts on this Northwest Atlantic feeding ground. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Although a great deal of effort has been directed toward attempts to use sound to reduce or eliminate marine mammal incidental capture in fisheries and predation on fish, there is little evidence of the effectiveness of such methods in solving marine mammal-fishery conflicts. Passive methods of increasing a net's reflectivity are hypothesized to result in lowered marine mammal bycatch rates, by making it easier for the animals to detect and avoid nets. However, so far, substantial decreases in cetacean bycatch have not been demonstrated, either from comparisons of catch rates in commercial fisheries or from observational studies of deterrence. The goal of active acoustic methods is the production of sound to warn the animals of the gear, or to cause them to leave the area. Various attempts have been made to use active methods to deter pinnipeds from areas of fishing activity (generally to avoid predation on the fish), and to warn cetaceans of the presence of a net (to reduce incidental catch). Net alarms have greatly reduced large whale entrapment in fish traps in Canadian waters, but despite extensive testing, have generally not shown similar success in reducing small cetacean bycatch in a number of gillnet fisheries. Overall, most attempts to use sound to reduce or eliminate marine mammal-fishery interactions have been based upon trial and error, with few controlled scientific experiments, making evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods difficult. Much more basic research on marine mammal echolocation behavior and on behavioral interactions between marine mammals and fisheries needs to be done before substantial success using acoustic methods can be expected.

AB  - The United States and Canada employ dynamic management strategies to improve conservation outcomes for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). These strategies rely on near real-time knowledge of whale distribution generated from visual surveys and opportunistic sightings. Near real-time passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems have been operational for many years but acoustic detections of right whales have yet to be incorporated in dynamic management because of concerns over uncertainty in the location of acoustically detected whales. This rationale does not consider whale movement or its contribution to location uncertainty following either visual or acoustic detection. The goal of this study was to estimate uncertainties in right whale location following acoustic and visual detection and identify the timescale at which the uncertainties become similar owing to post-detection whale movement. We simulated whale movement using an autocorrelated random walk model parameterized to approximate three common right whale behavioral states (traveling, feeding, and socializing). We then used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate whale location over a 96-hr period given the initial uncertainty from the acoustic and visual detection methods and the evolving uncertainties arising from whale movement. The results demonstrated that for both detection methods the uncertainty in whale location increases rapidly following the initial detection and can vary by an order of magnitude after 96 hr depending on the behavioral state of the whale. The uncertainties in whale location became equivalent between visual and acoustic detections within 24-48 hr depending on whale behavior and acoustic detection range parameterization. These results imply that using both visual and acoustic detections provides enhanced information for the dynamic management of this visually and acoustically cryptic and highly mobile species.

AB  - North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis calve during winter off Florida and Georgia, USA, a region of high shipping traffic, and ship-strike risk is a concern. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of right whales on their foraging grounds increases detection opportunities to inform mariners of right whale presence and reduce the likelihood of ship strike. This study evaluates the effectiveness of PAM on right whale calving grounds by documenting the occurrence of right whale call detections on 2 types of acoustic instruments deployed off the coasts of Savannah, GA, and Jacksonville, FL, and comparing results with visual sightings and ambient noise conditions. Over 400 right whale calling events were detected on archival marine acoustic recording units (MARUs) at 2 sites across 2 seasons, and 92% of these calling events included right whale upcalls. Daily detections on archival MARUs and near-real time Autobuoys, which automatically detect upcalls, were significantly correlated and occurred on up to 25% of days off Savannah and 46% of days off Jacksonville. Visual aerial surveys detected right whales within 20 km of each acoustic site on a similar proportion of days with visual survey effort (15 to 33% off Savannah and 34 to 43% off Jacksonville). Acoustic methods enabled greater temporal effort, yielding a 2- to 10-fold increase in days with right whale detections over visual methods. Shipping noise and fish chorusing likely mask right whale call detections. However, considering the high number of right whale calling event detections by PAM during this study the results indicate that this is an effective method to augment detection of right whales in this environment, especially at night when they cannot be seen.

AB  - A prototype real-time, passive-acoustic observing system for killer whales was developed and tested off the coast of Newport, Oregon, USA. The system consists of two modules: 1) the passive-acoustic monitoring (PAM) module, which sits on the seafloor and continuously monitors the underwater soundscape for killer whale calls, and 2) a surface buoy, which receives information on acoustics detections from the PAM module via an underwater acoustic modem link and relays the information to shore via an Iridium (TM) satellite connection. The system was deployed in similar to 65 m deep water off Oregon in September 2015 for five days, during which the real-time detection capability was tested. A high rate of false positive detections was observed. Later analysis revealed that Dolphin clicks and impulsive sounds by invertebrate caused detection errors. During the experiment, killer whale sounds were projected with an underwater playback system to validate the detection algorithm.

AB  - The presence of beaked whales in mass-strandings coincident with navy maneuvers has prompted the development of methods to detect these cryptic animals. Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, produce distinctive echolocation clicks during long foraging dives making passive acoustic detection a possibility. However, performance of passive acoustic monitoring depends upon the source level, beam pattern, and clicking behavior of the whales. In this study, clicks recorded from Digital acoustic Tags (DTags) attached to four M. densirostris were linked to simultaneous recordings from an 82-hydrophone bottom-mounted array to derive the source level and beam pattern of the clicks, as steps towards estimating their detectability. The mean estimated on-axis apparent source level for the four whales was 201 dB(rms97). The mean 3 dB beamwidth and directivity index, estimated from sequences of clicks directed towards the far-field hydrophones, were 13 degrees and 23 dB, respectively. While searching for prey, Blainville's beaked whales scan their heads horizontally at a mean rate of 3.6 degrees/s over an angular range of some +/-10 degrees. Thus, while the DI indicates a narrow beam, the area of ensonification over a complete foraging dive is large given the combined effects of body and head movements associated with foraging.

AB  - Animal behaviour can provide valuable information for wildlife management and conservation. Studying the detailed behaviour of marine mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals. These developments will improve our capabilities in areas such as testing whether their behaviour adheres to traditional behavioural theory, and will certainly assist the guiding of conservation efforts.

AB  - Acoustic monitoring and aerial visual surveys of marine mammal activity were conducted simultaneously at the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility near Kauai, HI, during times of both high- and low-whale density from February 2002 to March 2003. Specifically, recordings from the range's 24 broadband hydrophones were made during 11 of 16 "in-season" and during six of ten "off-season" aerial surveys. Basic acoustic detections consisted primarily of humpback whale calls and sperm-whale clicks, and those two species were also reported in the visual surveys. The relative number of acoustic detections roughly corresponded with the visual survey results throughout the year. The same acoustic data were also provided to a passive-acoustic-localization algorithm based on, acoustic propagation models which generated estimates of sperm-whale movement through the range. The acoustic localizations are in close proximity in space and time to the visual observations of sperm whales. Verification of the model-based localization algorithm's accuracy was demonstrated in a controlled-source experiment at the Navy's Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) range in the Bahamas where the recordings of sperm-whale clicks were broadcast and successfully tracked. The localization accuracy of the model-based technique and traditional hyperbolic techniques is compared. These results raise the possibility of using existing Navy assets to detect and track marine mammals, particularly during times when visual sighting conditions are not favorable, in efforts to minimize their exposure to underwater sound.

AB  - Despite well-documented experimental evidence of echolocation in toothed whales, virtually nothing is known about the use and functional significance of cetacean sonar in the wild. Here, the patterns of echolocation sounds produced by killer whales, Orcinus orca, off British Columbia and Alaska are described. Two sympatric populations with divergent food habits differed markedly in sonar sound production. Individuals belonging to the fish-eating 'resident' population produced trains of characteristic sonar clicks, on average, 4% of the time, 27 times more often than marine mammal-eating 'transient' killer whales. The click trains of residents averaged 7 s, more than twice as long as the trains of transients. Click repetition rates within resident's trains were constant or changed gradually; within transient's trains they often fluctuated abruptly. Transients produced isolated single or paired clicks at an average rate of 12/h, four times as often as residents. In general, the isolated clicks and infrequent, short and irregular trains of transients were less conspicuous against background noise than the sonar of residents. This difference in acoustic crypticity may reflect a flexible response to the probability of alerting prey, because marine mammals have more acute hearing than fish in the frequency range of sonar clicks. In both populations, echolocation use per individual decreased with increasing group size, suggesting the sharing of information between group members. No relationships were found between echolocation activity and water clarity for whales of either population. Transient whales often travelled or foraged without discernibly echolocating, suggesting that passive listening provides cues for prey detection and orientation.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a rapidly growing field, providing valuable insights in marine ecology. The approach allows for long-term, species-specific monitoring over a range of spatial scales. For many baleen whales fundamental information on seasonal occurrence and distribution is still missing. In this study, pulse trains produced by the North Atlantic minke whale, a highly mobile and cryptic species, are used to examine its seasonality, diel vocalization patterns and spatial distribution throughout the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS), USA. Three and a half years (2006, 2007 to 2010) of near continuous passive acoustic data were analyzed using automated detection methods. Random forests and cluster analyses grouped pulse trains into 3 main categories (slow-down, constant and speed-up), with several subtypes. Slow-down pulse trains were the most commonly recorded call category. Minke whale pulse train occurrence was highly seasonal across all years. Detections were made from August to November, with 88% occurring in September and October. No detections were recorded in January and February, and only few from March to June. Minke whale pulse trains showed a distinct diel pattern, with a nighttime peak from approximately 20:00 to 01:00 h Eastern Standard Time (EST). The highest numbers of pulse trains were detected to the east of Stellwagen Bank, suggesting that minke whales travel preferably in deeper waters along the outer edge of the sanctuary. These data show that minke whales consistently use Stellwagen Bank as part of their migration route to and from the feeding grounds. Unlike other baleen whales in this area they do not appear to have a persistent year-round acoustic presence.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are top marine predators occurring globally. In Antarctic waters, five ecotypes have been described, with Type C being the smallest form of killer whale known. Acoustic recordings of nine encounters of Type C killer whales were collected in 2012 and 2013 in McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea. In a combined 3.5 h of recordings, 6386 killer whale vocalizations were detected and graded based on their signal-to-noise ratio. Spectrograms of the highest-quality calls were examined for characteristic patterns yielding a catalogue of 28 call types (comprising 1250 calls). Acoustic parameters of each call were measured and summarized by call type. Type C killer whales produced complex calls, consisting of multiple frequency-modulated, amplitude-modulated and pulsed components. Often, two components occurred simultaneously, forming a biphonation; although the biphonic components did not necessarily start and end together, with one component lasting over several others. The addition and deletion of components yielded call subtypes. Call complexity appears stable over time and may be related to feeding ecology. Characterization of the Type C acoustic repertoire is an important step for the development of passive acoustic monitoring of the diverse assemblage of killer whale ecotypes in Antarctica's rapidly changing marine ecosystems.

AB  - Competition for prey resources among ecologically similar populations that occur in sympatry can be reduced by spatiotemporal resource partitioning. Understanding patterns of habitat use of cetaceans can be difficult since they are highly mobile and can have large home ranges. We used passive acoustic monitoring at 15 sites along the coast of Washington State, USA, to assess habitat use patterns of 2 sympatric populations of fish-eating killer whales Orcinus orca: northern residents (NRKW) and southern residents (SRKW). This area is part of the ocean distributions of a number of important runs of Chinook salmon Oncorhyncus tshawytscha, the preferred prey of both populations, and is proposed critical habitat for SRKW. We compared monthly occurrence of both populations at recorder locations grouped by their proximity to the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the north and the Columbia River to the south in one analysis and by their distance from shore in a second analysis. NRKW and SRKW were detected throughout the year with spring and fall peaks in occurrence. The northernmost sites accounted for 93% of NRKW detections, while less than half of SRKW detections were at these sites. SRKW were most frequently detected at nearshore sites (83% of detections), while the majority of NRKW detections were at mid-shelf and deep sites (94% of detections). This study provides further information about the habitat use of these resident killer whale populations with implications for their management and conservation.

AB  - Collecting enough data to obtain reasonable abundance estimates of whales is often difficult, particularly when studying rare species. Passive acoustics can be used to detect whale sounds and are increasingly used to estimate whale abundance. Much of the existing effort centres on the use of acoustics to estimate abundance directly, e. g. analysing detections in a distance sampling framework. Here, we focus on acoustics as a tool incorporated within mark-recapture surveys. In this context, acoustic tools are used to detect and track whales, which are then photographed or biopsied to provide data for mark-recapture analyses. The purpose of incorporating acoustics is to increase the encounter rate beyond using visual searching only. While this general approach is not new, its utility is rarely quantified. This paper predicts the "acoustically-assisted'' encounter rate using a discrete-time individual-based simulation of whales and survey vessel. We validate the simulation framework using existing data from studies of sperm whales. We then use the framework to predict potential encounter rates in a study of Antarctic blue whales. We also investigate the effects of a number of the key parameters on encounter rate. Mean encounter rates from the simulation of sperm whales matched well with empirical data. Variance of encounter rate, however, was underestimated. The simulation of Antarctic blue whales found that passive acoustics should provide a 1.7-3.0 fold increase in encounter rate over visual-only methods. Encounter rate was most sensitive to acoustic detection range, followed by vocalisation rate. During survey planning and design, some indication of the relationship between expected sample size and effort is paramount; this simulation framework can be used to predict encounter rates and establish this relationship. For a case in point, the simulation framework indicates unequivocally that real-time acoustic tracking should be considered for quantifying the abundance of Antarctic blue whales via mark-recapture methods.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of using duty-cycled passive acoustic recordings to monitor the daily presence of beaked whale species at three locations in the northwest Atlantic. Continuous acoustic records were subsampled to simulate duty cycles of 50%, 25%, and 10% and cycle period durations from 10 to 60 min. Short, frequent listening periods were most effective for assessing the daily presence of beaked whales. Furthermore, subsampling at low duty cycles led to consistently greater underestimation of Mesoplodon species than either Cuvier's beaked whales or northern bottlenose whales, leading to a potential bias in estimation of relative species occurrence.

AB  - Passive acoustic data collected from marine autonomous recording units deployed off Jacksonville, FL (from 13 September to 8 October 2009 and 3 December 2009 to 8 January 2010), were analyzed for detection of cetaceans and Navy sonar. Cetaceans detected included Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Eubalaena glacialis, B. borealis, Physeter macrocephalus, blackfish, and delphinids. E. glacialis were detected at shallow and, somewhat unexpectedly, deep sites. P. macrocephalus were characterized by a strong diel pattern. B. acutorostrata showed the strongest relationship between sonar activity and vocal behavior. These results provide a preliminary assessment of cetacean occurrence off Jacksonville and new insights on vocal responses to sonar.

AB  - Large-amplitude internal solitary waves and internal tides are common oceanographic features in the South China Sea, which are generated in the Luzon Strait and propagate westward cross the basin area to the continental shelf and hit the east wage of DongSha Atoll. These waves shoal near Dongsha plateau and force nutrients and plankton and potentially entraining fishes, squids, and nutrients into the upper ocean, potentially foraged by cetaceans. Several studies have indicated that dolphins and whales may exploit prey aggregations associated with predictable but ephemeral ocean features, such as upwellings, fronts, and eddies. Prey availability for dolphins in the South China Sea influenced by the aggregative properties of internal waves is speculated and once was reported by one photo in 2005 in a benign sea state. This study presents evidence that internal waves attract and aggregate dolphins by using integrative analysis of current data, pressure data, and passive acoustic monitoring data.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) produce a variety of acoustic signal types used for communication: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Discrete pulsed calls are highly stereotyped, repetitive, and unique to individual pods found around the world. Discriminating amongst pod specific calls can help determine population structure in killer whales and is used to track pod movements around oceans. Killer whale presence in the Canadian Arctic has increased substantially, but we have limited understanding of their ecology, movements, and stock identity. Two autonomous passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) hydrophones were deployed in the waters of Eclipse Sound and Milne Inlet, in northern Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada, in August and September 2017. Eleven killer whale pulsed call types, three multiphonic and eight monophonic, are proposed and described using manual whistle contour extraction and feature normalization. Automated detection of echolocation clicks between 20 and 48 kHz demonstrated little to no overlap between killer whale calls and echolocation presumed to be narwhal, which suggests that narwhal remain audibly inconspicuous when killer whales are present. Describing the acoustic repertoire of killer whales seasonally present in the Canadian Arctic will aid in understanding their acoustic behaviour, seasonal movements, and ecological impacts. The calls described here provide a basis for future acoustic comparisons across the North Atlantic and aid in characterizing killer whale demographics and ecology, particularly for pods making seasonal incursions into Arctic waters.

AB  - The minke whale is one of the most abundant species of baleen whales worldwide, yet is rarely sighted in subtropical waters. In the North Pacific, they produce a distinctive sound known as the boing, which can be used to acoustically localize individuals. A vessel-based survey using both visual and passive acoustic monitoring was conducted during the spring of 2007 in a large (616,000 km(2)) study area encompassing the Mariana Islands. We applied line transect methods to data collected from a towed hydrophone array to estimate the abundance of calling minke whales in our study area. No minke whales were sighted, but there were hundreds of acoustic detections of boings. Computer algorithms were developed to localize calling minke whales from acoustic recordings, resulting in over 30 independent localizations, a six-fold increase over those estimated during the survey. The two best estimates of abundance of calling minke whales were determined to be 80 and 91 animals (0.13 and 0.15 animals per 1,000 km2, respectively; CV = 34%). These are the first density and abundance estimates for calling minke whales using towed hydrophone array surveys, and the first estimates for this species in the Mariana Islands region. These are considered minimum estimates of the true number of minke whales in the study area.

AB  - Beaked and sperm whales are top predators living in the waters off the Kona coast of Hawai'i. Temporal and spatial analyses of the foraging activity of these two species were studied with passive acoustics techniques. Three passive acoustics recorders moored to the ocean floor were used to monitor the foraging activity of these whales in three locations along the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii. Data were analyzed using automatic detector/classification systems: M3R (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges), and custom-designed MATLAB programs. The temporal variation in foraging activity was species-specific: beaked whales foraged more at night in the north, and more during the day-time off Kailua-Kona. No day-time/night-time preference was found in the southern end of the sampling range. Sperm whales foraged mainly at night in the north, but no day-time/night-time preference was observed off Kailua-Kona and in the south. A Generalized Linear Model was then applied to assess whether location and chlorophyll concentration affected the foraging activity of each species. Chlorophyll concentration and location influenced the foraging activity of both these species of deep-diving odontocetes. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - This paper discusses passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals during the Sirena 10 survey. We present results of testing a towed array consisting of 4 broadband hydrophones arranged in a tetrahedral configuration (CPAM Compact Passive Acoustic Monitoring), for detection, classification and localization of marine mammals. Robust angular determinations of detected signals were possible using time of arrival but range estimation was hindered by stability issues with the towed body. We present a preliminary cluster analysis of vocalization time series for species classification. Finally, we discuss the utility of such passive acoustic systems for cetacean surveys and their applications in abundance and habitat suitability modeling for marine mammals.

AB  - Despite the well-documented, broad global distribution of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), their distributional patterns remain poorly known in Arctic regions, where year-round monitoring is challenging. Adult male sperm whales are known to migrate seasonally between nutrient-rich high latitude waters and low latitude breeding grounds. However, knowledge is limited regarding fine-scale distribution and seasonal presence at high latitudes. To investigate the acoustic occurrence of this vocally active species in the High Arctic of the Northeast Atlantic, this study combined automated and manual click detection methods to analyze passive acoustic data collected at eight locations around the Svalbard Archipelago, Norway, between 2012 and 2021. The results revealed the presence of sperm whales at six recording sites and demonstrated sperm whale "hotspots" in ice-free areas in eastern Fram Strait along the shelf break and close to the west coast of Spitsbergen from May-January, with some variation between years and locations. Although acoustic presence decreased with increasing latitude, even the northern-most location (81 degrees N) recorded sperm whale vocal activity between August and January. This study provides a baseline for sperm whale acoustic presence in the High Arctic, which will be essential in the context of detecting future changes and also for predicting future distribution patterns in the rapidly changing Arctic marine environment.

AB  - Eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue (EIOPB) whales were localised and tracked through the Perth Canyon area utilising a passive acoustic tracking array. Vocalising animals were tracked using the Type II unit of the EIOPB whale song across recordings for an average of 109.3 min (95% CI +/- 27 min), suggesting that animals move slowly through the array area. Comparisons of the distribution of animals between sample years revealed nonuniform distribution of animals suggesting that environmental variables may drive pygmy blue whale spatial distribution within foraging areas. Analysis of the movement patterns of acoustically tracked animals found that animals tracked between January and early March generally exhibited directional movement while singing animals tracked between March and May exhibited directional and milling movement patterns, indicating that they may be foraging, and thus that animals may sing between feeding bouts. Comparisons of visual and acoustic localisations found animals appeared to utilise similar areas around the passive acoustic receiver array on days where survey effort overlapped, though acoustic survey methods returned consistently higher numbers of detections. Further, acoustic and visual detections of animals within the same day were not within the same location highlighting the need for holistic studies of species habitat utilisation. The inclusion of in-situ environmental data collection in the design of future acoustic tracking studies would be valuable to understand whether there is a link between environmental factors at the local scale and the localised movement of whales around the listening area.

AB  - Little is known about the year-round occurrence of blue whales in Atlantic Canadian waters. We used passive acoustic monitoring to investigate blue whale call presence and increase our understanding of year-round blue whale occurrence along the eastern edge of the Scotian Shelf, Nova Scotia, Canada. Blue whale calls were recorded at 3 deep water sites within and near the Gully Marine Protected Area from October 2012 to September 2014 using bottom-mounted passive acoustic recorders. Calls were categorized as either tonal or downsweeping. At all 3 sites, tonal calls occurred most often from November through January in both years and in August 2014, while the majority of downsweeping calls occurred during May through September 2014. There was no discernible diel pattern in the occurrence of tonal calls. Downsweeping calls occurred most often during evening twilight, with a dramatic peak in occurrence during the hour of 19:00 Atlantic Standard Time at all 3 sites. The peak in downsweeping call occurrence during evening twilight may have been related to blue whale foraging ecology. This study sheds light on the poorly understood year-round occurrence of blue whales off Atlantic Canada. Understanding when and where blue whales occur will help to inform management decisions for the protection and conservation of this endangered population.

AB  - Herring-eating killer whales debilitate herring with underwater tail slaps and likely herd herring into tighter schools using a feeding-specific low-frequency pulsed call ('herding' call). Feeding on herring may be dependent upon daylight, as the whales use their white underside to help herd herring; however, feeding at night has not been investigated. The production of feeding-specific sounds provides an opportunity to use passive acoustic monitoring to investigate feeding behaviour at different times of day. We compared the acoustic behaviour of killer whales between day and night, using an autonomous recorder deployed in Iceland during winter. Based upon acoustic detection of underwater tail slaps used to feed upon herring we found that killer whales fed both at night and day: they spent 50% of their time at night and 73% of daytime feeding. Interestingly, there was a significant diel variation in acoustic behaviour. Herding calls were significantly associated with underwater tail slap rate and were recorded significantly more often at night, suggesting that in low-light conditions killer whales rely more on acoustics to herd herring. Communicative sounds were also related to underwater tail slap rate and produced at different rates during day and night. The capability to adapt feeding behaviour to different light conditions may be particularly relevant for predator species occurring in high latitudes during winter, when light availability is limited.

AB  - The presence of Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) in the Beibu Gulf, China has been reported since 2016. In the current study, in situ Bryde's whale vocalizations were recorded. Bouts of frequency modulated repetitive and diversified calls were recorded. Repetitive calls were recorded when 1-3 whales were present within 2 km of the boat and were probably emitted by a single whale and functioned as contact calls. Repetitive calls were divided into biphonation downswept tonals and downswept tonals. Diversified calls were recorded when 4-7 whales were present within 2 km of the boat and were probably associated with acoustic exchanges between or among conspecifics. Diversified calls occasionally contained inflection points, frequency jumps, and break point features. The frequency band of Bryde's whale vocalizations overlapped highly with background noise. Most vocalizations in the current study were different than those previously reported for this species. Therefore, the findings of this study provide more information on the known acoustic repertoire of Bryde's whales and provide a basis for noninvasive monitoring of Bryde's whale with passive acoustic methods and for developing mitigation and conservation protocols to ensure their future viability.

AB  - Seasonal variation in the acoustic presence of blue whale calls has been widely reported for feeding grounds worldwide, however variation over the submonthly scale (several days to <1 month) has been examined to a much lesser extent. This study combines passive acoustic, hydroacoustic, and in situ oceanographic observations collected at a mooring in the Corcovado Gulf, Northern Chilean Patagonia, from January 2016-February 2017, to examine the temporal variation in blue whale acoustic occurrence and prey backscatter over seasonal and submonthly scales. Time series data for a) Southeast Pacific blue whale song calls and D-calls, b) zooplankton backscatter, c) tidal amplitude, and d) meridional and zonal wind stress were examined visually for seasonal trends. To examine submonthly timescales over the summer feeding season (January-June), wavelet transforms and wavelet coherence were applied; generalized linear models (GLM) were also applied. There was a 3-month lag between the seasonal onsets of high zooplankton backscatter (October) and blue whale acoustic presence (January), and an almost immediate drop in blue whale acoustic presence with the seasonal decrease of backscatter (June). This may be due to the use of memory by animals when timing their arrival on the feeding ground, but the timing of their departure may be related to detection of low prey availability. Over the summer feeding season, blue whale acoustic presence was strongly associated with zooplankton backscatter (GLM coefficient p MUCH LESS-THAN 0.0001). Song calls followed a seasonal cycle, but D-calls appeared to respond to short term variations in environmental conditions over submonthly scales. Results suggest that spring tides may increase prey aggregation and/or transport into the Corcovado Gulf, leading to increased blue whale acoustic presence over 15-day or 30-day cycles; and short-lived events of increased wind stress with periodicities of 2-8 days and 16-30 days, may also contribute to the aggregation of prey. We discuss the strengths and limitations of coupling passive and active acoustic data to examine drivers of blue whale distribution.

AB  - Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus and fin whales B. physalus are common inhabitants of the Southern California Bight (SCB), but little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of their use of this area. To study their distribution in the SCB, high-frequency acoustic recording packages were intermittently deployed at 16 locations across the SCB from 2006 to 2012. Presence of blue whale B calls and fin whale 20 Hz calls was determined using 2 types of automatic detection methods, i.e. spectrogram correlation and acoustic energy detection, respectively. Blue whale B calls were generally detected between June and January, with a peak in September, with an overall total of over 3 million detections. Fin whale 20 Hz calls, measured via the fin whale call index, were present year-round, with the highest values between September and December, with a peak in November. Blue whale calls were more common at coastal sites and near the northern Channel Islands, while the fin whale call index was highest in the central and southern areas of the SCB, indicating a possible difference in habitat preferences of the 2 species in this area. Across years, a peak in blue whale call detections occurred in 2008, with minima in 2006 and 2007, but there was no long-term trend. There was an increase in the fin whale call index during this period. These trends are consistent with visual survey estimates for both species in Southern California, providing evidence that passive acoustics can be a powerful tool to monitor population trends for these endangered species.

AB  - Passive underwater acoustics allows for the monitoring of the echolocation clicks of cetaceans. Static hydrophone arrays monitor from a fixed location, however, they cannot track animals over long distances. More flexibility can be achieved by mounting hydrophones on a mobile structure. In this paper, we present the design of a small non -uniform array of five hydrophones mounted directly under the Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) Sphyrna (also called an Autonomous Laboratory Vehicle) built by SeaProven in France. This configuration is made challenging by the 40cm aperture of the hydrophone array, extending only two meters below the surface and above the thermocline, thus presenting various artifacts. The array, fixed under the keel of the drone, is numerically stabilized in yaw and roll using the drone's Motion Processing Unit (MPU). To increase the accuracy of the 3D tracking computed from a four hour recording of a Sperm Whale diving several kilometers away, we propose an efficient joint filtering of the clicks in the Time Delay of Arrival (TDoA) space. We show how the DBSCAN algorithm efficiently removes any outlier detection among the thousands of transients, and yields to coherent high definition 3D tracks.

AB  - A land-based infrared (IR) camera is used to detect endangered Southern Resident killer whales in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. The observations are motivated by a proposed tidal energy pilot project, which will be required to monitor for environmental effects. Potential monitoring methods also include visual observation, passive acoustics, and active acoustics. The effectiveness of observations in the infrared spectrum is compared to observations in the visible spectrum to assess the viability of infrared imagery for cetacean detection and classification. Imagery was obtained at Lime Kiln Park, Washington from 7/6/10-7/9/10 using a FLIR Thermovision A40M infrared camera (7.5-14 mu m, 37 HFOV, 320x240 pixels) under ideal atmospheric conditions (clear skies, calm seas, and wind speed 0-4 m/s). Whales were detected during both day (9 detections) and night (75 detections) at distances ranging from 42 to 162 m. The temperature contrast between dorsal fins and the sea surface ranged from 0.5 to 4.6 degrees C. Differences in emissivity from sea surface to dorsal fin are shown to aid detection at high incidence angles (near grazing). A comparison to theory is presented, and observed deviations from theory are investigated. A guide for infrared camera selection based on site geometry and desired target size is presented, with specific considerations regarding marine mammal detection. Atmospheric conditions required to use visible and infrared cameras for marine mammal detection are established and compared with 2008 meteorological data for the proposed tidal energy site. Using conservative assumptions, infrared observations are predicted to provide a 74% increase in hours of possible detection, compared with visual observations.

AB  - Visual line transect (VLT) surveys are central to the monitoring and study of marine mammals. However, for cryptic species such as deep diving cetaceans VLT surveys alone suffer from problems of low sample sizes and availability bias where animals below the surface are not available to be detected. The advent of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) technology offers important opportunities to observe deep diving cetaceans but statistical challenges remain particularly when trying to integrate VLT and PAM data. Herein, we present a general framework to combine these data streams to estimate abundance when both surveys are conducted simultaneously. Secondarily, our approach can also be used to derive an estimate of availability bias. We outline three methods that vary in complexity and data requirements which are (1) a simple distance sampling (DS) method that treats the two datasets independently (DS-DS Method), (2) a fully integrated approach that applies a capture-mark recapture (CMR) analysis to the PAM data (CMR-DS Method) and (3) a hybrid approach that requires only a subset of the PAM CMR data (Hybrid Method). To evaluate their performance, we use simulations based on known diving and vocalizing behavior of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). As a case study, we applied the Hybrid Method to data from a shipboard survey of sperm whales and compared estimates to a VLT only analysis. Simulation results demonstrated that the CMR-DS Method and Hybrid Method reduced bias by >90% for both abundance and availability bias in comparison to the simpler DS -DS Method. Overall, the CMR-DS Method was the least biased and most precise. For the case study, our application of the Hybrid Method to the sperm whale dataset produced estimates of abundance and availability bias that were comparable to estimates from the VLT only analysis but with considerably higher precision. Integrating multiple sources of data is an important goal with clear benefits. As a step towards that goal we have developed a novel framework. Results from this study are promising although challenges still remain. Future work may focus on applying this method to other deep-diving species and comparing the proposed method to other statistical approaches that aim to combine information from multiple data sources.

AB  - In the context of passive acoustic monitoring of large whales, we propose a new method for localizing blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) from the acoustic recordings of only one sensor. We use a precise modelling of the sound propagation thanks to SPECFEM, a spectral element code for solving wave propagation equations. Based on field measurements in Northern Chile, we ran a simulation on a large supercomputer. We also exploited a recording device, Bombyx II, for one and a half months, with visual monitoring of the zone by a group of experts. We find that the method applied to the south east Pacific song of blue whales gives theoretical results of about 50% success in position recovery. Since we have redundancy in our data, we were able to locate the whale with a precision of 500 m over a box of 10 km by 5 km in the case when we have both visual detection and a strong acoustic signal. More tests should be performed before validating this method, but these first results are encouraging.

AB  - In recent years there is growing concern that the use of mid-frequency (1-10 kHz) tactical sonar may be causing atypical mass stranding of some species of whales. Beaked whales form a family of 21 species of mostly deep diving whales that range from 4 to 13 meters long with a characteristic 'beak' similar to dolphins. The beaked whale species common in the Mediterranean Sea, the Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), seem uniquely vulnerable to the effects of mid-frequency sonar. These whales make deep dives (nearly 2000 m), typically lasting 20 to 30 minutes but as long as 85 minutes, and together with their minimal surface expression, make visual detection difficult.
   Although the detailed cause and effect of sonar-related whale strandings are still unknown and subject to intensive research, NURC has been developing a small towed system that not only detects deep-diving whales but also allows for real-time localization. The goal is to detect marine mammals in an area of acoustic experiments that involve high power sonar sources. The Compact Passive Acoustic Monitor (CPAM) lets researchers to monitor the environment with persistent data collection and results reporting. It uses advanced passive acoustic processing technology to capture and analyze very high frequency, short transient signals from marine mammals. A small volumetric array of four hydrophones together with depth and orientation sensors results in true three-dimensional direction finding. In this paper, we describe CPAM and some of the data obtained from engineering tests as well as a recent large-scale marine mammal survey cruise conducted in the Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) produce song and non-song vocalisations, which allows their presence to be detected through passive acoustic monitoring. To determine the seasonal and diel acoustic presence and acoustic behaviour of humpback whales at the migratory stopover site off Bermuda, three hydrophones were deployed between March 2018 and April 2019 on Challenger Bank and the Bermuda platform. Song was the predominant vocalisation type encountered, with 65% of song recordings containing whale chorus and a clear seasonal trend of humpback whale occurrence in the spring and winter months from late December to mid-May. A strong diel pattern in singing activity was detected. Singing activity significantly increased at night relative to the daytime (p<0.01), whilst twilight periods were characterised by intermediate levels of singing. The song structure encountered in spring 2018 consisted of 18 units, 6 themes and 5 transitional phrases. The high occurrence of whale chorus and the strong seasonal and diel patterns of male humpback whale singing activity highlights the importance of Bermuda not just on their northward migration during spring, as described historically, but also on their southward migration during winter. Bermuda therefore constitutes a two-way migratory stopover site for humpback whales. The present study also provides Bermuda's planning authorities with better constraints on the duration and intensity of anthropogenic activities in these waters.

AB  - Passive acoustic observation of whales is an increasingly important tool for whale research. Accurately detecting whale sounds and correctly classifying them into corresponding whale species are essential tasks, especially in the case when two species of whales vocalize in the same observed area. Whistles are vital vocalizations of toothed whales, such as killer whales and long-finned pilot whales. In this paper, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a novel method is proposed to detect and classify whistles of both killer whales and long-finned pilot whales. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed one can automatically learn the sound characteristics from the training data, without specifying the sound features for classification and detection, and thus shows better adaptability to complex sound signals. First, the denoised sound to be analyzed is sent to the trained detection model to estimate the number and positions of the target whistles. The detected whistles are then sent to the trained classification model, which determines the corresponding whale species. A GUI interface is developed to assist with the detection and classification process. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 97% correct detection rate and 95% correct classification rate on the testing set. In the future, the presented method can be further applied to passive acoustic observation applications for some other whale or dolphin species. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many observations collected from whaling logbooks or more recent satellite tags and acoustic surveys report that the Indian Ocean is a very important place for large baleen whales. They undergo long seasonal migrations from Southern feeding grounds to tropical and subtropical mating and breeding grounds. However, whether and where they stop to rest or feed during their long travels are poorly known. The Indian Ocean is also home to many odontocete species such as sperm whales, killer whales and multiple delphinid species. In this paper, we analyze passive acoustic data collected by an electric glider around two steep bathymetric features located in the Western sub-tropical Indian Ocean (Walters Shoal) and in the mid sub-tropical Indian Ocean (St. Paul and Amsterdam islands), both included in Important Marine Mammal Areas (IMMAs). The acoustic data were manually reviewed and annotated by two analysts. The aim of this experiment was to improve the knowledge on marine mammal presence in these little studied IMMAs. We found that bioacoustic activity was quite high in both monitored areas with 40% of the records con-taining marine mammal sounds in Walters Shoal and 70% in St. Paul and Amsterdam islands. Calls from Antarctic blue whales, Southwestern and Southeastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue whales, fin whales and an unidentified baleen whale were detected at one or both sites. Odontocete clicks and whistles were also recorded at both sites. The discussion puts these marine mammal acoustic detections back into the context of their seasonal and geographical presence already described by other studies in the Indian Ocean and makes hypotheses about the role of the two studied areas for marine mammals.

AB  - Understanding the relative performance of data collection methods is critical for the production of robust results in any biological field study. This is particularly relevant for monitoring studies of rare and inconspicuous species, such as some cetaceans. Here, we compared how passive acoustic and visual survey methods performed when surveying a multispecies cetacean community in a large-scale survey area and whether the simultaneous application of these methods leads to complementary results. For both methods we compared (1) frequency of unscheduled survey stoppages, (2) detection ranges, (3) success in identifying species, (4) precedence of either method in synchronous detections, (5) detection rates, and (6) influence of sea state on detection rates. Data were collected during 4 surveys conducted between 2015 and 2017, using simultaneous visual and acoustic methods in the Santos Basin, Brazil. A total of 1492 h of simultaneous sampling yielded 617 detections, of which 46.5% (n = 287) were exclusively acoustic, 18.5% (n = 114) were exclusively visual, and 35% (n = 216) were corresponding detections of the same group made by each method, resulting in 108 paired detections. The simultaneous application of visual and acoustic methods was complementary. Acoustics were more efficient in detecting cetaceans-detecting first and further from the vessel and with a greater detection rate-whereas visual observation was more accurate for species identification. When used together, detection rates per species increased, reducing potential biases. By improving acoustic classification through visually confirmed sightings, this integrated approach has the potential to provide a reliable sound library for cetaceans in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - In previous work we described an algorithm based on an acoustic propagation model that was used for passive acoustic localization of vocalizing marine mammals. Differences between measured and modeled pair-wise time-differences of arrival were used to define an ambiguity surface that identifies the most probable whale location in a horizontal plane around an array. The algorithm has been successfully applied to humpback whale calls in deep water near Hawaii and blue whale calls in shallow water near California. In this work, we return to Hawaii to track another species of whale, the sperm whale, whose calls are brief, broadband clicks. Acoustic localizations are in close proximity in space and time to aerial observations of sperm whales. We were also able to verify the algorithm's accuracy in a controlled source experiment at the Navy's AUTEC range in the Bahamas. Recordings of sperm whale clicks were broadcast and successfully tracked. The localization accuracy of the model-based technique and traditional hyperbolic techniques is compared.

AB  - Killer whales in British Columbia are at risk, and little is known about their winter distribution. Passive acoustic monitoring of their year-round habitat is a valuable supplemental method to traditional visual and photographic surveys. However, long-term acoustic studies of odontocetes have some limitations, including the generation of large amounts of data that require highly time-consuming processing. There is a need to develop tools and protocols to maximize the efficiency of such studies. Here, two types of analysis, real-time and long term spectral averages, were compared to assess their performance at detecting killer whale calls in long-term acoustic recordings. In addition, two different duty cycles, 1/3 and 2/3, were tested. Both the use of long term spectral averages and a lower duty cycle resulted in a decrease in call detection and positive pod identification, leading to underestimations of the amount of time the whales were present. The impact of these limitations should be considered in future killer whale acoustic surveys. A compromise between a lower resolution data processing method and a higher duty cycle is suggested for maximum methodological efficiency. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Beaked whales produce frequency-modulated echolocation pulses that appear to be species-specific, allowing passive acoustic monitoring to play a role in understanding spatio-temporal patterns. The Cross Seamount beaked whale is known only from its unique echolocation signal (BWC) with no confirmed species identification. This beaked whale spans the Pacific Ocean from the Mariana Archipelago to Baja California, Mexico, south to the equator, but only as far north as latitude 29 & DEG;N. Within these warm waters, 92% of BWC detections occurred at night, 6% during crepuscular periods, and only 2% during daylight hours. Detections of BWC signals on drifting recorders with a vertical hydrophone array at 150 m depth demonstrated that foraging often occurred shallow in the water column (<150 m). No other species of beaked whale to date has been documented foraging in waters this shallow. Given their nocturnal, shallow foraging dives, this species appears to prefer prey that may be available in the water column only during those hours. The foraging behavior of Cross Seamount beaked whales appears to be unique among all beaked whales, and these findings contribute additional ecological and acoustic information which can help guide future efforts to identify this cryptic whale.

AB  - Aquatic biotelemetry increasingly relies on using acoustic transmitters ('tags') that enable passive detection of tagged animals using fixed or mobile receivers. Both tracking methods are resource-limited, restricting the spatial area in which movements of highly mobile animals can be measured using proprietary detection systems. Transmissions from tags are recorded by underwater noise monitoring systems designed for other purposes, such as cetacean monitoring devices, which have been widely deployed in the marine environment; however, no tools currently exist to decode these detections, and thus valuable additional information on animal movements may be missed. Here, we describe simple hybrid methods, with potentially wide application, for obtaining information from otherwise unused data sources. The methods were developed using data from moored, acoustic cetacean detectors (C-PODs) and towed passive receiver arrays, often deployed to monitor the vocalisations of cetaceans, but any similarly formatted data source could be used. The method was applied to decode tag detections that were found to have come from two highly mobile fish species, bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and Twaite shad (Alosa fallax), that had been tagged in other studies. Decoding results were validated using test tags; range testing data were used to demonstrate the relative efficiency of these receiver methods in detecting tags. This approach broadens the range of equipment from which acoustic tag detections can be decoded. Novel detections derived from the method could add significant value to past and present tracking studies at little additional cost, by providing new insights into the movement of mobile animals at sea.

AB  - The easily identifiable, high-amplitude echolocation signals produced by sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus make the species ideal for long-term passive acoustic monitoring. Sperm whale signals were manually identified in the recordings from high-frequency acoustic recording packages monitoring 13 deep-water locations across the central and western North Pacific Ocean from 2005 to 2013, constituting the longest passive acoustic study of sperm whales to date. The species was detected at all of the sites, with the highest detection rate at Ladd Seamount (>18% of analyzed periods) and the lowest rates at equatorial sites (<1 % of analyzed periods). Generalized additive models and generalized estimating equations were used to produce explanatory models to assess temporal and geographic patterns. The model variables included diel phase, lunar day, day of the year, year, and site. The site-specific variability in detection rates was high across the North Pacific, but there were also common patterns, including a seasonal trend, with decreased detections during the summer or fall, and a diel trend, with increased detections at night. There appeared to be a seasonal movement pattern, with minimum detection rates occurring later in the year at more northerly sites. The nocturnal pattern was seen across all data sets but was not strong at equatorial locations. Although lunar cycles were important at many sites, there was no consistent trend at any spatial scale. Overall, this analysis confirms the broad distribution of sperm whales across the North Pacific and highlights the subtle temporal patterns in their acoustic activity, which may be related to shifts in animal behavior or movement.

AB  - This paper proposes an algorithm for whale monitoring by passive acoustic using four short-spaced hydrophones. It is successfully tested on the NEutrino Mediterranean Observatory - Ocean Noise Detection Experiment (NEMO ONDE) underwater acoustic platform. In past years, interest in marine mammals has increased, leading to the development of passive acoustic methods of localization which permits to study whales' behavior in deep water (several hundreds of meters) without interfering with the animals. In this paper, we propose a robust Angle of Arrival (AoA) tracking algorithm, which provides an estimation of elevation and azimuth angles in spite of the short distance between hydrophones, which does not allow direct 3D localization. Moreover we show that, in some cases, the time-delay between direct signal and its reflection on the sea surface allows the range estimation, and thus the exact localization of the whale. The classic AoA estimation is performed with a non-linear regression, and it is compared with a more sophisticated algorithm, the Rao-Blackwell Monte Carlo Data Association. We demonstrate that the second method is very robust to the presence of clutter. According to the Pavi 2009 workshop challenge, our algorithm is the only one performing relevant tracks of whale.

AB  - Estimates of abundance and their changes through time are key elements of marine mammal conservation and management. Absolute marine mammal abundance in a region of the open ocean is often difficult to attain. However, methods of estimating their abundance based on passive acoustic recordings are becoming increasingly employed. This study shows that passive acoustic monitoring of North Atlantic minke whales with a single hydrophone provides sufficient information to estimate relative population abundance. An automated detector was developed for minke whale pulse trains and an approach for converting its output into a relative abundance index is proposed by accounting for detectability as well as false positives and negatives. To demonstrate this technique, a 2 y dataset from the seven sites of the Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network project on the U.S. east coast was analyzed. Resulting relative abundance indices confirm pulse train-calling minke whale presence in the deep waters of the outer continental shelf. The minkes are present December through April annually with the highest abundance near the site offshore of Savannah, Georgia.

AB  - Fin whales Balaenoptera physalus produce stereotyped low-frequency calls (1530 Hz) that can be detected at great ranges and are considered song when produced in a repeated temporal pattern. These calls, referred to as 20 Hz calls, were localized and tracked using a 1 km aperture array of 4 passive acoustic recorders at approximately 800 m depth northwest of San Clemente Island, offshore of Southern California, USA, for 4 continuous weeks during late fall 2007. A total of 1454 calls were localized over the recording period. The average (+/- SD) estimated source sound pressure level was 194.8 +/- 0.2 dB(pp) re 1 mu Pa-2 at 1 m (where pp is peak-to-peak) and 180.9 +/- 0.2 dB(rms) re 1 mu Pa at 1 m (where rms is root mean square). The majority of these calls were in the form of a doublet song pattern, with average inter-pulse intervals of 13 and 18 s. These tracks are the first to be reported for transiting solitary singing fin whales using passive acoustic monitoring techniques. Acoustic tracking of fin whales provides insight into the ecology and behavior of this endangered species as well as vocal behaviors, which are important when studying the potential impact of anthropogenic noise. Call source sound pressure level, along with calling behavior, provides important parameters required for population density estimation. Furthermore, studying fin whale song patterns may aid in distinguishing different subpopulations.

AB  - Three killer whale ecotypes are found in the Northeastern Pacific: residents, transients, and offshores. These ecotypes can be discriminated in passive acoustic data based on distinct pulsed call repertoires. Killer whale acoustic encounters for which ecotypes were assigned based on pulsed call matching were used to characterize the ecotype-specific echolocation clicks. Recordings were made using seafloor-mounted sensors at shallow (& SIM;120 m) and deep (& SIM;1400 m) monitoring locations off the coast of Washington state. All ecotypes' echolocation clicks were characterized by energy peaks between 12 and 19 kHz, however, resident clicks featured sub peaks at 13.7 and 18.8 kHz, while offshore clicks had a single peak at 14.3 kHz. Transient clicks were rare and were characterized by lower peak frequencies (12.8 kHz). Modal inter-click intervals (ICIs) were consistent but indistinguishable for resident and offshore killer whale encounters at the shallow site (0.21-0.22 s). Offshore ICIs were longer and more variable at the deep site, and no modal ICI was apparent for the transient ecotype. Resident and offshore killer whale ecotype may be identified and distinguished in large passive acoustic datasets based on properties of their echolocation clicks, however, transient echolocation may be unsuitable in isolation as a cue for monitoring applications.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool that allows remote detection of marine mammals through their vocalizations. While call detection provides information on species presence, additional information may be contained within the vocalizations that could provide more information regarding the demographics and/or number of individuals in a particular area based on passive acoustic detections. The North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis produces a stereotyped upswept call, termed the upcall, that is thought to function as a long-distance contact call in this species. As such, the call is likely to contain cues providing information about the individual producing it. The goal of this study was to test whether the right whale upcall could potentially encode information related to the identity and age of the caller. Using upcalls recorded from 14 known individuals through non-invasive suction cup archival acoustic tags, we demonstrate that the upcall does contain sufficient information to discriminate individual identity and age class, with average classification levels of 72.6 and 86.1%, respectively. Parameters measured from the fundamental frequency, duration, and formant structure were most important for discrimination among individuals. This study is the first step in demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining additional data from passive acoustic monitoring to aid in the conservation efforts for this highly endangered species.

AB  - Killer whales are apex predators with temporally and spatially varying distributions throughout the world's oceans. Their ecology and behaviour are poorly understood in most regions due to limited research, often because of logistical challenges. Here, we used a passive acoustic monitoring device to investigate the seasonal acoustic occurrence and diel vocalizing behaviour of killer whales around the remote sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs), Southern Ocean. Killer whales showed diel vocalizing patterns that varied seasonally in relation to their prey abundance and social activities. Killer whale calls were intermittently detected year-round with a high number of hours containing calls in October to December, and a secondary peak in February to May, corresponding to seal prey abundance. Random forest modelling identified wind speed as the primary predictor of the occurrence of killer whale calls (with a negative correlation) while sea surface height, chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature were moderately important. We provide the first acoustic evidence that killer whale occurrence around the PEIs might coincide with variability in environmental conditions and prey abundance. Our results provide the first indication of diel vocalizing pattern of killer whales in the Southern Ocean. This knowledge is important for understanding killer whale ecology and adaptation to the changing oceans.

AB  - Sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus produce loud, stereotypical click sequences and are an ideal species to be studied with passive acoustic techniques. To increase our limited knowledge of sperm whale occurrence patterns in remote and inaccessible locations of the North Pacific, we analyzed a five-year-long (June 2007-April 2012) acoustic data set recorded at Ocean Station PAPA (OSP; 50 degrees N, 145 degrees W) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Firstly, we assessed the sperm whale detection performance of the Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), and secondly, we investigated temporal patterns of sperm whale presence at OSP. The PAL proved highly efficient, with above 50% probability of detecting more than two sperm whales, a condition met for over 50% of the recordings. Results indicated that sperm whale clicks were recorded year-round, with a clear seasonal pattern. The number of detections during the summer months was approximately 70% higher compared to winter. An ambient noise analysis showed that differences in detection rates were likely not driven by seasonal changes in ambient noise levels. The average propagation range of sperm whale clicks ranged between 7 and 8 km between summer and winter, with slightly decreased detection distances observed in winter. Seasonal shifts in the intensity of the Alaska Current and the latitudinal oscillations of the North Pacific Transition Zone results in changes in water mixing, transport of nutrients and the concentration of prey such as squid, which likely drives sperm whale distribution.

AB  - False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) feed primarily on several species of large pelagic fish, species that are also targeted by the Hawai'i-permitted commercial deep-set longline fishery. False killer whales have been known to approach fishing lines in an attempt to procure bait or catch from the lines, a behavior known as depredation. This behavior can lead to the hooking or entanglement of an animal, which currently exceeds sustainable levels for pelagic false killer whales in Hawaii. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was used to record false killer whales near longline fishing gear to investigate the timing, rate, and spatial extent of false killer whale occurrence. Acoustic data were collected using small autonomous recorders modified for deployment on the mainline of longline fishing gear. A total of 90 fishing sets were acoustically monitored in 2013 and 2014 on a chartered longline vessel using up to five acoustic recorders deployed throughout the fishing gear. Of the 102 odontocete click and/or whistle bouts detected on 55 sets, 26 bouts detected on 19 different fishing sets were classified as false killer whales with high or medium confidence based on either whistle classification, click classification, or both. The timing of false killer whale acoustic presence near the gear was related to the timing of fishing activities, with 57% of the false killer whale bouts occurring while gear was being hauled, with 50% of those bouts occurring during the first third of the haul. During three fishing sets, false killer whales were detected on more than one recorder, and in all cases the whales were recorded on instruments farther from the fishing vessel as the haul proceeded. Only three of the 19 sets with acoustically-confirmed false killer whale presence showed signs of bait or catch damage by marine mammals, which may relate to the difficulty of reporting depredation. PAM has proven to be a relatively inexpensive and efficient method for monitoring the Hawai'i longline fishery for interactions with false killer whales. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - a novel approach has been developed for detecting and classifying foraging calls of two mysticete species in passive acoustic recordings. This automated detector/classifier applies a computer-vision based technique, a pattern recognition method, to detect the foraging calls and remove ambient noise effects. The detected calls were then classified as blue whale D-calls [1] or fin whale 40-Hz calls [2] using a logistic regression classifier, a machine learning technique. The detector/classifier has been trained using the 2015 Detection, Classification, Localization and Density Estimation (DCLDE 2015, Scripps Institution of Oceanography UCSD [3]) low-frequency annotated set of passive acoustic data, collected in the Southern California Bight, and its out-of-sample performance was estimated by using a crossvalidation technique. The DCLDE 2015 scoring tool was used to estimate the detector/classifier performance in a standardized way. The pattern recognition algorithm's out-of-sample performance was scored as 96.68% recall with 92.03 % precision. The machine learning algorithm's out-of-sample prediction accuracy was 95.20%. The result indicated the potential of this detector/classifier on real-time passive acoustic marine mammal monitoring and bioacoustics signal processing.

AB  - This study presents evidence of diel patterns in fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 20 Hz acoustic presence in Eastern Antarctic waters. Passive acoustic recordings were collected at four sites in Eastern Antarctica from 2013 to 2019. A generalized linear model fitted by a generalized estimating equation was used to test the hypothesis that fin whale 20 Hz acoustic presence shows significant variation between light regimes dawn, day, dusk and night. In the Indian sector of Antarctica, at the Prydz and Southern Kerguelen Plateau sites, fin whale acoustic presence was significantly more common during the night and dawn before declining during the day and dusk periods. A different diel pattern was observed in the Pacific sector, at the Dumont d'Urville site: fin whale acoustic presence was significantly more common during the day than dusk and night periods. No diel pattern was identified at the Casey site. The identified diel patterns in the Indian sector of Eastern Antarctica correlate with previously identified diel patterns of the fin whales' prey. We suggest an indirect association between fin whale acoustic presence and foraging, with the animals more likely to produce the 20 Hz pulse during the night when not foraging and less likely to vocalize when foraging during the day.

AB  - Since its near extirpation during the period of industrial whaling in the early and mid 20th century, the once common Antarctic blue whale Balaenoptera musculus intermedia re mains extremely rare. While annual systematic surveys around Antarctica from 1978 to 2009 re corded only 216 visual encounters of this species, their loud and distinctive calls were detected frequently throughout the Southern Ocean. We describe and assess a new method for locating these whales by acoustically detecting their vocalisations, tracking the location of their calls, and finally locating the whales visually. This methodology was employed during an Antarctic research voyage from 140 degrees E to 170 degrees W, between January and March 2013. The loudest song unit (a 26 Hz tone) was detected at all 298 recording sites south of 52 degrees S. Acoustically derived bearings from these whales enabled visual observers to eventually sight the whales, often hundreds of kilometres from initial acoustic detections. Received sound pressure levels of detections increased with decreasing range to several hotspots where both song and non-song calls were detected. Within hotspots, short-range acoustic localisation yielded 33 visual encounters of Antarctic blue whales (group size: 1 to 5 whales) over a 31 d period south of 60 degrees S. These results demonstrate that acoustic tracking provides the capacity to locate Antarctic blue whales widely dispersed over many hundreds of kilometres, as well as the capacity to acoustically track individual whales for days at a time irrespective of most weather conditions. Thus, passive acoustic localisation is a reliable and efficient method to track Antarctic blue whales, and this technique should be considered for future studies of these iconic animals.

AB  - The southeast Pacific (SEP) contains the home ranges of several migratory large whale species, determined largely based on research in coastal waters. These whales' pelagic seasonal residency is unknown. The Juan Fernandez Archipelago (JFA) is an offshore island in the SEP where passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data collection is ongoing at the HA03 hydroacoustic station (sample rate of 250 Hz) maintained by the Preparatory Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Six years (2007-2009 and 2014-2016) of PAM data from HA03 were examined for the acoustic presence of Antarctic, Chilean (southeast Pacific 1, southeast Pacific 2), and southeast Indian Ocean blue whale song types; the fin whale 20-Hz song; and minke whale vocalizations. The weekly presence or absence of these six vocalization types was annotated manually by an expert analyst and then averaged across all years. For each vocalization type, the number of weeks per month with presence was averaged over all years. Consistently, we found austral wintertime presence of Antarctic blue, fin, and minke whales; and the year-round presence of Chilean blue whales. Southeast Indian Ocean blue whales were also detected, but very rarely. We discuss the possible seasonal movements of each species or acoustic group in the offshore SEP. This is the first year-round multispecies study of baleen whale in the offshore SEP and provides valuable information for understanding the migrations of endangered baleen whales in this region, highlighting the importance of offshore areas as hotspots for baleen whale biodiversity.

AB  - To properly conserve and manage wild populations, it is important to have information on abundance and population dynamics. In the case of rare and cryptic species, especially in remote locations, surveys can be difficult and expensive, and run the risk of not producing sample sizes large enough to produce precise estimates. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct preliminary analysis to determine if the study will produce useable estimates. The focus of this paper is a proposed mark-recapture study of Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia). Antarctic blue whales were hunted to near extinction up until the mid-1960s, when commercial exploitation of this species ended. Current abundance estimates are a decade old. Furthermore, at present, there are no formal circumpolar-level cetacean surveys operating in Antarctic waters and, specifically, there is no strategy to monitor the potential recovery of Antarctic blue whales. Hence the work in this paper was motivated by the need to inform decisions on strategies for future monitoring of Antarctic blue whale population. The paper describes a model to predict the precision and bias of estimates from a proposed survey program. The analysis showed that mark-recapture is indeed a suitable method to provide a circumpolar abundance estimate of Antarctic blue whales, with precision of the abundance, at the midpoint of the program, predicted to be between 0.2 and 0.3. However, this was only if passive acoustic tracking was utilized to increase the encounter rate. The analysis also provided guidance on general design for an Antarctic blue whale program, showing that it requires a 12-year duration; although surveys do not necessarily need to be run every year if multiple vessels are available to clump effort. Mark-recapture is based on a number of assumptions; it was evident from the analysis that ongoing analysis and monitoring of the data would be required to check such assumptions hold (e.g., test for heterogeneity), with the modeling adjusted as needed.

AB  - Several seamounts have been identified as hotspots of marine life in the Azores, acting as feeding stations for top predators, including cetaceans. Passive acoustic monitoring is an efficient tool to study temporal variations in the occurrence and behaviour of vocalizing cetacean species. We deployed bottom-moored Ecological Acoustic Recorders (EARs) to investigate the temporal patterns in acoustic presence and foraging activity of oceanic dolphins at two seamounts (Condor and Gigante) in the Azores. Data were collected in March-May 2008 and April 2010-February 2011. Dolphins were present year round and nearly every day at both seamounts. Foraging signals (buzzes and bray calls) were recorded in >87% of the days dolphin were present. There was a strong diel pattern in dolphin acoustic occurrence and behaviour, with higher detections of foraging and echolocation vocalizations during the night and of social signals during daylight hours. Acoustic data demonstrate that small dolphins consistently use Condor and Gigante seamounts to forage at night. These results suggest that these seamounts likely are important feeding areas for dolphins. This study contributes to a better understanding of the feeding ecology of oceanic dolphins and provides new insights into the role of seamount habitats for top predators.

AB  - The relative distribution of sperm whales (Physeler macrocephalus) and sea surface temperature (SST) fronts have been studied in summer in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. We used passive acoustic data (778 samples) obtained offshore during dedicated surveys between 1999 and 2004 and Pathfinder/Modis remote sensing data to compute front maps and to calculate mean distances from sperm whale detections (N=132) to SST-fronts. Mean distances from sperm whale acoustic detections to SST fronts were significantly lower (10.4 km) than from other acoustic samples to those fronts (17.0 km). The same result was obtained when calculating distances from sperm whales to the North Balearic Front surface signature. If sperm whales are commonly observed along the continental slope, we showed that offshore individuals were located close to SST fronts. This bimodal distribution in the north-western Mediterranean is linked to sperm whale feeding,, demonstrating ecological opportunistic behaviour in this high level predator.

AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) undergo seasonal migration in the Arctic Sea. Because their migration and distribution is likely affected by changes in global climate, we aimed to examine the migration timing of fin whales, and the relationship with prey availability within the oceanographic environment of the Arctic Sea, using passive and active acoustic monitoring methods. Automatic Underwater Sound Monitoring Systems were deployed in the southern Chukchi Sea from July 2012 to 2014 to determine the acoustic presence of fin whales. Furthermore, water temperature and salinity were recorded by a fixed data logger. An Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler was additionally deployed to estimate prey abundance through backscattering strength. Sea ice concentrations were obtained by remote sensing data. Fin whale calls were automatically detected using a custom-made software, and the per cent of half-hours containing calls were counted. Fin whale calls were detected from 4 August to 20 October 2012 (78 d) and 25 July to 1 November 2013 (100 d). The extended period of acoustic presence of fin whales during 2013 when compared with 2012 is likely related to a longer ice-free period during 2013. Furthermore, generalized linear model analyses showed that half-hour periods containing calls increased with a rise in water temperature and zooplankton abundance during the initial call presence period, while they decreased with a decrease in water temperature and salinity during the end of the call presence period. Our results suggest that the rise in water temperature and zooplankton abundance affect the timing of migration of fin whales in away that is consistent with the expansion of their suitable habitats and the extension of their presence in the Arctic Sea.

AB  - To date, there has been no dedicated study in Australian waters on the acoustics of killer whales. Hence no information has been published on the sounds produced by killer whales from this region. Here we present the first acoustical analysis of recordings collected off the Western Australian coast. Underwater sounds produced by Australian killer whales were recorded during the months of February and March 2014 and 2015 in the Bremer Canyon in Western Australia. Vocalisations recorded included echolocation clicks, burst-pulse sounds and whistles. A total of 28 hours and 29 minutes were recorded and analysed, with 2376 killer whale calls (whistles and burst-pulse sounds) detected. Recordings of poor quality or signal-to-noise ratio were excluded from analysis, resulting in 142 whistles and burst-pulse vocalisations suitable for analysis and categorisation. These were grouped based on their spectrographic features into nine Bremer Canyon (BC) "call types". The frequency of the fundamental contours of all call types ranged from 600 Hz to 29 kHz. Calls ranged from 0.05 to 11.3 seconds in duration. Biosonar clicks were also recorded, but not studied further. Surface behaviours noted during acoustic recordings were categorised as either travelling or social behaviour. A detailed description of the acoustic characteristics is necessary for species acoustic identification and for the development of passive acoustic tools for population monitoring, including assessments of population status, habitat usage, migration patterns, behaviour and acoustic ecology. This study provides the first quantitative assessment and report on the acoustic features of killer whales vocalisations in Australian waters, and presents an opportunity to further investigate this little-known population.

AB  - An acoustic Digital MONitor (DMON) has been integrated into a Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicle to serve as a general-use tool for passive acoustic sensing of marine mammal vocalizations. The system is being developed as a complement to conventional ship-based cetacean survey methods. The acoustic system includes three omnidirectional hydrophones, one located on centerline of the aft payload hatch and one on each wingtip. An on-board real-time detector has been implemented to record an audio sample if ambient noise has risen above a user-prescribed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold level. The data size and the number of detections are available in semi-real time, and the acoustic data are retrieved upon recovery of the instrument. Because the DMON system interfaces with the Seaglider firmware, the glider pilot has the capability to modify several operational parameters governing the collection of acoustic data while the glider is deployed to tailor the data recording to the desired mission objectives. This implementation is referred to as the Seaglider Customizable Sampling Configuration (SCSC) DMON and has recorded a wide variety of cetacean vocal activity offshore the Hawaiian Islands.

AB  - Eight years of passive acoustic data (2007-2014) from the Beaufort Sea were used to estimate the mean cue rate (calling rate) of individual bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) during their fall migration along the North Slope of Alaska. Calls detected on directional acoustic recorders (DASARs) were triangulated to provide estimates of locations at times of call production, which were then translated into call densities (calls/h/km(2)). Various assumptions were used to convert call density into animal cue rates, including the time for whales to cross the arrays of acoustic recorders, the population size, the fraction of the migration corridor missed by the localizing array system, and the fraction of the seasonal migration missed because recorders were retrieved before the end of the migration. Taking these uncertainties into account in various combinations yielded up to 351 cue rate estimates, which summarize to a median of 1.3 calls/whale/h and an interquartile range of 0.5-5.4 calls/whale/h.

AB  - North Pacific minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) boing calls are commonly detected in Hawaiian waters. When producing boing vocalizations, minke whales seem to be in one of two calling behavioral states. Most often minke whales produce boings with inter-call intervals of several minutes, but sometimes minke whales call rapidly with inter-call intervals of less than a minute. Since minke whales are difficult to detect visually, cue-rate-based density estimation using passive acoustic monitoring has been proposed. However, the variables that influence cue rate or calling rate are poorly understood in most whales, including minke whales. We collected passive acoustic recordings from 47 bottom-mounted hydrophones at the Pacific Missile Range Facility's instrumented range off the coast of KauaModified Letter Turned Commai, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai to test the hypothesis that minke whales call more rapidly when closer in proximity to other calling conspecifics. A total of 599 days of data were recorded between August 2012 and July 2017 and were automatically post-processed to detect, classify, and localize calls. Localized calls were grouped into tracks and manually validated, resulting in 509 individual tracks composed of 36,033 calls within a 16 x 39 km focal study area. Tracked minke whales exhibited a strong bimodal call rate with means of one call every 6.85 min (sigma= 2.54 min) and 0.63 min (sigma= 0.36 min). We ran hidden Markov models to quantify the relationship between call rate and the distance to the nearest calling conspecific. Overall, the probability of the higher call rate occurring increased as the distance to the nearest conspecific decreased, and the probability of the lower call rate occurring increased as the distance to the nearest conspecific increased. We also examined individual track data and found that minke whales may also exhibit other responses (i.e. increased speed, changes in heading, and cessation of calling) when calling conspecifics are nearby. These findings provide new information about minke whale calling behavior in what is likely a breeding area.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has been successfully used to study deep-diving marine mammal populations. To assess regional population trends of sperm whales in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM), including impacts of the Deepwater Horizon platform oil spill in 2010, the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center-Gulf Ecological Monitoring and Modeling (LADC-GEMM) consortium collected broadband acoustic data in the Mississippi Valley/Canyon area between 2007 and 2017 using bottom-anchored moorings. These data allow the inference of short-term and long-term variations in site-specific abundances of sperm whales derived from their acoustic activity. A comparison is made between the abundances of sperm whales at specific sites in different years before and after the oil spill by estimating the regional abundance density. The results show that sperm whales were present in the region throughout the entire monitoring period. A habitat preference shift was observed for sperm whales after the 2010 oil spill with higher activities at sites farther away from the spill site. A comparison of the 2007 and 2015 results shows that the overall regional abundance of sperm whales did not recover to pre-spill levels. The results indicate that long-term spatially distributed acoustic monitoring is critical in characterizing sperm whale population changes and in understanding how environmental stressors impact regional abundances and the habitat use of sperm whales.

AB  - Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) have learned to remove fish from demersal longline gear deployments off the eastern Gulf of Alaska, and are often observed to arrive at a site after a haul begins, suggesting a response to potential acoustic cues like fishing-gear strum, hydraulic winch tones, and propeller cavitation. Passive acoustic recorders attached to anchorlines have permitted continuous monitoring of the ambient noise environment before and during fishing hauls. Timing and tracking analyses of sperm whale acoustic activity during three encounters indicate that cavitation arising from changes in ship propeller speeds is associated with interruptions in nearby sperm whale dive cycles and changes in acoustically derived positions. This conclusion has been tested by cycling a vessel engine and noting the arrival of whales by the vessel, even when the vessel is not next to fishing gear. No evidence of response from activation of ship hydraulics or fishing gear strum has been found to date. (C) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Several cetacean and pinniped species use the northeastern Chukchi Sea as seasonal or year-round habitat. This area has experienced pronounced reduction in the extent of summer sea ice over the last decade, as well as increased anthropogenic activity, particularly in the form of oil and gas exploration. The effects of these changes on marine mammal species are presently unknown. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders were deployed over a wide area of the northeastern Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska from Cape Lisburne to Barrow, at distances from 8 km to 200 km from shore: up to 44 each summer and up to 8 each winter. Acoustic data were acquired at 16 kHz continuously during summer and on a duty cycle of 40 or 48 min within each 4-h period during winter. Recordings were analyzed manually and using automated detection and classification systems to identify calls.
   Bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whale calls were detected primarily from April through June and from September to December during their migrations between the Bering and Beaufort seas. Summer detections were rare and usually concentrated off Wainwright and Barrow, Alaska. Gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whale calls were detected between July and October, their occurrence decreasing with increasing distance from shore. Fin (Balaenoptera physalus), killer (Orcinus orca), minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales were detected sporadically in summer and early fall. Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) was the most commonly detected species between June and October, primarily occupying the southern edge of Hanna Shoal and haul-outs near coastal recording stations off Wainwright and Point Lay. Ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals occur year-round in the Chukchi Sea. Ringed seal acoustic detections occurred throughout the year but detection numbers were low, likely due to low vocalization rates. Bearded seal acoustic detections peaked in April and May during their breeding season, with much lower detection numbers in July and August, likely as a result of reduced calling rates after breeding season. Ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata) were only detected in the fall as they migrated south through the study area toward the Bering Sea. These results suggest a regular presence of marine mammals in the Chukchi Sea year-round, with species-dependent seasonal and spatial density variations. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Acoustic detection of cetaceans is challenged by the variability of calls and the presence of variable background noise. One detection method is to start with frequency band-limited signal and noise estimates, and apply a likelihood ratio test (LRT). These detectors suffer from false alarms when broadband signals overlap the band of interest, triggering detection. Some detectors only consider previous samples, causing further false alarms. The authors propose a method of reducing false alarms by defining a guard band that is not expected to contain energy from the species of interest. A second LRT is performed by testing the ratio of the signal estimate in the signal band with the signal estimate of the guard band. This method is shown to reduce false alarms with a small reduction in detection performance. A detection method is also presented that can be optimized for high processing efficiency, while improving false-alarm rejection from signals that are longer in duration than the signal of interest. Performance is demonstrated on real cetacean recordings and ocean noise. The detection algorithm is implemented in PAMGUARD, an open source Java application designed for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of cetaceans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an increasingly used technique to access the occurrence, distribution, and abundance of cetaceans that may be visually unavailable most of the time. The largest tailings dam failure disaster occurred on 5 November 2015, when the Fundao dam collapsed, releasing over 50 million cubic meters of tailings into the Doce River basin; 14 days later, the tailings plume reached the Atlantic Ocean. PAM was implemented in the concerned area and cetacean species were acoustically identified. Whistles and clicks of visual and acoustic matches were used to predict and classify exclusive acoustic records through random forest models. The identified species were Guiana, rough-toothed, and bottlenose dolphins. Additionally, the franciscana, the most threatened cetacean in the western South Atlantic Ocean, was also acoustically identified. The whistle classifier had 86.9% accuracy with final frequency, duration, and maximum frequency ranked as the most important parameters. The clicks classifier had 86.7% accuracy with peak frequency and 3 dB bandwidth as the most important parameters for classifying species. Considering the potential effect of the increase in turbidity on sound transmission, such as attenuation, the presented classifier should be continuously improved with novel data collected from long-term acoustic monitoring.

AB  - Pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima) are deep diving cetaceans that commonly strand along the coast of the southeast US, but that are difficult to study visually at sea because of their elusive behavior. Conventional visual surveys are thought to significantly underestimate the presence of Kogia and they have proven difficult to approach for tracking and tagging. An approach is presented for density estimation of signals presumed to be from Kogia spp. based on passive acoustic monitoring data collected at sites in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) from the period following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010-2013). Both species of Kogia are known to inhabit the GOM, although it is not possible to acoustically separate the two based on available knowledge of their echolocation clicks. An increasing interannual density trend is suggested for animals near the primary zone of impact of the oil spill, and to the southeast of the spill. Densities were estimated based on both counting individual echolocation clicks and counting the presence of groups of animals during one-min time windows. Densities derived from acoustic monitoring at three sites are all substantially higher (4-16 animals/1000 km(2)) than those that have been derived for Kogia from line transect visual surveys in the same region (0.5 animals/1000 km(2)). The most likely explanation for the observed discrepancy is that the visual surveys are underestimating Kogia spp. density, due to the assumption of perfect detectability on the survey trackline. We present an alternative approach for density estimation, one that derives echolocation and behavioral parameters based on comparison of modeled and observed sound received levels at sites of varying depth.

AB  - Recognition of the potential disturbance from whale-based tourism has stimulated the discussion of whether whale watching remains ?no take?. Here we use observations and passive acoustic surveillance of tourism activities of foraging gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) on the west coast of Vancouver Island to better understand the pressures on whales that are repeatedly subject to aerial and vessel-based viewing. Pressure from the fleet was greatest for low prey years, whereby fewer whales were subject to a greater number of encounters with whale watching vessels. The pressure on operators for close encounters was also greater during these years. The acoustic recordings found that whale watching vessels shaped the soundscape, with a distinct diurnal pattern. Acoustic reactions by the whales were also noted. Cow-calf pairs showed increased calling rate in the presence of vessels in the feeding bay, with calling rate of single foraging whales increasing as vessel number, particularly those engaged in whale watching, increased. These responses have implications for energetics, communication success. The implications of acoustic disturbance from whale watching has yet to be well defined, but it is only one of many stressors that gray whales are subject to. The results of this study lead us to argue for greater evidence-based management of whale watching; restrictions on encounters; noise emission limitations; requiems for the whales, and a greater interpretative component for passengers. The aggregate and cumulative effects of disturbance should also be emphasized in vessel-whale interaction guidelines, with the most vulnerable individuals removed from the viewing resource altogether.

AB  - Cetacean monitoring is key to their protection. Understanding their behavior relies on multi-channel and high-sampling-rate underwater acoustic recordings for identifying and tracking them in a passive way. However, a lot of energy and data storage is required, requiring frequent human maintenance operations. To cope with these constraints, an ultra-low power mixed-signal always-on wake-up is proposed. Based on pulse-pattern analysis, it can be used for triggering a multi-channel high-performance recorder only when cetacean clicks are detected, thus increasing autonomy and saving storage space. This detector is implemented as a mixed architecture making the most of analog and digital primitives: this combination drastically improves power consumption by processing high-frequency data using analog features and lower-frequency ones in a digital way. Furthermore, a bioacoustic expert system is proposed for improving detection accuracy (in ultra-low-power) via state machines. Power consumption of the system is lower than 30 mu W in always-on mode, allowing an autonomy of 2 years on a single CR2032 battery cell with a high detection accuracy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve obtained has an area under curve of 85% using expert rules and 75% without it. This implementation provides an excellent trade-off between detection accuracy and power consumption. Focused on sperm whales, it can be tuned to detect other species emitting pulse trains. This approach facilitates biodiversity studies, reducing maintenance operations and allowing the use of lighter, more compact and portable recording equipment, as large batteries are no longer required. Additionally, recording only useful data helps to reduce the dataset labeling time.

AB  - Monitoring programmes for white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) have been called for repeatedly in recent years because this species is likely to be negatively impacted by climate change, but also because such a broadly dispersed, high trophic feeder can serve as an effective ecosystem sentinel. Arctic ecosystems are difficult to monitor because of the extensive winter ice coverage and extreme environmental conditions in addition to low human population densities. However, passive acoustic monitoring has proved to be a reliable method to remotely survey the presence of some marine mammals in the Arctic. In this study, we evaluate the potential use of echolocation loggers (T-POD and C-POD, Chelonia Ltd.) for remote monitoring of white whales. Captive experiments and open water surveys in three arctic/subarctic habitats (ice-noise-dominated environment, ice-free environment and low-turbidity waters) were used to document detection performance and to explore the use of logger angle and inter-click interval data to look at activity patterns and tidal influences on space use. When acoustic results were compared to concurrent visual observations, echolocation detection was only attributed to periods of white whale presence near the recorder deployment sites. Both T-PODs and C-PODs effectively detected echolocation, even under noisy ice. Diel and tidal behavioural patterns were identified. Acoustically identified movement patterns between sites were visually confirmed. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring white whales using echolocation loggers and describes some important features of their behaviour as examples of the potential application of this passive acoustic monitoring method in Arctic and subarctic regions.

AB  - The first records of beaked whales, including Cuvier's beaked whale Ziphius cavirostris, are reported from an acoustic baseline survey in the territorial waters of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, Gulf of Guinea, West Africa. The survey was carried out between late 2018 and early 2019 using an AutoNaut unmanned surface vessel (USV), which is propelled by the motion of waves and operated remotely via a satellite link. The USV towed a hydrophone array on a cable, and over the course of 75 days the USV completed 1 772 km of acoustic survey effort. Beaked whale encounters were not uncommon and occurred on 28 of the 75 survey days. They were widespread on the shelf edge and in oceanic habitats above the abyssal plain. The average water depth at which acoustic detections were recorded was 2 519 (SD 555) m (n = 43). Beaked whales were evenly distributed across areas with different seabed characteristics: the number of encounters recorded in areas characterised by seabed gradient and ruggedness did not differ from that expected after accounting for survey effort. The majority of acoustic detections were attributable to Cuvier's beaked whales, based on spectral and temporal characteristics of click-train vocalisations. The results provide baseline information on the distribution of beaked whales and suggest that passive acoustic methods using a small USV are well-suited to surveys of this species group, possibly because beaked whales, which are sensitive to disturbance associated with underwater sound sources, are less likely to avoid small, quiet vessels than larger vessels.

TI  - Assessing the Deepwater Horizon oil spill impact on marine mammal population through acoustics: Endangered sperm whales
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA  - English
KW  - SENSORS
AB  - Long-term monitoring of endangered species abundance based on acoustic recordings has not yet been pursued. This paper reports the first attempt to use multi-year passive acoustic data to study the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on the population of endangered sperm whales. Prior to the spill the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center (LADC) collected acoustic recordings near the spill site in 2007. These baseline data now provide a unique opportunity to better understand how the oil spill affected marine mammals in the Gulf of Mexico. In September 2010, LADC redeployed recording buoys at previously used locations 9, 25, and 50 miles away from the incident site. A statistical methodology that provides point and interval estimates of the abundance of the sperm whale population at the two nearest sites is presented. A comparison of the 2007 and the 2010 recordings shows a decrease in acoustic activity and abundance of sperm whales at the 9-mile site by a factor of 2, whereas acoustic activity and abundance at the 25-mile site has clearly increased. This indicates that some sperm whales may have relocated farther away from the spill. Follow-up experiments will be important for understanding long-term impact.

AB  - Passive acoustic observation of whales is an increasingly important tool for whale research. Clicks are the predominant vocalizations of toothed whales, such as sperm whales and long-finned pilot whales. Classifying clicks of sperm whales and long-funned pilot whales is an essential task for the passive acoustic observation of the two whale species, especially in the case that both whale species vocalize in the same observed area. In this paper, we proposed a method performing the automated classification of clicks produced by sperm whales and long-finned pilot whales. First, the two types of whales' original sounds were denoised using a wavelet denoising method. Then, a dual-threshold endpoint detection algorithm was utilized to detect and pick out all clicks from the denoised sounds. The continuous wavelet transform was applied to decompose the picked clicks, and a wavelet coefficient matrix can be obtained for each picked click. Focusing on the energy distribution and duration difference between the two types of whales' clicks, we proposed a feature-vector extraction algorithm based on the wavelet coefficient matrix. For each picked click, scale (frequency) features and time feature were obtained respectively and they were used to form the feature vector. Finally, a back propagation (BP) neural network was designed as a classifier of feature-vector to output final classification result. The experiment results show the proposed method can obtain high classification performances. The effect of training dataset size, and the number of training features on the classification performance was also examined in the experiments.

AB  - The earliest long-term monitoring of low-frequency signals of large whales was via cabled military arrays. These arrays provided valuable new data but were restricted in the locations that were monitored and there was no open access to the data collected. In order to monitor the low-frequency signals of large whales in different areas and over shorter time scales, Haruphones, single hydrophone, autonomous recording packages, were developed by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and deployed in the Gulf of Alaska and the eastern tropical Pacific. By integrating the acoustic data from these broadly spaced deployments with other data streams, new discoveries about blue whales in the eastern Pacific Ocean were made. These included establishing the geographic range and migratory patterns of eastern north Pacific blue whales; establishing that the eastern tropical Pacific appears to be a blue whale "hot spot" where as many as four, but primarily three, acoustic populations of blue whales occur; determining that the Gulf of Alaska is a region where eastern and western North Pacific blue whales overlap in space and time; and showing that blue whale calling behavior has a diel pattern whereby animals produce more sounds at night than during the day. In aggregate, these data show that passive acoustic monitoring is a valuable tool for establishing blue whale population identity, determining habitat range, and studying behavioral ecology over long time periods and in remote regions of the ocean.

AB  - Several marine autonomous recording units (MARUs) were deployed in northeastern Gulf of Mexico from 2010-2012 to study the acoustic ecology of Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. However, the acoustic repertoire of this sub-population is poorly documented, presently limiting the efficacy of acoustic monitoring applications. Numerous stereotyped, low-frequency signals from a putative biological sound source were found throughout the recordings. Sounds fell into three categories distinguished by spectral and temporal properties. Multiple calls overlapped temporally on individual MARUs, suggesting that multiple sources produced these sounds. The basic features are similar to those from other mysticetes, but they differ from any previously published sounds. Since Bryde's whales are the most common mysticete in the Gulf and have previously been observed within the recording area on multiple occasions, it is likely that Bryde's whales are the most probable source of these sounds. These results potentially identify a suite of previously undocumented calls from Bryde's whales, which could facilitate future passive acoustic monitoring efforts to better understand the population dynamics and status of this sub-population.

AB  - Short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) are large, deep-diving predators with diverse foraging strategies, but little is known about their echolocation. To quantify the source properties of short-finned pilot whale clicks, we made 15 deployments off the coast of Tenerife of a deep-water hydrophone array consisting of seven autonomous time-synced hydrophone recorders (SoundTraps), enabling acoustic localization and quantification of click source parameters. Of 8185 recorded pilot whale clicks, 47 were classified as being recorded on-axis, with a mean peak-to-peak source level (SL) of 181 +/- 7 dB re 1 mu Pa, a centroid frequency of 40 +/- 4 kHz, and a duration of 57 +/- 23 mu s. A fit to a piston model yielded an estimated half-power (-3 dB) beam width of 13.7 degrees [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.2 degrees-14.5 degrees] and a mean directivity index (DI) of 22.6 dB (95% CI 22.5-22.9 dB). These measured SLs and DIs are surprisingly low for a deep-diving toothed whale, suggesting we sampled the short-finned pilot whales in a context with little need for operating a long-range biosonar. The substantial spectral overlap with beaked whale clicks emitted in similar deep-water habitats implies that pilot whale clicks may constitute a common source of false detections in beaked whale passive acoustic monitoring efforts.

AB  - Distribution and movement patterns of Antarctic blue whales Balaenoptera musculus intermedia at large temporal and spatial scales are still poorly understood. The objective of this study was to explore spatio-temporal distribution patterns of Antarctic blue whales in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, using passive acoustic monitoring data. Multi-year data were collected between 2008 and 2013 by 11 recorders deployed in the Weddell Sea and along the Greenwich meridian. Antarctic blue whale Z-calls were detected via spectrogram cross-correlation. A Blue Whale Index was developed to quantify the proportion of time during which acoustic energy from Antarctic blue whales dominated over background noise. Our results show that Antarctic blue whales were acoustically present year-round, with most call detections between January and April. During austral summer, the number of detected calls peaked synchronously throughout the study area in most years, and hence, no directed meridional movement pattern was detectable. During austral winter, vocalizations were recorded at latitudes as high as 69 degrees S, with sea ice cover exceeding 90%, suggesting that some Antarctic blue whales overwinter in Antarctic waters. Polynyas likely serve as an important habitat for baleen whales during austral winter, providing food and reliable access to open water for breathing. Overall, our results support increasing evidence of a complex and non-obligatory migratory behavior of Antarctic blue whales, potentially involving temporally and spatially dynamic migration routes and destinations, as well as variable timing of migration to and from the feeding grounds.

AB  - Beaked whale foraging pulses were detected on the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) off Kaua'i, Hawaii, via long term passive acoustic monitoring. The unidentified pulses do not match foraging pulses of known species on the range but are similar to the unidentified beaked whale first detected at Cross Seamount, Hawaii. Although there has not been a visual confirmation of the unidentified beaked whale species, analysis of data collected from 2007 to 2019 has identified beaked whale foraging dive characteristics from echolocation pulses. From the 13 years of data, the most distinct patterns were that all foraging dives occurred at night and the nighttime foraging dive rate was Oil group vocal periods (GVP) per hour, with most detections on shallow hydrophones (625-1,000 m deep) over steep bathymetric slopes. Data collected during U.S. Navy training events were used to compare dive behavior during midfrequency active sonar (MFAS) activity against baseline periods; it was determined that the whales reduced GVPs during sonar and these remained low for at least 3 days after the training events. These results are the first longterm record of acoustic signals from the Cross Seamount beaked whale and provide important insights into their habitat use and occurrence patterns.

AB  - The detection and localization of acoustic sources remain technological challenges in bioacoustics, in particular, the tracking of moving underwater sound sources with a portable waterproof tool. For instance, this type of tool is important to describe the behavior of cetaceans within social groups. To contribute to this issue, an original innovative autonomous device, called a CETOSCOPE (c), was designed by ABYSS NGO, including a 360 degrees video camera and a passive acoustic array with 4 synchronized hydrophones. Firstly, different 3D structures were built and tested to select the best architecture to minimize the errors of the localizations. Secondly, a specific software was developed to analyze the recorded data and to link them to the acoustic underwater sources. The 3D localization of the sound sources is based on time difference of arrival processing. Following successful simulations on a computer, this device was tested in a pool to assess its efficiency. The final objective is to use this device routinely in underwater visual and acoustic observations of cetaceans.

AB  - Passive acoustic density estimation has been gaining traction in recent years. Cue counting uses detected acoustic cues to estimate animal abundance. A cue rate, the number of acoustic cues produced per animal per unit time, is required to convert cue density into animal density. Cue rate information can be obtained from animal borne acoustic tags. For deep divers, like beaked whales, data have been analyzed considering deep dive cycles as a natural sampling unit, based on either weighted averages or generalized estimating equations. Using a sperm whale DTAG (sound-and-orientation recording tag) example we compare different approaches of estimating cue rate from acoustic tags illustrating that both approaches used before might introduce biases and suggest that the natural unit of analysis should be the whole duration of the tag itself.

AB  - For effective species management, understanding population structure and distribution is critical. However, quantifying population structure is not always straightforward. Within the Southern Hemisphere, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) complex is extremely diverse but difficult to study. Using automated detector methods, we identified "acoustic populations" of whales producing region-specific call types. We examined blue whale call types in passive acoustic data at sites spanning over 7,370 km across the southeast Indian Ocean and southwest Pacific Ocean (SWPO) from 2009 to 2012. In the absence of genetic resolution, these acoustic populations offer unique information about the blue whale population complex. We found that the Australian continent acts as a geographic boundary, separating Australia and New Zealand blue whale acoustic populations at the junction of the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins. We located blue whales in previously undocumented locations, including the far SWPO, in the Tasman Sea off the east coast of Australia, and along the Lau Basin near Tonga. Our understanding of population dynamics across this broad scale has significant implications to recovery and conservation management for this endangered species, at a regional and global scale.

AB  - In this paper, we study to improve acoustical methods to identify endangered whale calls with emphasis on the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). A promising method using wavelet scattering transform and deep learning is proposed here to detect/classify the whale calls quite precisely in the increasingly noisy ocean with a small dataset. The performances shown in terms of classification accuracy (>97%) demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method which outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art methods. In this way, passive acoustic technology can be enhanced to monitor endangered whale calls. Efficient tracking of their numbers, migration paths and habitat become vital to whale conservation by lowering the number of preventable injuries and deaths while making progress in their recovery.

AB  - The population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, numbers approximately 336 individuals, and continues to decline. Current development and implementation of protection measures and monitoring of right whale presence relies on visual surveys from vessel and aerial platforms, and passive acoustic monitoring, which contribute to location data. Here we demonstrate that satellite imagery can be used to detect and confirm the North Atlantic right whales at a species level using newly available imaging methods, providing another tool to inform conservation efforts. Using optical satellite imagery with 15 cm resolution, 25 right whales were observed in Cape Cod Bay on April 24, 2021. Species confirmation was possible due to clearly visible callosity patterns indicative of their species within this range. Although the variations in callosity patterns commonly used to identify individuals were too small to be resolved at this image resolution, one whale with large distinctive markings visible on his body was identified at an individual level from satellite imagery alone. Although visual and acoustic survey methods can be combined for monitoring this species in critical habitats, satellite-based monitoring can be especially helpful to understand whale presence outside the areas monitored with existing visual and acoustic detection methods.

AB  - North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) produce a loud, broadband signal referred to as the gunshot sound. These distinctive sounds may be suitable for passive acoustic monitoring and detection of right whales; however, little is known about the prevalence of these sounds in important right whale habitats, such as the Bay of Fundy. This study investigates the timing and distribution of gunshot sound production on the summer feeding grounds using an array of five marine acoustic recording units deployed in the Bay of Fundy, Canada in mid-summer 2004 and 2005. Gunshot sounds were common, detected on 37 of 38 recording days. Stereotyped gunshot bouts averaged 1.5 h, with some bouts exceeding 7 h in duration with up to seven individuals producing gunshots at any one time. Bouts were more commonly detected in the late afternoon and evening than during the morning hours. Locations of gunshots in bouts indicated that whales producing the sounds were either stationary or showed directional travel, suggesting gunshots have different communication functions depending on behavioral context. These results indicate that gunshots are a common right whale sound produced during the summer months and are an important component in the acoustic communication system of this endangered species.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), particularly autonomous platforms, offers many advantages in monitoring phonating deep-diving marine mammals in oceanic environment. Relevant data can be obtained day and night continuously over long durations and in any weather conditions. It provides a cost-efficient solution with greater detection ranges when compared to traditional large research vessel and aerial visual surveys requiring keeping expert observers on station for long periods of time and relying on good visibility and calm seas. Therefore, PAM is becoming a preferred tool to assess population dynamics trends and health of deep-water marine mammal stocks. However the large volumes of collected data require robust automatic detection and classification algorithms to identify marine mammals in recordings. As for beaked whales, one of the challenging automatic processing goals is the identification of different species to advance our understanding of their role in the marine ecosystem. At present, traditional detection and classification methods employ searches for acoustic events above a user-defined signal-to-noise ratio threshold in the frequency band of interest and further rely on an experienced operator's manual inspection for species classification and removal of false positives. Current passive monitoring data collection systems yield large volumes of acoustic data, therefore a manual classification approach becomes very time-consuming and impractical. This paper focuses on developing a multi-stage automatic classifier for beaked whale species. The proposed method utilizes unsupervised machine clustering of signal attributes extracted from potential detection events flagged by an energy-band detector. The proposed algorithm was benchmarked against a manually annotated workshop dataset and applied to acoustic data collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The algorithm classifies beaked whale species in automatic mode with minimal operator involvement only at the validation stage. When compared with the manually annotated classification dataset, the proposed method achieved a recall rate of 82.8% for Cuvier's and 77.9% for Gervais' species in automatic mode. New insights on habitat use by different species of beaked whales in the Gulf of Mexico were gained when using the species-specific classifier. The high spatial resolution acoustic monitoring results showed that the habitat preferences of two dominating beaked whale species in the Gulf of Mexico support the habitat division (ecological niche) hypothesis.

AB  - The ability to modify vocalizations to compensate for environmental noise is critical for successful communication in a dynamic acoustic environment. Many marine species rely on sound for vital life functions including communication, navigation and feeding. The impacts of significant increases in ocean noise levels from human activities are a current area of concern for the conservation of marine mammals. Here, we document changes in calling behaviour by individual endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in increased background noise. Right whales, like several bird and primate species, respond to periods of increased noise by increasing the amplitude of their calls. This behaviour may help maintain the communication range with conspecifics during periods of increased noise. These call modifications have implications for conservation efforts for right whales, affecting both the way whales use sound to communicate and our ability to detect them with passive acoustic monitoring systems.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring takes advantage of the relative opacity of the ocean to sound. Traditionally, long-term monitoring has employed archival instruments from which data are accessed only when the recording instrument is retrieved. Recent advances in low-power instrumentation and computational speed allow passive acoustic data to be collected, processed and relayed to shore in near real time from fixed and mobile platforms deployed at the sea floor, in the water column or on the ocean's surface. Measurements of ambient noise provide insight into natural sound sources, such as rainfall, earthquakes or marine animals, as well as anthropogenic sound sources, such as shipping or resource extraction. Near real-time passive acoustic measurements allow scientists and agencies to monitor shipping, observe underwater seismicity and detect the presence of critically endangered large whales. The development and use of real-time passive acoustic monitoring systems will grow in coming decades to help better manage increasing industrialization of the oceans. This chapter reviews the capabilities of real-time passive acoustic monitoring to address civilian scientific needs. The currently available suite of instrumentation and platforms used for passive acoustic monitoring are discussed along with the wide variety of measurements that can be made with this technology. Finally, examples of how real-time passive acoustic monitoring has improved our understanding of the ocean are presented.

AB  - Male fin whales sing using 20 Hz pulses produced in regular patterns of inter-note intervals, but little is known about fin whale swimming behavior while they are singing. Even less is known about fin whales in Hawaiian waters because they have rarely been sighted during surveys and passive acoustic monitoring has been limited to sparse hydrophone systems that do not have localization capabilities. We hypothesized that fin whale kinematics may be related to their singing behavior, or external variables such as time and sea state. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed 115 tracks containing 50,034 unique notes generated from passive acoustic recordings on an array of 14 hydrophones from 2011 to 2017 at the U.S. Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility off Kauai, Hawaii. Fin whales swam at an average speed of 1.1 m/s over relatively direct paths. We incorporated the whales' speed and turning angle into hidden Markov models to identify different behavioral states based on the whales' movements. We found that fin whale kinematic behavioral state was related to the vocalization rate (also known as cue rate) and time of day. When cue rate was higher, fin whales were more likely to swim slower and turn more than when cue rate was lower. During the night, fin whales were also more likely to swim slower and turn more than during the day. In addition, we examined whether the presence of singing fin whales was related to time and sea state using generalized additive models. Fin whale track presence was affected by day of the year and song season, and possibly also wind speed and wave height. Although the track kinematics from the fin whale tracks presented here are limited to a subset of whales that are acoustically active, they provide some of the only detailed movements of fin whales in the region and can be compared against fin whale swim speeds in other regions. Understanding how fin whale swimming behavior varies based on their vocalization patterns, time, and environmental factors will help us to contextualize potential changes in whale behavior during Navy training and testing on the range.

AB  - Beaked whales (Cetacea: Ziphiidea) of the genera Ziphius and Mesoplodon have been reported to mass strand during naval sonar exercises, and the ability to mitigate such negative effects is of increasing importance. Beaked whales dive for long periods and am. difficult to sight at the surface. We discuss new results suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring for beaked whales holds promise for detecting their presence. A new non-invasive acoustic recording tag was attached to beaked whales of two species, 3 Mesoplodon densirostris and 7 Ziphius cavirostris. High-frequency clicks were recorded for about 30 min every 2-4 hours during deep dives of all tagged whales. The tagged whales only clicked at depths below 200 in, down to a maximum depth near 2000 in. During each foraging dive, both species produced thousands of directional, ultrasonic clicks with no significant energy below 20 kHz. The clicks are produced in trains with mean interclick intervals near 0.4 s. Individual clicks are frequency modulated pulses with durations of 200-300 mu sec and center frequencies around 40 kHz, -10 dB bandwidths of 20-30 kHz. The sound beam for Ziphius is narrow with an estimated directionality index of more than 25 dB, source levels up to 214 dBpp re 1 mu Pa at 1 m. Given knowledge of the source level, frequency range, and directionality of beaked whale clicks, along with the precise orientation and location of beaked whales clicking during foraging dives, it is possible to model the "acoustic footprint" of foraging dives. These data can be used to estimate the probability of detecting the presence of beaked whales by listening. Critical parameters include the density of sensors and the listening time needed to achieve adequate detection probability. Using the observed dive behavior of K, tagged beaked whales of genera Ziphius and Mesoplodon, we worked with the NATO Undersea Research Center to develop a simulation of detector performance for arrays of hydrophones at variable depths between 100 and 1400 in. We demonstrate that for continuous listening for at least the 2-4 hour interval between the start of deep dives, high detection probability could be achieved with acoustic sensors spaced a few km apart. The greatest problem for beaked whale detectors is likely to be false alarms from biological and physical acoustic transients (such as dolphin clicks), and monitoring efforts will need to trade off probability of false alarm against maximizing detection probability. While results may be somewhat poorer in realistic noise conditions and with practical detectors, there appears to be considerable potential for the acoustic detection of beaked

AB  - Long-term passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals on navy ranges provides the opportunity to better understand the potential impact of sonar on populations. The navy range in Tongue of the Ocean (TOTO), Bahamas contains extensive hydrophone arrays, potentially allowing estimation of the density of deep diving, vocally active species such as the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Previous visual surveys in TOTO have been of limited spatiotemporal coverage and resulted in only sporadic sightings of sperm whales, whereas passive acoustic observations suggest the species is present year round. However, until now the means of acoustically determining the specific number of individuals in each cluster has been limited. We used recently developed algorithms to identify the number of echolocating whales present during a 42 d study period. We screened a 297 h acoustic data set to determine the proportion of time animals were present; fifty 10 min samples during presence were analyzed to estimate the number of individuals vocalizing during each sample. These counts were combined with an independent estimate of the proportion of 10 min periods when tagged animals vocalize. The estimated average density was 0.16 whales/1,000 km2 (CV 27%; 95% CI 0.0950.264). The method is potentially applicable to other areas containing dense hydrophone arrays.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of ocean soundscapes can provide information on ecosystem status for those tasked with protecting marine resources. In 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established a long-term, continuous, low-frequency (10Hz-2kHz) passive acoustic monitoring site in the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS), located offshore of the central United States of America (U.S.) west coast, near San Francisco, CA. The California Current flows southward along the coast in this area, supporting a diverse community of marine animals, including several baleen whale species. Acoustic data analysis revealed that both large vessels and vocalizing baleen whales contribute to the ambient soundscape of the CBNMS. Sound levels fluctuated by month with the highest levels in the fall and lowest levels in the summer. Throughout the year, very low-frequency (10-100Hz) sound levels were most variable. Vessels and whales overlap in their contributions to ambient sound levels within this range, although vessel contributions were more omnipresent, while seasonal peaks were associated with vocalizing whales. This characterization of low-frequency ambient sound levels in the CBNMS establishes initial baselines for an important component of this site's underwater soundscape. Standardized monitoring of soundscapes directly supports NOAA's ability to evaluate and report on conditions within national marine sanctuaries.

AB  - The vocalization source level distributions and pulse compression gains are estimated for four distinct baleen whale species in the Gulf of Maine: fin, sei, minke and an unidentified baleen whale species. The vocalizations were received on a large-aperture densely-sampled coherent hydrophone array system useful for monitoring marine mammals over instantaneous wide areas via the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing technique. For each baleen whale species, between 125 and over 1400 measured vocalizations with significantly high Signal-to-Noise Ratios ( SNR > 10 dB) after coherent beamforming and localized with high accuracies (<10% localization errors) over ranges spanning roughly 1 km-30 km are included in the analysis. The whale vocalization received pressure levels are corrected for broadband transmission losses modeled using a calibrated parabolic equation-based acoustic propagation model for a random range-dependent ocean waveguide. The whale vocalization source level distributions are characterized by the following means and standard deviations, in units of dB re 1 mu Pa at 1 m: 181.9 +/- 5.2 for fin whale 20-Hz pulses, 173.5 +/- 3.2 for sei whale downsweep chirps, 177.7 +/- 5.4 for minke whale pulse trains and 169.6 +/- 3.5 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls. The broadband vocalization equivalent pulse-compression gains are found to be 2.5 +/- 1.1 for fin whale 20-Hz pulses, 24 +/- 10 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls and 69 +/- 23 for sei whale downsweep chirps. These pulse compression gains are found to be roughly proportional to the inter-pulse intervals of the vocalizations, which are 11 +/- 5 s for fin whale 20-Hz pulses, 29 +/- 18 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls and 52 +/- 33 for sei whale downsweep chirps. The source level distributions and pulse compression gains are essential for determining signal-to-noise ratios and hence detection regions for baleen whale vocalizations received passively on underwater acoustic sensing systems, as well as for assessing communication ranges in baleen whales.

AB  - The calling seasonality of blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin (B. physalus) whales was assessed using acoustic data recorded on seven autonomous Acoustic Recording Packages (ARPs) deployed from March 2001 to February 2003 west of the Antarctic Peninsula. A minimum of 258,706 blue and 72,194 fin whale calls were detected. Blue whales were present year round and their calls were detected 177 days/year on average. Peak calling occurred in March and April, with a secondary peak in October and November. Calling was lowest between June and September, and in December. Calling fin whales were present between February and June (on the average 51 days/year), with peak calling in May. Sea ice concentrations were determined from the Special Sensor Microwave / Imager passive microwave data available through 31 December 2002. Sea ice generally formed a month later and retreated a month earlier in 2001 than in 2002 over all sites. During the entire deployment period, detected calls of both species of whales showed negative correlation with sea ice concentrations. Also, there appeared to be a northeast-southwest movement of calling whales along the continental shelf break, which could correspond to prey movement.

AB  - In 1999, the first phase of a multiyear program was initiated at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Mammal Laboratory and Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory to advance the use of passive acoustics for the detection and assessment of large whales in offshore Alaskan waters. To date, autonomous recorders have been successfully deployed in the Gulf of Alaska (1999-2001), the southeastern Bering Sea (2000-present), and the western Beaufort Sea (2003-2004). Seasonal occurrences of six endangered species (blue, fin, humpback, North Pacific right, bowhead, and sperm whales) have been documented on the basis of call receptions in these remote ocean regions. In addition, eastern North Pacific gray whale calls were detected in the western Beaufort Sea from October 2003 through May 2004. Here we provide an overview of this suite Of research projects and suggest the next steps for applying acoustic data from long-term recorders to the assessment of large whale populations.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is an efficient way to provide insights on the ecology of large whales. This approach allows for long-term and species-specific monitoring over large areas. In this study, we examined six years (2010 to 2015) of continuous acoustic recordings at up to seven different locations in the Central and Southern Indian Basin to assess the peak periods of presence, seasonality and migration movements of Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia). An automated method is used to detect the Antarctic blue whale stereotyped call, known as Z-call. Detection results are analyzed in terms of distribution, seasonal presence and diel pattern of emission at each site. Z-calls are detected year-round at each site, except for one located in the equatorial Indian Ocean, and display highly seasonal distribution. This seasonality is stable across years for every site, but varies between sites. Z-calls are mainly detected during autumn and spring at the subantarctic locations, suggesting that these sites are on the Antarctic blue whale migration routes, and mostly during winter at the subtropical sites. In addition to these seasonal trends, there is a significant diel pattern in Z-call emission, with more Z-calls in daytime than in nighttime. This diel pattern may be related to the blue whale feeding ecology.

AB  - Marine organisms inhabiting coastal waters are known to be driven by periodic cycles such as diel, tidal, and seasonal changes. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) breed in shallow and warm coastal waters, with males singing complex songs during the breeding season. To investigate periodic variations in humpback whale singing activities, we conducted fixed passive acoustic monitoring in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, Japan, from winter to spring during 2016-2018. The singing activity and individual number of singers were observed throughout the day and night using a very long baseline passive acoustic array. The occurrence of singers peaked before sunrise and in the evening and was reduced during the daytime. The frequency of song reception depended on the tidal phase. A generalised additive model demonstrated that the occurrence of singers increased during the flood tide and decreased during the ebb tide in the waters west of Chichijima Island. These results suggest that the singing behaviour of humpback whales in breeding areas is affected by the diel and tidal cycles. Male humpback whales may change their behaviour or singing location depending on the strength and direction of the tidal current, considering that the selection of a stable location is beneficial for singing whales.

AB  - In the past decade, much progress has been made in real-time passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammal occurrence and distribution from autonomous platforms (e. g., gliders, floats, buoys), but current systems focus primarily on a single call type produced by a single species, often from a single location. A hardware and software system was developed to detect, classify, and report 14 call types produced by 4 species of baleen whales in real time from ocean gliders. During a 3-week deployment in the central Gulf of Maine in late November and early December 2012, two gliders reported over 25 000 acoustic detections attributed to fin, humpback, sei, and right whales. The overall false detection rate for individual calls was 14%, and for right, humpback, and fin whales, false predictions of occurrence during 15-min reporting periods were 5% or less. Transmitted pitch tracks-compact representations of sounds-allowed unambiguous identification of both humpback and fin whale song. Of the ten cases when whales were sighted during aerial or shipboard surveys and a glider was within 20 km of the sighting location, nine were accompanied by real-time acoustic detections of the same species by the glider within 612 h of the sighting time.

AB  - Marine megafauna occurrence was recorded in the deep-sea region bordering the abyssal plain similar to 400 km north-west of Luanda, Angola. The survey took place during an Environmental Baseline Study (EBS), prior to drilling exploration activities, with the goal of characterizing the habitat and biodiversity of the region. Offshore shipboard surveys were conducted during September 2018 in water depths ranging from 2350-3850 m. We recorded daytime sightings of marine mammals and sea turtles and at night made audio recordings using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) methods focused on capturing the sounds of vocalizing marine mammals. A variety of species were visually detected, including the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), common dolphin (Delphinus spp.), striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), Atlantic spotted dolphin (S. frontalis), and olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). Acoustic click bouts similar to those made by several odontocete species, possibly including beaked whales, were recorded within the 25-48 kHz range. The humpback whale was the most frequently sighted species, accounting for 56% of mammal sightings, indicating a potential far offshore migratory habitat in this region. Most notably, right whales (probable Eubalaena australis) were visually observed. This is the first confirmed record of right whales in Angolan waters since the early 1900s. As development expands in this offshore region, these data can usefully inform future monitoring and mitigation strategies focused on minimizing impacts to wildlife.

AB  - This study investigates the relevance of the Elephant Island (EI) region for Southern Hemisphere fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in their annual life cycle. We collected 3 years of passive acoustic recordings (January 2013 to February 2016) northwest of EI to calculate time series of fin whale acoustic indices, daily acoustic occurrence, spectrograms, as well as the abundance of their 20 Hz pulses. Acoustic backscatter strength, sea ice concentration and chlorophyll-a composites provided concurrent environmental information for graphic comparisons. Acoustic interannual, seasonal and diel patterns together with visual information and literature resources were used to define the period of occupancy and to infer potential drivers for their behaviour. Spectral results suggest that these fin whales migrate annually to and from offshore central Chile. Acoustic data and visual information reveal their arrival at EI in December to feed without producing their typical 20 Hz pulse. For all 3 years, acoustic activity commences in February, peaks in May and decreases in August, in phase with the onset of their breeding season. Our results emphasize the importance of EI for fin whales throughout most of the year. Our recommendation is to consider EI for establishing a marine protected area to expedite the recovery of this vulnerable species.

AB  - Automatic click detectors and full-bandwidth sound recorders are widely used in passive acoustic monitoring of small cetaceans. Detection of these signals depends on a variety of factors, including signal to noise ratio. Passive acoustic monitoring is often used to study impact of underwater noise on small cetaceans, but as detection probability is affected by changes in signal to noise ratio, variable noise levels may affect conclusions drawn from these experiments. Therefore, we examine how different detectors and filters perform in varying ocean noise conditions. C-PODs and full-bandwidth recorders (Wildlife Acoustics, SM2M+) were deployed at two stations in an environment with fluctuating ambient noise for 42 days. Noise level and harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) click trains simultaneously recorded on both loggers were compared. Overall, we found that porpoise click detections by the algorithm used to analyse full-band recorder data (Pamguard) paralleled detections by the C-POD. However, Pamguard detected significantly more clicks than the C-POD. A decrease in detections was seen for both loggers with increasing noise in the band 20 -160 kHz, in particular for levels above 100 dB re 1 mu Pa rms. We also found that the Pamguard detection function changed the least over varying noise conditions when compared to the C-POD detectors. This study sheds light on the fact that inference of animal presence/absence or density that are based on echolocation cues (here, Porpoise Positive Minutes) shall account for the acoustic environments where probability of detecting signals may be affected by variability in ambient noise levels.

AB  - The distribution and use of pelagic habitat by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) is poorly understood in the south-eastern Indian Ocean off Western Australia. However, a variety of data are available via online portals where records of historical expeditions, commercial whaling operations, and modern scientific research voyages can now be accessed. Crowdsourcing these online data allows collation of presence-only information of animals and provides a valuable tool to help augment areas of low research effort. Four data sources were examined, the primary one being the Voyage of the Odyssey expedition, a 5-year global study of sperm whales and ocean pollution. From December 2001 to May 2002, acoustic surveys were conducted along 5200 nautical miles of transects off Western Australia including the Perth Canyon and historical whaling grounds off Albany; 60 tissue biopsy samples were also collected. To augment areas not surveyed by the RV Odyssey, historical Yankee whaling data (1712-1920), commercial whaling data (1904-1999), and citizen science reports of sperm whale sightings (1990-2003) were used. Using Maxent, a species distribution modeling tool, we found that the submarine canyons off Albany and Perth provide important habitat for sperm whales. Current technology, along with current understanding of sperm whale bioacoustics and habitat preferences, provides strong motivation for undertaking long-term passive acoustic studies that can monitor the sperm whale population within Australia's EEZ waters (Perth and Albany canyons) as a way of informing future marine management and policy decisions.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring with hydrophones makes it possible to detect the presence of marine animals over large areas. For monitoring to be cost-effective, this process should be fully automated. We explore a new approach to detecting whale calls, using an end-to-end neural architecture and traditional speech features. We compare the results of the new approach with a convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to spectrograms, currently the standard approach to whale call detection. Experiments are conducted using the "Acoustic trends for the blue and fin whale library" from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC). We experiment with different types of speech features (mel frequency cepstral coefficients and filter banks) and different ways of framing the task. We demonstrate that a time delay neural network is a viable solution for whale call detection, with the additional benefit that spectrogram tuning required to obtain high-quality spectrograms in challenging acoustic conditions is no longer necessary. While the initial speech feature-based system (accuracy 96%) did not outperform the CNN (accuracy 98%) when trained on exactly the same dataset, it presents a viable approach to explore further.

AB  - Baseline knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for cetacean management and conservation. Such knowledge is particularly important in areas where gillnet fishing occurs, as the Upper Gulf of California, which increases the probability of bycatch of cetaceans. In this area, the vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) has been widely studied, but the knowledge of other cetaceans is scarce and based on traditional visual survey methods. We used data collected by an array of acoustic click detectors (C-PODs) during the summers 2011 to 2015 to analyze the distribution of dolphins in the Vaquita Refuge in the Upper Gulf of California. We recorded 120,038 echolocation click trains of dolphins during 12,371 days of recording effort at 46 sampling sites. Based on simultaneous visual and acoustic data, we estimated a false positive acoustic detection rate of 19.4%. Dolphin acoustic activity varied among sites, with higher activity in the east of the Vaquita Refuge. Acoustic activity was higher at night than during the day. We used negative binomial generalized linear models to study the count of clicks of dolphins in relation to spatial, temporal, physical, biological and anthropogenic explanatory variables. The best model selected for the response variable included sampling site, day-night condition, and vertical component of tide speed. Patterns in the spatial distribution of predicted acoustic activity of dolphins were similar to the acoustic activity observed per sampling season. Higher acoustic activity was predicted at night, but the tide speed variable was not relevant under this condition. Acoustic activity patterns could be related to the availability of prey resources since echolocation click trains are associated with foraging activities of dolphins. This is the first study of the distribution of dolphins in Mexico using medium-term systematic passive acoustic monitoring, and the results can contribute to better management to the natural protected area located in the Upper Gulf of California.

AB  - Seamounts are considered hot spots of biodiversity and can aggregate pelagic predators and their prey. Passive acoustic monitoring was conducted over 3 mo in 2012 to document the occurrence of odontocetes near a seamount chain in the central equatorial Pacific in relation to oceanographic changes over time. Beaked whale echolocation signals were most frequently encountered. The main beaked whale signal was an unknown type, BW38, which resembled signals produced by Blainville's beaked whales. It had high occurrence during high sea surface temperature and low sea surface salinity. Cuvier's beaked whales were the second most detected. They had an opposite pattern and were encountered more often when sea surface temperature was low and net primary productivity was high. Risso's dolphins and short-finned pilot whales had high acoustic densities, and echolocated predominantly at night. Risso's dolphins occurred more often during low sea surface height deviation. False killer whales were less frequently detected and mostly occurred during the day. Sperm whale detections were fewer than expected and associated with high chlorophyll a. Short duration Kogiidae encounters occurred on average every third day. These types of long-term site studies are an informative tool to comparatively assess species composition, relative abundance, and relationship to oceanographic changes.

AB  - Male fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus, produce a song consisting of 20 Hz notes at regularly spaced time intervals. Previous studies identified regional differences in fin whale internote intervals (INI), but seasonal changes within populations have not been closely examined. To understand the patterns of fin whale song in the western North Atlantic, the seasonal abundance and acoustic features of fin whale song are measured from two years of archival passive acoustic recordings at two representative locations: Massachusetts Bay and New York Bight. Fin whale 20 Hz notes are detected on 99% of recorded days. In both regions, INI varies significantly throughout the year as two distinct periods: a "short-INI" season in September-January (9.6 s) and a "long-INI" season in March-May (15.1 s). February and June-August are transitional-INI months, with higher variability. Note abundance decreases with increasing INI, where note abundance is significantly lower in April-August than in September-January. Short-INI and high note abundance correspond to the fin whale reproductive season. The temporal variability of INI may be a mechanism by which fin whale individuals encode and communicate a variety of behaviorally relevant information. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center (LADC) conducted a series of passive acoustic experiments in the Northern Gulf of Mexico and the Ligurian Sea in 2001 and 2002. Environmental and acoustic moorings were deployed in areas of large concentrations of marine mammals (mainly, sperm whales). Recordings and analysis of whale phonations are among the objectives of the project. Each mooring had a single autonomously recording hydrophone (Environmental Acoustic Recording System (EARS)) obtained from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office after modification to record signals up to 5,859 Hz in the Gulf of Mexico and up to 12,500 Hz in the Ligurian Sea. Self-recording environmental sensors, attached to the moorings, and concurrent environmental ship surveys provided the environmental data for the experiments. The results of acoustic simulations of long-range propagation of the broad-band (500-6,000 Hz) phonation pulses from a hypothetical whale location to the recording hydrophone in the experimental environments are presented. The utilization of the simulation results for an interpretation of the spectral features observed in whale clicks and for the development of tracking algorithms from single hydrophone recordings based on the identification of direct and surface and bottom reflected arrivals are discussed.

AB  - Aiming to gather information on southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) mother-calf pairs' vocal behavior, archival acoustic recorders were deployed at a calving area off Brazil. Manual inspection of spectrograms revealed seven call classes: upcall, downcall, down-upcall, tonal variable, tonal constant, hybrid, and pulsive calls, which are consistent with those previously described for this species in Argentina. Gunshots and warbles, vocalizations described from other right whale species, were not detected. Mean values of start, end, maximum, minimum and peak frequencies, frequency bandwidth and duration were calculated for each call class. Start and end frequencies, frequency bandwidth and duration of upcalls recorded off Brazil were compared to those from other right whale populations and species. Only mean duration of upcalls from Brazil were significantly different from upcalls from all other populations. Differences in call duration may be driven by differences in demographic factors or background noise features among study areas. The repertoire characterization presented in this study will contribute to increase the utility of passive acoustic monitoring as a tool for conservation and research of southern right whales off Brazil as it provides important baseline information on the vocal behavior of this species.

AB  - Beaked whales can remain submerged for an hour or more and are difficult to sight when they come to the surface to breathe. Passive acoustic detection (PAD) not only complements traditional visual-based methods for detecting these species but also can be more effective because beaked whales produce clicks regularly to echolocate on prey during deep foraging dives. The effectiveness of PAD for beaked whales depends not only on the acoustic behavior and output of the animals but also on environmental conditions and the quality of the passive sonar implemented. A primary constraint on the range at which beaked whale clicks can be detected involves their high frequencies, which attenuate rapidly, resulting in limited ranges of detection, especially in adverse environmental conditions. Given current knowledge of source parameters and in good conditions, for example, with a wind speed of 2 m/s, a receiver close to the surface should be able to detect acoustically Cuvier's beaked whales with a high probability at distances up to 0.7 km, provided the listening duration exceeds the deep dive interval, about 2.5 h on average. Detection ranges beyond 4 km are unlikely and would require low ambient noise or special sound propagation conditions. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.2988277]

AB  - False killer whales Pseudorca crassidens and short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus are known to interact with long-line fishing gear in Hawaiian waters, causing economic loss and leading to whale injuries and deaths. The main Hawaiian Islands' insular population of false killer whales is listed as endangered and the offshore population is considered 'strategic' under the Marine Mammal Protection Act due to relatively high bycatch levels. Discriminating between these species acoustically is problematic due to similarity in the spectral content of their echolocation clicks. We used passive acoustic monitoring along with data from satellite tags to distinguish signals from these 2 species. Acoustic encounters recorded with autonomous instruments offshore of the islands of Hawai'i and Kaua'i were matched with concurrent and nearby location information obtained from satellite tagged individuals. Two patterns of echolocation clicks were established for the 2 species. The overall spectral click parameters were highly similar (22 kHz peak and 25 kHz center frequency), but false killer whales had shorter duration and broader bandwidth clicks than short-finned pilot whales (225 mu s, 8 kHz [-3 dB bandwidth] and 545 mu s, 4 kHz, respectively). Also, short-finned pilot whale clicks showed distinct spectral peaks at 12 and 18 kHz. Automated classification techniques using Gaussian mixture models had a 6.5% median error rate. Based on these findings for echolocation clicks and prior published work on whistle classification, acoustic encounters of false killer whales and short-finned pilot whales on autonomous instruments should be identifiable to species level, leading to better long-term monitoring with the goal of mitigating bycatch.

AB  - Cetacean exposure to underwater noise in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean is largely unknown. With the goal to characterize sound pressure and sound exposure levels in different environments, we have employed data from one month of passive acoustic monitoring in a coastal and an oceanic location to register sound pressure level variations and to calculate sound exposure levels to which cetacean species are subjected. Noise profiles varied between locations; Rio de Janeiro coastal area had higher levels than the Vit ' oria-Trindade Seamount Chain area. At both sites, low-frequency hearing cetaceans were the group under higher exposure during day and night. For high-frequency and very high-frequency groups, the day period presented higher levels. Results highlight the conditions of these unexplored soundscapes and the necessity for taking underwater noise into consideration for space-time regulation of marine areas in cetacean conservation efforts.

AB  - It is very important to recognise marine biodiversity and to maintain sound ocean ecosystems for long-term and continuous utilisation of the ecosystems services. To ensure this end, ocean environment and ecosystem should be monitored over the long term and a wide range of ocean areas. The purpose of this research is a feasibility study of underwater acoustic observations of marine mammals using a passive acoustic data logger, A-tag. Final goal of this research is to realise the long-term and wide-range monitoring of ocean ecosystems using autonomous underwater gliders, and to evaluate the soundness of ocean ecosystems and environments. This paper deals with underwater acoustic observations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and analyses of their vocalisation. Underwater passive acoustic observations were conducted at the Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA in the summer of 2013. Direction of vocalisation source was analysed from the time arrival difference between two hydrophones of A-tag. It was demonstrated that the result of acoustic observations of killer whales' vocalisations agreed well with their actual behaviours by visual observations.

AB  - Passive acoustic tracking of sperm whales was conducted during three cruises (2001, 2002, and 2003) in the northwestern part of the Mediterranean Sea using a 128-element towed linear array with real-time beamforming capabilities. This allowed angular separation of sperm whales clicking from different horizontal directions, as well as an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, when several diving animals were present, the description of individual click series was possible. Over a total of 279 complete dives, sperm whales were recorded clicking an average of 35 min per dive. The acoustic repertoire heard from diving sperm whales consisted of usual clicks, creaks, codas, and trumpets. Trumpets occurred at the beginning of 45 dives. One hundred and thirty-one codas, 98% belonging to the Mediterranean pattern 3+1, were recorded, usually at the end of the dive.

AB  - Fisheries acoustics surveys provide platforms for deploying passive acoustic equipment to detect cetacean vocalizations. Passive acoustic methods are developing as viable alternatives to visual surveys, particularly for small, inconspicuous species such as the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed hydrophone array was carried out during an acoustic survey of clupeids in the Clyde Sea and surrounding sea lochs to identify spatial relationships between porpoises and their prey. Methods were developed to process passive acoustic data, successfully identifying porpoise echolocation clicks while discriminating them from the transmitted 120-kHz echosounder pulse and its reflections. To date, this has been a confounding factor which has made these survey techniques potentially incompatible. The highest biomass of pelagic fish was detected in the northernmost parts of the survey region, as were the largest number of porpoises. A moving average was used to examine the scale of the relationships identified, and it was found that while porpoises show no significant preferences for pelagic prey numbers at the smallest scales, they do show significant avoidance of larger areas (5+ km) with very low pelagic fish biomass. This study demonstrates that high-frequency passive acoustic monitoring can be used effectively alongside multifrequency fisheries echosounder surveys to provide novel insights into the trophic interactions between these species, and that further work will hopefully prove useful in improving the efficacy of management strategies for harbour porpoises.

AB  - In the Gulf of Alaska, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are known to remove sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) from commercial longline fishing gear. This removal, called depredation, is economically costly to fishermen, presents risk of injury or mortality to whales, and could lead to unknown removals during the federal sablefish longline survey that contributes to estimation of the annual fishing quota. In 2013 the Southeast Alaska Sperm Whale Avoidance Project (SEASWAP) evaluated the efficacy of an acoustic decoy in reducing encounters between sperm whales and longline fishing gear. The aim of the acoustic decoy was to use fishing vessel sounds to attract whales to an area away from the true fishing haul in order to reduce interactions between commercial fishing vessels and whales. A custom playback device that could be remotely activated via a radio modem was incorporated into an anchored buoy system that could be deployed by the vessel during a two-month trip between June and July 2013. Once activated, the decoy broadcasted vessel-hauling noises known to attract whales, while the vessel performed several true hauls at various ranges from the device. Passive acoustic recorders at both the decoy and true set locations were also deployed to evaluate whale presence. Twenty-six hauls were conducted while a decoy was deployed, yielding fourteen sets with whales present while the decoy was functional. A significant relationship was found between the number of whales present at the true fishing haul and the distance of the haul from the decoy (1-14 km range), with the decoy being most effective at ranges greater than 9 km (t = -2.06, df = 12, p = 0.04). The results suggest that acoustic decoys may be a cost-effective means for reducing longlining depredation from sperm and possibly killer whales under certain circumstances.

AB  - North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were found in an important nineteenth century whaling area east of southern Greenland, from which they were once thought to have been extirpated. In 2007-2008, a 1-year passive acoustic survey was conducted at five sites in and near the 'Cape Farewell Ground', the former whaling ground. Over 2000 right whale calls were recorded at these sites, primarily during July-November. Most calls were northwest of the historic ground, suggesting a broader range in this region than previously known. Geographical and temporal separation of calls confirms use of this area by multiple animals.

AB  - The identity, distribution and movements of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus that forage in the Chiloense Ecoregion in Southern Chile remain unclear. Studies of blue whale songs have identified acoustic populations with distinct song types, geographic ranges, migration routes and seasonal residencies-information that is relevant to the conservation of this endangered species. Here, we characterized the song sequences of blue whales that use the Corcovado Gulf based on dipping hydrophone recordings from 3 austral summer field seasons (2008, 2009, 2011), and compare these data to previously described song types for the Southeast Pacific (SEP) in order to better understand meso-scale (versus basin-scale) variation in blue whale song. Two distinct songs, SEP1 and SEP2, emerged from our analysis. Neither of these songs is used by Antarctic blue whales. Although SEP1 was the first song recorded in the Corcovado Gulf area in 1970, we found SEP2 to be the more common song, despite never having been reported previously in this area. Our report of SEP2 adds a new song to the current description of the SEP blue whale repertoire. Our recording of SEP1 reaffirms the acoustic link already established between Chile and the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP); our recording of SEP2 establishes a new acoustic link for this song between Chile and the ETP. These findings provide the basis for future passive acoustic studies on the temporal and spatial distributions of endangered SEP blue whales and for understanding how these songs relate to the population structure.

AB  - Whale entanglement in fishing gear is a global problem, and underwater ropes associated with this gear are often the cause of injuries that can lead to fatalities. Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are especially at risk because they are relatively small, widely distributed, and often occur in coastal habitats where many types of fishing gear are deployed. It is unknown whether minke whales can detect and avoid ropes associated with fishing gear. To address this question we conducted a series of field experiments to measure behavioral responses of nearshore minke whales to underwater ropes simulating crab and whelk fishing gear. We also investigated correlations between whale behaviors and specific environmental variables. Our methods involved both visual and acoustic monitoring of whale behaviors near experimental ropes and buoys of different colors. A remote sensing system was also used to simultaneously monitor oceanographic conditions, record underwater sounds, and capture underwater video of whales swimming near ropes. Minke whales (N=42) decreased their swimming velocity and altered their bearing when passing near experimental ropes, especially during trials with white and black ropes. Some minkes (N=7) also altered their underwater swimming trajectories when passing near ropes, and often appeared to produce low-frequency vocalizations. Collectively this information provides strong evidence that minke whales detect and react behaviorally to the presence of underwater ropes that simulate fishing gear in nearshore areas. We hypothesize that visual and perhaps passive acoustic sensory abilities may be the mechanisms behind these rope avoidance behaviors. We recommend that high contrast ropes (white and black) be used with fishing gear in coastal areas to help minimize entanglements of minke and perhaps other whale species. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Male fin whales sing by producing 20 Hz pulses in regular patterns of inter-note intervals. While singing, fin whales may also alternate the frequency ranges of their notes. Different song patterns have been observed in different regions of the world's oceans. New song patterns suddenly emerging in an area have been hypothesized to either be indicators of new groups of whales in the area or signs of cultural transmission between groups. Since the status of fin whales around Hawaii is unknown and visual surveys are expensive and difficult to conduct in offshore areas, passive acoustic monitoring has been proposed as a way to monitor these whales. We used passive acoustic recordings from an array of 14 hydrophones to analyze the song patterns of 115 fin whale encounters made up of 50,034 unique notes off Kauai, Hawaii from 2011 to 2017. Fin whale singing patterns were more complicated than previously described. Fin whales off Hawaii sang in five different patterns made of two 20 Hz note types and both singlet and doublet inter-note interval patterns. The inter-note intervals present in their songs were 28/33 s for the lower frequency doublet, 30 s for the lower frequency singlet, 17/24 s for the higher frequency doublet, 17 s for the higher frequency singlet, and 12/20 s for the doublet that alternated between both note types. Some of these song patterns were unique to these fin whales in Hawaiian waters, while others were similar to song patterns recorded from fin whales off the U.S. west coast. Individual fin whales often utilized several different song patterns which suggests that multiple song patterns are not necessarily indicators of different individuals or groups. The dominant song pattern also changed over these years. Cultural transmission may have occurred between fin whales in Hawaiian waters and off the U.S. west coast, which has resulted in similar songs being present at both locations but on lagged timescales. Alternatively, groups occupying the Hawaiian waters could shift over time resulting in different song patterns becoming dominant. This work has implications for the population structure and behavior of Hawaii fin whales.

AB  - Expanded marine shipping and industrial activity has increased the risk of harmful effects on marine mammals. Quantitative estimates of marine mammal time and space distributions are essential for developing mitigation strategies designed to reduce the risks. Seasonal distributions of key marine mammals can be estimated by deploying passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) hydrophone systems and using the acoustic data to monitor, detect and identify species presence, often in near real-time. Most contemporary PAM deployments in the ocean are stationary and archive the acoustic data for post-recovery analyses after some extended period and are thus not ideal for addressing risk dynamics in near real-time. Substantive expansions of fixed PAM arrays over large ocean expanses can be economically and on-time limiting. Mobile autonomous vehicles now offer the economy of collecting the necessary acoustic and oceanographic data over extended periods and across large swaths of the ocean. They can operate with a high degree of spatial sampling flexibility in near real-time that cannot be easily achieved using fixed PAM arrays.
   The Whale Habitat and Listening Experiment (WHaLE), funded by the Marine Environmental Observation Prediction And Response Network (MEOPAR) at Dalhousie University, and using Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) autonomous vehicles, is searching for whale habitats and monitoring the distributional patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other at-risk baleen whales across the shelf waters of Atlantic Canada. This is being achieved through fixed PAM array deployments involving several research partners, as well as the deployment of profiling and surface gliders (autonomous vehicles) equipped with PAM systems capable of detecting and identifying baleen whales that produce sounds in the 10 - 2000 Hz frequency range. When fitted with onboard, automated detection and identification algorithms, the gliders can become powerful tools for near real-time monitoring of the at-risk whales and thus risk mitigation.

AB  - The recent identification of the bio-duck call as Antarctic minke whale (AMW) vocalization allows the use of passive acoustic monitoring to retrospectively investigate year-round spatial-temporal patterns in minke whale occurrence in ice-covered areas. Here, we present an analysis of AMW occurrence patterns based on a 9-year passive acoustic dataset (2008-2016) from 21 locations throughout the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea). AMWs were detected acoustically at all mooring locations from May to December, with the highest presence between August and November (bio-duck calls present at more than 80% of days). At the southernmost recording locations, the bio-duck call was present up to 10 months of the year. Substantial inter-annual variation in the seasonality of vocal activity correlated to variation in local ice concentration. Our analysis indicates that part of the AMW population stays in the Weddell Sea during austral winter. The period with the highest acoustic presence in the Weddell Sea (September-October) coincides with the timing of the breeding season of AMW in lower latitudes. The bio-duck call could therefore play a role in mating, although other behavioural functions of the call cannot be excluded to date.

AB  - Sperm whales have depredated black cod (Anoplopoma fimbria) from demersal longlines in the Gulf of Alaska for decades, but the behavior has recently spread in intensity and geographic coverage. Over a three-year period 11 bioacoustic tags were attached to adult sperm whales off Southeast Alaska during both natural and depredation foraging conditions. Measurements of the animals' dive profiles and their acoustic behavior under both behavioral modes were examined for statistically significant differences. Two rough categories of depredation are identified: "deep" and "shallow." "Deep depredating" whales consistently surface within 500 m of a hauling fishing vessel, have maximum dive depths greater than 200 m, and display significantly different acoustic behavior than naturally foraging whales, with shorter inter-click intervals, occasional bouts of high "creak" rates, and fewer dives without creaks. "Shallow depredating" whales conduct dives that are much shorter, shallower, and more acoustically active than both the natural and deep depredating behaviors, with median creak rates three times that of natural levels. These results suggest that depredation efforts might be measured remotely with passive acoustic monitoring at close ranges. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - A combination of machine learning and expert analyst review was used to detect odontocete echolocation clicks, identify dominant click types, and classify clicks in 32 years of acoustic data collected at 11 autonomous monitoring sites in the western North Atlantic between 2016 and 2019. Previously-described click types for eight known odontocete species or genera were identified in this data set: Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), Gervais' beaked whales (Mesoplodon europaeus), Sowerby's beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens), and True's beaked whales (Mesoplodon mirus), Kogia spp., Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Six novel delphinid echolocation click types were identified and named according to their median peak frequencies. Consideration of the spatiotemporal distribution of these unidentified click types, and comparison to historical sighting data, enabled assignment of the probable species identity to three of the six types, and group identity to a fourth type. UD36, UD26, and UD28 were attributed to Risso's dolphin (G. griseus), short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus), and short-beaked common dolphin (D. delphis), respectively, based on similar regional distributions and seasonal presence patterns. UD19 was attributed to one or more species in the subfamily Globicephalinae based on spectral content and signal timing. UD47 and UD38 represent distinct types for which no clear spatiotemporal match was apparent. This approach leveraged the power of big acoustic and big visual data to add to the catalog of known species-specific acoustic signals and yield new inferences about odontocete spatiotemporal distribution patterns. The tools and call types described here can be used for efficient analysis of other existing and future passive acoustic data sets from this region.

AB  - Mitigation of threats posed to marine mammals by human activities can be greatly improved with a better understanding of animal occurrence in real time. Recent advancements have enabled low-power passive acoustic systems to be integrated into long-endurance autonomous platforms for persistent near real-time monitoring of marine mammals via the sounds they produce. Here, the integration of a passive acoustic instrument capable of real-time detection and classification of low-frequency (LF) tonal sounds with a Liquid Robotics wave glider is reported. The goal of the integration was to enable monitoring of LF calls produced by baleen whales over periods of several months. Mechanical noises produced by the platform were significantly reduced by lubricating moving parts with polytetrafluoroethylene, incorporating rubber and springs to decelerate moving parts and shock mounting hydrophones. Flow noise was reduced with the development of a 21-element hydrophone array. Surface noise produced by breaking waves was not mitigated despite experimentation with baffles. Compared to a well-characterized moored passive acoustic monitoring buoy, the system greatly underestimated the occurrence of sei, fin, and North Atlantic right whales during a 37-d deployment, and therefore is not suitable in its current configuration for use in scientific or management applications for these species at this time.

AB  - Since 2003, a collaborative effort (SEASWAP) between fishers, scientists, and managers has researched how Alaskan sperm whales locate demersal longline fishing activity and then depredate sablefish from gear. Sperm whales constantly produce relatively low-frequency biosonar signals whenever foraging; therefore, over the past decade, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become a basic tool, used for both measuring depredation activity and accelerating field tests of potential depredation countermeasures. This paper reviews and summarizes past published PAM research on SEASWAP, and then provides a detailed example of how PAM methods are currently being used to test countermeasures. The review covers two major research thrusts: (i) identifying acoustic outputs of fishing vessels that provide long-distance "cues" that attract whales to fishing activity; and (ii) validating whether distinctive "creak" sounds can be used to quantify and measure depredation rates, using both bioacoustic tags and statistical comparisons between visual and acoustic depredation estimates during federal sablefish surveys. The latter part of the paper then provides an example of how PAM is being used to study a particular potential countermeasure: an "acoustic decoy" which transmits fishing vessel acoustic cues to attract animals away from true fishing activity. The results of an initial 2011 field trial are presented to show how PAM was used to design the decoy signals and monitor the efficacy of the deployment. The ability of PAM to detect both whale presence and depredation behaviour has reduced the need to deploy researchers or other specialists on fishing cruises. Instead, volunteer fishers can deploy "user-friendly" acoustic recorders on their gear, greatly facilitating the testing of various deterrents, and providing the industry and regulators a convenient and unobtrusive tool for monitoring both the scale and long-term spread of this behaviour across the Alaskan fishery.

AB  - Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, but few studies have explored the presence of Bryde's whales at the boundary of their distribution range. Such studies are increasingly relevant as climate impact models predict the range expansion of warm water species towards the poles in response to ocean warming. Like other baleen whales, Bryde's whales produce distinct low frequency ( <60 Hz) calls, which can be used for long-term acoustic monitoring of whale presence in an area. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders deployed at five sites in the Southern California Bight (SCB) were used to investigate the presence of Bryde's whales in temperate waters from 2000 to 2010. Calling Bryde's whales were observed in the SCB from summer to early winter, indicating a seasonal poleward range expansion. There was a significant increase in the presence of calling Bryde's whales in the SCB between 2000 and 2010, but no significant correlation was found between Bryde's whale presence and local sea surface temperature. Bryde's whale occurrence is likely driven by prey availability within the California Current ecosystem, which is affected by seasonal and inter-annual changes in climate and oceanographic conditions. Continued monitoring of Bryde's whales and their prey in the eastern North Pacific is needed to provide a longer time series and determine the full effect of climate variability and ocean warming on the distribution of this species.

TI  - Spatial averaging of oceanic rainfall variability using underwater sound: Ionian sea rainfall experiment 2004
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA  - English
AB  - An experiment to evaluate the inherent spatial averaging of the underwater acoustic signal from rainfall was conducted in the winter of 2004 in the Ionian Sea southwest of Greece. A mooring with four passive aquatic listeners (PALs) at 60, 200, 1000, and 2000 in was deployed at 36.85 degrees N, 21.52 degrees E. 17 kin west of a dual-polarization X-band coastal radar at Methoni, Greece. The acoustic signal is classified into wind, rain, shipping, and whale categories. It is similar at all depths and rainfall is detected at all depths. A signal that is consistent with the clicking of deep-diving beaked whales is present 2% of the time, although there was no visual confirmation of whale presence. Co-detection of rainfall with the radar verifies that the acoustic detection of rainfall is excellent. Once detection is made, the correlation between acoustic and radar rainfall rates is high. Spatial averaging of the radar rainfall rates in concentric circles over the mooring verifies the larger inherent spatial averaging of the rainfall signal with recording depth. For the PAL at 2000 in, the maximum correlation was at 3-4 kin, suggesting a listening area for the acoustic rainfall measurement of roughly 30-50 km(2). (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - One of the most challenging tracking applications is to monitor the precise underwater movements of echo-locating cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises and whales) in the vicinity of a large pelagic trawl, i.e. in a moving frame of reference. The aim of the research is to provide information that may lead to a reduction in the by-catch of these animals. For example, by observing a dolphin as it approaches the trawl it may be possible to determine if or at what range it becomes aware of various deterrents, such as the trawl itself, or attached passive sonar reflectors and active acoustic pingers or transponders. To produce a valid estimate of a dolphin's instantaneous position, the tracking algorithm must determine the arrival times of the same echo-location click at all the hydrophones. The maximum spread of these arrival times is dependent only on the positioning of the hydrophones and the sound speed in water. The practical arrangement on the net comprises two parallel streamers, each with two hydrophones, all four therefore being in the same plane, and a fifth hydrophone above the trawl headline out of this plane.

AB  - In order to understand and address the environmental impact of sonar and acoustic systems testing, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) and its partners are developing new techniques and applications for the passive classification and tracking of marine mammals in designated Navy acoustic sensor testing areas. Ill The combined transient and broadband nature of the whale clicks contains a richly unique structure that can be exploited for completely non-evasive tracking and localization. NUWC has developed unique harmonic classification tools and other advanced visual tactical decision aids for the US Navy's latest sonar systems, designed to maximize operator performance and awareness of the undersea environment. In this paper, we will explore the use of harmonic frequency and temporal-patterned structures in the detection and tracking of whales on the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) acoustic range. We will demonstrate and report the results of the analysis of actual at-sea recorded blue whale vocalizations utilizing advanced sonar visualization and classification tools, and new tracking applications being developed.

AB  - For the planned tidal turbine site in Puget Sound, WA, the main concern is to protect Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKW) due to their Endangered Species Act status. A passive acoustic monitoring system is proposed because the whales emit vocalizations that can be detected by a passive system. The algorithm for detection is implemented in two stages. The first stage is an energy detector designed to detect candidate signals. The second stage is a spectral classifier that is designed to reduce false alarms. The evaluation presented here of the detection algorithm incoprporates behavioral models of the species of interest, environmental models of noise levels and potential false alarm sources to provide a realistic characterization of expected operational performance.

AB  - Mobile predators serve important ecological functions, including acting as nutrient vectors between different ecosystems. In coral reefs, pelagic nutrient subsidies are believed to play an increasingly important role under ongoing and projected environmental changes. Here, we combine visual sightings with passive acoustic monitoring to report habitat use and behaviour by cetaceans within atoll lagoons in the Maldives and Chagos archipelagoes. We demonstrate that spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are the most widely distributed and numerically abundant cetacean inside these atolls (>90% of all individual cetaceans by numbers). Our visual and acoustic observations both provide evidence of a regular diurnal behaviour, where dolphins enter the lagoons during the morning, for day-time resting, and exit during the afternoon, for night-time foraging offshore. Using standard metabolic models and timing of lagoonal residencies, we estimate that a dolphin pod would deposit approximately 288 +/- 17 kg year(-1) of nitrogen of primarily mesopelagic origin inside the lagoons. The nitrogen deposited inside an atoll lagoon by a dolphin pod resident year-round will therefore likely enhance coral reef productivity and resilience and suggests that these dolphins play a role in making pelagic energy and nutrients available to coral reefs. The absence of any acoustic detections following the reversal of the monsoon winds suggests that the short-to-medium-term residency of the dolphins is sensitive to seasonal productivity dynamics.

AB  - Little is known about the ecology of many beaked whale species, despite concerns raised by mass strandings linked to certain sources of anthropogenic noise. Here, we used passive acoustic monitoring to examine spatial and temporal patterns in beaked whale occurrence at six locations along the continental slope in the western North Atlantic Ocean. We analyzed 2642 days of recordings collected between 2011 and 2015, and identified echolocation signals from northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus), Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Sowerby's (Mesoplodon bidens), Gervais', (Mesoplodon europaeus), and Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) beaked whales, and one signal type of unknown origin. We recorded multiple species at each site, with detections generally occurring year-round, and observed latitudinal gradients and site-specific variation in relative species occurrence. Notably, we regularly detected Cuvier's beaked whales in a region where they have not been commonly observed, and discovered potential habitat partitioning among Cuvier's and Gervais' beaked whales within their overlapping ranges. This information on the distribution and seasonal occurrence of North Atlantic beaked whale species offers new insight into patterns of habitat use, and provides a year-round baseline from which to assess potential anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Passive acoustic recordings can identify whale species presence and behaviour in an area over time. Here a combination of moored and mobile receivers were used for acoustic surveillance of the deep-coastal and offshore waters of Clayoquot Sound. off the west coast of Vancouver Island. This study adds to the acoustic record of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) presence in the Canadian Pacific. Whale calls are a proxy for presence, and call type is an indicator of behaviour and habitat use. The recordings suggest a change in behaviour and social context of whales in this area as winter progresses to spring. There is a distinct temporal separation in call type used by fin whales, whereby recordings taken between December and late February are dominated by the 20-Hz pulse, while the 40-Hz call is prevalent in early spring (March-April). The presence of doublet song sequences is also noted for the winter recordings. The use of 20-Hz song sequences and 40-Hz calls suggest this area is used for both breeding and feeding behaviours. For 40-Hz especially, the calls are most frequently recorded along the continental shelf break, and areas of topographical complexity that may entrain prey. This study adds to the little that is known of fin whale presence and use of this area. Further works will continue to add to our knowledge of distribution and habitat use of fin whales in the northeastern Pacific as populations recover from whaling.

AB  - Linking individual and population scales is fundamental to many concepts in ecology [1], including migration [2, 3]. This behavior is a critical [4] yet increasingly threatened [5] part of the life history of diverse organisms. Research on migratory behavior is constrained by observational scale [2], limiting ecological understanding and precise management of migratory populations in expansive, inaccessible marine ecosystems [6]. This knowledge gap is magnified for dispersed oceanic predators such as endangered blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus). As capital breeders, blue whales migrate vast distances annually between foraging and breeding grounds, and their population fitness depends on synchrony of migration with phenology of prey populations [7, 8]. Despite previous studies of individual-level blue whale vocal behavior via bio-logging [9, 10] and population-level acoustic presence via passive acoustic monitoring [11], detection of the life history transition from foraging to migration remains challenging. Here, we integrate direct high-resolution measures of individual behavior and continuous broad-scale acoustic monitoring of regional song production (Figure 1A) to identify an acoustic signature of the transition from foraging to migration in the Northeast Pacific population. We find that foraging blue whales sing primarily at night, whereas migratory whales sing primarily during the day. The ability to acoustically detect population-level transitions in behavior provides a tool to more comprehensively study the life history, fitness, and plasticity of population behavior in a dispersed, capital breeding population. Real-time detection of this behavioral signal can also inform dynamic management efforts [12] to mitigate anthropogenic threats to this endangered population [13, 14]).

AB  - Passive acoustic methods are increasingly used to study cetacean habitat use and behaviour. The Timing Porpoise Detector (T-POD; www.chelonia.co.uk) is a self-contained acoustic data logger, which records echolocation by cetaceans. This study used nine T-PODs to document habitat use by bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, over a 12-month period, collecting data over 76,104 h (of a possible 78,840). T-POD records show that dolphin distribution varied seasonally, with inner fiord sites being used most often in summer and autumn, and outer fiord sites during winter and spring. This seasonal pattern was positively correlated with surface water temperature. Echolocation activity in general and buzzes, which are usually indicative of foraging, were both significantly more common during dawn and/or dusk, suggesting crepuscular foraging. T-POD data suggest that parts of the 'Dolphin Protection Zone`, in which boat traffic is restricted, are used frequently while other parts are not, and provide a basis for refining this management tool.

AB  - Evaluating changes in the collective behavior of a population can be an indirect method for inferring organismal responses to changing environmental conditions. Apex predators, such as the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), can provide valuable insights into the ecosystem processes of the deep sea, where little direct observation can be made. Sperm whales are often difficult to observe at sea, as they inhabit deep, offshore waters and spend most of their lives beneath the surface. However, sperm whales are extremely amenable to passive acoustic monitoring, as their vocalizations are well-studied, highly distinguishable, produced regularly, and can be detected at relatively long ranges (>10 km). Sperm whales produce distinct clicks in two behavioral contexts (social interaction or foraging/prey capture); thus, we can use acoustic detection of these vocalizations to infer patterns of large-scale, collective behavior, which is similar to studying calling frogs or insects indicating their reproductive phonology. We recorded behaviorally-specific sperm whale vocalizations at three sites in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in July 2010 and 2011. We used these recordings to construct population-level time budgets, an empirical collective metric of behavior, based on the ratio of hours in a day with social clicks to the hours in a day with foraging clicks, and represented this as an "acoustic activity index." Our index showed significant differences in the proportions of social and foraging behavior across the range of sperm whales in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, and the proportion of social activity increased by more than a factor of two from 2010 to 2011. These differences support previous evidence of differential habitat use by sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico, and suggest possible changes in environmental conditions between years. Thus, the acoustic activity index may provide a powerful way to evaluate changes in behavior and link them to changing ecological conditions. This novel application of bioacoustics to constructing time budgets and creating a behaviorally-based index at the population scale can serve as an indicator of ecological change, and greatly enhance our ability to understand the behavior and ecology of many acoustically active species.

AB  - The expansion of offshore renewables has raised concerns over potential disturbance to coastal cetaceans. In this study, we used passive acoustic monitoring to assess whether cetaceans responded to pile-driving noise during the installation of two 5 MW offshore wind turbines off NE Scotland in 2006. Monitoring was carried out at both the turbine site and a control site in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Harbour porpoises occurred regularly around the turbine site in all years, but there was some evidence that porpoises did respond to disturbance from installation activities. We use these findings to highlight how uncertainty over cetacean distribution and the scale of disturbance effects constrains opportunities for B-A-C-I studies. We explore alternative approaches to assessing the impact of offshore wind farm upon cetaceans, and make recommendations for the research and monitoring that will be required to underpin future developments.

AB  - In a post-industrial whaling world, flagship and charismatic baleen whale species are indicators of the health of our oceans. However, traditional monitoring methods provide spatially and temporally undersampled data to evaluate and mitigate the impacts of increasing climatic and anthropogenic pressures for conservation. Here we present the first case of wildlife monitoring using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). By repurposing the globally-available infrastructure of sub-sea telecommunication fiber optic (FO) cables, DAS can (1) record vocalizing baleen whales along a 120 km FO cable with a sensing point every 4 m, from a protected fjord area out to the open ocean; (2) estimate the 3D position of a vocalizing whale for animal density estimation; and (3) exploit whale non-stereotyped vocalizations to provide fully-passive conventional seismic records for subsurface exploration. This first example's success in the Arctic suggests DAS's potential for real-time and low-cost monitoring of whales worldwide with unprecedented coverage and spatial resolution.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly used for assessing populations of marine mammals; however, analysis of large datasets is limited by our ability to easily classify sounds detected. Classification of beaked whale acoustic events, in particular, requires evaluation of multiple lines of evidence by expert analysts. Here we present a highly automated approach to acoustic detection and classification using supervised machine learning and open source software methods. Data from four large scale surveys of beaked whales (northwestern North Atlantic, southwestern North Atlantic, Hawaii, and eastern North Pacific) were analyzed using PAMGuard (acoustic detection), PAMpal (acoustic analysis) and BANTER (hierarchical random forest classifier). Overall classification accuracy ranged from 88% for the southwestern North Atlantic data to 97% for the northwestern North Atlantic. Results for many species could likely be improved with increased sample sizes, consideration of alternative automated detectors, and addition of relevant environmental features. These methods provide a highly automated approach to acoustic detection and classification using open source methods that can be readily adopted for other species and geographic regions.

AB  - Fin whale song is a ubiquitous low-frequency pulsing that has been recorded in every ocean basin. In recent years, the complexity of fin whale song has been realized. In the North Atlantic, this song is made up of two low-frequency note types (A and B notes) and one higher-frequency note type (upsweeps). The A and B notes are produced with both singlet and doublet inter-note intervals. These song patterns are interwoven throughout an individual's song and have been observed to shift over time, both gradually and suddenly. Like many baleen whales, the population size of fin whales is poorly defined. Passive acoustic monitoring has been suggested as a way to estimate abundance if a cue rate or calling rate can be determined. In this study, we used recordings from 119 fin whale tracks from 2013-2023 generated from passive acoustic recorders in the North Atlantic to define fin whale song patterns in this ocean basin, identify changes in these song patterns over time, and calculate cue rates. The fin whales recorded sang in 4 distinct patterns. Inter-note intervals were 25 s for A-A singlets, 13 s for B-B singlets, 12/20 s for B-B doublets, and 10/11 s for A-B doublets. B-B doublet inter-note intervals significantly increased from May 2019-April 2023 and A-B inter-note intervals showed an intra-annual increasing trend that reset each summer. Fin whale song in the North Atlantic also often includes higher frequency upsweep notes immediately prior to B notes. While A and B note peak frequency was steady over these years, upsweep peak frequency significantly decreased, continuing a similar trend that has been observed over 30 years. Despite these changes, the dominant song pattern remained consistent and cue rate for actively singing whales was relatively stable, which is in contrast to patterns observed in the North Pacific. Many of these nuances in fin whale singing behavior are newly described herein, and these findings are vital for monitoring baseline behavior, behavioral trends over time, and ultimately estimating abundance of a poorly understood species.

TI  - Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed hydrophone array results in identification of a previously unknown beaked whale habitat
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

AB  - Beaked whales are diverse and species rich taxa. They spend the vast majority of their time submerged, regularly diving to depths of hundreds to thousands of meters, typically occur in small groups, and behave inconspicuously at the surface. These factors make them extremely difficult to detect using standard visual survey methods. However, recent advancements in acoustic detection capabilities have made passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) a viable alternative. Beaked whales can be discriminated from other odontocetes by the unique characteristics of their echolocation clicks. In 2009 and 2010, PAM methods using towed hydrophone arrays were tested. These methods proved highly effective for real-time detection of beaked whales in the Southern California Bight (SCB) and were subsequently implemented in 2011 to successfully detect and track beaked whales during the ongoing Southern California Behavioral Response Study. The three year field effort has resulted in (1) the successful classification and tracking of Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Baird's (Berardius bairdii), and unidentified Mesoplodon beaked whale species and (2) the identification of areas of previously unknown beaked whale habitat use. Identification of habitat use areas will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between beaked whale distribution, occurrence, and preferred habitat characteristics on a relatively small spatial scale. These findings will also provide information that can be used to promote more effective management and conservation of beaked whales in the SCB, a heavily used Naval operation and training region.

AB  - Pre-spill and post-spill passive acoustic data collected by multiple fixed acoustic sensors monitoring about 2400 km(2) area to the west of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) were analyzed to understand long term local density trends and habitat use by different species of beaked whales. The data were collected in the Mississippi Valley/Canyon area between 2007 and 2017. A multistage algorithm based on unsupervised machine learning was developed to detect and classify different species of beaked whales and to derive species- and site-specific densities in different years before and after the oil spill. The results suggest that beaked whales continued to occupy and feed in these areas following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill thus raising concerns about (1) potential long-term effects of the spill on these species and (2) the habitat conditions after the spill. The average estimated local density of Cuvier's beaked whales at the closest site, about 16 km away from the spill location showed statistically significant increase from July 2007 to September 2010, and then from September 2010 to 2015. This is the first acoustic study showing that Gervais' beaked whales are predominantly present at the shallow site and that Cuvier's species dominate at two deeper sites, supporting the habitat division (ecological niche) hypothesis. The findings call for continuing high-spatial-resolution long-term observations to fully characterize baseline beaked whale population and habitat use, to understand the causes of regional migrations, and to monitor the long-term impact of the spill.

AB  - A recently described population of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) offered a unique opportunity to study its acoustic behavior. The often-inquisitive dwarf minke whale is seen on the Great Barrier Reef nearly coincident with its suspected calving and breeding seasons. During drifting encounters with whales, a towed hydrophone array was used to record sounds for subsequent localization of sound sources. Shipboard and in-water observers linked these sounds to the closely circling minke whale. A complex and stereotyped sound sequence, the "star-wars" (SW) vocalization, was recorded during a series of visual and acoustic observations. The SW vocalization spanned a wide frequency range (50 Hz-9.4 kHz) and was composed of distinct and stereotypically repeated units with both amplitude and frequency-modulated components. Broadband source levels between 150 and 165 dB re 1 mu Pa at I m were calculated. Passive acoustic studies can utilize this distinct vocalization to help determine the behavior, distribution, and movements of this animal. While the SW vocalization's function remains unknown, the regularly repeated and complex sound sequence was common in low latitude, winter month aggregations of minke whales. At this early stage, the SW vocalization appears similar to the songs of other whale species and has characteristics consistent with those of reproductive advertisement displays.

AB  - The development of marine renewables has raised concerns regarding impacts on wildlife, and environmental monitoring is often required. We examined 3 mo of continuous passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data collected at the Tidal Energy Ltd. DeltaStream turbine deployment in Ramsey Sound, UK. We aimed to assess the performance of the PAM system at an operational turbine, describe the 3D movements and behaviours of small cetaceans in the vicinity of the turbine, and model changes in detection rates against temporal and environmental variables. The PAM system was designed to acoustically detect, classify and track porpoises and dolphins via their vocalisations within a similar to 100 m radius of the turbine. In total, 247 small cetacean encounters were identified from click detections, which were also used to reconstruct the spatial movements of porpoises and dolphins, including close approaches to the turbine. Not all hydro phones were functional, which limited the ability to localise porpoise clicks; the probability of detecting and localising a click decreased by 50% at a range of similar to 20 m. Mechanical sounds on the turbine may have alerted cetaceans of its presence. In models examining acoustic detection patterns, the tidal state, time of day, low low-frequency noise levels and moon phase best explained the acoustic presence of porpoises. The limited duration of turbine operation yielded insufficient data to understand the effect of turbine rotation on animal presence and movement near the turbine. This is the first description of how small cetaceans behave and move around a tidal turbine, and we present recommendations regarding how PAM can be used to improve environmental monitoring at future tidal energy sites.

AB  - Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) vocalizing behavior varies over its range, both in call type and frequency. This study adds to the growing body of passive acoustic research outside of the calving/breeding lagoons, and moves toward a description of calling behaviors throughout the whales' range. Data are presented here from acoustic surveys for two northward and one southward migration, with recordings taken off the west coast of Vancouver Island. We found gray whales to be highly sonorous, with extensive calling during the study periods of February to May for northward migrations and September to the end of January for southward travel. Low frequency moans were the most prevalent call type, with others, including knocks, up- and down sweeps, and rumbles, recorded in varying numbers. We hypothesize that calling is an aid for navigation and orientation of the herd along the migration route, in addition to holding more social functions usually assigned to baleen whale calling.

AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) produce a variety of low-frequency, short-duration, frequency-modulated calls. The differences in temporal patterns between two fin whale call types are described from long-term passive acoustic data collected intermittently between 2005 and 2011 at three locations across the eastern North Pacific: the Bering Sea, off Southern California, and in Canal de Ballenas in the northern Gulf of California. Fin whale calls were detected at all sites year-round, during all periods with recordings. At all three locations, 40-Hz calls peaked in June, preceding a peak in 20-Hz calls by 3-5 months. Monitoring both call types may provide a more accurate insight into the seasonal presence of fin whales across the eastern North Pacific than can be obtained from a single call type. The 40-Hz call may be associated with a foraging function, and temporal separation between 40- and 20-Hz calls may indicate the separation between predominately feeding behavior and other social interactions.

AB  - The southern Indian Ocean is believed to be a natural territory for blue and fin whales. However, decades after commercial and illegal whaling decimated these populations, little is known about their current status, seasonal habitat or movements. Recent passive acoustic studies have described the presence of 4 acoustic populations of blue whales (Antarctic and 3 'pygmy' types), but are generally limited temporally and geographically. Here, we examine up to 7 yr of continuous acoustic recordings (2010-2016) from a hydrophone network of 6 widely spaced sites in the southern Indian Ocean, looking for the presence of Antarctic and pygmy blue and fin whales. Power spectral density analyses of characteristic and distinct frequency bands of these species show seasonal and geographic differences among the different populations, and the overall patterns for each display interannual consistencies in timing and occurrence. Antarctic blue and fin whales are recorded across the hydrophone network, mainly from austral autumn to spring, with peak intensity in winter. Pygmy blue whales show spatial variation: Madagascan pygmy blue whales are mainly present in the west of the network, while the Australian call type is heard at the eastern sites. Both populations share a common seasonality, with a presence from January to June. Finally, the Sri Lankan call type is recorded only on a single site in the northeast. These results confirm the importance of the southern Indian Ocean for several populations of endangered large whales and present the first long-term assessment of fin whales in the southern Indian Ocean.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of passive acoustic detection of contact calls produced by the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. The proposed solution is based on using a generalized likelihood ratio, test detector of polynomial-phase signals with unknown amplitude and polynomial coefficients observed in the presence of locally stationary Gaussian noise. The closed form representation for a minimal sufficient statistic is derived and a realizable detection scheme is developed. The receiver operation characteristic curves are calculated using empirical data recordings containing known right whale calls. The curves demonstrate that the proposed detector provides superior detection performance as compared with other known detection techniques for northern right whale contact calls.

AB  - Beaked whale are difficult to observe visually and are among the most sensitive species to anthropogenic noise. Thus passive acoustic monitoring is particularly interesting to study these species and mitigate noise impact. This paper presents the outline of an automatic recognition method of beaked whale signals. This method has three steps: a transient detector, individual click classification and click association in click trains using a multi hypothesis tracker. Click train association enhances classification because a click is not emitted alone and click trains have properties that can be characteristic of a species (e.g. inter-click-interval). The results are presented for three species: Blainville's, Cuvier's and Gervais beaked whale. The results obtained are very encouraging.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are highly social predators distributed throughout the world's oceans. They are divided into different ecotypes to foraging specializations, phenotype, and social organization. For Northern Hemisphere killer whale ecotypes, acoustic behaviour has been shown to relate to foraging strategies and social organization. In contrast to the intensively studied Northern Hemisphere ecotypes, distribution patterns, social structures, and acoustic behaviour of the Southern Hemisphere killer whale ecotypes are poorly known. One of the Southern Hemisphere ecotypes, the Antarctic Ecotype C killer whale, is known to occur in regions with dense pack ice. The limited accessibility of these areas make passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) methods a very effective investigation tool to derive information on ecotype-specific abundance and distribution. During 2 d in February 2013, it was possible to collect concurrent visual and acoustic information of Ecotype C killer whales off the Antarctic continent. From these events, a call type catalogue was compiled. The 2,238 examined calls were subjectively classified into 26 discrete call types. Ten percent of the examined calls were re-classified by two additional independent observers to examine robustness of the classification. Mean classification accordance among observers was 68%. Most call types were composed of more than one call part. Sixty-five percent of all call types were monophonic, and 35% were biphonic. Almost two-third of all call types started with a short, broadband pulse. The variability within call types was relatively high. The Ecotype C vocal repertoire contained typical acoustic features such as biphonation, high call complexity, and generally high variability in frequency modulation. For future studies, the distinct characteristics of some of the call types described herein could potentially serve as acoustic markers for PAM-based differentiation of killer whale ecotypes in the Southern Ocean.

AB  - Fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were the species of baleen whale most widely caught by commercial whaling fleets off the Chilean coast and are globally classified as Endangered. However, very little is known about the present distribution and seasonal movements of fin whales off the coast of Chile. Passive acoustic data collected at the HA03 station of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization off the Juan Fernandez Archipelago (JFA) between 2007 and 2016 were analyzed. The temporal occurrence of fin whale song was examined using automatic detection via spectrogram cross-correlation of song notes and by calculating the average acoustic power in the frequency bands of fin whale song. Fin whale song off JFA was composed of regular 17 Hz notes associated with high-frequency components at 85 Hz, with singlet phrasing at a dominant primary inter-note interval of 14.4 s and a secondary interval of 30.8 s. There was a clear seasonal pattern in acoustic presence that was consistent across all years: low or no song during the austral summer and a peak in song occurrence in austral winter. A propagation loss model estimated the detection range at this site to be 186 km. Where the fin whales that are heard off JFA spend the summer months remains an open question. Possible locations include the Western Antarctic Peninsula and/or off northern-central mainland Chile. Further studies should be pursued to better understand the distribution and seasonal movements and to support the conservation of this Endangered species.

AB  - While the Greenland and Barents Seas are known habitats for several cetacean and pinniped species there is a lack of long-term monitoring data in this rapidly changing environment. Moreover, little is known of the ambient soundscapes, and increasing off-shore anthropogenic activities can influence the ecosystem and marine life. Baseline acoustic data is needed to better assess current and future soundscape and ecosystem conditions. The analysis of a year of continuous data from three passive acoustic monitoring devices revealed species-dependent seasonal and spatial variation of a large variety of marine mammals in the Greenland and Barents Seas. Sampling rates were 39 and 78 kHz in the respective locations, and all systems were operational at a duty cycle of 2 min on, 30 min off. The research presents a description of cetacean and pinniped acoustic detections along with a variety of unknown low-frequency tonal sounds, and ambient sound level measurements that fall within the scope of the European Marine Strategy Framework (MSFD). The presented data shows the importance of monitoring Arctic underwater biodiversity for assessing the ecological changes under the scope of climate change.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly employed to monitor whales, their population size, habitat usage, and behaviour. However, in the case of the eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue whale (EIOPB whale), its applicability is limited by our lack of understanding of the behavioural context of sound production. This study explored the context of singing behaviour using a 7.6-day biotelemetry dataset from a single EIOPB whale moving north from 31.5 degrees S to 28.5 degrees S along the Western Australian coast and a simultaneously collected, but separate, acoustic recording. Diving behaviour was classified using an automated classification schema. Singing was identified in the depth, pitch, and fluking time series of the dive profile. The EIOPB whale sang profusely as it migrated, spending more time singing during the day (76.8%) than at night (64.9%), and most during twilight periods (83.3%). The EIOPB whale almost exclusively produced the three-unit (P3) song while milling. It sang the two-unit (P2) song in similar proportions to the P3 song while travelling, except at night when P3 was sung 2.7 times more than P2. A correlation between singing depth, migration duration, and water temperature provides a biological basis to explain depth preferences for sound production, which may contribute to the cause of intra- and inter-annual sound frequency trends.

AB  - Construction in the southern New England wind energy area (WEA), a large-scale offshore wind farm on the east coast of the United States, started in June 2023. Baseline data was collected from 2020 to 2022, with six passive acoustic recorders (SoundTraps) deployed at shallow (<60 m) sites in the vicinity of Nantucket Shoals and Cox's Ledge. Data were analysed for sperm whale presence, and demographic composition was assessed using interclick intervals. Presence varied by site, season, and year. Sperm whales were detected year-round but the majority (78%) of days with acoustic occurrences were between May and August. Three demographic classes (putative social groups, adult males, and midsize animals) were detected across multiple seasons, with social groups detected most frequently. Sound propagation tests were conducted at two sites and predicted detection ranges within 20-40 km indicate that sperm whales were likely in proximity to the WEA. These results provide a baseline that will be used to assess ongoing sperm whale presence, especially that of social groups which may be more sensitive to disturbance. This study highlights why sperm whales, classed as endangered in US waters, should be considered in mitigation plans and permitting efforts for offshore wind energy.

AB  - Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the tropical North Pacific are elusive and difficult to detect visually. The recent association of a unique sound called the "boing"to North Pacific minke whales has made it possible to use passive acoustics to investigate the occurrence of this species in Hawaiian waters. One year of recordings (17 February 2007-18 February 2008) made at the Station ALOHA Cabled Observatory were examined to investigate the characteristics of boings and temporal patterns in their occurrence at this site, located 100 km north of Oahu. Characteristics of boings exhibited low variability. Pulse repetition rate and duration measurements matched those for "central" or "Hawaii"boing types. Boings were detected from October until May, with a peak in March. Although no boings were detected from June to September, the absence of boings does not necessarily indicate the absence of minke whales. Significant diel variation in boing rate was not observed. The absence of a diel pattern in boing production suggests that day-or night-time acoustic surveys are equally acceptable methods for studying minke whale occurrence. Future research should include efforts to determine what other sounds are produced by minke whales in this area, and which age/sex classes produce boings. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - This study presents non-song vocalizations of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from two migratory areas off the Western Australian coast: Geographe Bay and Port Hedland. A total of 220 sounds were identified as non-song sounds in 193 h of recordings reviewed. Of those, 68 were measured and qualitatively classified into 17 groups using their spectral features. One group (HW-02) had a high level of variation in terms of spectral slope. However, further classification using statistical classification methods was not possible because of the small sample size. Non-song sound frequencies varied from 9 Hz to 6 kHz, with the majority of sounds under 200 Hz. The duration of non-song sounds varied between 0.09 and 3.59 s. Overall, the use of spectral features allowed general classification of humpback whale sounds in a low sample size scenario that was not conducive to using quantitative methods. However, for highly variable groups, quantitative statistical classification methods (e.g., random forests) are needed to improve classification accuracy. The identification and accurate classification of a species' acoustic repertoire is key to effectively monitor population status using acoustic techniques and to better understand the vocal behavior of the species. The results of this study improve the monitoring of humpback whales by standardizing the classification of sounds and including them in the species' repertoire. The inclusion of non-song sounds in passive acoustic monitoring of humpback whales will add females and calves to the detection counts of otherwise only singing males.

KW  - CLASSIFICATION
AB  - Passive acoustics provides a powerful tool for monitoring the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), but robust detection algorithms are needed to handle diverse and variable acoustic conditions and differences in recording techniques and equipment. This paper investigates the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) for addressing this need. ResNet, an architecture commonly used for image recognition, was trained to recognize the time-frequency representation of the characteristic North Atlantic right whale upcall. The network was trained on several thousand examples recorded at various locations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2018 and 2019, using different equipment and deployment techniques. Used as a detection algorithm on fifty 30-min recordings from the years 2015-2017 containing over one thousand upcalls, the network achieved recalls up to 80% while maintaining a precision of 90%. Importantly, the performance of the network improved as more variance was introduced into the training dataset, whereas the opposite trend was observed using a conventional linear discriminant analysis approach. This study demonstrates that DNNs can be trained to identify North Atlantic right whale upcalls under diverse and variable conditions with a performance that compares favorably to that of existing algorithms.

AB  - Two types of passive-acoustic survey were conducted to investigate the seasonal occurrence of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the western Beaufort and far northeastern Chukchi seas: (1) an over-winter (2003-04) Survey using autonomous recorders deployed northeast of Barrow, Alaska, and (2) a summertime dipping-hydrophone survey along the 2005 NOAA Ocean Exploration (CE) cruise track northwest of Barrow. The longest continuous sampling period from the over-winter survey was 3 October 2003 to 12 May 2004. During that period, bowhead whale calls were recorded from 3 to 23 October, intermittently on 6-7 and 22-23 November, then not again until 25 March 2004. Bowhead calls were recorded almost every hour from 19 April to 12 May 2004, with a call rate peak on 30 April (ca. 9400 calls) and a few instances of patterned calling (or, "song") detected in early May. Bowhead whale calls were never detected during the NOAA OE cruise, but calls of beluga whales (Delphinaptenis leucas) were recorded at 3 of 16 acoustic stations. Opportunistic visual surveys for marine mammals were also conducted during the NOAA CE cruise from the ship (65 h) and helicopter (7.8 h), resulting in single sightings of bowhead whales (3-5 whales), beluga (16-20 whales), walrus (1), polar bear (2 = sow/cub), and 17 sightings of 87 ringed seals from the ship and 15 sightings of 67 ringed seals from the helicopter.

AB  - Masking from industrial noise can hamper the ability to detect marine mammal sounds near industrial operations, whenever conventional (pressure sensor) hydrophones are used for passive acoustic monitoring. Using data collected from an autonomous recorder with directional capabilities (Directional Autonomous Seafloor Acoustic Recorder), deployed 4.1 km from an arctic drilling site in 2012, the authors demonstrate how conventional beamforming on an acoustic vector sensor can be used to suppress noise arriving from a narrow sector of geographic azimuths. Improvements in signal-to-noise ratio of up to 15 dB are demonstrated on bowhead whale calls, which were otherwise undetectable using conventional hydrophones. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America

AB  - The Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) is a difficult species to study because of its low visual detectability and preference for living within the sea ice habitat, accessible only by ice-strengthened vessels. Recent identification of the Antarctic minke whale as the source of the seasonally ubiquitous bio-duck call has allowed the use of this sound, as well as downsweeps, to investigate seasonality trends and diel patterns in Antarctic minke whale call production, and their relationship to sea ice cover. Passive acoustic data were collected using an autonomous Acoustic Recording Package (ARP) off the western Antarctic Peninsula. Bio-duck calls were classified into four distinct call variants, with one variant having two subtypes. Bio-duck calls were detected between April and November, with increasing call duration during the austral winter, indicating a strong seasonality in call production. Downsweeps, which were also attributed to Antarctic minke whales, were present throughout most months during the recording period, with a peak in July, and an absence in March and April. Both bio-duck and downsweeps were significantly correlated with sea ice cover. No diel patterns were observed in bio-duck calls or in downsweep call production at this site.

AB  - Odontocetes depredating fish caught on longlines is a serious socio-economic and conservation issue. A good understanding of the underwater depredation behavior by odontocetes is therefore required. Historically, depredation on demersal longlines has always been assumed to occur during the hauling phase. In this study, we have focused on the depredation behavior of two ecotypes of killer whales, Orcinus orca, (Crozet and Type D) from demersal longlines around the Crozet Archipelago (Southern Indian Ocean) using passive acoustic monitoring. We assessed 74 hr of killer whale acoustic presence out of 1,233 hr of recordings. Data were obtained from 29 hydrophone deployments from five fishing vessels between February and March 2018. We monitored killer whale buzzing activity (i.e., echolocation signals) as a proxy for feeding attempts around soaking longlines. These recordings revealed that the two ecotypes were feeding at close range from soaking longlines, even when fishing vessels were not present. Our results suggest that both killer whale ecotypes are likely to depredate soaking longlines, which would imply an underestimation of their depredation rates. The implication of underestimating depredation rates is inaccurate accounting for fish mortality in fisheries' stock assessments.

AB  - Approximately half of the North Pacific humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae stock visits the shallow waters of the main Hawaiian Islands seasonally. Within this breeding area, mature males produce an elaborate acoustic display known as song, which becomes the dominant source of ambient underwater sound between December and April. Following reports of unusually low whale numbers that began in 2015/16, we examined song chorusing recorded through long-term passive acoustic monitoring at 6 sites off Maui as a proxy for relative whale abundance between 2014 and 2019. Daily root-mean-square sound pressure levels (RMS SPLs) were calculated to compare variations in low-frequency acoustic energy (0-1.5 kHz). After 2014/15, the overall RMS SPLs decreased between 5.6 and 9.7 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 during the peak of whale season (February and March), reducing ambient acoustic energy from chorusing by over 50%. This change in song levels co-occurred with a broad-scale oceanic heat wave in the northeast Pacific termed the 'Blob,' a major El Nino event in the North Pacific, and a warming period in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation cycle. Although it remains unclear whether our observations reflect a decrease in population size, a change in migration patterns, a shift in distribution to other areas, a change in the behavior of males, or some combination of these, our results indicate that continued monitoring and further studies of humpback whales throughout the North Pacific are warranted to better understand the fluctuations occurring in this recently recovered population and other populations that continue to be endangered or threatened.

AB  - The use of passive acoustic observation is a useful tool in bioacoustic studies of cetaceans, such as killer whales (Orcinus orca). Such studies require the recording, detection, and classification of vocalizations of animals during long periods of time. The manual processing of the recordings is an extremely time consuming task because of the large amount of data to process. Automatic detection and classification techniques are useful to improve the processing, increase the amount of information and, as a consequence, provide information for the conservation of these species.
   The Orca Ocean facilities of Loro Parque in the Canary Islands, Spain, were used as an experimental platform for developing devices to perform bioacoustic studies. Detection methods with low computational complexity were tested in order to capture vocalizations of four O. orca specimens in real time. The algorithms were also tested in other scenarios in order to determine their global performance. The sensitivity to noise was also tested. The most accurate method in this study was implemented and integrated with a continuous recording system generating an event database in real time, downsizing the storage demand to 7%. This allowed the storage of all the sound events produced in about one month on a standard computer harddisk and the generation of basic statistics on vocal activity of the animals.

AB  - In most areas, estimating the presence and distribution of cryptic marine mammal species, such as beaked whales, is extremely difficult using traditional observational techniques such as ship-based visual line transect surveys. Because acoustic methods permit detection of animals underwater, at night, and in poor weather conditions, passive acoustic observation has been used increasingly often over the last decade to study marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movements, as well as for mitigation of potentially harmful anthropogenic effects. However, there is demand for new, cost-effective tools that allow scientists to monitor areas of interest autonomously with high temporal and spatial resolution in near-real time. Here we describe an autonomous underwater vehicle - a glider - equipped with an acoustic sensor and onboard data processing capabilities to passively scan an area for marine mammals in near-real time. The glider was tested extensively off the west coast of the Island of Hawai'i, USA. The instrument covered approximately 390 km during three weeks at sea and collected a total of 194 h of acoustic data. Detections of beaked whales were successfully reported to shore in near-real time. Manual analysis of the recorded data revealed a high number of vocalizations of delphinids and sperm whales. Furthermore, the glider collected vocalizations of unknown origin very similar to those made by known species of beaked whales. The instrument developed here can be used to cost-effectively screen areas of interest for marine mammals for several months at a time. The near-real-time detection and reporting capabilities of the glider can help to protect marine mammals during potentially harmful anthropogenic activities such as seismic exploration for sub-sea fossil fuels or naval sonar exercises. Furthermore, the glider is capable of under-ice operation, allowing investigation of otherwise inaccessible polar environments that are critical habitats for many endangered marine mammal species.

AB  - The endangered North Atlantic right whale is susceptible to increased risks associated with the developing energy market off the Virginia coast of the U.S.A., including increased noise exposure from shipping and energy exploration and extraction, and shipping activity. Primarily viewed as a migratory corridor between northern feeding and mating areas and the southern calving area, Virginia waters have not been intensely monitored for right whales. We conducted a 1 yr, continuous, passive acoustic survey from the Virginia coast to the continental shelf to better describe the seasonal occurrence and spatial distribution of right whales in this area. We found that whales were acoustically detected in every month of the year, with increased seasonal occurrences in fall and late winter/early spring, and not just during limited periods of the year. As industry activities continue to increase in the area, these new right whale occurrence data have implications for siting and permitting of offshore energy activities.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of dolphins is limited by our ability to classify calls to species. Significant overlap in call characteristics among many species, combined with a wide range of call types and acoustic behavior, makes classification of calls to species challenging. Here, we introduce BANTER, a compound acoustic classification method for dolphins that utilizes information from all call types produced by dolphins rather than a single call type, as has been typical for acoustic classifiers. Output from the passive acoustic monitoring software, PAMGuard, was used to create independent classifiers for whistles, echolocation clicks, and burst pulses, which were then merged into a final, compound classifier for each species. Classifiers for five species found in the California Current ecosystem were trained and tested using 153 single-species acoustic events recorded during a 4.5 mo combined visual and acoustic shipboard cetacean survey off the west coast of the United States. Correct classification scores for individual species ranged from 71% to 92%, with an overall correct classification score of 84% for all five species. The conceptual framework of this approach easily lends itself to other species and study areas as well as to noncetacean taxa.

AB  - The Mediterranean sperm whale population, Physeter macrocephalus, is listed as endangered due to population decline caused by human activities. To mitigate the impact of these activities, accurate knowledge of their distribution and abundance is crucial. During their long dives, sperm whales are not available to visual observation, but since they produce sounds when they dive, they are available to acoustic detection. Therefore, we aimed to use towed acoustic data to model their habitat and fill the knowledge gap on Mediterranean sperm whale distribution. Generalised additive models were used to link the number of sperm whales detected acoustically during the ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative in 2018 with different environmental variables integrated over different depth classes, encompassing the depth range used by the species for foraging. Sperm whale distribution was influenced by water temperature at the bottom, eddy kinetic energy between 200 and 600 m, as well as gradients of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The abundance of sperm whales was estimated at 2,959 individuals [2,077 - 4,265] in the sampled areas of the Mediterranean Sea. We predicted that sperm whales were mainly distributed in summer along the continental slope of the north-western Mediterranean basin from the Balearic Islands to the Ligurian Sea and off the Algerian coast. They were present throughout the western Mediterranean Sea and in the northern Ionian Sea. In contrast, predicted densities were low in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. The use of acoustic data compensated for the main difficulty in studying sperm whales, the unavailability of animals at the surface during visual observation and the paucity of visual data. We thus encourage more systematic use of passive acoustics to study sperm whale distribution. The model highlighted a higher concentration of sperm whales in the western Mediterranean basin than in the eastern basin in summer, opening up avenues to improve the conservation of this endangered Mediterranean sub-population.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is effective for examining the temporal variation of cetacean occurrences through continuous recording. How ever, the interpretation of behavior variability remains difficult. Cetacean tonal sounds are believed to play an important role in communication. Changes in tonal sound usage can be indicative of changes in cetacean behavior. In this study, we applied a generalized tonal sound detector on recordings from the marine cable hosted observatory (MACHO) off Northeastern Taiwan. The tonal sound detector is a modified local-max detector, which examines the prominence of tonality in 2 ms time intervals. Detections were confirmed based on the short-time transient characteristic of tonal sounds. The burst pulse, fundamental frequency, and harmonic were separated during post-processing. The detection results can be used to analyze the frequency distribution and modulation of the tonal sounds. Following individual contour extractions, the tonal sounds were classified to examine the repertoire composition through duration and frequency normalization. An evident nighttime occurrence was identified for both the burst pulse and tonal sound. The mode frequency of tonal sound did not show a significant difference, but the percentage of overlapping tonal sounds, Shannon entropy of frequency distribution, and repertoire complexity varied significantly among diurnal cycles. The current framework of quantification on tonal sound modulation and repertoire complexity provides intuitive parameters for the variability of cetacean behavior, which can be used to examine the temporal variations of cetacean habitat use. The precision in distinguishing different species and behaviors may be increased by comparing the repertoire established through automatic classification.

AB  - Cetacean abundance estimation often relies on distance sampling methods using shipboard visual line-transect surveys, which assumes that all animals on the trackline are detected and that the detection of animals decreases with increasing distance from the trackline. Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) typically employs a secondary visual observation team and may be used to identify the fraction of animals detected on the trackline when it is suspected that animals may have been missed. For species that are difficult to detect using visual observation methods, such as deep-diving species or those with cryptic surfacing behavior, this secondary team may be prone to the same limitations in detection as the primary observation team and alternative modes of detection may improve estimates. Here we examine the potential use of passive acoustic detection as a secondary platform for MRDS of rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) during a combined visual and acoustic shipboard line-transect survey. The average trackline detection probability for rough-toothed dolphins was less than one for both the trial configuration (for the visual team) and independent observer configuration (average p(0) 0.45 for the visual team) and independent observer configuration (average p(0) 0.37 for the visual, p (0) 0.77 for the acoustic and p(0) 0.84 for both teams combined). This study, while limited in scope, strongly suggests that passive acoustic methods may be an effective alternative for estimating p(0) for some cetaceans species.

AB  - Beaked whales are deep diving elusive animals, difficult to census with conventional visual surveys. Methods are presented for the density estimation of beaked whales, using passive acoustic monitoring data collected at sites in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) from the period during and following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010-2013). Beaked whale species detected include: Gervais' (Mesoplodon europaeus), Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) and an unknown species of Mesoplodon sp. (designated as Beaked Whale Gulf-BWG). For Gervais' and Cuvier's beaked whales, we estimated weekly animal density using two methods, one based on the number of echolocation clicks, and another based on the detection of animal groups during 5 min time-bins. Density estimates derived from these two methods were in good general agreement. At two sites in the western GOM, Gervais' beaked whales were present throughout the monitoring period, but Cuvier's beaked whales were present only seasonally, with periods of low density during the summer and higher density in the winter. At an eastern GOM site, both Gervais' and Cuvier's beaked whales had a high density throughout the monitoring period.

AB  - With one million animal species at risk of extinction, there is an urgent need to regularly monitor threatened species. However, in practice this is challenging, especially with wide-ranging, elusive and cryptic species or those that occur at low density.
   Here we compare two non-invasive methods, passive acoustic monitoring (n = 12) and camera trapping (n = 53), to detect chimpanzees Pan troglodytes in a savanna-woodland mosaic habitat at the Issa Valley, Tanzania. With occupancy modelling we evaluate the efficacy of each method, using the estimated number of sampling days needed to establish chimpanzee absence with 95% probability, as our measure of efficacy.
   Passive acoustic monitoring was more efficient than camera trapping in detecting wild chimpanzees. Detectability varied over seasons, likely due to social and ecological factors that influence party size and vocalization rate. The acoustic method can infer chimpanzee absence with less than 10 days of recordings in the field during the late dry season, the period of highest detectability, which was five times faster than the visual method.
   Synthesis and applications. Despite some technical limitations, we demonstrate that passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for species monitoring. Its applicability in evaluating presence/absence, especially but not exclusively for loud call species, such as cetaceans, elephants, gibbons or chimpanzees provides a more efficient way of monitoring populations and inform conservation plans to mediate species-loss.

AB  - Blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whales (B. physalus) produce high-intensity, low-frequency calls, which probably function for communication during mating and feeding. The source levels of blue and fin whale calls off the Western Antarctic Peninsula were calculated using recordings made with calibrated, bottom-moored hydrophones. Blue whales were located up to a range of 200 km using hyperbolic localization and time difference of arrival. The distance to fin whales, estimated using multipath arrivals of their calls, was up to 56 km. The error in range measurements was 3.8 km using hyperbolic localization, and 3.4 km using multipath arrivals. Both species produced high-intensity calls; the average blue whale call source level was 189 +/- 3 dB re: 1/mu Pa-1 m over 25-29 Hz, and the average fin whale call source level was 189 +/- 4 dB re: 1/mu Pa-1 m over 15-28 Hz. Blue and fin whale populations in the Southern Ocean have remained at low numbers for decades since they became protected; using source level and detection range from passive acoustic recordings can help in calculating the relative density of calling, whales.

AB  - A strong negative relationship has been observed between calf production of eastern North Pacific gray whales Eschrichtius robustus and Pacific Arctic sea ice area with the exception of 2 potentially anomalous periods: 2013-2014 and 2017-2019. Sea ice may play a role in reproductive variability by blocking gray whale access to foraging hotspot habitats. We tested this 'sea ice exclusion' hypothesis using complementary aerial survey and moored hydrophone data sets that together provide broad spatial and temporal coverage. A negative relationship (generalized additive model, p < 0.001) was found between gray whale aerial counts and ice concentration in the northeast Chukchi Sea (2008-2019), with a nonlinear increase in negative slope above 45-55% concentration. A comparison of distribution patterns between years further indicated the absence of sightings within northern Bering and northeastern Chukchi foraging hotspots during years with delayed ice break-up versus years with an early-to-average ice retreat. Passive acoustic recordings likewise showed the near-absence of detections during periods of dense ice cover and indicated a strongly positive relationship between ice break-up dates and the timing of acoustic detection onset. Together, these analyses point to the important role of sea ice in gray whale distribution, habitat use, and phenology. However, a relatively consistent 10-15 d lag observed between ice break-up and acoustic onset dates suggested that the mechanism(s) underpinning gray whale interactions with sea ice may be more complex than simply 'sea ice exclusion.' Here, we propose 'prey quality timing' as a potential alternative hypothesis that warrants further investigation.

AB  - Characterizing the trophic roles of deep-diving odontocete species and how they vary in space and time is challenged by our ability to observe foraging behavior. Though sampling methods are limited, foraging activity of deep-diving odontocetes can be monitored by recording their biosonar emissions. Daily occurrence of echolocation clicks was monitored acoustically for five months (July-December 2011) in the Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean Sea) using five passive acoustic recorders. Detected odontocetes included Cuvier's beaked whales (Zipuhius cavirostris), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), and long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). The results indicated that the foraging strategies varied significantly over time, with sperm whales switching to nocturnal foraging in late September whereas Risso's dolphins and pilot whales foraged mainly at night throughout the sampling period. In the study area, winter nights are about five hours longer than summer nights and an analysis showed that pilot whales and Risso's dolphins adjusted their foraging activity with the length of the night, foraging longer during the longer winter nights. This is the first study to show that marine mammals exhibit diurnal foraging patterns closely correlated to sunrise and sunset. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has the potential to be a useful tool for population estimation of sound-producing fish and mammals (mostly whales). Previous work on population estimates of callers employed a simple cross-correlation technique with recordings from two acoustic sensors, and the current work extends the technique to two configurations of a 3-acoustic sensors array using two different sounds, i.e., chirps which is commonly generated by damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), dugongs (Dugong dugon) etc., species, and grunts which is commonly generated by Japanese gurnard (Chelidonichthys kuniu), Grey gurnard (Eutrigla gumardus), gulf toadfish (O. beta), etc., species. We compared simulated results from this technique with values determined by theoretical approach. We have found that an increasing number of cross-correlation function (CCF) provide better results using this technique. However, the technique has some limitations including negligence of multipath interference, assuming the delays to be integer. (C) 2019 Shanghai Jiaotong University. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the attribution of the bio-duck call to Antarctic minke whales (AMW Balaenoptera bonaerensis), different studies have retrospectively identified several bio-duck call types at various sites throughout the Southern Hemisphere. The function of their vocal behavior however, remains largely unknown. Further insights into their repertoire usage may help to reveal the function of their calls. Here, we use passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data collected across six locations throughout the Weddell Sea (WS) in 2013 and from PALAOA Station (Ekstrom Ice Shelf, eastern WS) in 2015, 2016 and 2017. In 2013, we detected 11 bio-duck call types throughout the WS between May and December, with additional acoustic activity in February on the western recorder AMW calls fell into four general call clusters. Seasonal patterns of calls showed variability between locations and years. Furthermore, this is the first study to show that similar to other baleen whale species, AMWs also produce songs.

AB  - The central Gulf of Maine was recently identified as a persistent wintering ground and potential mating ground for non-calving North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis based on aerial survey data. However, these surveys were limited by bad weather and light. Here, we use passive acoustic monitoring to examine the long-term persistence of right whales in this area throughout a nearly continuous period from October 2009 through October 2010. Three archival marine acoustic recording units were deployed in the Outer Fall/central Gulf of Maine. The data were manually reviewed for right whale up-calls and gunshots to investigate seasonal and diel patterns. Up-calls and gunshots occurred seasonally, with the most calls recorded from October through January and fewer calls detected from February through July, increasing again in August through October. Up-calls were most frequent in November, and gunshots in December. There was a clear bimodal diel pattern in up-calls, with the majority of calls occurring between 04:00 through 08:00 h and 13:00 through 22:00 h. There was a clear peak in diel distribution of gunshots, with the majority of calls occurring between 16: 00 and 22:00 h. Our data demonstrate the continuous presence of right whales in the central Gulf of Maine during the winter months. The rate of gunshots during winter months in Outer Fall supports the hypothesis that male advertisement and/or right whale mating behavior may be taking place in this region at that time.

AB  - This paper focuses on the robust indexing of sperm whale hydrophone recordings based on a set of features extracted from a realtime passive underwater acoustic tracking algorithm for multiple whales using four hydrophones. Acoustic localization permits the study of whale behavior in deep water without interfering with the environment. Given the position coordinates, we are able to generate different features such as the speed, energy of the clicks, Inter-Click-Interval (ICI), and so on. These features allow to construct different markers which allow us to index and structure the audio files. Thus, the behavior study is facilitated by choosing and accessing the corresponding index in the audio file. The complete indexing algorithm is processed on real data from the NUWC (Naval Undersea Warfare Center of the US Navy) and the AUTEC (Atlantic Undersea Test & Evaluation Center-Bahamas). Our model is validated by similar results from the US Navy (NUWC) and SOEST (School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology) Hawaii university labs in a single whale case. Finally, as an illustration, we index a single whale sound file using the extracted whale's features provided by the tracking, and we present an example of an XML script structuring it.

AB  - We model the presence of rare Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) in relation to the swarm characteristics of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). A combination of visual observations and recent advances in passive acoustic technology were used to locate Antarctic blue whales, whilst simultaneously using active underwater acoustics to characterise the distribution, size, depth, composition and density of krill swarms. Krill swarm characteristics and blue whale presence were examined at a range of spatiotemporal scales to investigate sub meso-scale (i.e., <100 km) foraging behaviour. Results suggest that at all scales, Antarctic blue whales are more likely to be detected within the vicinity of krill swarms with a higher density of krill, those found shallower in the water column, and those of greater vertical height. These findings support hypotheses that as lunge-feeders of extreme size, Antarctic blue whales target shallow, dense krill swarms to maximise their energy intake. As both Antarctic krill and blue whales play a key role in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the nature of their predator-prey dynamics is an important consideration, not only for the recovery of this endangered species in a changing environment, but for the future management of Antarctic krill fisheries.

AB  - The passive acoustic monitoring of cetaceans is a research method that can provide unique information on the animal's behaviour since the animals can be studied at great depths and at a long-range without interference. Nevertheless, the real-time data collection, transfer, and analysis using these techniques are difficult to implement and maintain. In this paper, a review of several experiments that have used this approach will be provided. The first class of detectors consists of hydrophone systems housed under buoys on the sea surface with wireless data transmission, while the second type comprises several acoustic detector networks integrated within submarine neutrino telescopes cabled to the shore.

AB  - The number of migrating fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) appears to be increasing in the Pacific Arctic after changes in the marine ecosystem and recovering from depletion by commercial whaling. Fin whale songs are sequences of sounds produced repeatedly, and they may be used for population structure assessments. However, little is known about song types and population structures in the Pacific Arctic. We recorded fin whale songs using a fixed passive acoustic monitoring system from July 2012 to June 2015 in the southern Chukchi Sea. We randomly selected one hour of data from each week of the study period and measured the inter-pulse intervals (IPIs) of the songs. Songs were detected from August to November 2012-2014. All songs had a sequence of doublets with two IPIs (10.5 and 19.6 s), and they were similar to previously reported songs of whales from the eastern North Pacific in 2001-2013 but differed from those of whales from the Bering Sea and northeastern Chukchi Sea in 2007-2010. These results suggest that one group of fin whales migrated to the southern Chukchi Sea from the eastern North Pacific in 2012-2014, or the song changed. Comparing songs from different areas of the Pacific Arctic during the same years will reveal whether this group dispersed in this area.

CP  - International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing
AB  - This paper focuses on the robust indexing of sperm whale hydrophone recordings based on a set of features extracted from a real-time passive underwater acoustic tracking algorithm for multiple emitting whales. In past years, interest in marine mammals has increased leading to the development of robust and real-time systems. Acoustic localization permits to study whales' behavior in deep water (several hundreds of meters) without interfering with the environment. In this paper, we recall and use a real-time multiple tracking algorithm recently developed, which provides a localization of one or several sperm whales. Given the position coordinates, we are able to analyse different features such as speed, energy of the clicks, Inter-Click-Interval (ICI)... These features allow us to construct different markers which lead to the indexing and structuring the audio files. Thus, the behavior study is facilitated choosing and accessing the corresponding index in the audio file. The complete indexing algorithm is processed on real data from the NUWC1 and the AUTEC(2). Our model is validated by similar results from the US Navy(3) and SOEST4 Hawaii university labs in a single whale case. Finally, as an illustration, we index a single whale sound file thanks to the extracted whale's features provided by the tracking, and we present an example of an XML script structuring it.

TI  - Non-song vocalizations of pygmy blue whales in Geographe Bay, Western Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA  - English
AB  - Non-song vocalizations of migrating pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) in Western Australia are described. Simultaneous land-based visual observations and underwater acoustic recordings detected 27 groups in Geographe Bay, WA over 2011 to 2012. Six different vocalizations were recorded that were not repeated in a pattern or in association with song, and thus were identified as non-song vocalizations. Five of these were not previously described for this population. Their acoustic characteristics and context are presented. Given that 56% of groups vocalized, 86% of which produced non-song vocalizations and 14% song units, the inclusion of non-song vocalizations in passive-acoustic monitoring is proposed.

AB  - The distribution and seasonal patterns of the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, inform management decisions that mitigate anthropogenic threats. Based on data from visual surveys, much of the population migrates between winter calving grounds in coastal waters adjacent to the southeast USA and summer feeding and nursery grounds adjacent to the northeast USA. However, little is known about right whale occurrence along the mid-Atlantic US migratory corridor. A better understanding of right whale occurrence in this region is needed prior to offshore wind energy development activities, which may increase mortality risks and chronic impacts on the population. We conducted an 11 mo passive acoustic survey along coastal North Carolina and Georgia near several wind energy areas to document the acoustic occurrence of right whales in the southern region of the mid-Atlantic US coast. Right whales were acoustically detected across all seasons, with peak seasonal presence occurring during autumn in the Georgia site and during winter in the North Carolina site. A secondary peak in presence also occurred during June and July in the Georgia site, when right whales were not expected to be in the area. Given the nearly year-round presence of right whales in the survey areas, these results may warrant an evaluation of current management protocols in order to provide adequate protection to the population in the face of offshore energy development activities.

AB  - Freshwater cetaceans are among the data deficient and now recognized as the most threatened group of marine mammals. Large scale studies are required to be done on an urgent basis to ensure reasonable chance of survival for these species. A detailed analysis of the freshwater habitats globally, indicate tropical shallow environment (important for the survival of the freshwater cetaceans). Visual surveys being employed for abundance estimates have significant limitations and acoustic surveys have recently been identified as effective alternative and could complement the visual surveys for conservation efforts. However, two major issues can be prominent such as shallow water sound propagation and noise pollutions. It is well known that shallow waters result in multiple interaction of the acoustic signal with the surface and the bottom prior to being received at the hydrophone receiver. The tropical waters further cause random surface and bottom behaviour resulting in substantial site specific underwater channel fluctuations being coupled to the desired marine mammal signal. Thus, the acoustic survey efforts in the tropical shallow habitats are highly sensitive to the local conditions and demand efforts to mitigate the underwater channel fluctuations while pursuing analysis efforts on the received signal. Increasing population in these regions has resulted in unregulated waterborne activities linked to economic growth. Such activities have caused significant increase in the ambient noise in these habitats. The effectiveness of acoustic sensors is further limited by the high ambient noise in the habitat and could also impact survival chances of these critically endangered species. This work attempts to put in perspective the challenges of acoustic surveys in tropical shallow habitats and provide a way ahead for effective passive acoustic monitoring of the freshwater cetaceans globally.

AB  - To evaluate the acoustic behavior of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) located inshore and offshore of southern California, singular A and B calls, D calls, and AB phrases were analyzed from 12 mo of passive acoustic data collected at four locations within the Southern California Bight. The relative proportions of singular calls and phrases were used to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in sound and song type usage, and singular call and phrase production rates were calculated to investigate spatial and temporal variability in call abundance. Blue whale sounds were recorded from spring through early winter, with the majority of all detections occurring between September and December. The proportions and production rates of singular calls and phrases varied between the inshore and offshore sites. In addition, the percentage of A units within repetitive song phrases was greater inshore than offshore, resulting from a higher proportion of AB song type inshore, in which A and B phrase units were alternating. The ABB song type, in which a single A unit was followed by multiple B units, was more common offshore. The observed differences in calling and singing behaviors may identify distinct and variable acoustic behavioral settings for blue whales off southern California.

AB  - Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are among the least studied of all the large mammals. This is especially true of Shepherd's beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi), which until recently had been very rarely sighted alive, with nothing known about the species' acoustic behaviour. Vocalisations of Shepherd's beaked whales were recorded using a hydrophone array on two separate days during marine mammal surveys of the Otago submarine canyons in New Zealand. After carefully screening the recordings, two distinct call types were found; broadband echolocation clicks, and burst pulses. Broadband echolocation clicks (n = 476) had a median inter-click-interval (ICI) of 0.46 s and median peak frequency of 19.2 kHz. The burst pulses (n = 33) had a median peak frequency of constituent clicks (n = 1741) of 14.7 kHz, and median ICI of 11 ms. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited bandwidth used to record the signals. To the authors' knowledge, this study presents the first analysis of the characteristics of Shepherd's beaked whale sounds. It will help with identification of the species in passive acoustic monitoring records, and future efforts to further analyse this species' vocalisations. (C) 2018 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) have group-specific call repertoires that can be used to track groups and populations using passive acoustic monitoring. To provide a detailed description of the Icelandic killer whale repertoire and its variation, we analyzed acoustic data collected in five locations between 1985 and 2016. Calls were classified manually, and CART and random forest analyses were employed to validate the manual classification. A total of 91 call categories (including call types and subtypes) were defined. Most call categories were recorded in more than one location, with the highest proportion shared between herring grounds in Vestmannaeyjar (South) and Breioafjorour (West). However, both locations included call categories that were not recorded elsewhere in Iceland. Recordings from past herring wintering grounds in eastern Iceland included few call categories that matched other locations. Sample sizes from Reykjanes (Southwest) and Skjalfandi (North) were small and did not include unique call categories. The relative occurrence of call categories in Vestmannaeyjar changed little over a 14-year period (2002-2016), although shorter-term changes between years were observed that appeared to correlate to changes in individuals identified. This comparison of acoustic repertoires provides valuable information on the social structure and movement patterns of herring-eating killer whales around Iceland.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of the global ocean has increased dramatically over the last decade, providing insights into seasonal sea ice and wind/wave variability, biodiversity, geophysical hazards, and anthropogenic noise impacts. All of these phenomena are sentinels of marine ecosystem health and ocean climate change. Recognizing the utility of underwater sound, the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) formed a passive acoustic research program with the goal of quantifying deep-ocean and coastal soundscapes in support of NOAA's mission to conserve and manage marine ecosystems. PMEL Acoustics Program researchers have built a stable of novel ocean technologies, including autonomous stationary hydrophones, mobile platforms, and near-real-time surface buoys with satellite communication capability. These passive acoustic monitoring systems have been deployed in every major ocean basin on Earth, enabling significant advancements in understanding of natural and anthropogenic sounds. This progress includes evaluation of human-made sound levels across US waters, observations of ship noise fluctuations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluation of noise levels from offshore wave-energy devices. Progress in natural sound research includes assessment of seasonal variability in the presence of endangered cetacean species due to population recovery and/or changing ocean temperatures as well as early detection of the collapse of an Antarctic ice shelf.

AB  - Passive acoustics allow us to study large animals and obtain information that could not be gathered through other methods. In this paper we study a set of near-field audiovisual recordings of a sperm whale pod, acquired with a ultra high-frequency and small aperture antenna. We propose a novel kind of autoencoder, a Stereo-Autoencoder, and show how it allows to build acoustic manifolds in order to increase our knowledge regarding the characterization of their vocalizations, and possible acoustic individual signature.

AB  - Since passive acoustic monitoring is widely used, unidentified acoustic signals from marine mammals are commonly reported. The signal characteristics and emission patterns are the main clues to identify the possible sources. In this study, the authors describe two previously unidentified sounds, recorded at up to five widely-spaced sites (30 x 30 degree area) in the southern Indian Ocean, in 2007 and between 2010 and 2015. The first reported signal (M-call) consists of a single tonal unit near 22 Hz and lasting about 10 s, repeated with an interval longer than 2 min. This signal is only detected in 2007. The second signal (P-call) is also a tonal unit of 10 s, repeated every 160 s, but at a frequency near 27 Hz. Its yearly number increased greatly between 2007 and 2010, and moderately since then. Based on their characteristics and seasonal patterns, this study shows that both signals are clearly distinct from any known calls of blue whale subspecies and populations dwelling in the southern Indian Ocean. However, they display similarities with blue whale vocalizations. More particularly, the P-call can be mistaken for the first tonal unit of the Antarctic blue whale Z-call.

AB  - This paper reports on the diving behavior of a sperm whale tagged and tracked on September 6, 2000 during the Sirena 2000 cruise in the Ligurian Sea. A total of about 4.5 h of acoustic and nonacoustic sensor data were recorded when a sperm whale was tagged with a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution developed tag with a hydrophone, motion, and pressure sensors.' The animal was simultaneously tracked with a passive sonar system deployed from the NATO research vessel NRV Alliance. By combining data from the tag and passive sonar, we were able to reconstruct a three-dimensional track of the whale, along with its orientation and vocal behavior. While it was tagged, the whale carried out three deep dives to a depth of about 900 in in an area with a bottom depth of about 2600 in. The inter-click intervals of the diving whale were not consistent with ranging on the bottom, but were consistent the hypothesis that the whale was possibly echolocating on some target(s) near the depth at which it dove to feed. This study demonstrated an ability to track subtle changes in the behavior of diving whales. This ability is important for three areas: 1) basic research, 2) studies of the responses of these animals to controlled exposures of manmade noise, and 3) studies to infer the biological significance of behavioral disruption.

AB  - Although sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) are distributed throughout the globe, their behaviour and vocal repertoire are poorly described. We used passive acoustic monitoring to describe the vocal behaviour of sei whales in the Falkland Islands, between December 2018 and April 2019. We isolated more than 2000 low-frequency calls for manual classification, of which 510 calls with high signal-to-noise ratio were quantitatively measured. Five categories of stereotyped call types in the 15-230 Hz range were described, some with multiple subcategories. These included some similar to previously described calls (e.g. downsweeps), but others that were novel in acoustic structure and frequency band. In the mid-frequency range, we documented a highly stereotyped, hierarchically structured and rhythmically repetitive song display. Songs were arranged in phrases with a structure composed of repetitive sub-phrases, and a diverse variety of sounds in the 1-5 kHz range. Singing commenced in late February, despite the presence of whales and calls since early December, and continued through April. These acoustic properties and behavioural characteristics indicate that this is likely a male breeding display similar to songs and singing of other balaenopterids. This is the first detailed description of a song display for sei whales, highlighting the importance of the Falkland Islands.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is commonly utilized to monitor cetacean species' distribution, abundance, and behavior. The demand for automated methods to detect and extract cetacean vocalizations from acoustic data has increased in the last few decades. Automatic whistle extraction of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin (IPBD) and other whistle-producing delphinids habitating in the coastal areas represents a challenging problem due to the high ambient noise, including ship noise snapping shrimp at the same habitat. The acoustic signal containing snapping shrimp sound was usually excluded during the development of the detection method. A robust tool of bioacoustics for snapping shrimp sound is still lacking. This study trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for semantic segmentation, initially developed for autonomous driving, to extract the whistle contour from spectrogram at a pixel level. A total of 1600 datasets was annotated for training and testing. As a result, the semantic segmentation classified the whistle with an overall mean Precision of 0.96, Accuracy of 0.89, and F-score of 0.86. In particular, the semantic segmentation extracted the whistle even if associated with a rich snapping shrimp sound, which the conventional method is incapable of. The advancement of metrics presented in this paper will enable long-term assessment of the IPBD population and individual or group tracking.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring allows the assessment of marine mammal occurrence and distribution at greater temporal and spatial scales than is now possible with traditional visual surveys. However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

AB  - Understanding habitat use patterns of animal populations across space and time is fundamental to identifying ecological requirements, and informing threat mitigation and conservation strategies. Persistent data gaps tend to occur with cryptic species in difficult-to-access environments, where the use of appropriate monitoring tools is indispensable for detection. Three populations of threatened and endangered killer whales occur year-round in waters off British Columbia, Canada; however, their winter habitat use patterns are not well known. Here we quantify wintertime use of the northern Strait of Georgia by these sympatric killer whale populations, revealing the importance of this previously understudied region. Using a network of passive acoustic monitoring devices deployed over three winter periods, we examine site-specific and regional patterns of occurrence of Bigg's, and Southern and Northern Resident killer whales. All three populations frequented these waters in nearly every month from November to April, and across all study years. Bigg's killer whales were detected most frequently, followed by Southern Residents, then Northern Residents. Population-specific differences in site use was apparent, with Southern Resident detections occurring more often than expected off the southwest side of Texada Island, while Northern Residents appeared to favor the east side of Texada Island. Remarkably, the patterns of winter use we observe in this region by Resident killer whale populations have seemingly persisted for at least 50 years. Additionally, we evaluate and discuss the effect of using multiple simultaneous recorders to characterize habitat use patterns. Lastly, we present a data-driven approach for estimating acoustic residence time, describe inter-population differences in winter residency in the northern Strait of Georgia, and discuss implications for critical habitat designation. This study fills important knowledge gaps related to killer whale winter occurrence off western Canada, highlighting the significance of the northern Strait of Georgia for these at-risk populations.

AB  - Migratory species undertake seasonal, long-distance travel between feeding and breeding grounds, and time their arrivals with high-quality resources. The Breeding Stock D population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrates from Antarctic to Western Australian waters every austral winter. Based on 16 years (2002-2017) of passive acoustic recordings in the Perth Canyon, Western Australia, the hourly presence/absence of humpback whale vocalizations was used as an indicator of inter-annual changes in migration timing. A trend of earlier arrivals in the Perth Canyon by 1.4 days/year during the northward migration and possibly earlier departures from the Perth Canyon during the southward migration was observed. A distance-based linear model and a generalized linear model (GLM) both identified sea surface temperature (SST) as the most significant predictor for acoustic presence in the Perth Canyon. A 1 degrees C increase in SST corresponded to a decrease in humpback whale acoustic presence by 4.4 hours/day. Mean SST at the peak of the humpback whale season in the Perth Canyon was 19 degrees C. Exploratory analysis of the metocean environment of the Antarctic feeding grounds suggested that whales were leaving the Antarctic at the end of the austral summer, as sea ice concentration (SIC) increased and SST decreased. Further research should investigate whether changes in the metocean conditions on Australian breeding grounds correspond to changing departures from the Perth Canyon during the southward migration. If environmental conditions on breeding and feeding grounds change out-of-sync, migrating whales might be unable to arrive at either ground during optimal conditions.

AB  - Climate-driven changes are affecting sea ice conditions off Tasiilaq, Southeast Greenland, with implications for marine mammal distributions. Knowledge about marine mammal presence, biodiversity, and community composition is key to effective conservation and management but is lacking, especially during winter months. Seasonal patterns of acoustic marine mammal presence were investigated relative to sea ice concentration at two recording sites between 2014 and 2018, with one (65.6 & DEG;N, 37.4 & DEG;W) or three years (65.5 & DEG;N, 38.0 & DEG;W) of passive acoustic recordings. Seven marine mammal species were recorded. Bearded seals were acoustically dominant during winter and spring, whereas sperm, humpback, and fin whales dominated during the sea ice-free summer and autumn. Narwhals, bowhead, and killer whales were recorded only rarely. Song-fragments of humpback whales and acoustic presence of fin whales in winter suggest mating-associated behavior taking place in the area. Ambient noise levels in 1/3-octave level bands (20, 63, 125, 500, 1000, and 4000 Hz), ranged between 75.6 to 105 dB re 1 mu Pa. This study provides multi-year insights into the coastal marine mammal community composition off Southeast Greenland and suggests that the Tasiilaq area provides suitable habitat for various marine mammal species year-round.

AB  - Many organizations collect large passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data sets that need to be efficiently and reliably analyzed. To determine appropriate methods for effective analysis of big PAM data sets, we undertook a literature review of baleen whale PAM analysis methods. Methodologies from 166 studies (published between 2000-2019) were summarized, and a detailed review was performed on the 94 studies that recorded more than 1,000 hr of acoustic data ("big data"). Analysis techniques for extracting baleen whale information from PAM data sets varied depending on the research observed. A spectrum of methodologies was used and ranged from manual analysis of all acoustic data by human experts to completely automated techniques with no manual validation. Based on this assessment, recommendations are provided to encourage robust research methods that are comparable across studies and sectors, achievable across research groups, and consistent with previous work. These include using automated techniques when possible to increase efficiency and repeatability, supplementing automation with manual review to calculate automated detector performance, and increasing consistency in terminology and presentation of results. This work can be used to facilitate discussion for minimum standards and best practices to be implemented in the field of marine mammal PAM.

AB  - Most studies on tonal sounds extract contour parameters from fundamental frequencies. The presence of harmonics and the frequency distribution of multiple tonal sounds have not been well researched. To investigate the occurrence and frequency modulation of cetacean tonal sounds, the procedure of detecting the instantaneous frequency bandwidth of tonal spectral peaks was integrated within the local-max detector to extract adopted frequencies. The adopted frequencies, considered the representative frequencies of tonal sounds, are used to find the presence of harmonics and overlapping tonal sounds. The utility and detection performance are demonstrated on acoustic recordings of five species from two databases. The recordings of humpback dolphins showed a 75% detection rate with a 5% false detection rate, and recordings from the MobySound archive showed an 85% detection rate with a 5% false detection rate. These detections were achieved in signal-to-noise ratios of -12 to 21 dB. The parameters that measured the distribution of adopted frequency, as well as the prominence of harmonics and overlaps, indicate that the modulation of tonal sounds varied among different species and behaviors. This algorithm can be applied to studies on cetacean communication signals and long-term passive acoustic monitoring. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - During dedicated surveys for the Critically Endangered eastern stock of North Pacific right whales Eubalaena japonica (NPRW) in the Bering Sea, focal follows (FFs) were combined with passive acoustic monitoring to correlate vocal activity with dive behavior. During FFs, impulsive gunshot calls (hereafter 'gunshots'), similar to those produced by other right whale populations, were localized to male and female NPRWs. The timing of gunshots correlated strongly with diving behavior observed during the FFs. Log survivorship analysis of inter-blow intervals showed a bout criterion interval of 40 s, separating the data into shorter surfacings and longer dives. For both, gunshots were skewed closer to the end of the sequence (modal gunshot to blow times: 5 s for dives, 7 s for surfacings) than the beginning (modal blow to gunshot times: 22 s for dives, 13 s for surfacings). Gunshots were more commonly produced during dives than surfacings. Mean gunshot calling rate during FFs was 133.0 calls h(-1) (range: 38.9-425.0). Other NPRW calls, including upcalls, the predominant call used to identify right whales acoustically, were not detected during the FFs. To determine comparative call detection rates, an additional 180 h of non-FF recordings were analyzed. Gunshots were detected similar to 50 times more frequently than upcalls (mean: 228.3 vs. 4.3 calls h(-1), respectively), with a maximum gunshot calling rate of 835.7 calls h(-1). This is the first study to definitively attribute gunshots to NPRW, and demonstrates the importance of including gunshots in passive acoustic studies, which will greatly increase NPRW detectability while supporting more accurate determinations of their spatio-temporal distribution.

AB  - Using passive acoustic methods for biodiversity conservation and effective ecosystem monitoring is hindered by laborious, human-mediated processes of accurately identifying biologic and anthropogenic sounds within large datasets. Soundscape ecology provides a potential means of addressing this need through the use of automated acoustic-based biodiversity indices, which show promise in representing biodiversity in terrestrial environments. However, the direct relationship between specific underwater sounds and acoustic index measurements are largely unexplored. Using passive acoustic data collected from three broadband hydrophones within the Ocean Observatories Initiative's cabled arrays in the Pacific northwest, we identified periods of vocalizing marine mammals and sources of anthropogenic noise. Automated calculations of seven acoustic indices were compared across biologic and anthropogenic sound type and call parameters. Although several index measurements did not vary significantly, the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) measurements increased in response to echolocation clicks from sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and burst pulses originating from unidentified delphinid species. Measurements of the Bioacoustic Index (BI) decreased dramatically in response to sperm whale echolocation clicks, a more obvious trend when loud clicks were parsed from moderate and quiet clicks. Correlations coefficient and confidence interval values between ACI and BI measurements and call characteristics from sperm whales indicate a moderate to strong relationship, which was not found in correlations with delphinid calls. A generalized linear mixed-effect model indicated multiple species and sound types contribute significantly to the variation of several index measurements. Noise generated by passing ships consistently resulted in decreased values for the Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) and Total Entropy (H) as compared to quiet periods and periods with vocalizing marine mammals. These findings provide information on the relationship between several acoustic indices and specific underwater sounds produced by marine mammals and anthropogenic sources. This ground-truthing endeavor expands the understanding of acoustic indices and their potential use as a tool for conservation and ecosystem health management purposes.

AB  - Oceans across the globe are warming rapidly and marine ecosystems are changing as a result. However, there is a lack of information regarding how blue whales are responding to these changing environments, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. This is because long term data are needed to determine whether blue whales respond to variability in environmental conditions. Using over 16 years of passive acoustic data recorded at Cape Leeuwin, we investigated whether oceanic environmental drivers are correlated with the migration patterns of eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) pygmy blue whales off Western Australia. To determine which environmental variables may influence migration patterns, we modelled the number of acoustic call detections of EIO pygmy blue whale calls with broad and fine scale environmental variables. We found a positive correlation between total annual whale call detections and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), with more whale calls detected during La Nina years. We also found that monthly whale call detections correlated with sea surface height around the hydrophone and chlorophyll-a concentration at a prominent blue whale feeding aggregation area (Bonney Upwelling) where whales feed during the summer before migrating up the west Australian coast. At the interannual scale, ENSO had a stronger relationship with call detections than IOD. During La Nina years, up to ten times more EIO pygmy blue whale calls were detected than in neutral or El Nino years. This is likely linked to changes in productivity in the feeding areas of the Great Australian Bight and Indian Ocean. We propose that in lower productivity years whales either skipped migration or altered their habitat use and moved further offshore from the hydrophones and therefore were not detected. The frequency and intensity of ENSO events are predicted to increase with climate change, which is likely to impact the productivity of the areas used by blue whales. These changes in productivity may affect the physical condition and reproductive success of individual whales. A reduction in reproductive success could have a significant impact on blue whale recovery from historical whaling and their ability to adapt to a changing environment.

AB  - The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/CE) aims to achieve and maintain the 'good environmental status' (GES) of marine ecosystems, including the assessment of marine mammal populations. However, assessing their abundance and distribution is challenging due to their mobility, elusiveness, and difficult data acquisition. This article highlights the role of passive acoustic monitoring as a complementary approach to traditional methods (mainly plane and boat surveys). It also presents the conclusions and perspectives of a workshop organized at the 34th conference of the European Cetacean Society in O'Grove, Spain (18th to 20th April 2023). Building on the rich foundation established by the European Cetacean Society (ECS) in 1987, this society plays a pivotal role in advancing marine mammal research and conservation efforts across European waters. The workshop emphasized the need for harmonization of protocols, indicators, and guidelines to ensure comparability of results. The establishment of a dedicated European working group was proposed to coordinate passive acoustic monitoring efforts, foster collaboration, and share best practices. The workshop concluded that the consolidation of scientific knowledge, the development of common guidelines, and the establishment of a transnational working group would improve the understanding and conservation of these vulnerable species and their habitats.

AB  - Real recordings of bowhead whale signals and numerical simulation were used to investigate the propagation of such signals in an Arctic-type shallow-water waveguide. The authors analyzed attenuation and distortion of whale signals with increasing distance in the following conditions: (1) a soft and hard bottom, (2) different whale depths, (3) surface waves, (4) additive noise, and (5) reception by a single hydrophone and a vertical array. Signal attenuation was estimated by the change in sound pressure level (SPL). Signal distortion was estimated by the change in the correlation coefficient for the spectrograms of received signals and the reference spectrograms. It is shown that, compared to signals from a single receiver, the attenuation and distortion characteristics of the array output signals are more stable and resistant to changes in whale depth, to possible, under Arctic conditions, significant variations in sound speed in the bottom along the acoustic path, and to the effects of additive noise. The results can be used for passive monitoring of bowhead whales on the Arctic shelf.

AB  - This paper describes the natural variability of ambient sound in the Southern Ocean, an acoustically pristine marine mammal habitat. Over a 3-year period, two autonomous recorders were moored along the Greenwich meridian to collect underwater passive acoustic data. Ambient sound levels were strongly affected by the annual variation of the sea-ice cover, which decouples local wind speed and sound levels during austral winter. With increasing sea-ice concentration, area and thickness, sound levels decreased while the contribution of distant sources increased. Marine mammal sounds formed a substantial part of the overall acoustic environment, comprising calls produced by Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx). The combined sound energy of a group or population vocalizing during extended periods contributed species-specific peaks to the ambient sound spectra. The temporal and spatial variation in the contribution of marine mammals to ambient sound suggests annual patterns in migration and behaviour. The Antarctic blue and fin whale contributions were loudest in austral autumn, whereas the Antarctic minke whale contribution was loudest during austral winter and repeatedly showed a diel pattern that coincided with the diel vertical migration of zooplankton.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is the method of choice to detect whales and dolphins that are acoustically active and to monitor their underwater behavior. The NATO Science and Technology Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation has recently implemented a compact passive acoustic monitor (CPAM), consisting of three arrays of two hydrophones each that are combined in a fixed three-dimensional arrangement and that may be towed at depths of more than 100m. With its volumetric configuration, the CPAM is capable of estimating the three-dimensional direction vector of arriving sounds and under certain conditions on relative geometry between the whale and hydrophone array, the CPAM may also estimate the range to echolocating animals. Basic ranging methods assume constant sound speed and apply straightforward geometry to obtain depth and distance to the sound source. Alternatively, ray-tracing based methods may be employed to integrate the information provided by real sound speed profiles. Both ranging methods combine measurements of sound arrival angles and surface reflection delays and are easily implemented in real-time applications, whereby one could promote the ray-tracing approach as the preferred method because it may integrate real sound speed profiles.

AB  - Passive acoustic surveys were conducted to assess the vocal behavior of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the designated critical calving habitat along the shallow coastal waters of southeastern United States. Underwater vocalizations were recorded using autonomous buoys deployed in close proximity to surface active groups (SAGs). Nine main vocalization types were identified with manual inspection of spectrograms, and standard acoustic descriptors were extracted. Classification trees were used to examine the distinguishing characteristics of calls and quantify their variability within the SAG vocal repertoire. The results show that descriptors of frequency, bandwidth, and spectral disorder are the most important parameters for partitioning the SAG repertoire, contrary to duration-related measures. The reported source levels and vocalization statistics provide sound production data vital to inform regional passive acoustic monitoring and conservation for this endangered species.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are known to utilize Massachusetts Bay as a feeding ground in the spring and summer, during the annual migration of the Gulf of Maine sub-population. However, there is a limited understanding of the pattern of humpback whale occurrence in this region outside of the feeding period. Passive acoustic monitoring of Massachusetts Bay over a two-year period, revealed an extended presence of acoustically active humpback whales throughout a majority of the study period (87%; 633 days of presence out of 725 days of acoustic monitoring). Humpback whale presence oscillated between lengthy periods of consistent presence (April to December) and relatively shorter periods of variable presence (December to March). Seasonal variation in presence was evident during three distinct phases: (1) maximum-presence from spring to early winter; (2) variable-presence in early winter and early spring; and (3) minimum-presence mid-winter. The variation in seasonal presence was concurrent with coarse migratory patterns of humpback whales, and yearly variations in presence presumably reflect a shift in the influx and efflux of whales between years. The extended presence of humpbacks in this area suggests that Massachusetts Bay is an important, year-round habitat for the Gulf of Maine sub-population, and may warrant revision of management and regulatory practices to reflect this presence.

AB  - Bycatch is a significant cause of population declines of marine megafauna globally. While numerous bycatch mitigation strategies exist, acoustic alarms, or pingers, are the most widely adopted strategy for small cetaceans. Although pingers have been shown to be an effective measure for numerous species, there are some concerns about their long-term use. Bycatch is recognized as a persistent problem in waters around Cornwall, United Kingdom, where several cetacean species are resident, with harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) being the most-commonly sighted. In this study, we assessed the effects of a Banana Pinger (Fishtek Marine Limited) on harbour porpoises in Cornwall between August 2012 and March 2013. Two passive acoustic loggers (C-PODs; Chelonia Limited) were deployed 100 m apart to record cetacean activity during cycles of active and inactive pinger periods. Harbour porpoises were 37% less likely to be detected at the C-POD near the pinger when the pinger was active, while they were only 9% less likely to be detected 100 m further away. The effect of the pinger was constant over the study period at both C-PODs despite the temporal variation in harbour porpoise detections. In addition, we found no evidence of reduced pinger effect with changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, harbour porpoise detections at the C-POD near the pinger did not depend on the time elapsed since the pinger turned off, with harbour porpoises returning to the ensonified area with no delay. Together these results suggest that (1) harbour porpoises did not habituate to the pinger over an 8-month period, (2) the pinger effect is very localized, and (3) pinger use did not lead to harbour porpoise displacement over the study period, suggesting an absence of long-term behavioral effects. We suggest that the deployment of pingers on fishing nets would likely reduce net-porpoise interactions, thereby mitigating bycatch of harbour porpoises and potentially other cetacean species. As the small-scale fishery dominates in United Kingdom waters, there is an acute need for cost-effective mitigation strategies with concurrent monitoring to be implemented rapidly in order to address the problem of harbour porpoise, and more generally, cetacean bycatch.

AB  - We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) in the Arctic region. The Arctic region extends from the Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Amundsen Gulf, and Viscount Melville Sound. This NOAA-led effort uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, BIA II products incorporated a scoring and labeling system to improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support marine spatial planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for Arctic BIA II came from data derived from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite telemetry; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification; aboriginal subsistence harvests, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents; and prey studies. BIAs were identified for bowhead (Balaena mysticetus), gray (Eschrichtius robustus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales. In total, 44 BIAs were delineated and scored for the Arctic, including 12 reproduction, 24 feeding, and 8 migration BIAs. BIAs were identified in all months except January-March. Fifteen candidate areas did not have sufficient information to delineate as BIAs and were added to a watch list for future consideration in the BIA process. Some BIAs were transboundary between the Arctic region and the Aleutian Islands-Bering Sea region. Several BIAs were transnational, extending into territorial waters of Russia (in the Chukchi Sea) and Canada (in the Beaufort Sea), and a few BIAs were delineated in international waters.

AB  - A multinational oceanographic and acoustic sea experiment was carried out in the summer of 2014 off the western coast of the island of Sardinia, Mediterranean Sea. During this experiment, an underwater glider fitted with two hydrophones was evaluated as a potential tool for marine mammal population density estimation studies. An acoustic recording system was also tested, comprising an inexpensive, off-the-shelf digital recorder installed inside the glider. Detection and classification of sounds produced by whales and dolphins, and sometimes tracking and localization, are inherent components of population density estimation from passive acoustics recordings. In this work we discuss the equipment used as well as analysis of the data obtained, including detection and estimation of bearing angles. A human analyst identified the presence of sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) regular clicks as well as dolphin clicks and whistles. Cross-correlating clicks recorded on both data channels allowed for the estimation of the direction (bearing) of clicks, and realization of animal tracks. Insights from this bearing tracking analysis can aid in population density estimation studies by providing further information (bearings), which can improve estimates.

AB  - Deployment of long-term, continuously recording passive-acoustic sensors in the ocean can provide insights into sound sources related to ocean dynamics, air-sea interactions, and biologic and human activities, all which contribute to shaping ocean soundscapes. In the polar regions, the changing ocean climate likely contributes to seasonal and long-term variation in cryogenic sounds, adding to the complexity of these soundscapes. The Korea Polar Research Institute and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have jointly operated two arrays of autonomous underwater hydrophones in the Southern Ocean, one in the Terra Nova Bay Polynya (TNBP) during December 2015-January 2019 and the other in the Balleny Islands (BI) region during January 2015-March 2016, to monitor changes in ocean soundscapes. In the BI region, we found distinct seasonal variations in the cryogenic signals that were attributed to collisions and thermal/mechanical fracturing of the surface sea ice. This is consistent with sea-ice patterns due to annual freeze-thaw cycles, which are not clearly observed in TNBP, where frequent blowing out of sea ice by katabatic winds and icequakes from nearby ice shelves generate strong noise even in austral winters. Another advantage of passive acoustic recordings is that they provide opportunities to measure biodiversity from classifying spectral characteristics of marine mammals: we identified 1. Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx; 200-400 Hz), most abundant in the BI region and TNBP in December; 2. Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus; distinctive vocalization at 18 and 27 Hz), strong signals in austral winter and fall in the BI region and TNBP; 3. Fin whales (B. physalus; fundamental frequency in the 15-28 Hz and overtones at 80 and 90 Hz), maximum presence in the BI region during the austral summer and spring months; 4. Antarctic minke whales (B. bonaerensis; 100-200 Hz), strongest signals from June to August in the BI region; 5. Humpback whales in TNBP; 6. Unidentified whales (long-duration downsweeping from 75 to 62 Hz), detected in TNBP. Long-term soundscape monitoring can help understand the spatiotemporal changes in the Southern Ocean and cryosphere and provide a means of assessing the status and trends of biodiversity in the Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area.

AB  - Annual federal stock assessment surveys for Alaskan sablefish also attempt to measure sperm whale depredation by quantifying visual evidence of depredation, including lip remains and damaged fish. A complementary passive acoustic method for quantifying depredation was investigated during the 2011 and 2012 survey hauls. A combination of machine-aided and human analysis counted the number of distinct "creak" sounds detected on autonomous recorders deployed during the survey, emphasizing sounds that are followed by silence ("creak-pauses"), a possible indication of prey capture. These raw counts were then adjusted for variations in background noise levels between deployments. Both a randomized Pearson correlation analysis and a generalized linear model found that noise-adjusted counts of "creak-pauses" were highly correlated with survey counts of lip remains during both years (2012: r(10) = 0.89, p = 1e-3; 2011: r(39) = 0.72, p = 4e-3) and somewhat correlated with observed sablefish damage in 2011 [r(39) = 0.37, p = 0.03], but uncorrelated with other species depredation. The acoustic depredation count was anywhere from 10% to 80% higher than the visual counts, depending on the survey year and assumptions employed. The results suggest that passive acoustics can provide upper bounds on depredation rates; however, the observed correlation breaks down whenever three or more whales are present.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring has proven to be an indispensable tool for many aspects of baleen whale research. Manual detection of whale calls on these large data sets demands extensive manual labor. Automated whale call detectors offer a more efficient approach and have been developed for many species and call types. However, calls with a large level of variability such as fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 40 Hz call and blue whale (B. musculus) D call have been challenging to detect automatically and hence no practical automated detector exists for these two call types. Using a modular approach consisting of faster region-based convolutional neural network followed by a convolutional neural network, we have created automated detectors for 40 Hz calls and D calls. Both detectors were tested on recordings with high- and low density of calls and, when selecting for detections with high classification scores, they were shown to have precision ranging from 54% to 57% with recall ranging from 72% to 78% for 40 Hz and precision ranging from 62% to 64% with recall ranging from 70 to 73% for D calls. As these two call types are produced by both sexes, using them in long-term studies would remove sex-bias in estimates of temporal presence and movement patterns.

CP  - Complex Adaptive Systems Conference
AB  - This paper describes ongoing work to investigate the development of a complex system designed for extracting information from large acoustic datasets. The system, called DeLMA is based on integrating advanced machine learning with high performance computing (HPC). The goal of this work is to provide the capability to accurately detect and classify whale sounds in large acoustics datasets collected using underwater sensors. The case study for this work is focused on detecting the acoustic communication signals of the North Atlantic Right Whale, Eubalaena glacialis, and uses data collected in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS), USA. A summary of the work done for developing a complex detection-classification system and brief description of several algorithms that are used for classifying whale sounds will be covered. A brief discussion on how standard detection algorithms can be incorporated, with no special modifications, into the HPC system for analysis will be mentioned, and two new right whale detection methods are presented, based on continuous region analysis (CRA) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). This paper presents a first-hand look at applying the DeLMA system and these algorithms on a large dataset containing over 60,000 channel-hours of acoustic data from the SBNMS. Results from these new detection methods are compared against Baseline algorithms. With the development of the DeLMA system, sound archives can now be explored using a powerful distributed processing architecture. This advancement will allow for rapid execution and visualization of the data using seasonal graphs called diel plots, which show the distribution of detections on a time-of-day vs. time-of-year plane. Diel plots of Baseline, CRA and HOG algorithm results reveal various large-scale features of the seasonality of whale calling behavior. Results are summarized and the authors discuss future areas for study, especially those relate to handling other big passive acoustic data projects.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are highly vocal, producing a wide repertoire of sounds often organised into song. Song is prolific at breeding sites but also documented along migration routes and at feeding sites, including along the west coast of South Africa (28 degrees-34 degrees S). Here we examine the occurrence of humpback whale song within False Bay, South Africa, using intermittent recording periods from moored hydrophones spanning September 2016 to January 2018. Recordings from four locations were scrutinised for humpback whale vocalisations using long-term spectral averages (LTSAs). In total, 7205 h were examined, with song identified in 3% (211 h) of recording hours. Song was exclusively documented in September and October 2016 and was more prevalent at the most westerly sites. Diel patterns of song presence were modelled, showing the likelihood of detection was higher in the early morning and late evening (GAM: p < 0.05). On 15 occasions, two or more singers were detected with temporally overlapping song components. These results indicate prevalent, albeit seasonal, song production by humpback whales off the coast of South Africa and highlight the utility of passive acoustic monitoring to indicate their presence, behaviour, and potential population linkages in the region.

AB  - The endangered beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) population in Cook Inlet, AK faces threats from a variety of anthropogenic factors, including coastal development, oil and gas exploration, vessel traffic, and military activities. To address existing gaps in understanding about the occurrence of belugas in Cook Inlet, a project was developed to use passive acoustic monitoring to document the year-round distribution of belugas, as well as killer whales (Orcinus orca), which prey on belugas. Beginning in June 2009, ten moorings were deployed throughout the Inlet and refurbished every two to eight months. Despite challenging conditions consisting of strong tidal currents carrying debris and seasonal ice cover, 83% of mooring deployments were successfully recovered. Noise from water flow, vessel traffic, and/or industrial activities was present at several sites, potentially masking some signals. However, belugas were successfully detected at multiple locations. Detections were relatively common in the upper inlet and less common or absent at middle and lower inlet locations. Killer whale signals were also recorded. Some seasonal variability in the occurrence of both belugas and killer whales was evident. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Understanding species distribution and behavior is essential for conservation programs of migratory species with recovering populations. The critically endangered Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) was heavily exploited during the whaling era. Because of their low numbers, highly migratory behavior, and occurrence in remote areas, their distribution and range are not fully understood, particularly in the southwest Pacific Ocean. This is the first Antarctic blue whale study covering the southwest Pacific Ocean region from temperate to tropical waters (32 degrees S to 15 degrees S). Passive acoustic data were recorded between 2010 and 2011 across the southwest Pacific (SWPO) and southeast Indian (SEIO) oceans. We detected Antarctic blue whale calls in previously undocumented SWPO locations off eastern Australia (32 degrees S, 152 degrees E) and within the Lau Basin (20 degrees S, 176 degrees W and 15 degrees S, 173 degrees W), and SEIO off northwest Australia (19 degrees S, 115 degrees E).In temperate waters, adjacent ocean basins had similar seasonal occurrence, in that calling Antarctic blue whales were present for long periods, almost year round in some areas. In northern tropical waters, calling whales were mostly present during the austral winter. Clarifying the occurrence and distribution of critically endangered species is fundamental for monitoring population recovery, marine protected area planning, and in mitigating anthropogenic threats.

AB  - We present an analysis of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) songs on passive acoustic recordings from the Pelagos Sanctuary (Western Mediterranean Basin). The recordings were gathered between 2008 and 2018 using 2 different hydrophone stations. We show how 20 Hz fin whale pulses can be automatically detected using a low complexity convolutional neural network (CNN) despite data variability (different recording devices exposed to diverse noises). The pulses were further classified into the two categories described in past studies and inter pulse intervals (IPI) were measured. The results confirm previous observations on the local relationship between pulse type and IPI with substantially more data. Furthermore we show inter-annual shifts in IPI and an intra-annual trend in pulse center frequency. This study provides new elements of comparison for the understanding of long term fin whale song trends worldwide.

AB  - The occurrence of typical inter-click intervals (ICIs) is considered for the analysis of marine mammals signals. A new framework for passive acoustic monitoring is introduced based on ICI information retrieved from ocean acoustic data. The proposed scheme involves extraction of plausible click trains consist of echolocation clicks from various annotated data of marine mammals; here we investigate sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), and killer whale (Orcinus orca). Then a preliminary investigation on the analysis of the proposed ICI-based parameters is carried out. In order to characterize the biological clicks, some distinct information of ICI are derived from the click trains, which are extracted from the phase slope functions of the signals. The experimental results obtained from real-recorded ocean data reveal that the proposed ICI-based scheme can be a useful tool for monitoring various types of marine mammal vocalizations.

AB  - Increasing sound in the ocean from human activity potentially threatens marine animals that use sound to communicate, detect prey, avoid predators and function within their ecosystem. The detection and classification of sound produced by marine animals, such as whales and fish, is an important component in noise mitigation strategies, while also providing valuable insights into their ecology. Traditionally, visual surveys are conducted to assess how these animals utilize a specific area, often underestimating the number of individuals as they don't spend much time at the surface. Long-term passive acoustic monitoring efforts have become more prevalent to monitor such animals. The large datasets collected can be impractical to manually process, necessitating the development of automated detection methods, which often produce mixed results owing to the broad frequency range and variable duration of many biological sounds. Here we describe a novel approach for automated detection of underwater biophonic sounds employing hidden Markov models (HMM). Acoustic data was collected at a single listening station in Hauraki Gulf, from October 2014 to April 2016. HMM detection models were developed for Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) that were used as a model organism because they are notoriously hard to study with traditional visual surveys and produce a characteristic call. Bryde's whale calls also directly overlap the sounds of anthropogenic activity, in particular the sound of vessels transiting to the busiest port in New Zealand; therefore monitoring whale calls is of utmost importance when confronting increasing sound in the ocean. Vocalizations were detected with a sensitivity of 77% and false positive rate of 23%. Bryde's whale vocalizations were detected on 11% of all recordings. Overall, there were significantly more detections during summer (n = 1716) than winter (n = 447), and significantly more during the day (n = 1991) compared to night (n = 1264). This study shows the feasibility of using HMMs on long-term acoustic datasets. The method has the potential to be used for a wide range of soniferous animals who, like the Bryde's whale, also produce unique sounds. The detection method would be particularly useful for mitigation and management strategies of species that are difficult to detect using traditional visual methods.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammal calls is an increasingly important method for assessing population numbers, distribution, and behavior. A common mistake in the analysis of marine mammal acoustic data is formulating conclusions about these animals without first understanding how environmental properties such as bathymetry, sediment properties, water column sound speed, and ocean acoustic noise influence the detection and character of vocalizations in the acoustic data. The approach in this paper is to use Monte Carlo simulations with a full wave field acoustic propagation model to characterize the site specific probability of detection of six types of humpback whale calls at three passive acoustic monitoring locations off the California coast. Results show that the probability of detection can vary by factors greater than ten when comparing detections across locations, or comparing detections at the same location over time, due to environmental effects. Effects of uncertainties in the inputs to the propagation model are also quantified, and the model accuracy is assessed by comparing calling statistics amassed from 24 690 humpback units recorded in the month of October 2008. Under certain conditions, the probability of detection can be estimated with uncertainties sufficiently small to allow for accurate density estimates. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - A large variety of sound sources in the ocean, including biological, geophysical, and man-made, can be simultaneously monitored over instantaneous continental-shelf scale regions via the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) technique by employing a large-aperture densely-populated coherent hydrophone array system. Millions of acoustic signals received on the POAWRS system per day can make it challenging to identify individual sound sources. An automated classification system is necessary to enable sound sources to be recognized. Here, the objectives are to (i) gather a large training and test data set of fin whale vocalization and other acoustic signal detections; (ii) build multiple fin whale vocalization classifiers, including a logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network; (iii) evaluate and compare performance of these classifiers using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score; and (iv) integrate one of the classifiers into the existing POAWRS array and signal processing software. The findings presented here will (1) provide an automatic classifier for near real-time fin whale vocalization detection and recognition, useful in marine mammal monitoring applications; and (2) lay the foundation for building an automatic classifier applied for near real-time detection and recognition of a wide variety of biological, geophysical, and man-made sound sources typically detected by the POAWRS system in the ocean.

AB  - Monitoring blue and fin whales summering in the St. Lawrence Estuary with passive acoustics requires call recognition algorithms that can cope with the heavy shipping noise of the St. Lawrence Seaway and with multipath propagation characteristics that generate overlapping copies of the calls. In this paper, the performance of three time-frequency methods aiming at such automatic detection and classification is tested on more than 2000 calls and compared at several levels of signal-to-noise ratio using typical recordings collected in this area. For all methods, image processing techniques are used to reduce the noise in the spectrogram. The first approach consists in matching the spectrogram with binary time-frequency templates of the calls (coincidence of spectrograms). The second approach is based on the extraction of the frequency contours of the calls and their classification using dynamic time warping (DTW) and the vector quantization (VQ) algorithms. The coincidence of spectrograms was the fastest method and performed better for blue whale A and B calls. VQ detected more 20 Hz fin whale calls but with a higher false alarm rate. DTW and VQ outperformed for the more variable blue whale D calls.

AB  - Until the 1990s, beaked whales were one of the least understood groups of large mammals. Information on northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus) and Baird's beaked whales (Berardius bairdii) was available from data collected during whaling, however, little information existed on the smaller species other than occasional data gleaned from beach-cast animals. Recent research advances have been plentiful. Increasing global survey effort, together with morphometric and genetic analyses have shown at least 22 species in this group. Longitudinal field studies of at least four species (H. ampullatus, B. bairdii, Ziphius cavirostris, Mesoplodon densirostris) have become established over the last three decades. Several long-term studies support photo-identification catalogs providing insights into life history, social structure and population size. Tag-based efforts looking at diving, movements and acoustics have provided detail on individual behavior as well as population structure and ranges. Passive acoustic monitoring has allowed long-term and seasonal monitoring of populations. Genetic studies have uncovered cryptic species and revealed contrasting patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity amongst the few species examined. Conservation concern for these species was sparked by mass strandings coincident with military mid-frequency sonar use. Fat and gas emboli have been symptomatic indicators of mortalities related to sonar exposure, suggesting that their vulnerability stems from the physiological exertion of extreme diving for medium-sized whales. Behavioral response experiments have now shown that beaked whales appear to cease foraging and delay their return to foraging and/or leave the area in association with exposure to mid-frequency signals at low acoustic levels. Future priorities for these species will be to (1) continue field-studies to better understand smaller-scale habitat use, vital rates and social structure; (2) develop better detection methods for larger-scale survey work; (3) improve methodology for monitoring energetics, individual body condition and health; (4) develop tools to better understand physiology; (5) use recent genetic advances with improved sample databanks to re-examine global and local beaked whale relationships; (6) further quantify anthropogenic impacts (both sonar and other noise) and their population consequences (7) apply acquired data for realistic mitigation of sonar and other anthropogenic impacts for beaked whale conservation.

AB  - The Istanbul Strait (Bosphorus) is a part of the Turkish Straits System, connecting the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. There are three cetacean species in the Strait, namely the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), and the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). To monitor the presence of the cetaceans, a fixed stereo passive acoustic monitoring system (A-tag) was deployed in the middle of the Strait from July 2009 to September 2010. In total 26,814 click trains were detected. Presence, direction and inter-click intervals of phonating cetaceans were measured. Most click trains were detected during the night time. Diel presence pattern was prominent in March and April. In spring, the cetaceans were concentrated in one specific direction from the fixed monitoring system. In contrast, they were found in all directions for the rest of the year. Short range sonar (inter-click intervals (ICIs) less than 50 ms) was commonly detected in spring. During the rest of the year ICIs could reach up to 150 ms. All these findings suggest that they were feeding or socializing in spring and mostly travelling in the other seasons. It is well known that pelagic fish such as sprat and bluefish start their migration from the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea in spring. This study suggests that the cetaceans use the middle part of the Strait for feeding on the pelagic fish in spring when the fish migration has just started.

AB  - Understanding the function of baleen whale acoustic signals requires the investigation of calling behaviors relative to location, timing, and behavioral state. Previous studies of gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) vocal behavior have principally used passive recorders and been conducted primarily on breeding grounds and along migratory routes, and not areas associated with foraging. We conducted an analysis of accelerometer and acoustic data collected during 12 deployments of animal-borne tags in 2016, 2019, and 2021 on gray whales that return annually to northern Puget Sound, Washington. We identified 141 calls from gray whales in approximately 128 hours of accelerometer and/or acoustic data collected from tag deployments. The most prominent were pulsive 'rumble-like' calls, upsweeping tones, and moans. Using the tag's accelerometer to identify calls produced by tagged animals enabled us to explore the behavioral context behind call production, revealing that vocalizations were made primarily at slow speeds (mean 1.03 & PLUSMN; 0.26 m/s(-1)), shallow depths (mean 7.63 & PLUSMN; 4.99 m), and temporally proximate to surface behavior (mean 43.3 & PLUSMN; 39.66 sec) most similar to non-foraging associated depth (mean 5.78 & PLUSMN; 1.46 m and speed (mean 1.46 & PLUSMN; 1.11 m/s(-1)) profiles. Vocalizations originating from the tagged animal occurred closer to the conclusion of a foraging event (mean 87.7 & PLUSMN; 119.32 min) than the beginning, with only 7% of all calls occurring during periods of feeding. This study demonstrates that gray whales remain vocal on foraging grounds and that call-associated accelerometry signals can be a valuable tool in identifying individual callers in animal-borne acoustic data.

AB  - Minke whales comprise some of the most widely distributed species of baleen whales, some populations of which are still regularly targeted by commercial whaling. Here, we review the conservation status of common (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Antarctic (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) minke whale populations, against the backdrop of ongoing whaling operations and other anthropogenic threats, including climate change, entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, and noise pollution. Although some coastal minke whale populations have been studied in detail, others, which inhabit remote and ecologically sensitive locations, such as the Antarctic ice shelf, are among the least understood populations of marine mammals. The unresolved taxonomy of dwarf minke whales further highlights some of the existing knowledge gaps concerning these species. Due to their relatively small size and elusive behaviors, large uncertainties exist for almost all minke whale populations with respect to behavior, migratory routes and winter distributions, hindering effective conservation and management. However, recent advances in research technology, such as passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), unmanned aerial systems (UAS), multisensor recording tags, and machine learning assisted photo-identification, are increasingly being applied to study minke whales and their habitat, and are starting to open new windows into their life history and ecology. In future research, these non- and less-invasive methods should be integrated in larger-scale comparative studies aiming to better understand minke whale behavior, ecological interactions and their varying habitats to drive and support effective species conservation.

AB  - Seven passive acoustic surveys for marine mammal sounds were conducted by deploying sonobuoys along ship tracks during Antarctic voyages spanning years 2006-2021. These surveys included nearly 330 degrees of longitude throughout Antarctic (south of 60 degrees S) and sub-Antarctic (between 50-60 degrees S) latitudes. Here, we summarise the presence of calls from critically endangered Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) detected on all seven of these surveys. We describe and compare the spatial distribution of detections of three different types of Antarctic blue whale calls: unit-A, Z-calls, and D-calls. Three sets of voyages partially overlapped spatially but in different years, providing three regions (Indian Sector, Dumont d'Urville Sea, Ross Sea) to investigate differences over time for these three different call types. The proportion of sonobuoys with calls present was significantly higher in the more recent years for seven of the 15 combinations of years, regions, and call type. The proportion of sonobuoys with calls present was significantly lower only for one of the 15 combinations (unit A in the Ross Sea between 2015 vs 2017), and not significantly different for the remaining seven pairwise comparisons. We discuss possible explanations for these observations including: differences in probability of detection, whale behaviour, whale distribution, and abundance. These explanations are not mutually exclusive and cannot yet be resolved without application of complex analytical methods and collection of additional data. Lastly, we discuss future work that could help clarify the contributions of each of these potential drivers of acoustic detection. We propose continued acoustic data collection, application of new analytical methods, and collection of other synergistic data from Antarctic blue whales on their feeding grounds as a basis for future work on this species. This could provide a cost effective and holistic means of monitoring their status after the effects of 20th century industrial whaling, as well as their responses to natural and anthropogenic changes to their main prey, Antarctic krill, and a changing climate.

AB  - The fin whale is a globally endangered species and is listed as threatened in Australia, however no peer-reviewed studies are available to indicate the migratory movements of the species in Australian waters. This study uses passive acoustic monitoring as a tool to identify the migratory movements of fin whales in Australian waters. Sampling was conducted from eight locations around Australia between 2009 and 2017, providing a total of 37 annual migratory records. Taken together, our observations provide evidence of fin whale migration through Australian waters, with earliest arrival of the animals recorded on the Western Australian coast, at Cape Leeuwin in April. The whales travel through Cape Leeuwin, migrating northward along the Western Australian coast to the Perth Canyon (May to October), which likely acts as a way-station for feeding. Some whales continue migrating as far north as Dampier (19 degrees S). On Australia's east coast, at Tuncurry, fin whale seasonal presence each year occurred later, from June to late September/October. A total of only 8,024 fin whale pulses were recorded on the east coast, compared to 177,328 pulses recorded at the Perth Canyon. We suggest these differences, as well as the spatial separation between coasts, provide preliminary evidence that the fin whales present on the east and west coasts constitute separate sub-populations.

AB  - The patterns of movement of the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus (Linnaeus, 1758)) in the Mediterranean Sea are still a matter of debate. Feeding aggregations are well known in the Corso-Liguro-Provencal Basin from July to September, but little is known for the autumn and winter seasons. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was implemented in the Ligurian Sea to overcome this gap and to investigate the temporal and spatial variation of fin whale acoustic presence. From July to December 2011, five autonomous recorders were deployed at between 700 and 900 m depths. Fin whale calls were automatically detected almost every day, with higher vocalization rates in October, November, and December. Furthermore, daily vocalization rates were higher during light hours, and closer to the coast. These outcomes suggest that not all the individuals migrate, staying in the area also during autumn for feeding or breeding purposes. The dial cycle of vocalization might be related to feeding activities and zooplankton vertical migration, whereas the proximity to the coast can be explained by the morphology of the area that promotes the upwelling system. Although this work only represents a six-month period, certainly it suggests the need for a larger spatial and temporal PAM effort, crucial for species management and for mitigating possible impact of anthropogenic activities at the basin level.

AB  - Simple Summary Long term data on the number and location of foraging gray whales on the west coast of Vancouver was used to understand the rate of return and residency time of whales to certain areas. From this data, areas of increased use by foraging whales were determined, and patterns in the way the areas were used by the whales were seen. Whale location data showed them using prey patches and moving to other patches to allow the first to recover, before then returning to feed on them again later in the summer. Calves that follow their mother in their first migration were likely to return to the same site in the years after weaning. This suggests a maternal aspect to the use of foraging areas. Little is known about how whales detect prey; the use of acoustics was considered here, with call types differing between times when prey was more abundant and whales were feeding in close proximity, to those when foraging whales were more distant to each other. This suggests there may be a social aspect to the calling by gray whales in foraging areas. Gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) show high site fidelity to feeding and breeding areas. The whales' annual cycle could be learned or be driven by factors such as prey abundance or ocean conditions. Long-term line transect and photo-identification data were analyzed to consider intra- and inter- annual patterns of habitat use and the underlying drivers for foraging areas in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia. Time series, autocorrelation and weighted means analysis were used on the 20-years of data (1997-2016). A generalized additive model showed that whale use of the area was most strongly influenced by the maximum number of whales, and the date of its occurrence, recorded the previous year. This maximum, when it occurred in the summer, impacted the whale numbers for up to four subsequent years. The annual average number of whales per transect also influenced the proportion of whales known to return in multiple years to forage. Many of these returning whales first used the site to wean and returned in subsequent years to feed. The transect data was also used to contextualize passive acoustic recordings, comparing call type and rate for periods when the whale number, location and social context was known. Calling patterns appeared to be socially derived, with shorter-range knock calls dominant when whales were closer, and lower-frequency moans when foraging occurred when whales were more distant from each other. This suggests that prey-finding and site use may also be influenced by conspecifics.

TI  - Blue Whales Respond to Anthropogenic Noise
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - CALIFORNIA
AB  - Anthropogenic noise may significantly impact exposed marine mammals. This work studied the vocalization response of endangered blue whales to anthropogenic noise sources in the mid-frequency range using passive acoustic monitoring in the Southern California Bight. Blue whales were less likely to produce calls when mid-frequency active sonar was present. This reduction was more pronounced when the sonar source was closer to the animal, at higher sound levels. The animals were equally likely to stop calling at any time of day, showing no diel pattern in their sensitivity to sonar. Conversely, the likelihood of whales emitting calls increased when ship sounds were nearby. Whales did not show a differential response to ship noise as a function of the time of the day either. These results demonstrate that anthropogenic noise, even at frequencies well above the blue whales' sound production range, has a strong probability of eliciting changes in vocal behavior. The long-term implications of disruption in call production to blue whale foraging and other behaviors are currently not well understood.

AB  - Marine animals use sound for communication, navigation, predator avoidance, and prey detection. Thus the rise in acoustic energy associated with increasing human activity in the ocean has potential to impact the lives of marine animals. Thirty years ago marine bioacoustics primarily focused on evaluating effects of human-generated sound on hearing and behavior by testing captive animals and visually observing wild animals. Since that time rapidly changing electronic and computing technologies have yielded three tools that revolutionized how bioacousticians study marine animals. These tools are (1) portable systems for measuring electrophysiological auditory evoked potentials, (2) miniaturized tags equipped with positioning sensors and acoustic recording devices for continuous short-term acoustical observation rather than intermittent visual observation, and (3) passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems for remote long-term acoustic observations at specific locations. The beauty of these breakthroughs is their direct applicability to wild animals in natural habitats rather than only to animals held in captivity. Hearing capabilities of many wild species including polar bears, beaked whales, and reef fishes have now been assessed by measuring their auditory evoked potentials. Miniaturized acoustic tags temporarily attached to an animal to record its movements and acoustic environment have revealed the acoustic foraging behavior of sperm and beaked whales. Now tags are being adapted to fishes in effort to understand their behavior in the presence of noise. Moving and static PAM systems automatically detect and characterize biological and physical features of an ocean area without adding any acoustic energy to the environment. PAM is becoming a powerful technique for understanding and managing marine habitats. This paper will review the influence of these transformative tools on the knowledge base of marine bioacoustics and elucidation of relationships between marine animals and their acoustic environment, leading to a new, rapidly growing field of marine acoustic ecology.

AB  - The Chukchi Sea environment changes considerably in physical and biological conditions, driven by the expanding volume of warm Pacific summer water. These environmental changes can affect the migration timing of baleen whales in the southern Chukchi Sea. However, few studies have been conducted in this area to determine the migration timing of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), the only baleen whale species endemic to the Arctic region. In this study, we conducted a fixed passive acoustic monitoring of bowhead whales in the southern Chukchi Sea from July 2012 to October 2015 and compared the occurrence patterns of vocalizations to physical and biological environmental factors. Bowhead whale calls were detected in fall/winter and spring during the ice-freezing and retreating periods, respectively. The fall migration timing of bowhead whales through the southern Chukchi Sea was delayed in the years when the timing of sea ice formation was late, and it formed increasingly later in the years 2013, 2014, and 2012, in that sequence. Moreover, the sea surface temperature decreased before freeze-up, which affected the timing of fall migration of bowhead whales. There was no clear relationship between the occurrence of bowhead whale calls and the abundance of prey, especially in spring, suggesting that most bowhead whales use the southern Chukchi Sea as a corridor during their spring northward migrations. However, the occurrence of bowhead whales and high abundance of zooplankton in October-November present the possibility that bowhead whales expand their feeding area in the southern Chukchi Sea.

AB  - Understanding the distribution of animals is of paramount importance for management and conservation, especially for species that are impacted by anthropogenic threats. In the case of marine mammals there has been a growing concern about the impact of human-made noise, in particular for beaked whales and other deep diving odontocetes. Foraging (measured via echolocation clicks at depth) was studied for Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) and Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) using three passive acoustics recorders moored to the bottom of the ocean in a canyon area in the Ligurian Sea between July and December 2011. A Generalized Linear Model was used to test whether foraging was influenced by location and day of the year, including the possibility of interactions between predictors. Contrary to previous studies conducted by visual surveys in this area, all species were detected at all locations, suggesting habitat overlapping. However, significant differences were found in the occurrence of each species at different locations. Beaked and sperm whales foraged significantly more in the northern and western locations, while long-finned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins hunted more in the northern and eastern location.

AB  - Humpback whale males are known to sing on their low-latitude breeding grounds, but it is well established that songs are also commonly produced 'off-season' on the feeding grounds or during migration. This opens exciting opportunities to investigate migratory aggregations, study humpback whale behavioral plasticity and potentially even assign individual singers to specific breeding grounds. In this study, we analyzed passive acoustic data from 13 recording positions and multiple years (2011-2018) within the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (ASSO). Humpback whale song was detected at nine recording positions in five years. Most songs were recorded in May, austral fall, coinciding with the rapid increase in sea ice concentration at most recording positions. The spatio-temporal pattern in humpback whale singing activity on Southern Ocean feeding grounds is most likely shaped by local prey availability and humpback whale migratory strategies. Furthermore, the comparative analyses of song structures clearly show a differentiation of two song groups, of which one was solely recorded at the western edge of the ASSO and the other song group was recorded throughout the ASSO. This new finding suggests a common feeding ground occupation by multiple humpback whale populations in the ASSO, allowing for cultural and potentially even genetic exchange among populations.

AB  - Passive acoustic data were collected January 2012 to April 2013 at four sites in the Chiloense Ecoregion (CER) in southern Chile (approximate to 43 degrees S-44 degrees S, 71 degrees W-73 degrees W) and 1996-2002 from one site in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) (8 degrees S, 95 degrees W). Automatic detectors were used to detect the two songs (SEP1 and SEP2) described for southeast Pacific (SEP) blue whales. There was a strong seasonal pattern of occurrence of SEP songs in the CER from December to August, peaking March to May. In the ETP, the occurrence of songs was an order of magnitude lower but songs were present year-round, with a peak around June. These findings support austral summer/autumn seasonal residency in the CER and a seasonal movement of blue whales towards the ETP during June/July, returning in December. Interannual differences in the ETP were possibly linked to the 1997-1998 El Nino event. At both study sites, SEP2 was significantly more common than SEP1; both songs largely followed the same temporal trends. These findings contribute to our understanding of the seasonal movements of endangered SEP blue whales and can inform conservation strategies, particularly in the CER coastal feeding ground. We recommend future year-round passive acoustic studies in the CER and the ETP (e.g., near the Galapagos Islands), ideally coupled with oceanographic data.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a well-established tool for researching the occurrence, movements, and ecology of a wide variety of marine mammal species. Advances in hardware and data collection have exponentially increased the volumes of passive acoustic data collected, such that discoveries are now limited by the time required to analyze rather than collect the data. In order to address this limitation, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify humpback whale song in over 187,000 h of acoustic data collected at 13 different monitoring sites in the North Pacific over a 14-year period. The model successfully detected 75 s audio segments containing humpback song with an average precision of 0.97 and average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.992. The model output was used to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of humpback song, corroborating known seasonal patterns in the Hawaiian and Mariana Islands, including occurrence at remote monitoring sites beyond well-studied aggregations, as well as novel discovery of humpback whale song at Kingman Reef, at 5(circle) North latitude. This study demonstrates the ability of a CNN trained on a small dataset to generalize well to a highly variable signal type across a diverse range of recording and noise conditions. We demonstrate the utility of active learning approaches for creating high-quality models in specialized domains where annotations are rare. These results validate the feasibility of applying deep learning models to identify highly variable signals across broad spatial and temporal scales, enabling new discoveries through combining large datasets with cutting edge tools.

AB  - The length-frequency distribution of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) was studied on the east coast of NZ using passive acoustic recorders moored offshore of Kaikoura, Cape Palliser and Castlepoint. Sperm whale's echolocation signals are unique among odontocete species. Their clicks are composed by multiple pulses resulting from the sound transmission within the whale head. The total length of the whales can be estimated by measuring the time delay between these pulses. A total of 997 length measurements were obtained from click trains using cepstral analysis (mean = 14.6 m; min = 9.6 m; max = 18.3 m; std = 1 m). The size-frequency distributions at all three locations were similar, although animals smaller than 12 m were not present offshore of Kaikoura. Animals of various sizes appeared to be present all year round, with no apparent seasonality in the occurrence of any size class.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is widely used for detection and localization of marine mammals. Typically, pressure sensors are used, although several studies utilized acoustic vector sensors (AVSs), that measure acoustic pressure and particle velocity and can estimate azimuths to acoustic sources. The AVSs can localize sources using a reduced number of sensors and do not require precise time synchronization between sensors. However, when multiple animals are calling concurrently, automated tracking of individual sources still poses a challenge, and manual methods are typically employed to link together sequences of measurements from a given source. This paper extends the method previously reported by Tenorio-Halle, Thode, Lammers, Conrad, and Kim [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151(1), 126-137 (2022)] by employing and comparing two fully-automated approaches for azimuthal tracking based on the AVS data. One approach is based on random finite set statistics and the other on message passing algorithms, but both approaches utilize the underlying Bayesian statistical framework. The proposed methods are tested on several days of AVS data obtained off the coast of Maui and results show that both approaches successfully and efficiently track multiple singing humpback whales. The proposed methods thus made it possible to develop a fully-automated AVS tracking approach applicable to all species of baleen whales.

AB  - Cetaceans have elicited the attention of researchers in recent decades due to their importance to the ecosystem and their economic values. They use sound for communication, echolocation and other social activities. Their sounds are highly non-stationary, transitory and range from short to long sounds. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a popular method used for monitoring cetaceans in their ecosystems. The volumes of data accumulated using PAM are usually big, so they are difficult to analyze using manual inspection. Therefore different techniques with mixed outcomes have been developed for the automatic detection and classification of signals of different cetacean species. So far, no single technique developed is perfect to detect and classify the vocalizations of over 82 known species due to variability in time-frequency, difference in the amplitude among species and within species' vocal repertoire, physical environment, among others. The accuracy of any detector or classifier depends on the technique adopted as well as the nature of the signal to be analyzed. In this article, we review the existing techniques for the automatic detection and classification of cetacean vocalizations. We categorize the surveyed techniques, while emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques. The article suggests possible research directions that can improve existing detection and classification techniques. In addition, the article recommends other suitable techniques that can be used to analyze non-linear and non-stationary signals such as the cetaceans' signals. Several research have been dedicated to this topic, however, there is no review of these past results that gives a quick overview in the area of cetacean detection and classification. This review will help researchers and practitioners in the field to make insightful decisions based on their requirements.

AB  - Daily acoustic calling rates of Eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whales were measured on 6 days during 1 mo of their 2008 breeding season in the sheltered coastal lagoon of Laguna San Ignacio in Baja California, Mexico. Visual counts of whales determined that the numbers of single animals in the lower lagoon more than tripled over the observation period. All call types showed production peaks in the early morning and evening with minimum rates generally detected in the early afternoon. For four of the five observation days, the daily number of "S1"-type calls increased roughly as the square of the number of the animals in the lower lagoon during both daytime and nighttime. This relationship persisted when raw call counts were adjusted for variations in background noise level, using a simple propagation law derived from empirical measurements. The one observation day that did not fit the square-law relationship occurred during a week when the group size in the lagoon increased rapidly. These results suggest that passive acoustic monitoring does not measure gray whale group size directly but monitors the number of connections in the social network, which rises as roughly M2/2 for a group size M.

AB  - Long-term data of underwater passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) collected from two sites of pygmy blue whale presence within Australia, the continental shelf off Portland (38.5 degrees S, 141.2 degrees E) and the Perth Canyon (32 degrees S, 115 degrees E) were analysed to compare the acoustic behaviour of eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue (EIOPB) whales. Pygmy blue whale song detection was consistently higher at the Perth Canyon site than at the Portland sample site. Statistical analysis found there to be a significant difference in the production of song and phrase variants between sites (p < 0.01) with a shorter two-unit (P2) song variant being more common in the Perth Canyon area, while the traditional three-unit (P3) song variant was more frequent off Portland. This was supported by manual and feature space analysis techniques. Increasing song complexity was observed in the form of phrases with broken song units, a phenomenon that was first observed at the Portland site on isolated occasions but has occurred and proliferated in the Perth Canyon area from 2016 onwards. Analysis of environmental conditions indicated that increased background noise due to multiple EIOPB whales vocalising, as well as water depth, may influence song length. This was reflected by songs made up of shorter phrases dominating in higher background noise conditions and deeper water, while longer more complex phrase types dominate in quieter, shallower conditions. Further research is recommended to isolate any potential influence of environmental factors on song production.

AB  - The performance of large-aperture hydrophone arrays to detect and localize blue and fin whales' 15-85 Hz signature vocalizations under ocean noise conditions was assessed through simulations from a normal mode propagation model combined to noise statistics from 15 960 h of recordings in Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. The probability density functions of 2482 summer noise level estimates in the call bands were used to attach a probability of detection/masking to the simulated call levels as a function of whale depth and range for typical environmental conditions. Results indicate that call detection was modulated by the calling depth relative to the sound channel axis and by modal constructive and destructive interferences with range. Masking of loud infrasounds could reach 40% at 30 km for a receiver at the optimal depth. The 30 LIB weaker blue whale D-call were subject to severe masking. Mapping the percentages of detection and localization allowed assessing the performance of a six-hydrophone array under mean- and low-noise conditions. This approach is helpful for optimizing hydrophone configuration in implementing passive acoustic monitoring arrays and building their detection function for whale density assessment, as an alternative to or in combination with the traditional undersampling visual methods.

AB  - The sperm whale carries a hypertrophied nose that generates powerful clicks for long-range echolocation. However, it remains a conundrum how this bizarrely shaped apex predator catches its prey. Several hypotheses have been advanced to propose both active and passive means to acquire prey, including acoustic debilitation of prey with very powerful clicks. Here we test these hypotheses by using sound and movement recording tags in a fine-scale study of buzz sequences to relate the acoustic behaviour of sperm whales with changes in acceleration in their head region during prey capture attempts. We show that in the terminal buzz phase, sperm whales reduce inter-click intervals and estimated source levels by 1-2 orders of magnitude. As a result, received levels at the prey are more than an order of magnitude below levels required for debilitation, precluding acoustic stunning to facilitate prey capture. Rather, buzzing involves high-frequency, low amplitude clicks well suited to provide high-resolution biosonar updates during the last stages of capture. The high temporal resolution helps to guide motor patterns during occasionally prolonged chases in which prey are eventually subdued with the aid of fast jaw movements and/or buccal suction as indicated by acceleration transients (jerks) near the end of buzzes.

AB  - The Perennial Acoustic Observatory in the Antarctic Ocean (PALAOA) was developed to study the underwater vocal behavior of cetaceans and pinnipeds and to monitor ambient noise levels in the Southern Ocean. Establishing an autonomous long-term observatory in Antarctica is challenging mainly because of the harsh weather conditions and logistic constraints. The project goal was to build an autonomously operating, passive-acoustic observatory which allows scientists (1) to reliably and continuously record the Antarctic underwater soundscape yearround, (2) to record all vocalizations produced by marine mammals in the study area (frequency range of the recordings: 10 Hz to 96 kHz), (3) to locate vocalizing marine mammals and other underwater sound sources, (4) to obtain information on ambient noise levels in the area, and (5) to access and analyze the incoming acoustic data stream in real time at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) located in Bremerhaven, Germany.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is an effective technique for long-term monitoring of the soundscape in marine protected areas. Ocean noise is a key concern for the U.S. Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and has been identified as a research priority. The Sanctuary Soundscape Monitoring Project ("SanctSound") was implemented to support efforts to address ocean noise across seven U.S. sanctuaries using a comprehensive and standardized approach. In this study, acoustic recordings were collected in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary during the humpback whale seasons (November-May) from 2018-2022. Data encompassed 14 deployments across four sites in the main Hawaiian Islands: HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, Maui, O'ahu, and KauaModified Letter Turned Commai. The soundscape was dominated by biological sources, most prominently the seasonal detection of humpback whale song. Third octave level monthly medians ranged from 70.4-105 dB re 1 mu Pa across sites with distinct peaks from January to April particularly at both HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai and Maui sites. Overall, we reported relatively low vessel detection rates, with Maui having the highest daily average of vessel detections (x = 19.16). No COVID-19 impact could be observed acoustically using soundscape metrics which was likely due to the dominance of humpback whale chorusing. However, vessel detections and AIS data revealed a reduction in vessel activity after the onset of the pandemic at the Maui and HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai sites. This study demonstrates that standardized metrics are a useful tool for obtaining long-term, baseline soundscape levels to understand the various contributions to the underwater soundscape and potential changes within marine protected areas in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai.

AB  - Significant effort has been made over the last few decades to develop automated passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems capable of classifying cetaceans at the species level. The utility of such systems depends on the systems' ability to operate across a wide range of ocean acoustic environments; however, anecdotal evidence suggests that site-specific propagation characteristics impact the performance of PAM systems. Variability in propagation characteristics leads to differences in how each cetacean vocalization is altered as it propagates along the source-receiver path. A propagation experiment was conducted in the Gulf of Mexico to investigate the range-dependent impacts of acoustic propagation on the performance of an automated classifier. Modified bowhead and humpback vocalizations were transmitted over ranges from 1 to 10 km. When the classifier was trained with signals collected near the sound source, it was found that the performance decreased with increasing transmission range-this appeared to be largely explained by decreasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Generation of performance matrices showed that one method to develop a classifier that maintains high performance across many ranges is to include a varied assortment of ranges in the training data; however, if the training set is limited, it is best to train on relatively low SNR vocalizations.

AB  - North Atlantic right whale monitoring in Roseway Basin, Canada, is primarily based on short-term (<14 d) visual surveys conducted during August-September. Variability in survey effort has been the biggest limiting factor to studying changes in the population's occurrence and habitat use. Such efforts could be enhanced considerably using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). We sought to determine if variation in whale presence, relative abundance, demography, and/or behavior (estimated through visual surveys) could be explained by variation in three right whale call types in this habitat. A generalized linear model was fit to 23 d of concurrent PAM and visual monitoring during four summers within the Roseway Basin Right Whale Critical Habitat boundaries. The model revealed significant positive relationships between relative abundance, call counts and presence of surface-active group behavior. PAM can refine daily right whale presence estimates. While visual observations (n = 23 d) implied a 40% decline in right whale presence during 2014-2015 relative to 2004-2005, PAM data (n = 211 d) showed right whales were present between 71%-85% of survey days throughout all years analyzed. We demonstrate that PAM is a useful tool to extend periods of right whale monitoring, especially in areas where visual monitoring efforts may be limited.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to develop a four-channel underwater passive acoustic monitoring system for the use of underwater vehicles. Humans have received abundant blessings of the ocean, and thus it is very important to recognise marine biodiversity and to maintain sound ocean ecosystems for the sustainable utilisation of the ecosystem services. Final goal of this research is to realise a long-term and wide-range monitoring of marine mammals using autonomous underwater vehicles, and to evaluate the healthiness of ocean ecosystems and environments. Underwater glider has no propulsive machinery, and then it is one of the most suitable underwater vehicles for acoustic observation. It is widely known that killer whale is the top predator of ocean food chain. Recently, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of marine mammals has appeared in the spotlight. This paper deals with a 4-channel underwater passive acoustic monitoring system. Maximum operational depth is 400 metre. The system consists of four hydrophones, pre-amplifier with anti-aliasing low-pass filter, a 4-ch portable recorder. It is also equipped with a 3-axis digital compass, a GPS device, and a 2-ch serial data logger so as to estimate the accurate direction of sound source even though the system may be drifted in the waves.

AB  - Over the years, researchers have continued to put forward solutions to lessen the threats faced by whales within their ecosystem. The correct detection of the different species of whale is important in the search for solutions that will lessen the threats. In order to accurately detect and classify whale species, a number of techniques have been proposed over the years, with varying degrees of success. This research seeks to improve the performance of the hidden Markov models (HMMs), which is one of the most consistent methods for the detection and classification of whale vocalisations. The performance of HMMs is affected by the quality of the feature vectors fed into them. Thus, this research proposes feature extraction (FE) techniques based on principal component analysis. The principal components (PC) computed from PCA and kernel PCA were uniquely transformed into feature vector structures suitable for the HMMs. The emerging models, PCA-HMMs and kPCA-HMMs, were experimented with on passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) datasets containing southern right whale and humpback whale vocalisations. The results from the experiments showed that the kPCA-HMMs outperformed PCA-HMMs. This is due to kPCA's ability to find non-linear subspaces that may exist in whale vocalisations. Furthermore, the results of the developed PC-HMMs were compared with other existing FE techniques used with HMMs in the literature for the detection of whale vocalisations. The proposed PC-HMMs did not only outperform the existing FE-HMMs but also offered lower computational complexity than the existing HMMs for the detection of whale vocalisations.

AB  - Incidental mortality (bycatch) in gillnet fisheries is a major threat to many cetacean populations. Acoustic alarms or pingers are a widely adopted management tool used to deter dolphins and porpoises from nets; however, their efficacy is largely species- and fishery-dependent. As such, results from experimental trials may have limited transferability to poorly studied species or fisheries. Here, we investigated the effect of pingers on the behaviour of Burmeister's porpoise Phocoena spinipinnis in the vicinity of the Peruvian small-scale driftnet fleet. Over a 4 yr period (2009-2012), 116 control (without pingers) and 94 experimental (with pingers) fishing sets were observed, and porpoise acoustic activity around nets was recorded using passive acoustic loggers (C-PODs). We modelled variation in detection rates as a function of pinger use and habitat covariates, and found that in regions of preferred habitat associated with cooler (17-18 degrees C), shallow waters (within the 100 m isobath), the use of pingers lead to an 86% reduction in porpoise activity around nets. Our results suggest that pingers are likely to be particularly effective at deterring Burmeister's porpoises from fishing nets, and given the vast capacity of this and other fleets in the region, may substantially reduce mortality. This study also emphasizes the potential of passive acoustic monitoring to determine the effectiveness of bycatch mitigation measures, both for species for which visual observations are scarce, and also in regions where gathering statistically meaningful bycatch rates is logistically challenging.

AB  - Understanding the behavioral ecology of a species is fundamental to effective conservation and management efforts. This study quantifies the behavioral ontogeny of North Atlantic right whale mother-calf pairs from birth to weaning spanning three critical habitat areas off the eastern coast of the United States and Canada. Data from 55 focal follows of 34 mother-calf pairs were collected from 2011 to 2015. Resting behaviors dominated the activity budgets for both mother and calf during the first 5 months, putting them at increased risk of vessel collisions. There was an increase in the proportion of active behaviors (travel, foraging, social activity) in both mother and calf as the calf matured. Importantly, the type of active behaviors, in particular surface skim feeding and surface active social behavior, meant that the risk of vessel collision to the pair did not decrease as the calf matured. Mother-calf right whale pairs showed very low calling rates on the calving grounds, suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may not be an effective mitigation tool during the early months. However, calling rates increase once the pair leave the calving areas with both calf age and activity levels increasing, at which point passive acoustic monitoring becomes valuable. Protective measures need to take these rapid developmental changes throughout calf growth into account to improve the efficacy of protection measures for the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other species where behavioral ecology changes rapidly during maturation.

AB  - As part of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Natural Resource Damage Assessment in the Gulf of Mexico, we conducted a large passive acoustic survey across the eastern Gulf continental shelf edge to assess impacts to sperm whale population. In the months immediately after the spill, sperm whale occurrence was significantly higher in areas closest to the spill. Over the following seasons in 2010-2011, we documented cyclical patterns of decreased and increased occurrence suggesting that this population exhibits a seasonal occurrence pattern in the region, with seasonal movements to other regions, and not likely directly influenced by the oil spill. Unfortunately, a lack of adequately scaled, pre-spill data on sperm whales, along with limitations on the survey duration constrain our ability to infer spill-related changes in sperm whale occurrence. However, our study establishes post-disaster baseline data for continued monitoring, and an expanded study design could provide a model for continued monitoring.

TI  - Classification of Sperm Whale Clicks and Triangulation for Real-Time Localization with SBL Arrays
T2  - OCEANS 2008, VOLS 1-4
LA  - English
CP  - OCEANS 2008 Conference
AB  - In order to observe the underwater behavior of sperm whales, the authors previously introduced a passive acoustic system that consists of an AUV (Autonomou Underwater Vehicle) with a hydrophone array and two arrays attached to a support ship. The three arrays receive sperm whale clicks and determine the direction to the sound source by a SBL (Short Baseline) system. Based on triangulation with a pair of arrays, it is possible to calculate the location of the sound source in real-time. Sperm whales usually dive in groups, and so each array captures thousands of clicks from multiple whales. It is, therefore, necessary to identify the corresponding clicks of each individual captured by the three arrays. However, the acoustic communication band between the AUV and the support ship is limited, so it is impossible to correlate the clicks received by each array in real-time. In order to triangulate with a limited communication band, the authors introduce a click classification scheme at each array considering the individual sound source. The class data is sent together with direction data to the AUV and an array on the support ship. Thus the AUV and the operator in the support ship can estimate the posisiton of the whale by a LBL (Long Baseline) system. In this paper, the proposed classification algorithm is applied to data recorded off Ogasawara in 2003[6]. The clicks can be classified reasonably by the proposed method. The three-dimensional underwater trajectories of six sperm whales are obtained by using the classes obtained by the proposed method.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used for studying marine mammals, leading to the accumulation of large acoustic datasets. Analyzing these datasets becomes impractical without automated detection and classification software. Detectors and classifiers based on deep neural networks have shown great potential, but their performance is often limited by the availability of sufficient quantities of annotated training samples, and their application restricted to the specific acoustic environment(s) from which their training data were collected. We address these limitations by employing transfer learning, a deep learning concept whereby knowledge from a source domain is transferred to a target domain. Specifically, we considered two different underwater acoustic environments as the source and target domains. The objective was to use a deep neural network that had been trained in one environment with abundant annotated training samples, and optimize its performance in the other environment where the annotated training samples were limited. Training and testing were conducted using three acoustic datasets containing North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls. Experiments show that adapting a trained model to the new environment led to a substantial improvement in recall from 70% to 85%, while maintaining a low false-positive rate of less than 5 per hour. The methodology is implemented as an opensource Python tool to facilitate the creation of more tailored deep learning-based acoustic detectors and classifiers for North Atlantic right whale vocalizations and other stereotyped marine mammal calls.

AB  - The use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) around marine developments is commonplace. A buffer-based PAM system (e.g., C-POD) is a cost-effective method for assessing cetacean acoustic presence. Devices have been deployed by Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) Marine around the United Kingdom, allowing an examination of the performance of C-PODs with respect to background noise, tilt angle, and environmental factors. C-PODs were found to often only monitor for a few seconds of each minute, resulting in significant loss of monitoring time. Issues were likely driven by environmental and deployment factors. The practical limitations of buffer-based PAM systems in high-energy/noisy environments are indicated here.

AB  - The presence of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA is not well understood. Adequate protection of right whales in the face of plans to develop offshore renewable energy requires more information about this species' distribution and occurrence in this region. We present findings from the first year-round study dedicated to marine mammals in New Jersey's nearshore waters using line transect surveys and passive acoustic monitoring. Four groups of right whales, including a cow-calf pair, were sighted. Right whales were detected acoustically during all seasons. Sightings of females and subsequent confirmations of these same individuals in the calving grounds a month or less later illustrate that these waters are part of this species' migratory corridor. Observations of skim-feeding behavior suggest that feeding may also occur in areas farther south than the main feeding grounds. Based on the year-round occurrence of right whales off New Jersey, we recommend that presumed seasonal migratory patterns not be used alone to determine the timing of construction activities or monitoring/mitigation efforts for offshore development. Our results also provide support for the expansion of existing critical habitat to include nearshore waters of the mid-Atlantic.

AB  - The migration routes of wide-ranging species can be difficult to study, particularly at sea. In the western South Pacific, migratory routes of humpback whales between breeding and feeding areas are unclear. Male humpback whales sing a population-specific song, which can be used to match singers on migration to a breeding population. To investigate migratory routes and breeding area connections, passive acoustic recorders were deployed in the central New Zealand migratory corridor (2016); recorded humpback whale song was compared to song from the closest breeding populations of East Australia and New Caledonia (2015-2017). Singing northbound whales migrated past New Zealand from June to August via the east coast of the South Island and Cook Strait. Few song detections were made along the east coast of the North Island. New Zealand song matched New Caledonia song, suggesting a migratory destination, but connectivity to East Australia could not be ruled out. Two song types were present in New Zealand, illustrating the potential for easterly song transmission from East Australia to New Caledonia in this shared migratory corridor. This study enhances our understanding of western South Pacific humpback whale breeding population connectivity, and provides novel insights into the dynamic transmission of song culture.

TI  - Calibrating passive acoustic monitoring: Correcting humpback whale call detections for site-specific and time-dependent environmental characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA  - English
KW  - RADIATED NOISE
AB  - This paper demonstrates the importance of accounting for environmental effects on passive underwater acoustic monitoring results. The situation considered is the reduction in shipping off the California coast between 2008-2010 due to the recession and environmental legislation. The resulting variations in ocean noise change the probability of detecting marine mammal vocalizations. An acoustic model was used to calculate the time-varying probability of detecting humpback whale vocalizations under best-guess environmental conditions and varying noise. The uncorrected call counts suggest a diel pattern and an increase in calling over a two-year period; the corrected call counts show minimal evidence of these features.

AB  - We show that humpback-whale vocalization behavior is synchronous with peak annual Atlantic herring spawning processes in the Gulf of Maine. With a passive, wide-aperture, densely-sampled, coherent hydrophone array towed north of Georges Bank in a Fall 2006 Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) experiment, vocalizing whales could be instantaneously detected and localized over most of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem in a roughly 400-km diameter area by introducing array gain, of 18 dB, orders of magnitude higher than previously available in acoustic whale sensing. With humpback-whale vocalizations consistently recorded at roughly 2000/day, we show that vocalizing humpbacks (i) were overwhelmingly distributed along the northern flank of Georges Bank, coinciding with the peak spawning time and location of Atlantic herring, and (ii) their overall vocalization behavior was strongly diurnal, synchronous with the formation of large nocturnal herring shoals, with a call rate roughly ten-times higher at night than during the day. Humpback-whale vocalizations were comprised of (1) highly diurnal non-song calls, suited to hunting and feeding behavior, and (2) songs, which had constant occurrence rate over a diurnal cycle, invariant to diurnal herring shoaling. Before and during OAWRS survey transmissions: (a) no vocalizing whales were found at Stellwagen Bank, which had negligible herring populations, and (b) a constant humpback-whale song occurrence rate indicates the transmissions had no effect on humpback song. These measurements contradict the conclusions of Risch et al. Our analysis indicates that (a) the song occurrence variation reported in Risch et al. is consistent with natural causes other than sonar, (b) the reducing change in song reported in Risch et al. occurred days before the sonar survey began, and (c) the Risch et al. method lacks the statistical significance to draw the conclusions of Risch et al. because it has a 98-100% false-positive rate and lacks any true-positive confirmation.

AB  - We present results of the first simultaneous visual and acoustic surveys for Amazon River dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), undertaken in Yarinacocha Lagoon, Ucayali, Peru (length = 20 km, area = 12 km(2)). A total of 324 Sotalia observations and 44 Inia observations were recorded in boat-based transects. Based upon total survey effort, we estimated Sotalia had a mean density +/- SE of 1.98 +/- 4.6 ind km(-2) and an overall abundance of 34 individuals (95% CI: 28 to 40). Average density for Inia was 0.2 +/- 1.2 ind km(-2) with overall abundance estimated at 3 individuals (95% CI: 0 to 8). Visual surveys observed more Sotalia individuals during earlier hours of the day and during the dry season. Preliminary acoustic surveys undertaken with C-POD passive acoustic monitoring devices indicated a diel pattern in detections of cetacean vocalization with more diurnal activity and with detections ceasing from midnight until 10: 00 AM. This work highlights the possibility of monitoring both river dolphin species through visual and acoustic surveys to generate baseline information on abundance trends and distribution patterns in the Ucayali region, an area with high levels of human disturbance.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a widely used technique for studying the distribution and habitat use of cetaceans. The C-POD, an acoustic sensor with an onboard automated click detector, has been deployed in diverse acoustic environments, but studies verifying its offshore detection rates and factors affecting detection probability are scarce. To empirically evaluate the performance of C-PODs in detecting bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), C-PODs were deployed alongside archival acoustic recorders 12-30 km offshore in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The C-POD and acoustic recordings, post-processed using PAMGUARD software, were compared for a period of 6852 h. C-POD false positive rates were very low (mean 0.003%), and positive hourly detection accuracy was very high (mean 99.6%). Analysis of the acoustic environment and dolphin click characteristics revealed that true positive detections by C-PODs were significantly more likely to occur when PAMGUARD detected more clicks and there was increased high frequency noise (>20 kHz), likely from distant or unclassified clicks. C-PODs were found to be reliable indicators of dolphin presence at hourly or greater time scales. These results support the application of C-PODs in PAM studies that aim to investigate patterns of dolphin occurrence, such as those related to offshore windfarms.

AB  - Underwater passive acoustic recordings in the Southern and Indian Oceans off Australia from 2002 to 2016 have regularly captured a tonal signal of about 10 s duration at 22-28 Hz with a symmetrical bell-shaped envelope. The sound is often accompanied by short, higher frequency downsweeps and repeated at irregular intervals varying from 120 to 200 s. It is termed the "spot" call according to its appearance in spectrograms of long-time averaging. Although similar to the first part of an Antarctic blue whale Z-call, evidence suggests the call is produced by another great whale, with the source as yet not identified.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is an important tool in marine mammal studies. However, logistics and finances frequently constrain the number and servicing schedules of acoustic recorders, requiring a trade-off between deployment periods and sampling continuity, i.e., the implementation of a subsampling scheme. Optimizing such schemes to each project's specific research questions is desirable. This study investigates the impact of subsampling on the accuracy of two common metrics, acoustic presence and call rate, for different vocalization patterns (regimes) of baleen whales: (1) variable vocal activity, (2) vocalizations organized in song bouts, and (3) vocal activity with diel patterns. To this end, above metrics are compared for continuous and subsampled data subject to different sampling strategies, covering duty cycles between 50% and 2%. The results show that a reduction of the duty cycle impacts negatively on the accuracy of both acoustic presence and call rate estimates. For a given duty cycle, frequent short listening periods improve accuracy of daily acoustic presence estimates over few long listening periods. Overall, subsampling effects are most pronounced for low and/or temporally clustered vocal activity. These findings illustrate the importance of informed decisions when applying subsampling strategies to passive acoustic recordings or analyses for a given target species. (C) 2015 Author(s).

AB  - The study of marine soundscapes is a growing field of research. Recording hardware is becoming more accessible; there are a number of off-the-shelf autonomous recorders that can be deployed for months at a time; software analysis tools exist as shareware; rawor preprocessed recordings are freely and publicly available. However, what is missing are catalogues of commonly recorded sounds. Sounds related to geophysical events (e.g. earthquakes) and weather (e.g. wind and precipitation), to human activities (e.g. ships) and to marine animals (e.g. crustaceans, fish and marine mammals) commonly occur. Marine mammals are distributed throughout Australia's oceans and significantly contribute to the underwater soundscape. However, due to a lack of concurrent visual and passive acoustic observations, it is often not known which species produces which sounds. To aid in the analysis of Australian and Antarctic marine soundscape recordings, a literature review of the sounds made by marine mammals was undertaken. Frequency, duration and source level measurements are summarised and tabulated. In addition to the literature review, new marine mammal data are presented and include recordings from Australia of Omura's whales (Balaenoptera omurai), dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima), common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), long-finned pilot whales (G. melas), Fraser's dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei), false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and spinner dolphins (S. longirostris), as well as the whistles and burst-pulse sounds of Australian pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata). To date, this is the most comprehensive acoustic summary for marine mammal species in Australian waters.

AB  - In fall 2014 and spring 2015, passive acoustic data were collected via autonomous gliders east of Guam in an area that included the Mariana Trench Marine National Monument. A short (2-4 s), complex sound was recorded that features a similar to 38 Hz moan with both harmonics and amplitude modulation, followed by broad-frequency metallic-sounding sweeps up to 7.5 kHz. This sound was recorded regularly during both fall and spring surveys. Aurally, the sound is quite unusual and most resembles the minke whale "Star Wars" call. It is likely this sound is biological and produced by a baleen whale. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America

AB  - Species' conservation relies on understanding their seasonal habitats and migration routes. North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, migrate from the southeastern U.S. coast to Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, a federally designated critical habitat, from February through May to feed. The whales then continue north across the Gulf of Maine to northern waters (e.g., Bay of Fundy). To enter Cape Cod Bay, right whales must traverse an area of dense shipping and fishing activity in Massachusetts Bay, where there are no mandatory regulations for the protection of right whales or management of their habitat. We used passive acoustic recordings of right whales collected in Massachusetts Bay from May 2007 through October 2010 to determine the annual spatial and temporal distribution of the whales and their calling activity. We detected right whales in the bay throughout the year, in contrast to results from visual surveys. Right whales were detected on at least 24% of days in each month, with the exception of June 2007, in which there were no detections. Averaged over all years, right whale calls were most abundant from February through May. During this period, calls were most frequent between 17:00 and 20:00 local time; no diel pattern was apparent in other months. The spatial distribution of the approximate locations of calling whales suggests they may use Massachusetts Bay as a conduit to Cape Cod Bay in the spring and as they move between the Gulf of Maine and waters to the south in September through December. Although it is unclear how dependent right whales are on the bay, the discovery of their widespread presence in Massachusetts Bay throughout the year suggests this region may need to be managed to reduce the probability of collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear.

AB  - Understanding the marine soundscape is of growing importance to the National Marine Sanctuaries. In the center of Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a new Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) project has begun. Using the power and communications infrastructure of the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) cabled observatory, we deployed a broadband, digital, omnidirectional hydrophone on Smooth Ridge, near the MARS node (36 degrees 42.75'N, 122 degrees 11.21'W; depth 891 m). The system has been recording almost continuously since 28 July 2015. Natural biological sound (biophony) dominated long-term spectral average results at frequencies below 50 Hz, showing seasonal patterns in baleen whale vocalizations. Prevalence of blue whale vocalizations during August through October 2015 was succeeded by prevalence of fin whale vocalizations during November 2015 through January 2016. Diel variations (stronger signal at night) were evident for both species. In the high-frequency range, beaked whale clicks have been detected and represent a focus for advancing automated detection and classification methods. Biophonic richness in this soundscape was also indicated by human-expert analysis results for a one-week period, during which biological sound events were detected 86% of the time. Examination of natural physical sound (geophony) has included rainfall and the relationship between wind speed and ambient sound. The first 10 months of data showed that sound levels at 2 kHz followed Wenz curve predictions for wind speeds above 5 m/s. Examination of human-made sound (anthrophony) has included noise from vessel traffic and explosions detonated underwater during fishery operations. This new PAM project is providing extensive information on biophony, geophony, and anthrophony in this deep soundscape, information that is essential to understanding and managing acoustic habitat of the Sanctuary.

AB  - Current knowledge of the population size and movement of fin whales in the northeast Pacific is lacking, but is critical in implementing effective management actions. Here we used ocean gliders to survey the deep-coastal and offshore waters of Vancouver Island to add to what is known about fin whale habitat use in the Canadian Pacific. Passive acoustic recordings were made continuously, from which fin whale vocalizations were used as a proxy to presence. Oceanographic and preyscape variables were also taken to better delineate habitat units in horizontal and vertical space. Comparisons were made between on-shelf and shelf-break zones, and measures taken in- and out-side submarine canyons. Temporal comparisons between winter and spring were also possible. An on-shelf and shelf-break divide was seen, with cooler, fresher waters present closer to the coast for both deployments. The spring deployment showed fin whale acoustic presence focused around topographical features, including the shelf-break and canyons. The most prevalent cue was their 40-Hz call, which suggests foraging. Echosounder readings suggested denser aggregations of larger bodied zooplankton prey were present at canyon heads and along the shelf break. During the winter, calls in the acoustic record were more numerous than in the spring, and dominated by the 20-Hz call. A proportion of the recordings also showed 'song' patterning, which suggests breeding activity. Interpolated surfaces were used to examine the spatiotemporal relationships between the high-resolution habitat point data and presence of far-propagating fin whale calls. The predicted use of habitat by fin whales, as represented by their calls, was examined through Random Forest machine learning models using oceanographic and preyscape measures as input variables from these interpolations. Distance from the shelf break and preyscape variables were determined important in predicting whale habitat use in the spring, with model accuracy exceeding 80%. Call presence showed a much weaker relationship to environmental variables for the winter recordings with reduced accuracy of model predictions (13%). An understanding of habitat selection by fin whales may also aid in determining the importance of habitat units and areas that may critical to life history functions.

AB  - Squid play an important role in biomass turnover in marine ecosystems and constitute a food source for similar to 90% of all echolocating toothed whale species. Nonetheless, it has been hypothesized that the soft bodies of squid provide echoes too weak to be detected by toothed whale biosonars, and that only the few hard parts of the squid body may generate significant backscatter. We measured the acoustic backscatter from the common squid Loligo pealeii for signals similar to toothed whale echolocation clicks using an energy detector to mimic the mammalian auditory system. We show that the dorsal target strengths of L. pealeii with mantle lengths between 23 and 26 cm fall in the range from -38 to -44 dB, and that the pen, beak and lenses do not contribute significantly to the backscatter. Thus, the muscular mantle and fins of L. pealeii constitute a sufficient sonar target for individual biosonar detection by toothed whales at ranges between 25 and 325 m, depending on squid size, noise levels, click source levels, and orientation of the ensonified squid. While epipelagic squid must be fast and muscular to catch prey and avoid visual predators, it is hypothesized that some deep-water squid may have adopted passive acoustic crypsis, with a body of low muscle mass and low metabolism that will render them less conspicuous to echolocating predators.

AB  - Call source levels, transmission loss, and ambient noise levels were estimated for North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) up-calls recorded in the southeastern Bering Sea in autumn of 2000 and 2001. Distances to calling animals, needed to estimate source levels, were based on two independent techniques: (1) arrival-time differences on three or more hydrophones and (2) shallow-water dispersion of normal modes on a single receiver. Average root-mean-square (rms) call source levels estimated by the two techniques were 178 and 176 dB re 1 mu Pa at 1 m, respectively, over the up-call frequency band, which was determined per call and averaged 90 to 170 Hz. Peak-to-peak source levels were 14 to 22 dB greater than rms levels. Transmission loss was approximately 15*log(10)(range), intermediate between cylindrical and spherical spreading. Ambient ocean noise within the up-call band varied from 72 to 91 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz. Under average noise conditions, call spectrograms were detectable for whales at distances up to 100 km, but propagation and detection distance may vary depending on environmental parameters and anthropogenic noise. Obtaining distances to animals and acoustic detection range is a step toward using long-term passive acoustic recordings to estimate abundance for this critically endangered whale population.

AB  - A wide range of anthropogenic structures exist in the marine environment with the extent of these set to increase as the global offshore renewable energy industry grows. Many of these pose acute risks to marine wildlife; for example, tidal energy generators have the potential to injure or kill seals and small cetaceans through collisions with moving turbine parts. Information on fine scale behaviour of animals close to operational turbines is required to understand the likely impact of these new technologies. There are inherent challenges associated with measuring the underwater movements of marine animals which have, so far, limited data collection. Here, we describe the development and application of a system for monitoring the three-dimensional movements of cetaceans in the immediate vicinity of a subsea structure. The system comprises twelve hydrophones and software for the detection and localisation of vocal marine mammals. We present data demonstrating the systems practical performance during a deployment on an operational tidal turbine between October 2017 and October 2019. Three-dimensional locations of cetaceans were derived from the passive acoustic data using time of arrival differences on each hydrophone. Localisation accuracy was assessed with an artificial sound source at known locations and a refined method of error estimation is presented. Calibration trials show that the system can accurately localise sounds to 2m accuracy within 20m of the turbine but that localisations become highly inaccurate at distances greater than 35m. The system is currently being used to provide data on rates of encounters between cetaceans and the turbine and to provide high resolution tracking data for animals close to the turbine. These data can be used to inform stakeholders and regulators on the likely impact of tidal turbines on cetaceans.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring, mitigation, animal density estimation, and comprehensive understanding of the impact of sound on marine animals all require accurate information on vocalization source level to be most effective. This study focused on examining the uncertainty related to passive sonar equation terms that ultimately contribute to the variability observed in estimated source levels of fin whale calls. Differences in hardware configuration, signal detection methods, sample size, location, and time were considered in interpreting the variability of estimated fin whale source levels. Data from Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean and off Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean provided the opportunity to generate large datasets of estimated source levels to better understand sources of uncertainty leading to the observed variability with and across years. Average seasonal source levels from the Wake Island dataset ranged from 175 to 188 dB re 1 lPa m, while the 2007-2008 seasonal average detected off Portugal was 189 dB re 1 lPa m. Owing to the large inherent variability within and across this and other studies that potentially masks true differences between populations, there is no evidence to conclude that the source level of 20-Hz fin whale calls are regionally or population specific.

AB  - One of the best ways of studying animals that produce signals in underwater environments is to use passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Acoustic monitoring is used to study marine mammals in oceans, and gives us information for understanding cetacean life, such as their behaviour, movement or reproduction. Automated analysis for captured sound is almost essential because of the large quantity of data. A deep learning approach was chosen for this task, since it has proven great efficiency for answering such problematics. This study focused on the orcas (Orcinus orca) of northern Vancouver Island, Canada, in collaboration with the NGO Orcalab which developed a multihydrophone recording station around Hanson Island to study orcas. The acoustic station is composed of 5 hydrophones and extends over 50 km2 of ocean. Since 2016 we are continuously streaming the hydrophone signals to our laboratory at Toulon, France, yielding nearly 50 TB of synchronous multichannel recordings. The objective for this research is to do a preliminary analysis of the collected data and demonstrate influence of environmental factors (tidal, moon phase and daily period) on the orcas' acoustic activities.

AB  - Density estimation for marine mammal species is performed primarily using visual distance sampling or capture-recapture. Minke whales in Hawaiian waters are very difficult to sight; however, they produce a distinctive "boing" call, making them ideal candidates for passive acoustic density estimation. We used an array of 14 bottom-mounted hydrophones, distributed over a 60 x 30 km area off Kauai, Hawaii, to estimate density during 12 d of recordings in early 2006. We converted the number of acoustic cues (i.e., boings) detected using signal processing software into a cue density by accounting for the false positive rate and probability of detection. The former was estimated by manual validation, the latter by applying spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods to a subset of data where we had determined which hydrophones detected each call. Estimated boing density was 130 boings per hour per 10,000 km(2) (95% CI 104-163). Little is known about the population's acoustic behavior, so conversion from boing to animal density is difficult. As a demonstration of the method, we used a tentative boing rate of 6.04 boings per hour, from a single animal tracked in 2009, to give an estimate of 21.5 boing-calling minke whales per 10,000 km(2).

AB  - Calling depth distributions are estimated for two types of calls produced by critically endangered eastern North Pacific right whales (NPRWs) in the Bering Sea, using passive acoustic data collected with bottom-mounted hydrophone recorders. Nonlinear time resampling of 12 NPRW "upcalls" and 20 "gunshots" recorded in a critical NPRW habitat isolated individual normal mode arrivals from each call. The relative modal arrival times permitted range estimates between 1 and 40 km, while the relative modal amplitudes permitted call depth estimates, provided that environmental inversions were obtained from high signal-to-noise ratio calls. Gunshot sounds were generally only produced at a few meters depth, while upcall depths clustered between 10 and 25 m, consistent with previously published bioacoustic tagging results from North Atlantic right whales. A Wilcoxon rank sum test rejected the null hypothesis that the mean calling depths of the two call types were the same (p = 2.9 x 10(-5)); the null hypothesis was still rejected if the sample set was restricted to one call per acoustic encounter (p = 0.02). Propagation modeling demonstrates that deeper depths enhance acoustic propagation and that source depth estimates impact both NPRW upcall source level and detection range estimates.

AB  - Understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of bowhead whales is ecologically and culturally important in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Long-term monitoring can reveal alterations in the bowhead whale distribution range, spatiotemporal patterns, and migration phenology that can be responses to global change. However, Arctic ecosystems are challenging to monitor. Here, we deployed passive acoustic recorders at three locations in the southern Amundsen Gulf (western Canadian Arctic) between September 2018 and September 2019 to detect bowhead whale presence, quantify their seasonal occurrence, and examine the oceanographic conditions that correlate with bowhead occurrence. Results show clear seasonal patterns in the occurrence of bowheads with increased acoustic presence in spring/summer at all sites. In contrast to their typical migratory behavior, bowhead sounds were detected throughout the year at all sites, providing evidence of a number of overwintering animals in what is normally their summer feeding ground. The continuous occupancy of bowheads from May to August at all sites emphasizes the importance of this area as a core foraging ground for this population. Our results indicate a clear selection for the shallowest habitat over an annual cycle. Statistical habitat modeling indicated associations between bowhead occurrence and decreasing sea-ice coverage, wind speed, temperature, and salinity. Positive relationships between bowhead detections and zooplankton density suggest a predator-prey dynamic. These results are the first that cover an entire annual cycle of bowhead presence in the southern Amundsen Gulf, providing new knowledge and current status of bowhead habitat use to support effective management under ongoing Arctic change.

AB  - Successful conservation and management of marine top predators rely on detailed documentation of spatiotemporal behavior. For cetacean species, this information is key to defining stocks, habitat use, and mitigating harmful interactions. Research focused on this goal is employing methodologies such as visual observations, tag data, and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. However, many studies are temporally limited or focus on only one or few species. In this study, we make use of an existing long-term (2009-2019), labeled PAM data set to examine spatiotemporal patterning of at least 10 odontocete (toothed whale) species in the Hawaiian Islands using compositional analyses and modeling techniques. Species composition differs among considered sites, and this difference is robust to seasonal movement patterns. Temporally, hour of day was the most significant predictor of detection across species and sites, followed by season, though patterns differed among species. We describe long-term trends in species detection at one site and note that they are markedly similar for many species. These trends may be related to long-term, underlying oceanographic cycles that will be the focus of future study. We demonstrate the variability of temporal patterns even at relatively close sites, which may imply that wide-ranging models of species presence are missing key fine-scale movement patterns. Documented seasonal differences in detection also highlights the importance of considering season in survey design both regionally and elsewhere. We emphasize the utility of long-term, continuous monitoring in highlighting temporal patterns that may relate to underlying climatic states and help us predict responses to climate change. We conclude that long-term PAM records are a valuable resource for documenting spatiotemporal patterns and can contribute many insights into the lives of top predators, even in highly studied regions such as the Hawaiian Islands.

AB  - Killer whales around Crozet Islands consume a great variety of preys, including fish, penguins (Eudyptes sp.), elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), and, occasionally, large cetacea. Predation techniques used on elephant seals and penguins, which are easily observed from the shore, are described. Hydrophones were used to record the acoustic behaviour of the whales during their hunts for both types of prey. The successful predation of 29 elephant seals was observed, 24 of which were weaned pups. Seats were captured along the banks (n = 3), near river outlets (n = 14), by voluntary stranding of the whales on the beaches (n = 7), or by attack of seals swimming in bays (n = 5). Hunting techniques were routinely used in "strategic" points apparently chosen specifically according to the location and climatic factors. King penguins were hunted along the banks (n = 13), particularly where algae prevailed, or offshore (n = 32). While hunting, whales tended to be very quiet and used acoustic signals sparingly, emitting a few isolated clicks and short distance contact calls. Reactions of whales exposed to artificial sounds tended to show that they localize their prey by passive listening. When an elephant seal was captured, long distance contact calls characterized by excitement were emitted 72% of the time and resulted in the arrival, by "porpoising, " of the most distant members of the group, along with whales of other groups coming from several kilometers away. The author hypothesizes that the adaptive value of this behaviour is to allow the size of the hunting unit to adjust itself to the size of the prey by permitting not only members of the same groupu to associate, but also members of other groups to associate temporarily.

AB  - Information on individual calling behaviour and source levels are important for understanding acoustically mediated social interactions of marine mammals, for which visual observations are difficult to obtain. Our study, conducted in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SB-NMS), located in the Gulf of Maine, USA, used passive acoustic arrays to track North Atlantic minke whales and assess the sound production behaviour of individuals. A total of 18 minke whales were acoustically tracked in this study. Individual calling rates were variable, with a median inter-call interval (ICI) of 60.3 s. Average source levels (SLrms) for minke whales pulse trains ranged between 164 and 168 dB re 1 mu Pa, resulting in a minimum detection range of 0.4-10.2 km for these calls in this urban, coastal environment. All tracked animals were actively swimming at a speed of 5.0 +/- 1.2 km/h, which matches swimming speeds of migrating minke whales from other areas and confirms SBNMS as part of the migration route of this species in the Western North Atlantic. Tracked minke whales produced 7 discrete call types belonging to 3 main categories, yet no individual produced all call types. Instead, minke whales produced 2 multisyllabic call sequences (A and B) by combining 3-4 different call types in a non-random order. While 7 of the tracked individuals produced calling pattern A, 10 whales used calling pattern B, and only 1 animal combined call types differently. Animals producing different call sequences were in acoustic range of one another on several occasions, suggesting they may use these sequences for mediating social interactions. The fact that the same calling patterns were shared by several individuals suggests that these patterns may contain information related to sex, age or behavioural context.

AB  - Data from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of Navy training ranges can be used to test predictions of marine mammal responsiveness to naval sonar from experimental behavioral response studies. Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) vocalizations were detected, classified, localized, and associated into individual tracks from data collected on bottom-mounted hydrophones on the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility located off Kauai, Hawaii. Data were analyzed from before, during, and after naval undersea warfare training activities in February 2014 and February 2017. The spatial distribution of acoustically derived whale tracks was modelled using "latitude," "longitude," "depth," "year," and "phase" (Before, During, and After) as covariates. It was found that, as well as inter-annual variability across all phases, the distribution of calling whales changed in both years, with fewer tracks in the vicinity of the center of ship activity in the During phase compared with the Before phase. This redistribution of calls extended for approximately five days after the end of the training activity in both years. As the data are from PAM, it is unknown whether this change in the probability of acoustic presence across the range is a result of whales moving away from the range or ceasing calling, or perhaps a combination of both. The expectation from experimental studies is that minke whales will exhibit avoidance in response to naval sonar activity. We conclude that this is a probable explanation for the results reported here, particularly given the nature of the redistribution (an increase in some areas distant from the center of ship activity coincident with a decrease near the center) and the time taken for the distribution observed in the Before phase to re-establish in the After phase of both years.

AB  - Simple Summary Death-related behaviors have been often observed in cetaceans, frequently with a female caregiver (presumed mother) supporting a dead calf by carrying, lifting, or sinking it, generally accompanied by other escorting individuals. However, how cetaceans experience death and if their behavior could be compared to human grieving is still largely unknown, as well as their acoustic production in such contexts. This report describes two cases of an adult common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) supporting a dead newborn and associated acoustic behavior in the Tiber River estuary area (Rome, Mediterranean Sea, Italy). In both cases, a main supporter (putative mother) was observed interacting with the carcass of a newborn by lifting (case 1) and sinking it (case 2), always escorted by another adult individual. Several vocalizations were recorded, including a signature whistle (a tonal sound with a repeated, stereotyped, individual-specific frequency modulation pattern) in the first case, likely emitted by the putative mother to seek aid from other individuals. This result appears reasonable since bottlenose dolphins are a highly vocal species, that communicates mainly through acoustic signals. These observations confirm the occurrence of death-related supportive behavior in bottlenose dolphins and report a preliminary description of associated vocalizations, providing additional information on this largely unknown topic. Epimeletic behavior toward dead calves has been frequently reported in cetaceans, mostly with females (presumed mothers) showing supportive behaviors such as carrying, lifting, or sinking, often assisted by "escort" individuals. However, information on acoustic production in such contexts is scarce. This report describes two observations of epimeletic behavior toward dead newborns in bottlenose dolphins and associated acoustic production. Data were collected at the Tiber River estuary (Rome, Mediterranean Sea, Italy) with one hydrophone for passive acoustic monitoring and two digital cameras. In both cases, an individual (presumed mother) acting as the main supporter and directly interacting with the carcass by lifting it (case 1) or sinking it (case 2) was observed. Another adult individual (escort) was present in both encounters showing standing-by and excitement behaviors (case 1) and supportive behavior (case 2). In both encounters, whistles, pulsed sounds, and bray-call elements were recorded. The consistent vocal activity observed likely conveyed context-specific information. A signature whistle in the first encounter was also recorded, likely emitted by the putative mother as a distress call. This report confirms the occurrence of epimeletic behavior in bottlenose dolphins and reports a preliminary description of the acoustic production when a dead calf is involved, providing additional information on this largely unknown topic.

AB  - Quantitatively describing the acoustic repertoire of a species is important for establishing effective passive acoustic monitoring programs and developing automated call detectors. This process is particularly important when the study site is remote and visual surveys are not cost effective. Little is known about the vocal behavior of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) in New Zealand. The aim of this study was to describe and quantify their entire vocal repertoire on calving grounds in the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands. Over three austral winters (2010-2012), 4349 calls were recorded, measured, and classified into 10 call types. The most frequently observed types were pulsive, upcall, and tonal low vocalizations. A long tonal low call (<= 15.5 s duration) and a very high call (peak frequency similar to 750 Hz) were described for the first time. Random Forest multivariate analysis of 28 measured variables was used to classify calls with a high degree of accuracy (82%). The most important variables for classification were maximum ceiling frequency, number of inflection points, duration, and the difference between the start and end frequency. This classification system proved to be a repeatable, fast, and objective method for categorising right whale calls and shows promise for other vocal taxa. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The endangered Rice's whale Balaenoptera ricei, with fewer than 100 individuals remaining, is the only year-round resident baleen whale found in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and occurs primarily along the northeastern shelf break near De Soto Canyon. Historical whaling records and predictive density modeling suggest that these whales potentially could occur more broadly throughout the GOM. High levels of anthropogenic activities in the GOM, including oil and gas exploration and extraction, fisheries, shipping, and the unprecedented Deepwater Horizon oil spill, highlight the need to better understand the distribution, ecology, and threats to this small population to improve protection of these endangered whales. We used long-term passive acoustic recordings from the northwestern GOM shelf break to explore the extent of Rice's whale distribution in the northern GOM and to evaluate whether they exhibit seasonal movements throughout this range. We describe 6 new stereotyped variants of Rice's whale long-moan calls, found predominantly in the western GOM, that share distinctive features with typical eastern long-moans, including a 150 Hz starting tone, an approximately 100 Hz tail with amplitude modulation, and a long call duration ranging from 10 to 35 s. Western long-moan variants were detected at 3 northwestern sites, occurring sporadically throughout the year on as many as 16% of days at the westernmost site, and infrequently at an eastern core-habitat site. These results indicate that some whales persistently occur over a broader range in the GOM than previously understood, which is important to consider when designating critical habitat and assessing threats to this Critically Endangered species.

AB  - Passive acoustic methods are increasingly being used to estimate animal population density. Most density estimation methods are based on estimates of the probability of detecting calls as functions of distance. Typically these are obtained using receivers capable of localizing calls or from studies of tagged animals. However, both approaches are expensive to implement. The approach described here uses a MonteCarlo model to estimate the probability of detecting calls from single sensors. The passive sonar equation is used to predict signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of received clicks, which are then combined with a detector characterization that predicts probability of detection as a function of SNR. Input distributions for source level, beam pattern, and whale depth are obtained from the literature. Acoustic propagation modeling is used to estimate transmission loss. Other inputs for density estimation are call rate, obtained from the literature, and false positive rate, obtained from manual analysis of a data sample. The method is applied to estimate density of Blainville's beaked whales over a 6-day period around a single hydrophone located in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas. Results are consistent with those from previous analyses, which use additional tag data. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3583504]

AB  - Underwater noise is a significant pollutant produced by anthropogenic activities carried out in the sea. Several types of acoustic sources can potentially have adverse impacts on marine fauna, especially on cetaceans. The vocalization response of cetaceans to underwater noise varies depending on noise characteristics such as duration, bandwidth, and intensity, as well as the species being insonified. Some studies report changes in vocalization properties due to continuous noise, but there is a lack of knowledge regarding impulsive noise sources, especially those related to explosive events. It is known that underwater explosions represent a serious threat to marine fauna because it produces one of the highest sound pressure levels introduced by anthropogenic activities. In this communication, an opportunistic study related to changes in the dolphin vocalizations was performed by considering two scenarios (i.e., before and after a detonation event). The acoustic raw data were recorded by a passive acoustic device installed in a mooring line deployed in the Mediterranean coast of Spain. The objective of the experimental installation was to monitor the underwater sound pressure level in the framework of the development of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in Spain. A detonation event of unknown origin was recorded during the monitoring period while Delphinids were vocalizing, allowing for the observation of their acoustic reaction to the explosion. The study considers the number of vocalizations, morphology of whistles, and spectral characteristics before and after the explosion. The results obtained indicate that the number of whistles, their complexity in terms of morphology, and spectral components vary due to the explosive event, showing significant differences that will be presented and discussed in this communication.

AB  - This paper describes a method for real-time, autonomous, joint detection-classification of humpback whale vocalizations. The approach adapts the spectrogram correlation method used by Mellinger and Clark [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 107, 3518-3529 (2000)] for bowhead whale endnote detection to the humpback whale problem. The objective is the implementation of a system to determine the presence or absence of humpback whales with passive acoustic methods and to perform this classification with low false alarm rate in real time. Multiple correlation kernels are used due to the diversity of humpback song. The approach also takes advantage of the fact that humpbacks tend to vocalize repeatedly for extended periods of time, and identification is declared only when multiple song units are detected within a fixed time interval. Humpback whale vocalizations from Alaska, Hawaii, and Stellwagen Bank were used to train the algorithm. It was then tested on independent data obtained off Kaena Point, Hawaii in February and March of 2009. Results show that the algorithm successfully classified humpback whales autonomously in real time, with a measured probability of correct classification in excess of 74% and a measured probability of false alarm below 1%.

AB  - A passive acoustic method is developed to estimate whale density from their calling activity in a monitored area. The algorithm is applied to a loquacious species, the white whale (Delphinapterus leucas), in Saguenay fjord mouth near Tadoussac, Canada, which is severely affected by shipping noise. Beluga calls were recorded from cabled coastal hydrophones deployed in the basin while the animal density was estimated visually from systematic observations from a fixed-point on the shore. Beluga calling activity was estimated from an algorithm extracting the call events in time-frequency space, while simultaneously tracking the masking intensity resulting from local shipping noise. The activity index was summarized in 15- and 30-min bins using four different metrics. For bins containing more than 40% of valid data, the metrics were compared to the corresponding visual observations. The estimated mean acoustic detection range generally exceeded the fjord width, and extended to the whole similar to 3-km long monitored area under low-noise conditions. The significant linear relations of the visual estimates with the calling activity metrics allowed assessing expected number of visually detected belugas in the basin from a weighted regression model, with a mean standard error of 7.1%.

AB  - Effective management of wild animal populations relies on an understanding of their spatio-temporal distributions. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a noninvasive method to investigate the distribution of free-ranging species that reliably produce sound. Critically endangered Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) (ABWs) co-occur with pygmy blue whales (B. m. brevicauda) (PBWs) around New Zealand. Nationally, both are listed as "data deficient" due to difficulties in access and visual sub-species identification. PAM was used to investigate the distributions of blue whales via sub-species specific song detections in central New Zealand. Propagation models, incorporating ambient noise data, enabled the comparison of detections among recording locations in different marine environments. ABW detections peaked during austral winter and spring, indicating that New Zealand, and the South Taranaki Bight (STB) in particular, is a migratory corridor for ABWs. Some ABW calls were also detected during the breeding season (September and October). PBW calls were highly concentrated in the STB, particularly between March and May, suggesting that an aggregation of PBWs may occur here. Therefore, the STB is of great importance for both sub-species of blue whale. PBW detections were absent from the STB during parts of austral spring, but PBWs were detected at east coast locations during this time. Detection area models were valuable when interpreting and comparing detections among recording locations. The results provide sub-species specific information required for management of critically endangered ABWs and highlight the relative importance of central New Zealand for both sub-species of blue whale.

AB  - Passive acoustics is one of the methods for marine mammal observations. This approach is complementary of visual observations or use of tags. Different projects for marine mammals' acoustics observatory (permanent or mobile) are actually in construction. A part of them are included in biggest multidisciplinary projects and especially in geophysics projects. We join the Antares project for at least 2 reasons. Firstly, the Antares neutrino detector is built in one of the Mediterranean Sea hotspots. Secondly, many sensors is used for this neutrino detector anti especially hydrophones with appropriate bandwidth for marine mammal observations. We first briefly present the ESONET Network and then the ANTARES telescope. We then illustrate the real-time analyses that we can run on ANTARES data. We finaly discuss on the ANTARES extensions in the Ligure Sea and its impact on cetacean studies monitoring.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering in American Samoan waters belong to the endangered Oceania subpopulation (IUCN Red List), but survey effort in this region has been relatively limited. Humpback whale seasonal occurrence was assessed using long-term passive acoustic recordings from March 2008 to July 2009 at Tutuila, the most populous island of American Samoa, and October 2008 to September 2009 at the remote Rose Atoll, 240 km to the east. Humpback whale song occurred from mid-July through November at both locations. For days with song, the mean number of recordings per day with song was significantly greater at Tutuila than at Rose Atoll. Song incidence at Rose Atoll peaked at 82% of recordings/day in late September 2008, and at Tutuila 70-100% of recordings contained song in late August through early September 2009, when recording ceased. Song incidence at Rose Atoll decreased at midday and increased at midnight, whereas there was no significant diurnal pattern at Tutuila. The lower overall incidence of song and its episodic nature at Rose Atoll suggest lower densities of whales traveling through the likely smaller detection area there, whereas greater song incidence and longer peak periods at Tutuila suggest greater whale densities and longer residence times.

AB  - The vocal repertoire of the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) is poorly documented, with no published information about acoustic signals from South Atlantic Ocean populations. We conducted passive acoustic monitoring and recording of S. attenuata population in the Santos Basin, Brazil, using a towed hydrophone array during line-transects surveys. Our monitoring yielded whistle samples derived from eight groups of S. attenuata, from which we selected 155 whistles for further analysis. Approximately 48% of the whistles presented ultrasonic frequency values, with maximum frequencies up to 31.1 kHz. Across the sample, the number of steps ranged from 0 to 20 and inflection points ranged from 0 to 8. On average, end frequencies were higher than start frequencies, and whistles generally presented wide frequency ranges, with an average of 11.3 kHz. The most predominant whistle contour category was "ascending-descending." Our study provides new information regarding the acoustic repertoire of this poorly documented species and will aid efforts for using acoustics to identify and monitor cetaceans in this region.

AB  - To better understand fin whale vocalization behaviour in the Norwegian and Barents Seas, a large-aperture densely sampled coherent hydrophone array was deployed in late winter 2014 to monitor their vocalizations instantaneously over wide areas via passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS). Here, we (i) provide a time-frequency characterization for different call types observed (20Hz pulses, 130Hz upsweeps, 30-100Hz downsweep chirps, and 18-19Hz backbeats); (ii) compare their relative abundances in three different coastal regions off Alesund, Lofoten, and Northern Finnmark; (iii) estimate the temporal and spatial distributions; (iv) source level distributions; and (v) probability of detection (PoD) regions for the more abundant 20Hz pulse and 130Hz upsweep call types. The fin whale vocalizations received over the diel cycle (24h) were significantly more abundant by a factor of roughly seven off Northern Finnmark than the other two regions, associated with fish feeding activities. The source levels are estimated to be 190.5 +/- 7.4 dB for the fin whale 20Hz pulses and 170.3 +/- 5.2dB for the 130Hz upsweeps. We find that fin whales are capable of producing each vocalization type either independently or simultaneously with other types, and the 20Hz sound production in the fin whales involves a mechanism that generates a significantly less-intense second-order harmonic of the fundamental.

KW  - WAVE ATTENUATION
KW  - MIXTURES
AB  - Many marine mammal species are highly social and are frequently encountered in groups or aggregations. When conducting passive acoustic monitoring in such circumstances, recordings commonly contain vocalizations of multiple individuals which overlap in time and frequency. This paper considers the use of blind source separation as a method for processing these recordings to separate the calls of individuals. The example problem considered here is that of the songs of humpback whales. The high levels of noise and long impulse responses can make source separation in underwater contexts a challenging proposition. The approach present here is based on time-frequency masking, allied to a noise reduction process. The technique is assessed using simulated and measured data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for separating humpback whale songs.

AB  - To investigate the potential impacts of naval mine neutralization exercises (MINEX) on odontocete cetaceans, a long-term passive acoustic monitoring study was conducted at a US Navy training range near Virginia Beach, USA. Bottom-moored acoustic recorders were deployed in 2012-2016 near the epicentre of MINEX training activity and were refurbished every 2-4 months. Recordings were analysed for the daily presence/absence of dolphins, and dolphin acoustic activity was quantified in detail for the hours and days before and after 31 MINEX training events. Dolphins occurred in the area year-round, but there was clear seasonal variability, with lower presence during winter months. Dolphins exhibited a behavioural response to underwater detonations. Dolphin acoustic activity near the training location was lower during the hours and days following detonations, suggesting that animals left the area and/or reduced their signalling. Concurrent acoustic monitoring farther away from the training area suggested that the radius of response was between 3 and 6 km. A generalized additive model indicated that the predictors that explained the greatest amount of deviance in the data were the day relative to the training event, the hour of the day and circumstances specific to each training event.

AB  - In this paper, we present an automatic method, without human supervision, for the detection and classification of blue whale vocalizations from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data using Hidden Markov Model technology implemented with a state-of-the-art machine learning platform, the Kaldi speech processing toolkit. 157.5 hours of PAM data were annotated for model training and testing, selected from a dataset collected from the Corcovado Gulf, Chilean Patagonia in 2016. The system obtained produced 85.3% accuracy for detection and classification of a range of different blue whale vocalizations. This system was then validated by comparing its unsupervised detection and classification results with the published results of southeast Pacific blue whale song phrase ('SEP2') via spectrogram cross-correlation, involving a dataset collected with a different hydrophone instrument. The proposed system led to a reduction in the root mean square error relative to published results as high as 80% when compared with comparable methods employed elsewhere. This is a significant step in advancing the monitoring of endangered whale populations in this region, which remains poorly covered in terms of PAM and general ocean observation. With further training, testing and validation, this system can be applied to other target signals and regions of the world ocean.

AB  - Habitat preferences of calling blue whales were investigated using data from two multidisciplinary oceanographic cruises conducted off the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during the austral falls of 2001 and 2002. Data were collected on depth, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration, krill biomass, zooplankton abundance, and blue whale call presence. In 2001, the study area was sea ice free, high Chl-a concentrations occurred over a small area, krill biomass and zooplankton abundance were high, and few blue whale calls were detected. In 2002 the sea ice covered the southern part of the survey area. Chl-a was high over a large area, krill and zooplankton were low, and there were more blue whale calls. Logistic regression analysis revealed blue whale calls were positively correlated with depth and SST, and negatively correlated with the mean zooplankton abundance from 101 to 300 m and the mean krill biomass in the top 100 m. The negative correlation between blue whale calls and zooplankton could occur if feeding animals do not produce calls. Our survey area did not cover the full range of blue whale habitat off the WAP, as blue whales probably follow the melting and freezing ice edge through this region. Passive acoustics can provide insight to mesoscale habitat use by blue whales in the Southern Ocean where visual sightings are rare, but the ability to localize on the calling animals would greatly improve the ability to model at a finer scale.

AB  - An autonomous surface vehicle known as a wave glider, instrumented with a low-power towed hydrophone array and embedded digital signal processor, is demonstrated as a viable low-noise system for the passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals. Other key design elements include high spatial resolution beamforming on a 32-channel towed hydrophone array, deep array deployment depth, vertical motion isolation, and bandwidth-efficient real-time acoustic data transmission. Using at-sea data collected during a simultaneous deployment of three wave glider-based acoustic detection systems near Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in September 2019, the capability of a low-frequency towed hydrophone array to spatially reject noise and to resolve baleen whale vocalizations from anthropogenic acoustic clutter is demonstrated. In particular, mean measured array gain of 15.3 dB at the aperture design frequency results in a post-beamformer signal-to-noise ratio that significantly exceeds that of a single hydrophone. Further, it is shown that with overlapping detections on multiple collaborating systems, precise localization of vocalizing individuals is achievable at long ranges. Last, model predictions showing a 4x detection range, or 16x area coverage, advantage of a 32-channel towed array over a single hydrophone against the North Atlantic right whale upcall are presented for the continental shelf environment south of Martha's Vineyard.

AB  - Passive acoustic towed linear arrays are increasingly used to detect marine mammal sounds during mobile anthropogenic activities. However, these arrays cannot resolve between signals arriving from the port or starboard without vessel course changes or multiple cable deployments, and their performance is degraded by vessel self-noise and non-acoustic mechanical vibration. In principle acoustic vector sensors can resolve these directional ambiguities, as well as flag the presence of non-acoustic contamination, provided that the vibration-sensitive sensors can be successfully integrated into compact tow modules. Here a vector sensor module attached to the end of a 800 m towed array is used to detect and localize 1813 sperm whale "clicks" off the coast of Sitka, AK. Three methods were used to identify frequency regimes relatively free of non-acoustic noise contamination, and then the active intensity (propagating energy) of the signal was computed between 4-10 kHz along three orthogonal directions, providing unambiguous bearing estimates of two sperm whales over time. These bearing estimates are consistent with those obtained via conventional methods, but the standard deviations of the vector sensor bearing estimates are twice those of the conventionally-derived bearings. The resolved ambiguities of the bearings deduced from vessel course changes match the vector sensor predictions. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3495945]

AB  - Pacific Environmental Lab of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (PMEL/NOAA), with support from Ocean Exploration, has extended its hydrophone monitoring capability to the eastern Pacific by installing "Pioneer Seamount Acoustic Observatory" off California. Recently in the western Pacific, five moored autonomous hydrophones have been added to explore and monitor volcanic activity in the Mariana Islands. As a result, our passive autonomous hydrophone networks cover vast areas of the global oceans, and currently collect acoustic data at a rate of approximately 1 GByte/day. These data allow detection of low-magnitude seismicity associated with volcanic activity with more accurate source locations than from land-based seismic networks. The data are also used to study the distribution of large baleen whales in the open ocean, which is otherwise expensive to access. Drawing on our extensive collection of acoustic data and expertise in hydrophone technology development, in 2002 we created and executed a public outreach program called "Sound in the Sea." The program teaches middle and high school students the fundamentals of ocean acoustics. Using actual PMEL/NOAA hydrophone data, students explore epicenters of underwater earthquakes and identities of different species of whales based on their vocalization characteristics. Students also learn how to make a simple hydrophone using glue and a plastic eggshell (the "Easter egg hydrophone"), which they test dockside in Yaquina Bay, Oregon. The "Sound in the Sea" program provides an exciting hands-on experience.

AB  - The songs of the male humpback whales have traditionally been associated with breeding activities at low latitude breeding grounds during winter. This study provides the first detailed analysis of humpback whale songs recorded in the subarctic waters of Iceland using passive acoustic recorders. Recordings were collected during three winter seasons: 2008-2009, 2009-2010, and 2011 during which singing was detected in all seasons. Peak song occurrence was during January-February in all years; this coincides with the timing of the peak breeding season of humpback whales in the Northern hemisphere. A total of 2810 song units from all years were measured and statistically divided into 14 groups, which constructed 25 phrases. The song unit repertoires included stable song unit types that occurred frequently in songs during all years while the occurrence of other song unit types varied more between years. Around 60% of the phrases were conserved between the first two study seasons, while the majority of phrases found during the last study season had not been observed before. This study indicates the importance of a subarctic feeding ground for song progression and song exchange and possibly as an opportunistic mating ground for migrating or overwintering humpback whales.

AB  - Marine seismic surveys are under increasing scrutiny because of concern that they may disturb or otherwise harm marine mammals and impede their communications. Most of the energy from seismic surveys is low frequency, so concerns are particularly focused on baleen whales. Extensive mitigation efforts accompany seismic surveys, including visual and acoustic monitoring, but the possibility remains that not all animals in an area can be observed and located. One potential way to improve mitigation efforts is to utilize the seismic hydrophone streamer to detect and locate calling baleen whales. This study describes a method to localize low frequency sound sources with data recoded by a streamer. Beamforming is used to estimate the angle of arriving energy relative to sub-arrays of the streamer which constrains the horizontal propagation velocity to each sub-array for a given trial location. A grid search method is then used to minimize the time residual for relative arrival times along the streamer estimated by cross correlation. Results from both simulation and experiment are shown and data from the marine mammal observers and the passive acoustic monitoring conducted simultaneously with the seismic survey are used to verify the analysis.

AB  - Six years of passive acoustic monitoring data from the Gulf of California reveal seasonality and movements for the northeastern Pacific blue whales. Three sites were studied, one from the southern (Punta Pescadero) and two from the northern (Isla Tiburon and Canal de Ballenas) regions. A total of 4,953 h were analyzed, and 15,539 blue whale calls were detected, of which 2,723 (18%) were A calls, 11,249 were B calls (72%), and 1,567 were D calls (10%). A and B calls were produced both as song units (2,524) or AB singular calls (2,026). The high rate of songs and their seasonality suggest that the GC is a winter-breeding ground. A shift from AB call predominance in winter, to D calls in spring and early summer, especially at the entrance of the GC, suggests the importance of this area for reproduction and foraging. Analysis of calling frequency suggests a clear movement of blue whales from the southern region (Punta Pescadero) to the northern regions (Canal de Ballenas and Isla Tiburon), with subsequent southern movement in March. The seasonality and mobility of blue whales in the Gulf of California, inferred from their calling, contributes to the ecological understanding of this population.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has proven a powerful tool for the study of marine mammals, allowing for documentation of biologically relevant factors such as movement patterns or animal behaviors while remaining largely non-invasive and cost effective. From 2008-2019, a set of PAM recordings covering the frequency band of most toothed whale (odontocete) echolocation clicks were collected at sites off the islands of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, KauaModified Letter Turned Commai, and Pearl and Hermes Reef. However, due to the size of this dataset and the complexity of species-level acoustic classification, multi-year, multi-species analyses had not yet been completed. This study shows how a machine learning toolkit can effectively mitigate this problem by detecting and classifying echolocation clicks using a combination of unsupervised clustering methods and human-mediated analyses. Using these methods, it was possible to distill ten unique echolocation click 'types' attributable to regional odontocetes at the genus or species level. In one case, auxiliary sightings and recordings were used to attribute a new click type to the rough-toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis. Types defined by clustering were then used as input classes in a neural-network based classifier, which was trained, tested, and evaluated on 5-minute binned data segments. Network precision was variable, with lower precision occurring most notably for false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens, across all sites (35-76%). However, accuracy and recall were high (>96% and >75%, respectively) in all cases except for one type of short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus, call class at KauaModified Letter Turned Commai and Pearl and Hermes Reef (recall >66%). These results emphasize the utility of machine learning in analysis of large PAM datasets. The classifier and timeseries developed here will facilitate further analyses of spatiotemporal patterns of included toothed whales. Broader application of these methods may improve the efficiency of global multi-species PAM data processing for echolocation clicks, which is needed as these datasets continue to grow.

AB  - Between 1984 and 1993, visual and acoustic methods were combined to census the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, population. Passive acoustic location was based on arrival-time differences of transient bowhead sounds detected on sparse arrays of three to five hydrophones distributed over distances of 1.5-4.5 km along the ice edge. Arrival-time differences were calculated from either digital cross correlation of spectrograms (old method), or digital cross correlation of time waveforms (new method). Acoustic calibration was conducted in situ in 1985 at five sites with visual site position determined by triangulation using two theodolites. The discrepancy between visual and acoustic locations was <1%-5% of visual range and less than 0.7 degrees of visual bearing for either method. Comparison of calibration results indicates that the new method yielded slightly more precise and accurate positions than the old method. Comparison of 217 bowhead whale call locations from both acoustic methods showed that the new method was more precise, with location errors 3-4 times smaller than the old method. Overall, low-frequency bowhead transients were reliably located out to ranges of 3-4 times array size. At these ranges in shallow water, signal propagation appears to be dominated by the fundamental mode and is not corrupted by multipath. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The F-POD, an echolocation-click logging device, is commonly used for passive acoustic monitoring of cetaceans. This paper presents the first assessment of the error-rate of fully automated analysis by this system, a description of the F-POD hardware, and a description of the KERNO-F v1.0 classifier which identifies click trains. Since 2020, twenty F-POD loggers have been used in the BlackCeTrends project by research teams from Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Turkiye, and Ukraine with the aim of investigating trends of relative abundance in populations of cetaceans of the Black Sea. Acoustic data from this project analysed here comprises 9 billion raw data clicks in total, of which 297 million were classified by KERNO-F as Narrow Band High Frequency (NBHF) clicks (harbour porpoise clicks) and 91 million as dolphin clicks. Such data volumes require a reliable automated system of analysis, which we describe. A total of 16,805 Detection Positive Minutes (DPM) were individually inspected and assessed by a visual check of click train characteristics in each DPM. To assess the overall error rate in each species group we investigated 2,000 DPM classified as having NBHF clicks and 2,000 DPM classified as having dolphin clicks. The fraction of NBHF DPM containing misclassified NBHF trains was less than 0.1% and for dolphins the corresponding error-rate was 0.97%. For both species groups (harbour porpoises and dolphins), these error-rates are acceptable for further study of cetaceans in the Black Sea using the automated classification without further editing of the data. The main sources of errors were 0.17% of boat sonar DPMs misclassified as harbour porpoises, and 0.14% of harbour porpoise DPMs misclassified as dolphins. The potential to estimate the rate at which these sources generate errors makes possible a new predictive approach to overall error estimation.

AB  - Shallow, low-activity, low-biosonar parabolic-shaped dives were observed in biologging data from tagged harbor porpoises in Danish waters and identified as potential sleeping behavior. This behavioral state merits consideration in assessing the context for noise exposure and passive acoustic monitoring studies. Similar dives have also been reported for other cetacean species. The existence of low-level bioacoustic dives that may represent that sleeping has implications for the mitigation of not only noise exposure but also of bycatch as well as legal repercussions given the protected status of sleeping, as a part of resting, under many legislative regimes.

AB  - Passive acoustic sensors provide a cost-effective tool for monitoring marine environments. Documenting acoustic conditions among habitats can provide insights into temporal changes in ecosystem composition and anthropogenic impacts. Agencies tasked with safeguarding marine protected areas, such as the U.S. National Park Service and U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, are increasingly interested in using long-term monitoring of underwater sounds as a means of tracking species diversity and ecosystem health. In this study, low-frequency passive acoustic recordings were collected fall 2014 - spring 2018, using standardized instrumentation, from four marine protected areas across geographically disparate regions of the U.S. Economic Exclusive Zone: Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, South Pacific, and Caribbean. Recordings were analyzed for differences in seasonal conditions and to identify acoustic metrics useful for resource assessment across all sites. In addition to comparing ambient sound levels, a species common to all four sites, the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), was used to compare biological sound detection. Ambient sound levels varied across the sites and were driven by differences in animal vocalization rates, anthropogenic activity, and weather. The highest sound levels [dB(RMS(50 Hz-1.5 kHz)) re 1 mu Pa] were recorded in the Northwest Atlantic in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (Stellwagen) during the boreal winter-spring resulting from bioacoustic activity, vessel traffic, and high wind speeds. The lowest sound levels [dB(RMS(50 Hz-1.5 )(kHz)) re 1 mu Pa] were recorded in the Northeast Pacific adjacent to a vessel-restricted area of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (Glacier Bay) during the boreal summer. Humpback whales were detected seasonally in the southern latitude sites, and throughout the deployment periods in the northern latitude sites. Temporal trends in band and spectrum sound levels in Glacier Bay and the National Park of American Samoa were primarily driven by biological sound sources, while trends in Stellwagen and the Buck Island Reef National Monument were primarily driven by anthropogenic sources. These results highlight the variability of ambient sound conditions in marine protected areas in U.S. waters, and the utility of long-term soundscape monitoring for condition assessment in support of resource management.

AB  - To learn more about the occurrence and behaviour of a recently discovered population of blue whales, passive acoustic data were collected between January 2012 and April 2013 in the Chiloense ecoregion of southern Chile. Automatic detectors and manual auditing were used to detect blue whale songs (SEP calls) and D calls, which were then analysed to gain insights into temporal calling patterns. We found that D call rates were extremely low during winter (June-August) but gradually increased in spring and summer, decreasing again later during fall. SEP calls were absent for most winter and spring months (July-November) but increased in summer and fall, peaking between March and April. Thus, our results support previous studies documenting the austral summer residency of blue whales in this region, while suggesting that some individuals stay longer, highlighting the importance of this area as a blue whale habitat. We also investigated the daily occurrence of each call type and found that D calls occurred more frequently during dusk and night hours compared to dawn and day periods, whereas SEP calls did not show any significant diel patterns. Overall, these findings help to understand the occurrence and behaviour of endangered Chilean blue whales, enhancing our ability to develop conservation strategies in this important Southern Hemisphere habitat.

AB  - Acoustic identification of vocalizing individuals opens up new and deeper insights into animal communications, such as individual-/group-specific dialects, turn-taking events, and dialogs. However, establishing an association between an individual animal and its emitted signal is usually non-trivial, especially for animals underwater. Consequently, a collection of marine species-, array-, and position-specific ground truth localization data is extremely challenging, which strongly limits possibilities to evaluate localization methods beforehand or at all. This study presents ORCA-SPY, a fully-automated sound source simulation, classification and localization framework for passive killer whale (Orcinus orca) acoustic monitoring that is embedded into PAMGuard, a widely used bioacoustic software toolkit. ORCA-SPY enables array-and position-specific multichannel audio stream generation to simulate real-world ground truth killer whale localization data and provides a hybrid sound source identification approach integrating ANIMAL-SPOT, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based orca detection network, followed by downstream Time-Difference-Of-Arrival localization. ORCA-SPY was evaluated on simulated multichannel underwater audio streams including various killer whale vocalization events within a large-scale experimental setup benefiting from previous real-world fieldwork experience. Across all 58,320 embedded vocalizing killer whale events, subject to various hydrophone array geometries, call types, distances, and noise conditions responsible for a signal-to-noise ratio varying from -14.2 dB to 3 dB, a detection rate of 94.0 % was achieved with an average localization error of 7.01(?). ORCA-SPY was field-tested on Lake Stechlin in Brandenburg Germany under laboratory conditions with a focus on localization. During the field test, 3889 localization events were observed with an average error of 29.19(?) and a median error of 17.54(?). ORCA-SPY was deployed successfully during the DeepAL fieldwork 2022 expedition (DLFW22) in Northern British Columbia, with a mean average error of 20.01(?) and a median error of 11.01(?) across 503 localization events. ORCA-SPY is an open-source and publicly available software framework, which can be adapted to various recording conditions as well as animal species.

AB  - The Critically Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis entered a population decline around 2011. To save this species without closing the ocean to human activities requires detailed information about its intra-annual density patterns that can be used to assess and mitigate human-caused risks. Using 2.9 million km of visual line-transect survey effort from the US Atlantic and Canadian Maritimes conducted in 2003-2020 by 11 institutions, we modeled the absolute density (ind. km-2) of the species using spatial, temporal, and environmental covariates at a monthly time step. We accounted for detectability differences between survey platforms, teams, and conditions, and corrected all data for perception and availability biases, accounting for platform differences, whale dive behavior, group composition, and group size. We produced maps of predicted density and evaluated our results using independently collected passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Densities correlated positively (r = 0.46, rho = 0.58, tau = 0.46) with acoustic detection rates obtained at 492 stationary PAM recorders deployed across the study area (mean recorder duration = 138 d). This is the first study to quantify the concurrence of visual and acoustic observations of the species in US waters. We summarized predictions into mean monthly density and uncertainty maps for the 2003-2009 and 2010-2020 eras, based on the significant changes in the species' spatial distribution that began around 2010. The results quantify the striking distribution shifts and provide effort- and bias-corrected density surfaces to inform risk assessments, estimations of take, and marine spatial planning.

AB  - Mitigating the effects of human activities on marine mammals often depends on monitoring animal occurrence over long time scales, large spatial scales, and in real time. Passive acoustics, particularly from autonomous vehicles, is a promising approach to meeting this need. We have previously developed the capability to record, detect, classify, and transmit to shore information about the tonal sounds of baleen whales in near real time from long-endurance ocean gliders. We have recently developed a protocol by which a human analyst reviews this information to determine the presence of marine mammals, and the results of this review are automatically posted to a publicly accessible website, sent directly to interested parties via email or text, and made available to stakeholders via a number of public and private digital applications. We evaluated the performance of this system during two 3.75-month Slocum glider deployments in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2015 and 2016. Near real-time detections of humpback, fin, sei, and North Atlantic right whales were compared to detections of these species from simultaneously recorded audio. Data from another 2016 glider deployment in the same area were also used to compare results between three different analysts to determine repeatability of results both among and within analysts. False detection (occurrence) rates on daily time scales were 0% for all species. Daily missed detection rates ranged from 17 to 24%. Agreement between two trained novice analysts and an experienced analyst was greater than 95% for fin, sei, and right whales, while agreement was 83-89% for humpback whales owing to the more subjective process for detecting this species. Our results indicate that the presence of baleen whales can be accurately determined using information about tonal sounds transmitted in near real-time from Slocum gliders. The system is being used operationally to monitor baleen whales in United States, Canadian, and Chilean waters, and has been particularly useful for monitoring the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale throughout the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for observing soniferous species in remote marine environments over long periods of time, which can inform conservation planning and wildlife management. In this study, we collected seven examine the seasonal presence of four species of marine mammals and unidentified fish species, examine drivers of underwater sound levels, and quantify underwater noise from vessel traffic. Bearded seals were vocally present from mid-March to early July. Ringed seals were present in every month. Beluga whales were present from early July until September. Bowhead whales were detected from April to August, and fish were detected from February to July. Underwater sound levels were dampened by the presence of landfast sea ice and increased with wind speed. Increased bearded seal calls also caused increased sound levels. The only vessel detected was the research vessel that recovered the acoustic recorder. Underwater sound levels were much lower in Minto Inlet compared to other areas in the region, and it appears to be an important site for many marine mammals where forage fish species, primarily Arctic cod, are abundant at depth. These results are in line with Minto Inlet being identified as an important area by the community of Ulukhaktok. At present, anthropogenic impact on this area appears to be very low, but further monitoring is required to determine if any management measures are necessary to maintain these low levels.

KW  - RECOGNITION
AB  - This paper proposes a robust system for detecting North Atlantic right whales by using deep learning methods to denoise noisy recordings. Passive acoustic recordings of right whale vocalisations are subject to noise contamination from many sources, such as shipping and offshore activities. When such data are applied to uncompensated classifiers, accuracy falls substantially. To build robustness into the detection process, two separate approaches that have proved successful for image denoising are considered. Specifically, a denoising convolutional neural network and a denoising autoencoder, each of which is applied to spectrogram representations of the noisy audio signal, are developed. Performance is improved further by matching the classifier training to include the vestigial signal that remains in clean estimates after the denoising process. Evaluations are performed first by adding white, tanker, trawler, and shot noises at signal-to-noise ratios from -10 to +5 dB to clean recordings to simulate noisy conditions. Experiments show that denoising gives substantial improvements to accuracy, particularly when using the vestigial-trained classifier. A final test applies the proposed methods to previously unseen noisy right whale recordings and finds that denoising is able to improve performance over the baseline clean-trained model in this new noise environment.

KW  - ABUNDANCE
AB  - Beaked whales are deep divers, emitting echolocation clicks while at depth. Little is known about the dive behavior of most species; however, passive acoustic data collected with towed hydrophone arrays can provide depth information using multipath reflections of clicks coupled with a two-dimensional localization of the individual. Data were collected during a shipboard survey in the western North Atlantic Ocean using a towed linear hydrophone array. Beaked whale tracks were classified as either Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) or Gervais'/True's (Mesoplodon europaeus/ Mesoplodon mirus). Weighted species average depths and weighted species standard deviations were 1158 m +/- 6287 m for Cuvier's (n = 24), and 870 m +/- 6151 m for Gervais'/True's (n = 15). Depth uncertainties ranged from 3% to 142% of the average depth. Slant ranges were corrected for depth to provide average horizontal perpendicular distance estimates. The average horizontal perpendicular distance distribution exhibited fewer detections in the first bin than the second. This is the first report of dive depths for Gervais'/True's beaked whales and use of this method to obtain depths for beaked whales using a towed linear array.

AB  - Automatically detecting animal signals in soundscape recordings is of benefit to passive acoustic monitoring programs which may be undertaken for research or conservation. Numerous algorithms exist, which are typically optimized for certain situations (i.e., certain animal sound types and ambient noise conditions). Adding to the library of algorithms, this paper developed, tested, and compared three detectors for Omura's whale vocalizations (15-62 Hz; <15 s) in marine soundscape recordings which contained noise from other animals, wind, earthquakes, ships, and seismic surveys. All three detectors were based on processing of spectrographic representations. The specific methods were spectrogram cross-correlation, entropy computation, and spectral intensity "blob" tracing. The latter two were general-purpose detectors that were adapted for detection of Omura's whale vocalizations. Detector complexity and post-processing effort varied across the three detectors. Performance was assessed qualitatively using demonstrative examples, and quantitatively using Receiver-Operating Characteristics and Precision-Recall curves. While the results of quantitative assessment were dominated by the spectrogram cross-correlation method, qualitative assessment showed that all three detectors offered promising performance.

AB  - A diverse group of toothed whale species inhabits the pelagic habitats of the western North Atlantic, competing for overlapping prey resources. Historical data deficits have limited fundamental research into many of these species, such as establishing baselines of distribution and abundance, so their occurrence and habitat use patterns are not well characterized. Periodic cycles in activity have been reported at a range of temporal scales for odontocetes in other regions, such as seasonal movements, foraging activity modulated by lunar cycles, and diel activity patterns. A variety of spatial, temporal, and behavioral separation strategies have also been observed among predator guilds in both marine and terrestrial systems, and these may also contribute to observed spatiotemporal patterns in activity. Recently, passive acoustic data has been applied to monitor odontocete species continuously, with improved detection and species discrimination for some cryptic species. We used a long-term passive acoustic data set collected at sites spanning the western North Atlantic shelf-break region to quantify presence and characterize seasonal, lunar, and diel activity patterns for 10 species. Our results demonstrated strong regional preferences and clear patterns of spatiotemporal separation between species with similar foraging ecology. Latitudinal shifts in seasonal presence peaks may suggest meridional seasonal migrations for some dolphin species. We also observed strong diel activity patterns that were modulated by both seasonal and lunar cycles. This study reveals complex behavioral patterns arising in response to natural cycles playing out over multiple temporal scales and provides new insights into habitat partitioning among toothed whale species.

AB  - Considering the success of mobile computing, real-time identification of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) data is now an emerging possibility. Despite computational evolution, analysis of raw acoustic data by complex algorithms requires considerably computing effort, therefore, consuming overly battery power. As battery power is a low resource in many environments, such as the sea, a very simple time-domain signal similarity filter is proposed in this paper. To accomplish that, the filter uses a richer representation of time-domain data created by symbolic data analysis. Taking this new data type and assuming environmental noise as a stationary process, a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test is applied to detect signal similarity over time. To evaluate overall processing time, a dataset of raw acoustic data acquired from PAM was used. In addition, to endorse accuracy and no data loss, all data were visually and acoustically searched for sperm whale clicks.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring for cetaceans mainly employ fixed-location methods or point transect samplings; an acoustic survey from a moving platform to conduct line transects is less common. In this study, acoustic capture-recapture by combining a double-observer method with line transect sampling was performed to observe Yangtze finless porpoises. Two acoustic devices were towed with the distance between them varying 0.5 to 89.5 m. The conditional probabilities that both devices would detect the porpoises within the same time window were calculated. In a 1-s time window, it became smaller as the distance between the devices increased, approaching zero when the distance between them was more than 50 m. It was considered that the devices with less than 50m distance detected the same signals from the same animals, which means the identical detection. When the distance between them is too great, the recapture rate is reduced and the incidence of false matching may increase. Thus, a separation distance of around 50m between two devices in acoustic capture-recapture of Yangtze finless porpoises was recommended. Note that the performance of the double detections can change depending on the particular device used and on animal behaviors such as vocalizing interval, ship avoidance.

AB  - The Arctic marine environment is changing rapidly through a combination of sea ice loss and increased anthropogenic activity. Given these changes can affect marine animals in a variety of ways, understanding the spatial and temporal distributions of Arctic marine animals is imperative. We use passive acoustic monitoring to examine the presence of marine mammals near Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada, from October 2016 to April 2017. We documented bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus Linnaeus, 1758) and beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)) vocalizations later into the autumn than expected, and we recorded bowhead whales in early April. We recorded ringed seal (Pusa hispida (Schreber, 1775)) vocalizations throughout our deployment, with higher vocal activity than in other studies and with peak vocal activity in January. We recorded bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus (Erxleben, 1777)) throughout the deployment, with peak vocal activity in February. We recorded lower bearded seal vocal activity than other studies, and almost no vocal activity near the beginning of the spring breeding season. Both seal species vocalized more when ice concentration was high. These patterns in vocal activity document the presence of each species at this site over autumn and winter and are a useful comparison for future monitoring.

AB  - Power extracted from fast-moving tidal currents has been identified as a potential commercial-scale source of renewable energy. Marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) device developers and utilities are pursuing deployment of prototype tidal turbines to assess technology viability, site feasibility, and and environmental interactions. Deployment of prototype turbines requires environmental review and permits from a range of regulatory authorities. Ensuring the safety of marine animals, particularly those under protection of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, has emerged as a key regulatory challenge for initial MHK deployments. The greatest perceived risk to marine animals is from strike by the rotating blades of tidal turbines. Development of the marine animal alert system (MAAS) was undertaken to support monitoring and mitigation requirements for tidal turbine deployments. The prototype system development focused on the Southern Resident killer whale (SRKW), and endangered population that frequents Puget Sound, Washington, and is seasonally present in the part of the sound where deployment of prototype tidal turbines is being considered. Passive acoustics were selected as the primary means to detedct the SRKWs because of the vocal mature of these animals. The MAAS passive acoustic system consists of two-stage process involving the use of an energy detector and a spectrogram-based classifier to distinguish between SKRW calls and background noise. A prototype consisting of two 2D symmetrical star arrays separated by 20 m center to center was built and evaluated successfully in the waters of Sequim Bay, Washington, using whale-call playback.

AB  - Cetacean tourism and vessel traffic have grown considerably around the world in recent decades. At Akaroa Harbor, Aotearoa New Zealand, recreational vessel traffic, dolphin tourism, and cruise ship presence increased substantially between 2008 and 2020. We examined the relationship between vessel traffic parameters and the presence of Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) during the austral summer 2019-2020, using automated vessel tracking and autonomous passive acoustic monitoring. Data were collected between December 2019 and May 2020, including the entirety of the first COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Generalized additive models revealed that increasing levels of motor vessel traffic, the presence of cruise ships, and high levels of dolphin tour vessel traffic resulted in decreases in acoustic detections of dolphins. Our findings suggest that Hector's dolphins at Akaroa Harbor were displaced from core habitat in response to each of these vessel traffic parameters. We recommend that managers use immediately actionable tools to reduce the impacts of vessels on these dolphins.

AB  - Characterizing population structure and dynamics is critical for the conservation of endangered species. Monitoring sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus is especially difficult because it requires monitoring different latitudes to capture the dynamics of most populations. Since their remarkable sexual dimorphism in body size is reflected in their sounds, passive acoustic monitoring presents an opportunity to capture contiguous patterns in time, space, and over large scales. We show that the echolocation repetition rate (measured as inter-click interval, ICI) as a proxy for body length is a suitable approach for large-scale acoustic monitoring. Body length has previously been estimated from the time interval between pulses (IPI) within sperm whale echolocation clicks. These estimates can only be achieved when whales are oriented toward the recorder or directly facing away, resulting in sparse data. A representative subsample of data demonstrated that ICI and IPI are linearly correlated, allowing conversion of ICI distributions into likely body length categories. This approach was applied to three monitoring sites in the Gulf of Mexico (2010-2017), where sperm whale population structure and male movements were poorly understood. We identified three classes: large animals between 12-15 m (ICI between 0.72 and 1 sec), presumed to correspond to adult males, and small animals below 12 m (ICI between 0.44 and 0.64 sec) likely pertaining to social groups (mixed groups with adult females and their offspring), and the third class with mid-sized animals (ICI between 0.64 and 0.83 sec) believed to contain adult females or sub-adult males. Our results revealed spatial and seasonal variability of the population structure including possible male presence throughout the year and migratory patterns of the population. This approach provides a means to efficiently characterize the putative population structure of sperm whales to understand the population's geographical dynamics and population status, which is relevant under rapidly changing habitat conditions.

AB  - Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) emit short, broadband clicks which often include multiple pulses. The time interval between these pulses [inter-pulse interval (IPI)] represents the two-way time for a pulse to travel between the air sacs located at either end of the sperm whale's head. The IPI therefore, is a proxy of head length which, using an allometric relationship, can be used to estimate total body length. Previous studies relating IPI to an independent measure of length have relied on very small sample sizes and manual techniques for measuring IPI. Sound recordings and digital stereo photogrammetric measurements of 21 individuals were made off Kaikoura, New Zealand, and, in addition, archived recordings of whales measured with a previous photogrammetric system were reanalyzed to obtain a total sample size of 33 individuals. IPIs were measured automatically via cepstral analysis implemented via a software plug-in for PAMGUARD, an open-source software package for passive acoustic monitoring. IPI measurements were highly consistent within individuals (mean CV = 0.63%). The new regression relationship relating IPI (I) and total length (T) was found to be T = 1.258I + 5.736 (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001). This new regression provides a better fit than previous studies of large (> 11 m) sperm whales. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3578455]

AB  - Killer whales occur in the Arctic but few data exist regarding the ecotypes present. The calling behavior differs among ecotypes, which can be distinguished based on pulsed call type, call rate, and bandwidth. In this study, a passive acoustic recorder was deployed 75 km off Point Hope, Alaska, in the southeastern Chukchi Sea to identify which ecotypes were present. A total of 1323 killer whale pulsed calls were detected on 38 of 276 days during the summers (June-August) of 2013-2015. The majority of calls (n = 804, 61%) were recorded in 2013 with the most calls recorded in July (76% of total calls). The calls were manually grouped into six categories: multipart, downsweep, upsweep, modulated, single modulation, and flat. Most detections were flat (n = 485, 37%) or multipart calls (n = 479, 36%), which contained both high and low frequency components. Call comparisons with those reported in the published literature showed similarities with other transient populations in fundamental frequency contour point distribution and median frequency. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of transient killer whale calls in this region as well as reports on previously undescribed calls.

AB  - 1. Understanding habitat requirements for species at risk is crucial for effective conservation management, even though the location and extent of vital habitats may be unknown for rare or elusive species.2. In the case of marine species, determining important habitat often relies on limited occurrence data or extrapolation from species distribution models (SDMs). SDMs predict habitat by associating species records with environmental variables, assuming a functional ecological relationship.3. This study focuses on northern bottlenose whales (NBW; Hyperoodon ampullatus) and Sowerby's beaked whales (SBW; Mesoplodon bidens) in the western North Atlantic. As both NBW and SBW are at risk in Canada, the objective was to identify the extent and function of important habitats to guide conservation efforts.4. The analysis mapped all available geographic occurrence data and used passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data to inform the development of ensemble SDMs to predict potential habitat and assess the persistence of realized habitat use.5. Important habitats for NBW and SBW were found primarily concentrated along the continental shelf edges, at an average depth of 1200 m +/- 460 SD. All habitat areas support foraging and movement and critical life history functions for both species.6. The Gully and other submarine canyons off eastern Nova Scotia emerged as important areas for both species, validating the existing Critical Habitat for NBW. However, spatial-temporal patterns diverged on either side of this region. North-eastern Newfoundland was identified as the next closest area of near-year-round presence for NBW, whereas the south-western Scotian Shelf region, Georges Bank and the Fundian Channel supported persistent foraging by SBW.7. By integrating multiple data sources (sightings, acoustic detections and SDMs) and demonstrating the temporal persistence of habitat use by NBW and SBW, this study provides valuable insights for identifying, protecting and managing important habitat for beaked whales.

AB  - Arabian Sea humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), listed as "Endangered" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, remain resident throughout the year in the waters of the Arabian Sea and constitute a genetically isolated population. In the eastern Arabian Sea, information on humpback whales off the Indian coast has largely been limited to stranding records, local ecological knowledge, and opportunistic visual sighting data. These data, along with information from a long-term study off Oman, suggest that humpback whales migrate across the Arabian Sea into Indian ter-ritorial waters from October to March. To study the presence of Arabian Sea humpback whales in Indian waters more comprehensively, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was initiated along the west coast of India in 2019. Male humpback whales produce complex songs with a stereo-typed structure; these songs are shared within a population, and song patterns are known to evolve progressively over time. In this article, a struc-tural analysis of humpback whale song recorded over four days off the coast of Netrani Island, Karnataka, India, in December 2019 is presented. Time-frequency features of 2,641 individual call units were analysed. Call units had a fundamen-tal frequency bandwidth ranging from 149.98 to 541.65 Hz, with a duration ranging from 1.19 to 5.5 s. The call units were used to identify phrases and themes required to construct the structure of the song, which can potentially help identify the population to which singing individuals belong. This study indicates the need for a long-term PAM program across the Arabian Sea to compare whale songs across the region. Simultaneous recordings over multiple seasons will best assess population connectivity, seasonal occurrence, and movement patterns within and between populations across the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico is a region densely populated by marine mammals that must adapt to living in a highly active industrial environment. This paper presents a new approach to quantifying the anthropogenic impact on the marine mammal population. The results for sperm and beaked whales of a case study of regional population dynamics trends after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, derived from passive acoustic-monitoring data gathered before and after the spill in the vicinity of the accident, are presented.

AB  - Collisions between traffic and wildlife can have population-level consequences and carry economic costs. Vessel-strike may threaten the viability of whale populations especially where habitat overlaps with frequent vessel traffic; as seen in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, which is the entrance to the busy Ports of Auckland and holds a year-round population of endangered Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). Here, we identify a serious threat: out of 44 Bryde's whale-deaths, 17 of 20 (85%), with known cause of mortality, sustained injuries consistent with vessel-strike; a mortality rate that is likely to be unsustainable. This information started a social forum with stakeholders engaged in science-based discussion of mitigation measures to reduce lethal vessel-strikes in this region. To determine the viability of different mitigation actions we studied Bryde's whale behavior with suction-cup attached tags. Tagged whales (n = 7, 62.5 h) spent 91% of their time at depths within the maximum draft of vessels transiting the Gulf, increasing the probability of vessel-strike. Whales are broadly distributed throughout the Gulf so re-routing traffic would not lessen the threat of vessel-strike. Monitoring whales visually is difficult and not applicable at night, when whales rested closer to the surface than during the day. Passive acoustic monitoring is unreliable due to the whales' low vocal activity and because low frequency calls are susceptible to masking from vessel noise. These findings resulted in a Transit Protocol for Shipping including voluntary speed restrictions and a monitoring plan, highlighting the value of scientific and social stakeholders working together for conservation.

AB  - To track highly directional echolocation clicks from odontocetes, passive hydrophone arrays with small apertures can be used to receive the same high frequency click on each sensor. A four-hydrophone small-aperture array was coupled to an autonomous acoustic recorder and used for long-term tracking of high-frequency odontocete sounds. The instrument was deployed in the spring of 2009 offshore of southern California in a known beaked whale and dolphin habitat at about 1000 m depth. The array was configured as a tetrahedron with approximately 0.5 m sensor spacing. Time difference of arrival measurements between the six sensor-pairs were used to estimate three-dimensional bearings to sources. Both near-seafloor beaked whales and near-sea surface dolphins were tracked. The tracks observed using this technique provide swimming and diving behavioral information for free-ranging animals using a single instrument. Furthermore, animal detection ranges were derived, allowing for estimation of detection probability functions. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3662076]

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of underwater sounds is an emerging discipline that can be used to guarantee that anthropogenic noise meets acceptable limits, to detect the presence of cetacean species, and to ensure sustainable exploitation of our oceans and seas. In this scenario, graphical representation techniques play a key role in helping to reveal seasonal structures of human made noises. Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs. All of this is applied to data from deployments in two marine protected areas in order to provide an acoustic panorama and identify seasonal events. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To date, the majority of studies investigating marine mammal distribution and behavior take a single-species perspective, which is often driven by the logistic difficulties of collecting appropriate data at sea. Passive acoustic monitoring, provided recording tools exhibit sufficient bandwidth, has the potential to provide insights into community structure as devices operate autonomously simultaneously collecting data on baleen, pinniped and toothed whale acoustic presence. Data can provide information on local species diversity, residency times and co-occurrence. Here, we used multi-year passive acoustic data from 6 sites in the Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean, to explore how local marine mammal community compositions develop over time and in relation to sea-ice. Diversity peaked in austral late spring and early summer, shortly before seasonal sea-ice break-up. The effective number of species exhibited little variation over time, reflecting that species remain in Antarctic waters throughout austral winter. Community composition showed almost complete seasonal overturn, indicating that species replace each other throughout the year. For all 6 sites, community dissimilarity increased with increasing temporal distance, reflecting temporal trends in community composition beyond seasonality. Several species exhibited significant positive or negative co-occurrence patterns over time. These seasonal associations were consistent across all 5 oceanic sites, but partly inversed at the Western Antarctic Peninsula recording site. This study shows that the application of biodiversity metrics to passive acoustic monitoring data can foster insights into the timing of behaviors and community composition, which can boost the interpretation of responses in the light of ongoing environmental changes.

AB  - Humpback whale song chorusing dominates the marine soundscape in Hawai'i during winter months, yet little is known about spatio-temporal habitat use patterns of singers. We analysed passive acoustic monitoring data from five sites off Maui and found that ambient noise levels associated with song chorusing decreased during daytime hours nearshore but increased offshore. To resolve whether these changes reflect a diel offshore-onshore movement or a temporal difference in singing activity, data from 71 concurrently conducted land-based theodolite surveys were analysed. Non-calf pods (n = 3082), presumably including the majority of singers, were found further offshore with increasing time of the day. Separately, we acoustically localized 217 nearshore singers using vector-sensors. During the day, distances to shore and minimum distances among singers increased, and singers switched more between being stationary and singing while travelling. Together, these findings suggest that the observed diel trends in humpback whale chorusing off Maui represent a pattern of active onshore-offshore movement of singers. We hypothesize that this may result from singers attempting to reduce intraspecific acoustic masking when densities are high nearshore and avoidance of a loud, non-humpback, biological evening chorus offshore, creating a dynamic of movement of singers aimed at increasing the efficiency of their acoustic display.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is commonly used to generate information on the distribution, abundance, and behavior of cetacean species. In African waters, the utilization of PAM lags behind most other continents. This study examines whether the whistles of three coastal delphinid species (Delphinus delphis, Tursiops truncatus, and Tursiops aduncus) commonly encountered in the southern African subregion can be readily distinguished using both statistical analysis of standard whistle parameters and the automated detection and classification software PAMGuard. A first account of whistles recorded from D. delphis from South Africa is included. Using PAMGuard, classification to species was high with an overall mean correct classification rate of 87.3%. Although lower, high rates of correct classification were also found (78.4%) when the two T. aduncus populations were included separately. Classification outcomes reflected patterns observed in standard whistle parameters. Such acoustic discrimination may be useful for confirmation of morphologically similar species in the field. Classification success was influenced by training and testing the classifier with data from different populations, highlighting the importance of locally collected acoustic data to inform classifiers. The small number of sampling populations may have inflated the classification success, therefore, classification trials using a greater number of species are recommended.

AB  - Underwater passive acoustic monitoring systems record many hours of audio data for marine research, making fast and reliable non-causal signal detection paramount. Such detectors assist in reducing the amount of labor required for signal annotations, which often contain large portions devoid of signals.Cetacean vocalization detection based on spectral entropy is investigated as a means of vocalization discovery. Previous techniques using spectral entropy mostly consider time-frequency enhancement of the entropy measure, and utilize the short time Fourier transform (STFT) as its time-frequency (TF) decomposition. Spectral entropy methods also requires the user to set a detection threshold manually, which call for knowledge of the produced entropy measures.This paper considers median filtering as a simple, effective way to provide temporal stabilization to the entropy measure, and considers the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as an alternative TF decomposition. Kmeans clustering is used to determine the threshold required to accurately separate the signal/no-signal entropy measures, resulting in a one-dimensional, two-class classification problem. The class means are used to perform pseudo-probabilistic soft class assignment, which is a useful metric in algorithmic development. The effect of median filtering, signal-to-noise ratio and the chosen TF decomposition are investigated. The accuracy and specificity measures of the proposed detection technique are simulated using a pulsed frequency modulated sweep, corrupted by a sample of ocean noise.The results show that median filtering is particularly effective for low signal-to-noise ratios. Both the STFT and CWT prove to be effective TF analyses for signal detection purposes, each presenting with different advantages and drawbacks. The simulated results provide insight into configuring the proposed detector, which is compared to a conventional STFT-based spectral entropy detector using manually annotated humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) songs recorded in False Bay, South Africa, July2021. The proposed method shows a significant improvement in detection accuracy and specificity, while also providing a more interpretable detection threshold setting via soft class assignment, providing a detector for use in development of adaptive algorithms.

AB  - The diversity of animal acoustic signals has evolved due to multiple ecological processes, both biotic and abiotic. At the level of communities of signaling animals, these processes may lead to diverse outcomes, including partitioning of acoustic signals along multiple axes (divergent signal parameters, signaling locations, and timing). Acoustic data provides information on the organization, diversity and dynamics of an acoustic community, and thus enables study of ecological change and turnover in a non-intrusive way. In this review, we lay out how community bioacoustics (the study of acoustic community structure and dynamics), has value in ecological monitoring and conservation of diverse landscapes and taxa. First, we review the concepts of signal space, signal partitioning and their effects on the structure of acoustic communities. Next, we highlight how spatiotemporal ecological change is reflected in acoustic community structure, and the potential this presents in monitoring and conservation. As passive acoustic monitoring gains popularity worldwide, we propose that the analytical framework of community bioacoustics has promise in studying the response of entire suites of species (from insects to large whales) to rapid anthropogenic change.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities can lead to changes in animal behavior. Predicting population consequences of these behavioral changes requires integrating short-term individual responses into models that forecast population dynamics across multiple generations. This is especially challenging for long-lived animals, because of the different time scales involved. Beaked whales are a group of deep-diving odontocete whales that respond behaviorally when exposed to military mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), but the effect of these nonlethal responses on beaked whale populations is unknown. Population consequences of aggregate exposure to MFAS was assessed for two beaked whale populations that are regularly present on U.S. Navy training ranges where MFAS is frequently used. Our approach integrates a wide range of data sources, including telemetry data, information on spatial variation in habitat quality, passive acoustic data on the temporal pattern of sonar use and its relationship to beaked whale foraging activity, into an individual-based model with a dynamic bioenergetic module that governs individual life history. The predicted effect of disturbance from MFAS on population abundance ranged between population extinction to a slight increase in population abundance. These effects were driven by the interaction between the temporal pattern of MFAS use, baseline movement patterns, the spatial distribution of prey, the nature of beaked whale behavioral response to MFAS and the top-down impact of whale foraging on prey abundance. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for monitoring of marine mammal populations and highlight key uncertainties to help guide future directions for assessing population impacts of nonlethal disturbance for these and other long-lived animals.

AB  - Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is emerging as a solution for monitoring species and environmental change over large spatial and temporal scales. However, drawing rigorous conclusions based on acoustic recordings is challenging, as there is no consensus over which approaches are best suited for characterizing marine acoustic environments. Here, we describe the application of multiple machine-learning techniques to the analysis of two PAM datasets. We combine pre-trained acoustic classification models (VGGish, NOAA and Google Humpback Whale Detector), dimensionality reduction (UMAP), and balanced random forest algorithms to demonstrate how machine-learned acoustic features capture different aspects of the marine acoustic environment. The UMAP dimensions derived from VGGish acoustic features exhibited good performance in separating marine mammal vocalizations according to species and locations. RF models trained on the acoustic features performed well for labeled sounds in the 8 kHz range; however, low- and high-frequency sounds could not be classified using this approach. The workflow presented here shows how acoustic feature extraction, visualization, and analysis allow establishing a link between ecologically relevant information and PAM recordings at multiple scales, ranging from large-scale changes in the environment (i.e., changes in wind speed) to the identification of marine mammal species.

AB  - BackgroundClimate change is warming the Arctic faster than the rest of the planet. Shifts in whale migration timing have been linked to climate change in temperate and sub-Arctic regions, and evidence suggests Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) might be overwintering in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.MethodsWe used an 11-year timeseries (spanning 2009-2021) of BCB bowhead whale presence in the southern Chukchi Sea (inferred from passive acoustic monitoring) to explore relationships between migration timing and sea ice in the Chukchi and Bering Seas.ResultsFall southward migration into the Bering Strait was delayed in years with less mean October Chukchi Sea ice area and earlier in years with greater sea ice area (p = 0.04, r(2) = 0.40). Greater mean October-December Bering Sea ice area resulted in longer absences between whales migrating south in the fall and north in the spring (p < 0.01, r(2) = 0.85). A stepwise shift after 2012-2013 shows some whales are remaining in southern Chukchi Sea rather than moving through the Bering Strait and into the northwestern Bering Sea for the winter. Spring northward migration into the southern Chukchi Sea was earlier in years with less mean January-March Chukchi Sea ice area and delayed in years with greater sea ice area (p < 0.01, r(2) = 0.82).ConclusionsAs sea ice continues to decline, northward spring-time migration could shift earlier or more bowhead whales may overwinter at summer feeding grounds. Changes to bowhead whale migration could increase the overlap with ships and impact Indigenous communities that rely on bowhead whales for nutritional and cultural subsistence.

AB  - Various methods for estimating animal density from visual data, including distance sampling (DS) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR), have recently been adapted for estimating call density using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data, e.g., recordings of animal calls. Here we summarize three methods available for passive acoustic density estimation: plot sampling, DS, and SECR. The first two require distances from the sensors to calling animals (which are obtained by triangulating calls matched among sensors), but SECR only requires matching (not localizing) calls among sensors. We compare via simulation what biases can arise when assumptions underlying these methods are violated. We use insights gleaned from the simulation to compare the performance of the methods when applied to a case study: bowhead whale call data collected from arrays of directional acoustic sensors at five sites in the Beaufort Sea during the fall migration 2007-2014. Call detections were manually extracted from the recordings by human observers simultaneously scanning spectrograms of recordings from a given site. The large discrepancies between estimates derived using SECR and the other two methods were likely caused primarily by the manual detection procedure leading to non-independent detections among sensors, while errors in estimated distances between detected calls and sensors also contributed to the observed patterns. Our study is among the first to provide a direct comparison of the three methods applied to PAM data and highlights the importance that all assumptions of an analysis method need to be met for correct inference.

AB  - A fundamental issue in cetacean conservation is determining the occurrence, distribution, and habitat use of target species. However, these baselines are extremely deficient in many poorly investigated regions, making it challenging to inform conservation management initiatives. In this case study, we employed three complementary approaches to generate conservation baselines on a "Vulnerable" near-shore delphinid species, the IndoPacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, in the waters southwest of Hainan (SW Hainan), China. First, in late 2013, we conducted large-scale local ecological knowledge (LEK) surveys with 510 Hainanese fishers. Our LEK findings revealed that SW Hainan was a previously underreported area with numerous fishermen encounters of humpback dolphins dating back to the 1970s. Second, from 2014 to 2019, we conducted monthly boat-based visual surveys in SW Hainan. Our sighting data verified the reliability of previous LEK findings and further confirmed the year-round occurrence and species dominance of humpback dolphins in SW Hainan. Third, we applied a supplementary approach (stationary passive acoustic monitoring, PAM) to monitor dolphin biosonar activities in the region. Our 10-site PAM dataset from February 2018 to June 2019 indicated spatiotemporal variations in dolphin click detections. To conclude, our findings, derived from multiple approaches, provide a scientific basis for cetacean conservation management and marine spatial planning on a regional scale. More generally, this study offers an integrated monitoring strategy consisting of three step-by-step approaches, which can help conservationists, especially those who work in data-deficient waters, obtain critical baseline data on cetaceans in an efficient, timely, and reliable way.

AB  - In this paper, we present marine mammal observation statistics, high-frequency seismic source characteristics, and example denoising of marine mammal acoustical recordings using data collected during the mitigation and monitoring program for a 3-D seismic survey by EnCana Corporation, Calgary, AB, Canada, in the Northwest Atlantic during 2003. Marine mammals were observed both visually and acoustically. No marine mammal incidents or adverse reactions were observed during the survey. Acoustical observations were made by the Seamap Passive Acoustic Cetacean Monitoring System (SPACMS), consisting of two hydrophones placed 50 m apart, towed ahead of and to one side of the seismic source. Visual and acoustical detections were uncorrelated, indicating the complementary nature of the two observational techniques. Visual detections were more common per hour of effort than acoustical detections. Acoustical detection rates showed no significant day-night difference. Marine mammals appeared to have avoided very close ranges (< 100 m) from the seismic array during seismic acquisition, but the overall number of marine mammals in the observable radius (1-2 km) did not change significantly when the seismic source was "on" compared to "off." Marine mammals were observed in larger groups and appeared to have become less vocal when the seismic source was active. It should be noted however, that the results from this data gathering effort may be affected by potential sources of bias (such as the combination of data from,toothed and baleen whales). Signal processing of seismic source signatures indicated some high-frequency energy content consistent with expectations from earlier work. This analysis confirmed that most of the seismic energy was concentrated at lower frequencies (< 500 Hz). No low-frequency comparisons with near-field data could be made due to the geometry of the SPACMS recording hydrophones and seismic source, which resulted in the Lloyd's mirror effect obliterating low-frequency components in the SPACMS records. A wavelet-based denoising method was applied to improve the visibility of marine mammal vocalizations on a spectrogram display.

AB  - The Perth Canyon is a submarine canyon off Rottnest Island in Western Australia. It is rich in biodiversity in general, and important as a feeding and resting ground for great whales on migration. Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) has moorings in the Perth Canyon monitoring its acoustical, physical and biological oceanography. Data from these moorings, as well as weather data from a near-by Bureau of Meteorology weather station on Rottnest Island and ship traffic data from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority were correlated to characterise and quantify the marine soundscape between 5 and 3000 Hz, consisting of its geophony, biophony and anthrophony. Overall, biological sources are a strong contributor to the soundscape at the IMOS site, with whales dominating seasonally at low (15-100 Hz) and mid frequencies (200-400 Hz), and fish or invertebrate choruses dominating at high frequencies (1800-2500 Hz) at night time throughout the year. Ships contribute significantly to the 8-100 Hz band at all times of the day, all year round, albeit for a few hours at a time only. Wind-dependent noise is significant at 200-3000 Hz; winter rains are audible underwater at 2000-3000 Hz. We discuss how passive acoustic data can be used as a proxy for ocean weather. Passive acoustics is an efficient way of monitoring animal visitation times and relative densities, and potential anthropogenic influences. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oceanic odontocetes rely on echolocation to forage on pelagic or benthic prey, but their feeding ecology is difficult to study. We studied sperm whale foraging dives during summer in the north-western Mediterranean, using visual and passive acoustic observations. Clicking and creaking activities were recorded during dives of focal whales, at distances <3000 m using a towed hydrophone and DAT recorder. A total of 52 sperm whales were recorded over at least one full dive cycle. Data were obtained for 156 complete dives in total, including sequences of up to nine consecutive dives. Various dive and environmental variables were entered in multiple linear regression and principal components analysis, as well as estimated mass of whales. Creak rate was 0.80 creak/minute on average, with moderate variance. Bigger whales tended to dive longer at greater depths (as suggested by ascent durations), and emitted more creaks during a dive: 20.2 creaks/dive on average for individuals <24 tons, compared to 25.6 creaks/dive for animals >24 tons of estimated mass. For individual whales, creak rates did not vary significantly with size (range 0.78-0.80 creak/minute), but decreased with time of the day, and increased for shorter foraging phases. For different dives, higher creak rates were also observed earlier in the day, and linked to shorter foraging phases and surface durations. Although the exact significance of creak emissions (i.e. foraging attempt or prey capture) is not precisely determined, creak rates may be reliably used to quantify sperm whale foraging when single animal dives can be followed acoustically.

AB  - The bowhead whale is the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and is well adapted to this environment. Bowheads live near the polar ice edge for much of the year and although sea ice dynamics are not the only driver of their annual migratory movements, it likely plays a key role. Given the intrinsic variability of open water and ice, one might expect bowhead migratory plasticity to be high and linked to this proximate environmental factor. Here, through a network of underwater passive acoustic recorders, we document the first known occurrence of bowheads overwintering in what is normally their summer foraging grounds in the Amundsen Gulf and eastern Beaufort Sea. The underlying question is whether this is the leading edge of a phenological shift in a species' migratory behaviour in an environment undergoing dramatic shifts due to climate change.

AB  - Acoustic surveys can have several advantages over visual methods in surveys of cetaceans, although verification is required that novel techniques are effective. The T-POD is an autonomous acoustic data logger with inbuilt filters that can be set to match the click characteristics of the target species. We tested the performance of the T-POD for detecting Hector's dolphins at Flea Bay, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. Simultaneous visual surveys were conducted from a hillside overlooking the bay, with distances between the T-POD and dolphins measured using a theodolite. Wideband sound recordings confirmed that T-POD detections were echolocation clicks made by Hector's dolphins. Detection probability and click train detection rate decreased with increasing distance, with no detections made beyond 500 m. By fitting detection functions to the probability of detection versus distance we showed that the T-POD effectively detected all dolphin groups within a radius Of 198-239 m, depending on the click train categories utilized. The T-POD shows considerable promise as a tool for passive acoustic surveys of Hector's dolphins, with possible applications in studies of distribution, habitat use and echolocation behaviour.

AB  - The 2001 survey of western Arctic (Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas) bowhead whales was conducted from 5 April to 7 June near Barrow, Alaska. Visual observers recorded a total of 3,295 "new" (not seen before) and 532 "conditional" (possibly seen before) whales in 1,130 h of watch effort, including 121 new calves (3.7% of the new whales). Concurrent with the visual survey, passive acoustic surveillance was conducted almost continuously from 16 April to 31 May, resulting in 27,023 locations of vocalizing bowhead whales. The estimated number of whales within 4 km of the perch (N-4) was 9,025 (SE = 1,068). The estimated proportion of the whales within 4 km of the perch (P-4) was 0.862 (SE = 0.044, computed by a moving blocks bootstrap). Combining these, the abundance estimate (N-4/P-4) for 2001. is 10,470 (SE = 1,351) with a 95% confidence interval of 8,100-13,500. The estimated annual rate of increase (ROI) of the population from 1978 to 2001 is 3.4% (95% CI 1.79%-5%). Reports from hunters and results of an aerial survey in June 2001 indicate whales continued to pass Barrow after the survey had ended. In 2001 51% (572 h) of the watch was scored as occurring during "fair-excellent" visibility conditions, somewhat lower than the average for all surveys since 1978. Sea ice in the leads and fog were the principle environmental factors affecting visibility for all years. The estimated rate of increase and the fact that the number of calves counted in 2001 is the highest ever recorded suggest a steady recovery of this population. Other populations of large balaenids, notably the North Atlantic right whale, have failed to recover despite 70 yr of protection. The recovery of the bowhead whale is likely attributable to low anthropogenic mortality, a relatively pristine habitat, and a well-managed subsistence hunt. Nonetheless, offshore oil development, increasing shipping traffic, changes in the Bering Sea ecosystem, sea ice retreat, and possibly killer whale predation within its range could impact this bowhead population and should be carefully monitored.

AB  - Between 15 and 17 August 2010, a simple two-element vertical array was deployed off the continental slope of Southeast Alaska in 1200 m water depth. The array was attached to a vertical buoy line used to mark each end of a longline fishing set, at 300 m depth, close to the sound-speed minimum of the deep-water profile. The buoy line also served as a depredation decoy, attracting seven sperm whales to the area. One animal was tagged with both a LIMPET dive depth-transmitting satellite and bioacoustic "B-probe" tag. Both tag datasets were used as an independent check of various passive acoustic schemes for tracking the whale in depth and range, which exploited the elevation angles and relative arrival times of multiple ray paths recorded on the array. Analytical tracking formulas were viable up to 2 km range, but only numerical propagation models yielded accurate locations up to at least 35 km range at Beaufort sea state 3. Neither localization approach required knowledge of the local bottom bathymetry. The tracking system was successfully used to estimate the source level of an individual sperm whale's "clicks" and "creaks" and predict the maximum detection range of the signals as a function of sea state.

AB  - Many marine mammals rely on sound for foraging, maintaining group cohesion, navigation, finding mates, and avoiding predators. These behaviors are potentially disrupted by anthropogenic noise. Behavioral responses to sonar have been observed in a number of baleen whale species but relatively little is known about the responses of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Previous analyses demonstrated a spatial redistribution of localizations derived from passive acoustic detections in response to sonar activity, but the lack of a mechanism for associating localizations prevented discriminating between movement and cessation of calling as possible explanations for this redistribution. Here we extend previous analyses by including an association mechanism, allowing us to differentiate between movement responses and calling responses, and to provide direct evidence of horizontal avoidance responses by individual minke whales to sonar during U.S. Navy training activities. We fitted hidden Markov models to 627 tracks that were reconstructed from 3 years of minke whale (B. acutorostrata) vocalizations recorded before, during, and after naval training events at the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai, Hawaii. The fitted models were used to identify different movement behaviors and to investigate the effect of sonar activity on these behaviors. Movement was faster and more directed during sonar exposure than in baseline phases. The mean direction of movement differed during sonar exposure, and was consistent with movement away from sonar-producing ships. Animals were also more likely to cease calling during sonar. There was substantial individual variation in response. Our findings add large-sample support to previous demonstrations of horizontal avoidance responses by individual minke whales to sonar in controlled exposure experiments, and demonstrate the complex nature of behavioral responses to sonar activity: some, but not all, whales exhibited behavioral changes, which took the form of horizontal avoidance or ceasing to call.

AB  - Behavioral responses of beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) to naval use of mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS) have been quantified for some species and regions. We describe the effects of MFAS on the probability of detecting diving groups of Blainville's beaked whales on the U.S. Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in Hawaii and compare our results to previously published results for the same species at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas. We use passive acoustic data collected at bottom-mounted hydrophones before and during six naval training exercises at PMRF along with modelled sonar received levels to describe the effect of training and MFAS on foraging groups of Blainville's beaked whales. We use a multistage generalized additive modeling approach to control for the underlying spatial distribution of vocalizations under baseline conditions. At an MFAS received level of 150 dB re 1 mu Pa rms the probability of detecting groups of Blainville's beaked whales decreases by 77%, 95% CI [67%, 84%] compared to periods when general training activity was ongoing and by 87%, 95% CI [81%, 91%] compared to baseline conditions. Our results indicate a more pronounced response to naval training and MFAS than has been previously reported.

AB  - Given new distribution patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis) population in recent years, an improved understanding of spatio-temporal movements are imperative for the conservation of this species. While so far visual data have provided most information on NARW movements, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was used in this study in order to better capture year-round NARW presence. This project used PAM data from 2004 to 2014 collected by 19 organizations throughout the western North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, data from 324 recorders (35,600 days) were processed and analyzed using a classification and detection system. Results highlight almost year-round habitat use of the western North Atlantic Ocean, with a decrease in detections in waters off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina in summer and fall. Data collected post 2010 showed an increased NARW presence in the mid-Atlantic region and a simultaneous decrease in the northern Gulf of Maine. In addition, NARWs were widely distributed across most regions throughout winter months. This study demonstrates that a large-scale analysis of PAM data provides significant value to understanding and tracking shifts in large whale movements over long time scales.

AB  - In Alaska, sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation on longline sets has increased since implementation of the Individual Fishing Quota programme in 1995. A collaborative effort (SEASWAP) between longliners, scientists, and managers has undertaken research to evaluate this depredation with a primary objective to develop and test a passive deterrent that would reduce depredation without reducing catch rate of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). Commercial longliners, fishing for their own sablefish quotas during the regular season, deployed beaded gear (25 mm lucite beads attached to gangions) with control gear and set recorders to collect acoustic data. Beaded and control gear were randomly assigned by skate quad (672 hooks) with 5 quads in each longline set. Acoustic recorders were used to document sperm whale creak-pause events, representative of depredation of the longline gear. Although there were more sablefish per skate quad on the beaded gear and there was a decrease in depredation events on the beaded gear compared with the control, neither effect was significant (p = 0.205 and 0.364, respectively). The SEASWAP project is testing other deterrent strategies including gear modifications and the establishment of a sighting network to improve avoidance.

AB  - The Arctic is changing rapidly, leading to changes in habitat availability and increased anthropogenic disturbance. Information on the distribution of animals is needed as these changes occur. We examine seasonal presence of marine mammals in the western Canadian Arctic near Sachs Harbour, Northwest Territories, using passive acoustic monitoring between 2015 and 2016. We also examined the influence of environmental variables (ice concentration and distance, wind speed) on the presence of these species. Both bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) arrived in late April, and belugas departed in mid-August, while bowheads departed in late October. Bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) vocalizations began in October, peaked from April through June, and stopped in early July. Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) vocalized occasionally in all months, but were generally quiet. Whales migrated in as the ice broke up and migrated out before ice formed in the autumn. Bearded seals started vocalizing as ice formed and stopped once ice was almost gone. Given the importance of sea ice to the timing of migration of whales and vocalization by bearded seals, the trends that we present here may change in the future due to the increasing ice-free season caused by climate change. Our study therefore serves as a baseline with which to monitor future change.

AB  - A decade of visual and acoustic detections of marine megafauna around offshore Oil & Gas (O&G) installations in the North and Irish Seas are presented. Marine megafauna activity was monitored visually and acoustically by Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) qualified and experienced Marine Mammal Observers (MMO) and Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) Operators respectively, with real-time towed PAM in combination with industry standard software, PAMGuard. Monitoring was performed during routine O&G industrial operations for underwater noise mitigation purposes, and to ensure adherence to regulatory guidelines. Incidental sightings by off-effort MMOs and installation crew were also reported. Visual and acoustic monitoring spanned 55 non-consecutive days between 2004 and 2014. A total of 47 marine mammal sightings were recorded by MMOs on dedicated watch, and 10 incidental sightings of marine megafauna were reported over 10 years. Species included: harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), white beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), common seal (Phoca vitulina), grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and, basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). Passive Acoustic Monitoring was conducted on two occasions in 2014; 160 PAM hours over 12 days recorded a total of 308 individual clicks identified as harbour porpoises. These appear to be the first such acoustic detections obtained from a North Sea drilling rig whilst using a typically configured hydrophone array designed for towing in combination with real-time PAMGuard software. This study provides evidence that marine megafauna are present around mobile and stationary offshore O&G installations during routine operational activities. On this basis, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for decommissioning O&G platforms should be carried-out on a case-by-case basis, and must include provisions for hitherto overlooked marine megafauna.

AB  - Acoustic monitoring of cetaceans was conducted using two buoyancy-driven AUVs in a deep-water canyon north of the Navy's QUTR range off the Washington coast in April 2015. The two AUVs operated were the acoustically-equipped QUEphone, which is an APEX (TM)-based acoustic profiler float from Teledyne Webb, and the Seaglider (TM) from Kongsberg. A passive acoustic monitoring device, WISPR, from Embedded Ocean Systems (EOS) was installed on both AUVs. With one 512-GB CF card and level-2 Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), WISPR recorded sound continuously for 12 days at a 125 kHz sampling rate with 16-bit resolution. The Sealider's record showed high levels of flow noise below 100 Hz during ascent, 16 dB higher than during the descent. The Seaglider's CTD generated 1-sec long line noise at 53.37 kHz at 5 to 10 sec intervals, while the Seaglider's mass shifter generated 3-sec long band-limited noise below 10 kHz. The QUEphone's acoustic record was generally quieter than the Seaglider primarily due to the fact that it is nearly stationary platform with less mechanical and electrical components to generate system noise. Despite higher system noise levels, the Seaglider detected twice as many calls/clicks resulting from its ability to actively stay in the target area where the population density of marine mammals was higher, while the QUEphone drifted away from the target area with the prevailing ocean currents.

AB  - Six years have passed since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Work is still ongoing to assess and repair the economic and property damage caused by the accident, which was considered to be the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. An estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the sea over an 87-day period after the initial explosion.
   The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) awarded funding to The Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center - Gulf Ecological Monitoring and Modeling (LADC-GEMM) consortium to study the long-term impact of the oil spill on population levels of deep-diving marine mammals. The GEMM project is using some very interesting -some might say avant-garde- technology for collecting acoustic data, especially for marine mammal sounds.
   In 2007, LADC-GEMM conducted a two-week baseline survey in this region of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2010, following the oil spill, LADC was funded by NSF and collaborated with Greenpeace to conduct further surveys. The aim now is to estimate and compare the abundance of the marine mammals after the spill and to understand the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on marine mammal populations.
   In June 2015 as part of this project, ASV provided two vehicles (C-Enduro and C-Worker) to carry out Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in the Gulf of Mexico. The C-Worker and C-Enduro cruised at a speed of approximately 3 knots using a combination of solar, wind and diesel-powered engines. The ASVs were joined by AUVs (Automatic Underwater Vehicles-gliders and EARs (Environmental acoustic recording system) buoys. Data collected during the experiment and other acoustic surveys in the area will contribute in future monitoring efforts to better understand how the spill affected different species in the long-term.
   Both ASV's were fitted with towed hydrophone arrays to record marine mammal sounds. C-Worker deployed the array on a cable 220 m in length and C-Enduro towed a smaller cable 55 m in length. Both arrays contained two omni-directional broadband hydrophones and preamplifiers which enabled bearing estimates to vocalizing marine mammals to be calculated from time-of-arrival differences.
   The autonomous PAM system was configured to detect species from their acoustic phonations over a range of 20 Hz to 160 kHz. These would include the low frequency calls of Bryde's whales, the broadband regular click patterns of sperm whales, higher frequency clicks and whistles of several different dolphin species, and the high frequency echolocation pulse trains of beaked whales, pygmy and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia).
   Autonomous systems are relatively quiet platforms for PAM in comparison with conventional research vessels. They can offer a considerable reduction in operating costs and HSE exposure, and improved operational flexibility. In many cases it has been found that tasks are performed more accurately when using an ASV as opposed to conventional methods. Large survey vessels produce a significant noise signature that can mask weak/distant marine mammal sounds. The use of ASVs provide a novel approach and quiet platform to improve signal response and expand the range of frequencies and distances that can be effectively monitored from a towed survey.

AB  - Blainvilles beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) were detected through passive acoustic monitoring recordings of the hydrophones at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) off Kauai, Hawaii, from 2011 through 2013. Group vocal period (GVP) detections were analyzed for temporal (intra- and inter-annual and diel) and spatial (depth, slope, and range extent) patterns. A habitat model was developed using those parameters as predictor variables in Blainvilles beaked whale foraging dive distributions. No monthly or annual trends in GVP rates were found, but there was some diel periodicity found in GVP rates related to the lunar cycle. In addition, a strong relationship was found between bathymetric features and GVP rates, with most dives occurring over steep slopes and depths between 2,000 and 3,000 m. While GVPs occurred across the range throughout each year, they were concentrated in those areas of preferred habitat. GVP rates were also compared against Navy training activity to assess whether foraging behavior was affected by active sonar or explosive sounds. Similar to other Navy ranges, biannual multi-day training events did decrease GVP rates, but all of the other training activity did not appear to affect GVP rates over sampling periods of a week to a month. These results are the first description of baseline foraging behavior for Blainvilles beaked whales at PMRF and provide some insight into the habitat use patterns related to both the natural environment and anthropogenic impacts.

   Understanding the status of biodiversity and its changing patterns is crucial for conservation management. Ecological assessment in deep-sea environments is challenging owning to the limited accessibility and visibility. Nevertheless, we can listen to underwater sounds to investigate the acoustic behaviors of marine animals. This study applied machine learning techniques to analyze underwater recordings transmitted from a deep seafloor observatory off northeastern Taiwan. In particular, our computational approach does not require preexisting labels in the procedure of model building. The model can automatically learn acoustic features and effectively separate sounds of marine mammals, fishes, and shipping activities with minimal supervision. The analysis of 2.5 years of audio data revealed that the studied continental shelf environment has a high diversity of sound-producing animals, and the community structure changes with diurnal, lunar, and seasonal cycles. The applied techniques also generated a database of environmental and anthropogenic sounds, which can facilitate future investigations on how human activities affect the acoustic environment and biodiversity. Our technique is entirely based on passive acoustics, which minimizes interference with animals. It also transforms audio recordings into highly interpretable ecological data, which can be useful for tracking changes in marine biodiversity.
   Remote acquisition of information on ecosystem dynamics is essential for conservation management, especially for the deep ocean. Soundscape offers unique opportunities to study the behavior of soniferous marine animals and their interactions with various noise-generating activities at a fine temporal resolution. However, the retrieval of soundscape information remains challenging owing to limitations in audio analysis techniques that are effective in the face of highly variable interfering sources. This study investigated the application of a seafloor acoustic observatory as a long-term platform for observing marine ecosystem dynamics through audio source separation. A source separation model based on the assumption of source-specific periodicity was used to factorize time-frequency representations of long-duration underwater recordings. With minimal supervision, the model learned to discriminate source-specific spectral features and prove to be effective in the separation of sounds made by cetaceans, soniferous fish, and abiotic sources from the deep-water soundscapes off northeastern Taiwan. Results revealed phenological differences among the sound sources and identified diurnal and seasonal interactions between cetaceans and soniferous fish. The application of clustering to source separation results generated a database featuring the diversity of soundscapes and revealed a compositional shift in clusters of cetacean vocalizations and fish choruses during diurnal and seasonal cycles. The source separation model enables the transformation of single-channel audio into multiple channels encoding the dynamics of biophony, geophony, and anthropophony, which are essential for characterizing the community of soniferous animals, quality of acoustic habitat, and their interactions. Our results demonstrated the application of source separation could facilitate acoustic diversity assessment, which is a crucial task in soundscape-based ecosystem monitoring. Future implementation of soundscape information retrieval in long-term marine observation networks will lead to the use of soundscapes as a new tool for conservation management in an increasingly noisy ocean.

AB  - In order to mitigate against possible impacts of seismic surveys on baleen whales it is important to know as much as possible about the presence of whales within the vicinity of seismic operations. This study expands on previous work that analyzes single seismic streamer data to locate nearby calling baleen whales with a grid search method that utilizes the propagation angles and relative arrival times of received signals along the streamer. Three dimensional seismic reflection surveys use multiple towed hydrophone arrays for imaging the structure beneath the seafloor, providing an opportunity to significantly improve the uncertainty associated with streamer-generated call locations. All seismic surveys utilizing airguns conduct visual marine mammal monitoring surveys concurrent with the experiment, with powering-down of seismic source if a marine mammal is observed within the exposure zone. This study utilizes data from power-down periods of a seismic experiment conducted with two 8-km long seismic hydrophone arrays by the R/V Marcus G. Langseth near Alaska in summer 2011. Simulated and experiment data demonstrate that a single streamer can be utilized to resolve left-right ambiguity because the streamer is rarely perfectly straight in a field setting, but dual streamers provides significantly improved locations. Both methods represent a dramatic improvement over the existing Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) system for detecting low frequency baleen whale calls, with similar to 60 calls detected utilizing the seismic streamers, zero of which were detected using the current R/V Langseth PAM system. Furthermore, this method has the potential to be utilized not only for improving mitigation processes, but also for studying baleen whale behavior within the vicinity of seismic operations.

AB  - Under the EU Habitats Directive, cetacean species must be maintained at favourable conservation status in European waters. Whether this is achieved via protected area designation, curtailment of activities such as fishing or construction, or time restrictions on noise, it is dependent on understanding the temporal patterns in occurrence. Our ability to study this is often limited by the relatively short time-series of data available to researchers. This study uses nine years of passive acoustic monitoring data paired with environmental covariates to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of harbour porpoise and dolphin species using generalised estimating equations-generalised linear models (GEE-GLMs). This long-term time-series included periods of increased disturbance due to construction of an underwater gas pipeline in the area, enabling us to investigate the effect of construction on species occurrence. Harbour porpoise and dolphins occurred in every season, with detections peaking in winter. We found a negative association between dolphins and porpoises throughout the year. Inter-annual variation in occurrence was evident, with a cyclical bi-annual pattern highlighted for both species suggesting a complex pattern of movement. Construction activity had a significant negative effect on the presence of porpoise but not dolphins. However, no long-term decrease in detection rates of porpoise was recorded. This study highlights the importance of understanding what factors influence cetacean occurrence as well as the temporal scale of disturbance effects for planning and management of construction activities in coastal areas.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to develop a solar-powered autonomous surface vehicle (SASV) for the use of ocean environment monitoring and underwater passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals. Measuring items of the logger version CTD with optical fast DO sensor are depth, temperature, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll and turbidity. The authors have also developed kinds of underwater passive acoustic monitoring systems (UPAMSs) for establishing a soundness index of the ocean, and contributing to preventative safety measures for collision avoidance of high-speed vessels and cetaceans. A practical application of the SASV can be watching over swarm intelligent underwater vehicles. This SASV consists of a couple of solar panels with a charge-and-discharge controller, an embedded PC, a couple of thrustors, a GPS device and a 3-axis digital compass for navigation. The SASV can be operated in autonomous control mode and manual control mode by a small game controller. Feature of this small-sized, lightweight and low-cost SASV is easy handling and long-term operation. This paper deals with its design concept, hardware components, control software, and trial run.

AB  - A set of algorithms for real-time detection and localization of vocalizing marine mammals has been developed as part of the Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges (M3R) program. These algorithms work on a broad variety of vocalizations including sperm whale clicks. The detection algorithm is a two stage process utilizing a binary thresholded FFT as the first stage. The second stage examines the FFT output to determine whether a click is present in a given FFT window. Detected clicks are split out of the data stream and sent to a data association algorithm called a scanning sieve. Time differences of arrival (TDOAs) are calculated which are then fed into 2D and 3D hyperbolic localization algorithms. Software written to implement the algorithms was used to process a data set consisting of sperm whale vocalizations provided as part of the 2nd International Workshop on Detection and Localization of Marine Mammals using Passive Acoustics. Real-time detection and localization results from the data set are provided, along with a detailed description of the algorithms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marine habitat heterogeneity underpins species distribution and can be generated through interactions between physical and biological drivers at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used worldwide to study potential impacts of marine industrial activities on cetaceans, but understanding of animals' site use at small spatiotemporal scales (< 1 km, < 1 day) remains limited. Small-scale variability in vocalising harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) distribution within two Scottish marine renewable energy development (MRED) sites was investigated by deploying dense arrays of C-POD passive acoustic detectors at a wave energy test site (the European Marine Energy Centre [Billia Croo, Orkney]) and by a minor tidal-stream site (Scarba [Inner Hebrides]). Respective arrays consisted of 7 and 11 moorings containing two C-PODs each and were deployed for up to 55 days. Minimum inter mooring distances varied between similar to 300-600 m. All C-POD data were analysed at a temporal resolution of whole minutes, with each minute classified as 1 or 0 on the basis of presence/absence of porpoise click trains (Porpoise-Positive Minutes/PPMs). Porpoise detection rates were analysed using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) with Generalised Estimation Equations (GEES).
   Although there were many porpoise detections (wave test site: N=3,432; tidal-stream site: N=17,366), daily detection rates varied significantly within both arrays. Within the wave site array (< 1 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 43 to 14.8 PPMs/day. Within the tidal stream array (< 2 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 10.3 to 49.7 PPMs/day. GAM-GEE model results for individual moorings within both arrays indicated linkages between porpoise presence and small-scale heterogeneity among different environmental covariates (e.g., tidal phase, time of day). Porpoise detection rates varied considerably but with coherent patterns between moorings only several hundred metres apart and within hours. These patterns presumably have ecological relevance.
   These results indicate that, in energetically active and heterogeneous areas, porpoises can display significant spatiotemporal variability in site use at scales of hundreds of metres and hours. Such variability will not be identified when using solitary moored PAM detectors (a common practice for site-based cetacean monitoring), but may be highly relevant for site-based impact assessments of MRED and other coastal developments. PAM arrays encompassing several detectors spread across a site therefore appear to be a more appropriate tool to study site-specific cetacean use of spatiotemporally heterogeneous habitat and assess the potential impacts of coastal and nearshore developments at small scales.

AB  - There is strong socio-political support for offshore wind development in US territorial waters and construction is planned off several east coast states. Some of the planned development sites coincide with important habitat for critically endangered North Atlantic right whales. Both exclusion zones and passive acoustic monitoring are important tools for managing interactions between marine mammals and human activities. Understanding where animals are with respect to exclusion zones is important to avoid costly construction delays while minimizing the potential for negative impacts. Impact piling from construction of hundreds of offshore wind turbines likely require exclusion zones as large as 10 km. We have developed a three-hydrophone passive acoustic monitoring system that provides bearing information along with marine mammal detections to allow for informed management decisions in real-time. Multiple units form a monitoring system designed to determine whether marine mammal calls originate from inside or outside of an exclusion zone. In October 2021, we undertook a full system validation, with a focus on evaluating the detection range and bearing accuracy of the system with respect to right whale upcalls. Five units were deployed in Mid-Atlantic waters and we played more than 3500 simulated right whale upcalls at known locations to characterize the detection function and bearing accuracy of each unit. The modelled results of the detection function error were then used to compare the effectiveness of a bearing-based system to a single sensor that can only detect a signal but not ascertain directivity. Field trials indicated maximum detection ranges from 4-7.3 km depending on source and ambient noise levels. Simulations showed that incorporating bearing detections provide a substantial improvement in false alarm rates (6 to 12 times depending on number of units, placement and signal to noise conditions) for a small increase in the risk of missed detections inside of an exclusion zone (1%-3%). We show that the system can be used for monitoring exclusion zones and clearly highlight the value of including bearing estimation into exclusion zone monitoring plans while noting that placement and configuration of units should reflect anticipated ambient noise conditions.

AB  - One dataset made available for the 2nd international workshop on detection and localization of marine mammals using passive acoustics featured a single sperm whale recorded for 25 min on five widely spaced, bottom-mounted hydrophones in the Tongue of the Ocean. In this paper, we track the whale using a model-based method that relies on the difference in arrival times along direct and surface-reflected propagation paths. Four receivers are required to estimate positions in three-dimensions. Details of the method are presented, and tracks are estimated using an isospeed and a depth-dependent sound speed profile (SSP). Depth estimates for the isospeed SSP are about 50-100 m shallower than for the depth-dependent SSP, and horizontal positions are similar.

AB  - The numbers of animals in groups and the density of Blainville's beaked whale Mesoplodon densirostris (Md) were estimated using passive acoustic data collected on the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC). Md typically associate in groups, producing ultrasonic echolocation signals when foraging, and are routinely detected year-round on the AUTEC range. AUTEC includes a large network of hydrophones cabled to shore that can be used to detect Md echolocation signals. Using a first data set, with known group sizes, we used generalized linear models (GLMs) to model group size as a function of the acoustic footprint of a detected deep dive as perceived on the AUTEC hydrophones. The most important variable to explain group size was the detected click rate (total number of clicks detected divided by total length of vocal period duration). Using a second data set, covering 3 separate time periods in 2011 with automated group dive detections, we estimated beaked whale density using a dive counting approach. False positives were removed through manual inspection, removing dives with biologically infeasible characteristics. This led to a total of 8271 detections of beaked whale deep dives, with the average number per day in the three time periods considered being 75, 80 and 76 respectively. Using the selected GLM, the mean estimated group size was 236 (95% CI 2.15-2.60), 2.30 (95% CI 2.08-2.56), and 2.33 (95% CI 2.19-2.58) whales/group for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd time period. Md density was estimated at 15.8 (95% CI 13.6-21.9), 16.5 (95% CI 13.8-22.4), and 15.8 (95% Cl 13.2-21.2) whales/1000 km(2), respectively. These results support findings from previous studies, and will allow a more precise estimation of group sizes and densities for Md in future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persistently poor weather in the Arctic makes traditional marine mammal research from aircraft and ships difficult, yet collecting information on marine mammal distribution and habitat utilization is vital for understanding the impact of climate change on Arctic ecosystems. Moreover, as industrial use of the Arctic increases with the expansion of the open-water summer season, there is an urgent need to monitor the effects of noise from oil and gas exploration and commercial shipping on marine mammals. During September 2013, we deployed a single Slocum glider equipped with a digital acoustic monitoring (DMON) instrument to record and process in situ low-frequency (<5 kHz) audio to characterize marine mammal occurrence and habitat as well as ambient noise in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska, USA. The DMON was programmed with the low-frequency detection and classification system (LFDCS) to autonomously detect and classify sounds of a variety of Arctic and sub-Arctic marine mammal species. The DMON/LFDCS reported regularly in near real time via Iridium satellite detailed detection data, summary classification information, and spectra of background noise. The spatial distributions of bowhead whale, bearded seal, and walrus call rates were correlated with surface salinity measured by the glider. Bowhead whale and walrus call rates were strongly associated with a warm and salty water mass of Bering Sea origin. With a passive acoustic capability that allows both archival recording and near real-time reporting, we envision ocean gliders will become a standard tool for marine mammal and ocean noise research and monitoring in the Arctic.

AB  - Tidal power has been identified as one of the most promising commercial-scale renewable energy sources. Puget Sound, Washington, is a potential site to deploy tidal power generating devices. The risk of injury for killer whales needs to be managed before the deployment of these types of devices will be approved by regulating authorities. A passive acoustic system consisting of two star arrays, each with four hydrophones, was designed and implemented for the detection and localization of Southern Resident killer whales. Performance evaluation of the passive acoustic system was conducted at Sequim Bay, Washington. A total of nine sound source locations were chosen, within a radius of 250 m around the star arrays, to evaluate the accuracy of our localization approach. A localization algorithm, a least square solver, was applied to obtain a bearing location to a sound source from each star array. The sound source location was estimated by the intersection of the bearings from the two star arrays. Bearing and distance errors were computed to compare calculated and true (from Global Positioning System) sound source locations. Observed bearing errors were within 1.04 for eight of the nine test locations; location 3 had bearing errors slightly larger than expected due to a high level of background noise. The distance errors for six of the test locations were between 1.91 and 32.36 m. The other two test locations, 8 and 9, were near the line passing through the centers of the two star arrays, where large errors were expected based on theoretical sensitivity analysis results.

AB  - The development of risk assessments for the exposure of protected populations to noise from coastal construction is constrained by uncertainty over the nature and extent of marine mammal responses to man-made noise. Stakeholder concern often focuses on the potential for local displacement caused by impact piling, where piles are hammered into the seabed. To mitigate this threat, use of vibration piling, where piles are shaken into place with a vibratory hammer, is often encouraged due to presumed impact reduction. However, data on comparative responses of cetaceans to these different noise sources are lacking. We studied the responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to both impact and vibration pile driving noise during harbor construction works in northeast Scotland, using passive acoustic monitoring devices to record cetacean activity and noise recorders to measure and predict received noise levels. Local abundance and patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins were also compared with a five-year baseline. The median peak-to-peak source level estimated for impact piling was 240 dB re 1 lPa (single-pulse sound exposure level [SEL] 198 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s), and the r.m.s. source level for vibration piling was 192 dB re 1 lPa. Predicted received broadband SEL values 812 m from the piling site were markedly lower due to high propagation loss: 133.4 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s (impact) and 128.9 dB re 1 lPa2 s (vibration). Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises were not excluded from sites in the vicinity of impact piling or vibration piling; nevertheless, some small effects were detected. Bottlenose dolphins spent a reduced period of time in the vicinity of construction works during both impact and vibration piling. The probability of occurrence of both cetacean species was also slightly less during periods of vibration piling. This work provides developers and managers with the first evidence of the comparative effects of vibration and impact piling on small cetaceans, enabling more informed risk assessments, policy frameworks, and mitigation plans. In particular, our results emphasize the need for better understanding of noise levels and behavioral responses to vibration piling before recommending its use to mitigate impact piling.

AB  - The seasonal and geographic patterns in the distribution, residency, and density of two populations (Chukchi and Beaufort) of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) were examined using data from aerial surveys, passive acoustic recordings, and satellite telemetry to better understand this arctic species in the oceanographically complex and changing western Beaufort Sea. An aerial survey data-based model of beluga density highlights the Beaufort Sea slope as important habitat for belugas, with westerly regions becoming more important as summer progresses into fall. The Barrow Canyon region always had the highest relative densities of belugas from July-October. Passive acoustic data showed that beluga whales occupied the Beaufort slope and Beaufort Sea from early April until early November and passed each hydrophone location in three broad pulses during this time. These pulses likely represent the migrations of the two beluga populations: the first pulse in spring being from Beaufort animals, the second spring pulse Chukchi belugas, with the third, fall pulse a combination of both populations. Core-use and home range analyses of satellite-tagged belugas showed similar use of habitats as the aerial survey data, but also showed that it is predominantly the Chukchi population of belugas that uses the western Beaufort, with the exception of September when both populations overlap. Finally, an examination of these beluga datasets in the context of wind-driven changes in the local currents and water masses suggests that belugas are highly capable of adapting to oceanographic changes that may drive the distribution of their prey.

AB  - Passive acoustic recorders set around Australia since 2004 have been used to study blue whales. Calls from New Zealand pygmy blue whales occur predominantly eastward of Bass Strait (145.8 degrees E), calls from Eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue whales (EIO PB) west of Bass Strait, while Antarctic blue whale calls occur along the entire southern Australian coast. The only location all calls have been detected within a short space of time in the same season is Bass Strait, where inter-species mixing commonly occurs. The EIO PB shows three migratory stages: "southbound" from November to January during which whales travel down the Western Australian coast; "southern Australian" where animals spread across the Indian and Southern Oceans spanning longitudes from 74 degrees to 146 degrees E down to at least a latitude of 55 degrees S searching for food and feeding; then a northern migration where they return north to Indonesian waters post April-August. Along the southern Australian coastline EIO PB whales are more often detected towards the east, favouring an area where late summer to autumn upwelling occurs mostly over similar to 134-145 degrees E longitude. Receivers on the shelf break south of Portland (141.2 degrees E) showed 10-181 times greater EIO PB whale calling when integrated over their three month season than at sites located around the Great Australian Bight to the west. Within a season the Portland site did not show consistency of EIO PB whale presence or number of calling individuals, but when the number of calling individuals was integrated across a season and correlated with an upwelling index of seasonally integrated seabed water temperature across seven seasons, the upwelling index predicted 83% of the seasonal variance in whale presence. The strength of this correlation will be reduced by population growth of whales. By correcting EIO PB whale call rates for a variety of population growth rate values, we found a 4.3% growth rate for the population proportion visiting the Portland area, gave the maximum regression, correlation coefficient of r(2) = 90%. Time averaged levels of squared pressure produced at the upper chorus frequency of the Antarctic blue whale z-call and received via deep sound channel propagation at Portland showed a 12.6% increase rate. This is indicative of population growth rate for Antarctic blue whales using waters south of Australia, although the value of using pressure squared in this fashion and the assumptions underlying the technique need to be explored.

AB  - This paper investigates the system requirements and signal processing tools for a semi-autonomous passive acoustic boat detection framework for monitoring marine environments. The objective is to develop a surveillance system which provides wide area coverage, automatic (boat) detection, and ultimately the ability to communicate real-time alerts (i.e., a bell-ringer system). A critical challenge for a successful system is the ability to accurately detect (and possibly classify) targets in the presence of noise. A wavelet detection algorithm has been developed to identify the presence of a boat in acoustic signals overwhelmed by noise from snapping shrimp and humpback whales. A feature extraction tool is introduced to examine the harmonically related structures in shipping noise. These methods are applied on acoustic data collected in a series of field tests in Hawaii, in which small-scale sensor networks were deployed near Marine Protected Areas (MPA) to assess the ability to monitor boat activity. A simulation tool developed based on Bellhop is introduced to study boat signatures under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Describing the repertoire of sounds produced by wild cetaceans is necessary for understanding their function, for acoustic population monitoring and for measuring the potential influence of anthropogenic impact. Geographic variation in the types and parameters of sounds makes regional assessment of vocal behaviour necessary. We describe the acoustic repertoire of a small population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting Walvis Bay, Namibia from recordings made over 59 encounters (72h) between 2009 and 2012. The characteristics of burst pulse (BP) sounds, low-frequency narrow-band (LFN) sounds, brays, whistles and chirps are described. The BP sounds identified were generated at 150-1050 pulses per second, and most were short, lasting less than 1s in duration. Bottlenose dolphins from Walvis Bay produce the lowest frequency LFN sounds described for the species. Whistles ranged in frequency from 1.58 to 23.24kHz, and the mean acoustic parameters were within the range of those described from other geographic regions. Chirps were identified infrequently and usually as single occurrences. Although several sound types were often produced in close temporal succession, we found little evidence of stereotyped bray production, even during recordings of animals feeding. Our results demonstrate geographic variation in both the characteristics and sound types used by bottlenose dolphins and highlight the importance of regional data collection as a pre-curser to passive acoustic monitoring programmes.

AB  - Discrimination of bioacoustic signals to the species or population level is critical for using passive acoustic monitoring to study cetacean ecology. Risso's dolphins off southern California have distinctive peaks and notches in their echolocation clicks, but it was unknown whether Risso's dolphins from other geographic areas have similarly distinctive click spectra and whether populations are acoustically distinct. This study investigates using clicks for species and population identification by characterizing the spectral structure of Risso's dolphin echolocation clicks recorded over wide-ranging geographic regions including the U.S. waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and North Pacific Ocean; and international waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. All recordings with Risso's dolphin clicks exhibited the spectral peak and notch pattern described off southern California, indicating the presence of peak banding patterns is useful for species discrimination. Geographic regions were a significant explanatory factor for variability in the frequencies of click spectral peaks, with relatively higher frequency peaks and notches found off Hawaii compared to California waters and off the southeast U.S. compared to the Gulf of Mexico. In the North Atlantic Ocean, a latitudinal cline in frequencies was evident. Potential causes of acoustic variation within and among acoustic encounters are evaluated.

AB  - Large groups of animals aggregate around resource hotspots, with group size often influenced by the heterogeneity of the environment. In most cases, the foraging success of individuals within groups is interdependent, scaling either constructively or destructively with group size. Here we used biologging tags, acoustic prey mapping, passive acoustic recording of social cues and remote sensing of surface currents to investigate an alternative scenario in which large, dense aggregations of southeast Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, and northeast Pacific blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, were each associated with ephemeral krill aggregations large enough such that their availability to predators appeared to be influenced more by environmental features than by consumption, implying independence of group size and consumption rates. We found that the temporal scale and spatial extent of oceanographic drivers were consistent with the temporal scale and locations of predator aggregations, and additionally found that groups formed above bathymetric features known to promote zooplankton concentration. Additionally, we found calling behaviour counter-indicative of competition: blue whale foraging calls were anomalously high during observed aggregation time periods, suggesting signalling behaviour that could alert conspecifics to the location of high-quality resources. Modelled results suggest that the use of social information reduces the time required for individuals to discover and exploit high-quality resources, allowing for more efficient foraging without apparent costs to the caller. Thus, rorqual whales foraging in these environments appear to exhibit a social foraging strategy whereby a behaviour with negligible individual costs (signalling) provides information that enhances group foraging efficiency. The population density dependence of this social foraging strategy may help explain why some rorqual species were at first slow to recover from human exploitation, but have since increased more rapidly.

TI  - Using line acceleration to measure false killer whale (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>) click and whistle source levels during pelagic longline depredation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA  - English
KW  - OCEAN
AB  - False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) depredate pelagic longlines in offshore Hawaiian waters. On January 28, 2015 a depredation event was recorded 14m from an integrated GoPro camera, hydrophone, and accelerometer, revealing that false killer whales depredate bait and generate clicks and whistles under good visibility conditions. The act of plucking bait off a hook generated a distinctive 15Hz line vibration. Two similar line vibrations detected at earlier times permitted the animal's range and thus signal source levels to be estimated over a 25-min window. Peak power spectral density source levels for whistles (4-8 kHz) were estimated to be between 115 and 130 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz @ 1m. Echolocation click source levels over 17-32 kHz bandwidth reached 205 dB re 1 mu Pa @ 1m pk-pk, or 190 dB re 1 mu Pa @ 1m (root-mean-square). Predicted detection ranges of the most intense whistles are 10 to 25km at respective sea states of 4 and 1, with click detection ranges being 5 times smaller than whistles. These detection range analyses provide insight into how passive acoustic monitoring might be used to both quantify and avoid depredation encounters. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - The international problem of incidental capture and consequent drowning of small cetaceans in passive fishing gear necessitates research to identify techniques which will minimize such interactions. Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) interactions with bottom-set gear are of considerable concern both in North America and in Europe. However, these animals are difficult to study and their apparent inability to avoid gillnets requires explanation. Few data on this animal's echolocation capabilities exist. Source levels (SL) and spectra have been determined for two young animals rescued from strandings. In the absence of direct acoustic measurement, the minimum sonar beam widths have been estimated using physical acoustic parameters with dimensions determined From autopsied animals. Individual harbour porpoises foraging in the Cromarty Firth in Scotland have been tracked at the surface with electronic rheodolites and video, whilst their underwater acoustic emissions were monitored using an innovative acoustic detection system. The preliminary data suggest that these animals search for prey using a narrowbeam, narrowband, high-frequency sonar with a detection range, for single fish of an ingestible size, up to 30 m. These sonar characteristics appear to favour foraging close to either the sea surface or the bottom. The implications of this finding are discussed in the context of bottom-set gillnets.

AB  - When implementing conservation strategies involving passive acoustic monitoring, an accurate description of signal properties is crucial, especially when studying threatened and elusive vocalizing species. Misrepresentation of detected sounds can result in information loss or misclassification of species, thus compromising the management process. Distortion of the time-frequency features depends on the characteristics of acoustic propagation through sea water, sensitivity and sampling frequency of the acquisition system and distance between cetacean source and the receiving sensor (hydrophone). This study examined how the sampling frequency and the distance from the source affect the properties of burst pulsed sounds emitted by short-beaked common dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea and how the signal is modified in relation to the recording scenarios. Burst pulses were collected at 300 000 samples/s, and down-sampled at 192 000, 96 000, 48 000 and 44 100. Fifteen acoustic parameters were automatically measured. The median values were measured and compared among the signals sampled at different rates. Finally, a transmission loss model was applied to explore the variation of the power spectrum density during click propagation through seawater. The results showed that, even if higher sampling rates are a more accurate match with the original signal, some parameters (number of clicks, inter-click-interval and maximum peak) measured at 96 000 and 192 000 Hz did not display significant differences compared with 300 000 Hz, except for the frequency parameters. The transmission loss model also showed that the highest frequency components strongly attenuate within 800 m from the source. These results suggest that high recording distances and lower sampling rates do not allow an accurate analysis of burst pulsed signals. However, taking into account data storage limitations, recording at the highest frequency is not always required for an accurate description of signals and the outcomes of this study improve the accuracy of passive acoustic monitoring systems, thus enhancing the potential for conservation of short-beaked common dolphins.

AB  - A Bayesian model is proposed for estimating abundance or density of animals from passive acoustic binary data. The data are collected at points along one or more transects, and the points are spaced so that a single individual can be heard multiple times. Thus successive data points are dependent and this dependence is exploited to simultaneously estimate density, range of detection and probability of detection. The data are assumed to follow a homogeneous Poisson process. The Bayesian model combines a prior distribution for the model parameters, with a second-order Markov approximation to the likelihood. Sensitivity of the model to choice of priors is investigated. The method is illustrated using acoustic data from a survey of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Underwater ambient sound contains quantifiable information about the sound source. In the frequency band from 500 Hz to 50 kHz, dominant geophysical sources of underwater sound include the sound of breaking waves and rainfall. Other sound sources in the marine environment include: (1) geophysical sources such as earthquakes and volcanoes, (2) biological sources such as cetaceans, pinnipeds, fish and crustaceans, and (3) anthropogenic noises such as shipping, industrial noise and sonar. In this paper, we address the design and development of a low-duty cycle underwater passive aquatic listener (UPAL) sensor to monitor the ambient noise in marine environments. This sensor can also detect acoustic events such as rain storms, passing ships and marine animals. Further, the UPAL sensor includes real-time classification and quantification of the observed sound sources. Data from real experiments will be presented.

AB  - Marine passive acoustic monitoring can be used to study biological, geophysical, and anthropogenic phenomena in the ocean. The wide range of characteristics from geophysical, biological, and anthropogenic sounds sources makes the simultaneous automatic detection and classification of these sounds a significant challenge. Here, we propose a single Hidden Markov Model-based system with a Deep Neural Network (HMM-DNN) for the detection and classification of low-frequency biological (baleen whales), geophysical (earthquakes), and anthropogenic (air guns) sounds. Acoustic data were obtained from the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization station off Juan Fernandez, Chile (station HA03) and annotated by an analyst (498 h of audio data containing 30,873 events from 19 different classes), and then divided into training (60%), testing (20%), and tuning (20%) subsets. Each audio frame was represented as an observation vector obtained through a filterbank-based spectral feature extraction procedure. The HMM-DNN training procedure was carried out discriminatively by setting HMM states as targets. A model with Gaussian Mixtures Models and HMM (HMM-GMM) was trained to obtain an initial set of HMM target states. Feature transformation based on Linear Discriminant Analysis and Maximum Likelihood Linear Transform was also incorporated. The HMM-DNN system displayed good capacity for correctly detecting and classifying events, with high event-level accuracy (84.46%), high weighted average sensitivity (84.46%), and high weighted average precision (89.54%). Event-level accuracy increased with higher event signal-to-noise ratios. Event-level metrics per class also showed that our HMM-DNN system generalized well for most classes but performances were best for classes that either had a high number of training exemplars (e.g., generally above 50) and/or were for classes of signals that had low variability in spectral features, duration, and energy levels. Fin whale and Antarctic blue whale song and air guns performed particularly well.

LA  - English
CP  - Oceans 2006 Conference
AB  - Techniques to detect and localize marine mammals including Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) using the bottom-mounted hydrophones of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center have been developed. A series of verification tests using these passive acoustics techniques to determine the presence and position of vocalizing animals are being conducted. These acoustic "sightings" are verified by a team of surface observers. Based on Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution tag data and the ongoing verification tests, vocalizations associated with M. densirostris appear to be distinct in type, frequency, and repetition rate. Group size estimates have been derived from these tests and from previous long-term observations. By acoustically mapping the distribution of animals and applying estimatei of average group size an initial density estimate for M densirostris is derived.

AB  - Journal of Experimental Biology has a long history of reporting research discoveries on animal echolocation, the subject of this Centenary Review. Echolocating animals emit intense sound pulses , process echoes to localize objects in dynamic soundscapes. More than 1100 species of bats and 70 species of toothed whales rely on echolocation to operate in aerial and aquatic environments, respectively. The need to mitigate acoustic clutter and ambient noise is common to both aerial and aquatic echolocating animals, resulting in convergence of many echolocation features, such as directional sound emission and hearing , decreased pulse intervals and sound intensity during target approach. The physics of sound transmission in air and underwater constrains the production, detection and localization of sonar signals, resulting in differences in response times to initiate prey interception by aerial and aquatic echolocating animals. Anti-predator behavioral responses of prey pursued by echolocating animals affect behavioral foraging strategies in air and underwater. For example, many insect prey can detect and react to bat echolocation sounds, whereas most fish and squid are unresponsive to toothed whale signals, but can instead sense water movements generated by an approaching predator. These differences have implications for how bats and toothed whales hunt using echolocation. Here, we consider the behaviors used by echolocating mammals to specialIntscript track and intercept moving prey equipped with predator detectors, specialIntscript interrogate dynamic sonar scenes and specialIntscript exploit visual and passive acoustic stimuli. Similarities and differences in animal sonar behaviors underwater and in air point to open research questions that are ripe for exploration.

AB  - Narwhal acoustic phonation is embedded in the icy cacophony of one of the noisiest soundscapes in the ocean. The high susceptibility of the narwhal to climate change highlights the need for further efforts to document baseline descriptions of the sounds it produces, especially given the potential anthropogenic impacts on their habitats. However, observations are rare, and narwhal acoustic behavior and habitats are poorly understood (attributed to both the skittish nature of hard-to-approach narwhals and the difficult access to remote and often dangerous glacier fjords). Here, we provide acoustic measurements in a narwhal summering ground in glacial fjords in Northwest Greenland that were mainly collected during Inuit hunting expeditions. This unique observational strategy near a key narwhal hot spot allowed the acquisition of supervised near-source recordings of narwhal vocalizations, which confirms the animal's presence within several hundred meters of an actively calving Bowdoin Glacier. We accurately describe the acoustic signals and noise related to the cetacean, environmental, and anthropogenic sources, show previously unreported signals and their properties, report elevated background noise levels near the calving front, and discuss the general soundscape features of a glacier fjord. The baseline information presented here should encourage long-term follow-up acoustic monitoring in the area and provides an important reference for comparisons with future conditions and other regions. We also anticipate that our work will be a starting point both for the development of criteria to distinguish pulsed calls from terminal buzzes and for a thorough discussion of the dual use of passive acoustic monitoring in traditional hunting practices.

AB  - Environmental and ecological factors can trigger changes in the acoustic repertoire of cetaceans. This study documents the first use of a well-established passive acoustic monitoring device (C-POD) to analyze echolocation sounds and behavior of franciscana dolphins in different habitats: estuary [Babitonga Bay (BB)] and open sea [Itapiruba Beach (IB)]. A total of 10 924 click trains were recorded in BB and 6 093 in IB. An inter-click interval < 10 ms (so called "feeding buzzes") was used as a proxy for foraging activity. The main difference in the acoustic parameters between the two habitats was related to the frequency spectrum, with higher maximum and lower modal and minimum click frequencies in BB, and a train frequency range of 17 kHz, against 10 kHz in IB. Also, the click emission rate (clicks/s) was almost 20% higher in BB. Both studied habitats showed a high proportion of feeding buzzes (BB = 68%; IB = 58%), but with a higher probability of occurrence in BB (p < 0.001) and at night (p < 0.001) in both habitats. The C-PODs showed great potential to monitor occurrence, bioacoustics parameters, and echolocation behavior of franciscana dolphins. Longer-term temporal and spatial monitoring are necessary for elucidating several issues raised in this study. (c) 2021 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are highly social Arctic toothed whales with large vocal repertoires and similar acoustic profiles. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) that uses multiple hydrophones over large spatiotemporal scales has been a primary method to study their populations, particularly in response to rapid climate change and increasing underwater noise. This study marks the first acoustic comparison between wild belugas and narwhals from the same location and reveals that they can be acoustically differentiated and classified solely by echolocation clicks. Acoustic recordings were made in the pack ice of Baffin Bay, West Greenland, during 2013. Multivariate analyses and Random Forests classification models were applied to eighty-one single-species acoustic events comprised of numerous echolocation clicks. Results demonstrate a significant difference between species' acoustic parameters where beluga echolocation was distinguished by higher frequency content, evidenced by higher peak frequencies, center frequencies, and frequency minimums and maximums. Spectral peaks, troughs, and center frequencies for beluga clicks were generally > 60 kHz and narwhal clicks < 60 kHz with overlap between 40-60 kHz. Classification model predictive performance was strong with an overall correct classification rate of 97.5% for the best model. The most important predictors for species assignment were defined by peaks and notches in frequency spectra. Our results provide strong support for the use of echolocation in PAM efforts to differentiate belugas and narwhals acoustically.

AB  - As a first step to Antarctic blue whale (ABW) monitoring using passive acoustics, a method based on the stochastic matched filter (SMF) is proposed. Derived from the matched filter (MF), this filter-based denoising method enhances stochastic signals embedded in an additive colored noise by maximizing its output signal to noise ratio (SNR). These assumptions are well adapted to the passive detection of ABW calls where emitted signals are modified by the unknown impulse response of the propagation channel. A filter bank is computed and stored offline based on a priori knowledge of the signal second order statistics and simulated colored sea-noise. Then, the detection relies on online background noise and SNR estimation, realized using time-frequency analysis. The SMF output is cross-correlated with the signal's reference (SMF thorn MF). Its performances are assessed on an ccean bottom seismometer-recorded ground truth dataset of 845 ABW calls, where the location of the whale is known. This dataset provides great SNR variations in diverse soundscapes. The SMF thorn MF performances are compared to the commonly used MF and to the Z-detector (a subspace detector for ABW calls). Mostly, the benefits of the use of the SMF thorn MF are revealed on low signal to noise observations: in comparison to the MF with identical detection threshold, the false alarm rate drastically decreases while the detection rate stays high. Compared to the Z-detector, it allows the extension of the detection range of similar or equal to 30 km in presence of ship noise with equivalent false discovery rate.

AB  - All animals sleep and it is essential for maintaining optimal brain function. However, cetaceans engage in the unusual practice of unihemispherical sleep, where only half of their brain sleeps at a time, due to their constant need for movement and breathing. Most studies of sleep in cetaceans have occurred in captivity. However, tagging devices have now developed to the point where the data collected from wild animals can be assessed against published criteria for defining sleep behaviourally. Seven acoustic and behavioural data loggers were deployed on harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, in Danish waters between May 2010 and August 2011 and stayed on the animals between 53 and 72 h, recording 1884 to 2755 valid dives per animal. Parabolic dives with significantly reduced bioacoustic activity and a stereotyped behavioural pattern were identified as potential sleeping periods. The recordings for nearly half of the parabolic dives were found to contain no vocalization (echolocation clicks), significantly more than other dive types. Of the remaining parabolic dives, the click rate was, when normalized to their individual means, also significantly lower than detected in other dive types. Additionally, parabolic dives were shallow compared to all other dive types, and found to have a stereotypic low-energy profile. They were also found to contain fewer rolls and incorporate a lower vertical descent rate than most other dive types. If the data are representative, harbour porpoises spend a small, but meaningful amount of their diving time engaged in parabolic dives and thus potentially sleeping. All animals have a fundamental need for undisturbed sleep. These quiet periods thus need to be considered in studies of anthropogenic effects, but also those employing passive acoustic monitoring techniques, as well as in efforts to reduce incidental bycatch in fisheries, given the associated periods of reduced environmental awareness.

AB  - The soundscape is an important habitat component for marine animals. In the Arctic, marine conditions are changing rapidly due to sea ice loss and increased anthropogenic activities such as shipping, which will influence the soundscape. Here, we assess the contributors to the summer soundscape in the shallow waters of the Mackenzie River estuary within the Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Area in the western Canadian Arctic, a core summering habitat for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas Pallas, 1776). We collected passive acoustic data during the summer over four years, and assessed the influence of physical variables, beluga whale vocalizations, and boat noise on sound pressure levels in three frequency bands (low: 0.2 -1 kHz; medium: 1 -10 kHz; high: 10 -48 kHz) to quantify the soundscape. Wind speed, wave height, beluga vocalizations, and boat noise were all large contributors to the soundscape in various frequency bands. The soundscape varied to a lesser degree between sites, time of day, and with tide height, but remained relatively constant between years. This study is the first detailed description of a shallow summer soundscape in the western Canadian Arctic, an important habitat for beluga whales, and can be used as a baseline to monitor future changes during this season.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine denoising autoencoders (DAEs) for improving the detection of right whales recorded in harsh marine environments. Passive acoustic recordings are taken from autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) and are subject to noise from sources such as shipping and offshore construction. To mitigate the noise we apply DAEs and consider how best to train the classifier by augmenting clean training data with examples contaminated by noise. Evaluations find that the DAE improves detection accuracy and is particularly effective when the classifier is trained on data that has itself been denoised rather than using a clean model. Further, testing on unseen noises is also effective particularly for noises that exhibit similar character to noises seen in training.

AB  - Population growth and economic development in Latin America has led to an increase in seismic surveying to find new marine hydrocarbon reserves. However, most countries along the Pacific, Atlantic, and Caribbean lack the standards to minimize the impact of seismic exploration on marine organisms. We searched primary and secondary literature in major databases and consulted international authorities and oil companies to provide scientific evidence of the effects of seismic surveying on fish and cetaceans in order to propose minimum guidelines to reduce disturbance to marine organisms in Latin America. The results suggest that seismic surveys can disrupt basic life-cycle activities such as movement, communication, and feeding. Typical outcomes include sub-lethal effects such as escape behavior, habituation, temporary loss of hearing, and changes in vocalization behavior. In order to mitigate these impacts, we propose that oil companies must provide authorities with an environmental impact assessment that includes survey data, array specifications, and acoustic array properties before a hydrocarbon exploration license can be granted. Standard mitigation measures such as exclusion zones, marine mammal observers, and passive acoustic monitoring must be implemented to prevent potential adverse effects. Appropriate legislation and regulations must be designed and implemented, and environmental authorities should be privy to all activities by seismic vessels. Besides relevant regulations and continued monitoring, further investigation must be conducted to evaluate the impact of these activities on marine organisms. The adoption of these proposed minimum guidelines is highly re commended to minimize seismic surveying impact on fish and cetaceans in Latin American countries.

AB  - The alarming rise in the ocean noises due to the ramping up of anthropogenic activities had adversely impacted the marine fauna and altered the soundscape of the oceans. In recent times, Deep learning has gained high significance in assessing this pervasive underwater noise data. Studying the underwater soundscape is crucial in conserving the ocean health and in achieving a "quiet ocean". As an effort to it, in this paper, we present a deep neural network architecture, Convolutional Neural Network-based ocean noise classification cum recognition system capable of classifying vocalization of cetaceans, fishes, marine invertebrates, anthropogenic sounds, natural sounds, and the unidentified ocean sounds from passive acoustic ocean noise recordings. The challenge is to classify these noises amidst the highly non-stationary sound spectrum of short low grunts to long high peaked vocals, limited sensor receiving range, and the need for a large annotated training data. The proposed method can self-learn the features from the training audio data with no need for feature extraction proving better adaptability to complex audio acoustic signals. Experimental results prove that the proposed system is befitting for classifying ocean noises with 96.1% accuracy. Classification helps in distinguishing natural acoustic systems from artificial acoustic systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multi-sensor observations, integrated across time and space, may bridge knowledge gaps in ecosystem dynamics, one aspect of which is species co-occurrence. In the present work, we combined data streams from 2 acoustic technologies; passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and acoustic telemetry (AT) jointly installed under the LifeWatch project. We made use of existing long-term data series from studies on single-species dynamics, to investigate the co-occurrence of multiple species: European seabass, Atlantic cod and cetaceans (harbour porpoise and dolphins), in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Common co-occurrence analyses were applied to a combined PAM and AT hourly presence-absence matrix at different spatial and temporal resolutions. The fish species were in the presence of harbour porpoise at least one-third (seabass) to nearly half (cod) of the time they were detected. At a seasonal resolution, we did not observe probabilities of occupancy to be higher or lower than what is expected by chance, while we could discern patterns of co-occurrence when using an hourly resolution. Analyses done at an hourly resolution showed that porpoises have a significantly higher probability of co-occurrence with cod or seabass during autumn and winter nights. Developing these large-scale networks of integrated acoustic instruments while considering species co-occurrences would further expand data applicability. Considering co-occurrence in ecological research is a step towards ecosystem-based management of our oceans.

AB  - Passive acoustic data are increasingly being used as a tool for helping to define marine mammal populations and stocks. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) songs present a unique opportunity to determine interstock differences. Their highly stereotyped interpulse interval has been shown to vary between geographic areas and to remain stable over time in some areas. In this study the structure of songs recorded at two geographically close feeding aggregations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and Gulf of Maine (GoM) was compared. Recordings were made from September 2005 through February 2006 in the GSL and intermittently between January 2006 and September 2007 at two locations in the GoM. 6257 pulse intervals corresponding to 19 GSL and 29 GoM songs were measured to characterize songs from both areas. Classification trees showed that GSL songs differ significantly from those in the GoM. The results are consistent with those derived from other stock structure assessment methodologies, such as chemical signature and photoidentification analysis, suggesting that fin whales in these areas may form separate management stocks. Song structure analysis could therefore provide a useful and cost-efficient tool for defining conservation units over temporal and geographical scales relevant to management objectives in fin whales.

AB  - Bowhead whales vocalize during their annual fall migration from the Beaufort Sea to the Bering Sea, but the calling rates of individual animals are so low that tracking an individual trajectory is impractical using passive acoustic methods. However, the travel speed and direction of the migrating population can be inferred on a statistical basis by cross-correlating time sequences of call density measured at two locations spaced several kilometers apart. By using the triangulation abilities of a set of vector sensors deployed offshore the Alaskan North Slope between 2008 and 2014, call density time sequences were generated from 1-km wide and 40-km tall rectangular "zones" that were separated by distances ranging from 3.5 to 15 km. The cross-covariances between the two sequences generate a peak corresponding to the average time it takes for whales to travel between the zones. Consistent westward travel speeds of similar to 5 km/h were obtained from four different locations on 6 of the 7 years of the study, independent of whether the zones were separated by 3.5, 7, or 15 km. Some sites, however, also revealed a less prominent eastern movement of whales, and shifts in migration speed were occasionally detectable over week-long time scales.

AB  - Evaluation of the performance of computer-based algorithms to automatically detect mammalian vocalizations often relies on comparisons between detector outputs and a reference data set, generally obtained by manual annotation of acoustic recordings. To explore the reproducibility of these annotations, inter-and intra-analyst variability in manually annotated Antarctic blue whale (ABW) Z-calls are investigated by two analysts in acoustic data from two ocean basins representing different scenarios in terms of call abundance and background noise. Manual annotations exhibit strong inter-and intra-analyst variability, with less than 50% agreement between analysts. This variability is mainly caused by the difficulty of reliably and reproducibly distinguishing single calls in an ABW chorus made of overlaying distant calls. Furthermore, the performance of two automated detectors, based on spectrogram correlation or subspace-detection strategy, is evaluated by comparing detector output to a "conservative" manually annotated reference data set, which comprises only analysts' matching events. This study highlights the need for a standardized approach for human annotations and automatic detections, including a quantitative description of their performance, to improve the comparability of acoustic data, which is particularly relevant in the context of collaborative approaches in collecting and analyzing large passive acoustic data sets.

AB  - We investigated the feasibility of using a T-POD, a passive acoustic dolphin detector system, to monitor bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland, from 27 June to 18 August 2005. A v.3 T POD, logging alternate minutes, was moored in view of an observation site. Land-based theodolite tracking was used to record the position of the closest animal, school size and activity of the closest dolphin school to the T POD. All cetacean detections on the TPOD synchronous with shore watches in sea states :52 were analysed. A total of 94 schools were observed at distances up to 8000 in from the observer. Acoustic detections corresponded well with visual detections, with 82% of the dolphin schools observed within 500 m of the T-POD detected acoustically. The furthest distance dolphins were observed from the T POD during periods of acoustic detection was 1246 m. Twelve acoustic encounters were logged without corresponding visual detections, four of which may represent false positives. School size did not affect the acoustic detectability of the dolphins, as there was no difference in the size of schools observed with or without corresponding acoustic detections (Kruskal Wallis, P = 0.64). Simillarly no relationship was found between acoustic detections and school sizes at different distances to the T-POD (linear regression P=0.5, r(2)=0.01). Acoustic encounters did not vary in relation to diel patterns (Mann-Whitnet P=0.13) but were related to tidal state (chi(2)=40.2, P=0.00, df=11) with more encounters logged in the 4 h after high water, probably reflecting prey-related changes in habitat use. T-POD detections correlated well with visual observations and although detection is likely to vary according to T POD specification, sensitivity and the conditions at the deployment site, the T-POD is a useful tool that has been shown to offer the possibility of continuous monitoring, something that is difficult to achieve with visual methods alone.

AB  - This article describes an automatic detector for marine mammal vocalizations. Even though there has been previous research on optimizing automatic detectors for specific calls or specific species, the detection of any type of call by a diversity of marine mammal species still poses quite a challenge-and one that is faced more frequently as the scope of passive acoustic monitoring studies and the amount of data collected increase. Information (Shannon) entropy measures the amount of information in a signal. A detector based on spectral entropy surpassed two commonly used detectors based on peak-energy detection. Receiver operating characteristic curves were computed for performance comparison. The entropy detector performed considerably faster than real time. It can be used as a first step in an automatic signal analysis yielding potential signals. It should be followed by automatic classification, recognition, and identification algorithms to group and identify signals. Examples are shown from underwater recordings in the Western Canadian Arctic. Calls of a variety of cetacean and pinniped species were detected. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - Assessments of the impact of offshore energy developments are constrained because it is not known whether fine-scale behavioural responses to noise lead to broader-scale displacement of protected small cetaceans. We used passive acoustic monitoring and digital aerial surveys to study changes in the occurrence of harbour porpoises across a 2000 km(2) study area during a commercial two-dimensional seismic survey in the North Sea. Acoustic and visual data provided evidence of group responses to air gun noise from the 470 cu inch array over ranges of 5-10 km, at received peak-to-peak sound pressure levels of 165-172 dB re 1 mu Pa and sound exposure levels (SELs) of 145-151 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s(-1). However, animals were typically detected again at affected sites within a few hours, and the level of response declined through the 10 day survey. Overall, acoustic detections decreased significantly during the survey period in the impact area compared with a control area, but this effect was small in relation to natural variation. These results demonstrate that prolonged seismic survey noise did not lead to broader-scale displacement into suboptimal or higher-risk habitats, and suggest that impact assessments should focus on sublethal effects resulting from changes in foraging performance of animals within affected sites.

AB  - 1. The affordability, storage and power capacity of compact modern recording hardware have evolved passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of animals and soundscapes into a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for research and ecological management particularly useful for bats and toothed whales that orient and forage using ultrasonic echolocation. The use of PAM at large scales hinges on effective automated detectors and species classifiers which, combined with distance sampling approaches, have enabled species abundance estimation of toothed whales. But standardized, user-friendly and open access automated detection and classification workflows are in demand for this key conservation metric to be realized for bats.
   2. We used the PAMGuard toolbox including its new deep learning classification module to test the performance of four open-source workflows for automated analyses of acoustic datasets from bats. Each workflow used a different initial detection algorithm followed by the same deep learning classification algorithm and was evaluated against the performance of an expert manual analyst.
   3. Workflow performance depended strongly on the signal-to-noise ratio and detection algorithm used: the full deep learning workflow had the best classification accuracy (<= 67%) but was computationally too slow for practical large-scale bat PAM. Workflows using PAMGuard's detection module or triggers onboard an SM4BAT or AudioMoth accurately classified up to 47%, 59% and 34%, respectively, of calls to species. Not all workflows included noise sampling critical to estimating changes in detection probability over time, a vital parameter for abundance estimation. The workflow using PAMGuard's detection module was 40 times faster than the full deep learning workflow and missed as few calls (recall for both similar to 0.6), thus balancing computational speed and performance.
   4. We show that complete acoustic detection and classification workflows for bat PAM data can be efficiently automated using open-source software such as PAMGuard and exemplify how detection choices, whether pre-or post-deployment, hardware or software-driven, affect the performance of deep learning classification and the downstream ecological information that can be extracted from acoustic recordings. In particular, understanding and quantifying detection/classification accuracy and the probability of detection are key to avoid introducing biases that may ultimately affect the quality of data for ecological management.

AB  - Pygmy blue whales in the South-east Indian Ocean migrate from the southern coast of Australia to Indonesia, with a significant part of their migration route passing through areas subject to oil and gas production. This study aimed at improving our understanding of the spatial extent of the distribution, migration and foraging areas, to better inform impact assessment of anthropogenic activities in these regions. Using a combination of passive acoustic monitoring of the NW Australian coast (46 instruments from 2006 to 2019) and satellite telemetry data (22 tag deployments from 2009 to 2021) we quantified the pygmy blue whale distribution and important areas during their northern and southern migration. We show extensive use of slope habitat off Western Australia and only minimal use of shelf habitat, compared to southern Australia where use of the continental shelf and shelf break predominates. In addition, movement behaviour estimated by a state-space model on satellite tag data showed that in general pygmy blue whales off Western Australia were mostly engaged in migration, interspersed with relatively short periods (median = 28 h, range = 2 - 1080 h) of low move persistence (slow movement with high turning angles), which is indicative of foraging. Using the spatial overlap of time and number of whales in area analysis of the satellite tracking data (top 50% of grid cells) with foraging movement behaviour, we quantified the spatial extent of pygmy blue whale high use areas for foraging and migration. We compared these areas to the previously described areas of importance to foraging and migrating whales (Biologically Important Areas; BIAs). In some cases these had good agreement with the most important areas we calculated from our data, but others had only low (5%) to moderate (15%) overlap. Month was the most important variable predicting the number of pygmy blue whale units and number of singers (acting as indices of pygmy blue whale density). Whale density was highest in the southern part of the NW Australian coast and whales were present there between April-June, and November-December, a pattern also confirmed by the satellite tracking data. Available data indicated pygmy blue whales spent up to 124 days in Indonesian waters (34% of annual cycle). Since this area may also be the calving ground for this population, inter-jurisdictional management is necessary to ensure their full protection.

AB  - Automatic algorithms for the detection and classification of sound are essential to the analysis of acoustic datasets with long duration. Metrics are needed to assess the performance characteristics of these algorithms. Four metrics for performance evaluation are discussed here: receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, detection-error-trade-off (DET) curves, precision-recall (PR) curves, and cost curves. These metrics were applied to the generalized power law detector for blue whale D calls [Helble, Ierley, D'Spain, Roch, and Hildebrand (2012). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 131(4), 2682-2699] and the click-clustering neural-net algorithm for Cuvier's beaked whale echolocation click detection [Frasier, Roch, Soldevilla, Wiggins, Garrison, and Hildebrand (2017). PLoS Comp. Biol. 13(12), e1005823] using data prepared for the 2015 Detection, Classification, Localization and Density Estimation Workshop. Detection class imbalance, particularly the situation of rare occurrence, is common for long-term passive acoustic monitoring datasets and is a factor in the performance of ROC and DET curves with regard to the impact of false positive detections. PR curves overcome this shortcoming when calculated for individual detections and do not rely on the reporting of true negatives. Cost curves provide additional insight on the effective operating range for the detector based on the a priori probability of occurrence. Use of more than a single metric is helpful in understanding the performance of a detection algorithm. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI  - Integrated marine mammal monitoring and protection system (IMAPS): Gray whale target strength measurements and the analysis of the back-scattered response
T2  - OCEANS 2006, VOLS 1-4
LA  - English
CP  - Oceans 2006 Conference
AB  - The central IMAPS objective is to establish a global solution for systematic assessment and protection of the marine environment for the Navy, offshore industry, and scientific research community, through the development and implementation of a comprehensive, modular tool. The limitations of current technologies are that they are individually inadequate to fully achieve mitigation objectives. Visual monitoring, passive location, high frequency active sonar, and radar all have their inherent limitations such as weather conditions, a necessity for vocalizations, maximum detection range, and sea state limitations. Therefore, there is a need for all the sources of information related to the detection and classification of marine mammals to be fused and to operate in real-time in order to provide a robust protection, assessment, and research system.
   The other IMPAS direction is concentrated on the design and development of the active sonar modality representing just one component of the global system. The active sonar was designed, built and tested during the Marine Mammal Active Sonar Test (MAST 04), producing whale detections and whale tracks. The experiment was conducted in January 2004 off the coast of California. One of the objectives is to distinguish whale backscattered responses from the ones generated by the environmental clutter in a waveguide. Furthermore, it aims to identify and analyze the target signature features that are necessary for enhanced active sonar detection and classification of marine mammals. Over the years there have been very few documented attempts to capture and analyze the backscattering response of whales using an active sonar system. Nevertheless, whales, mostly owing to their size, their motion, and the aspect dependence of their backscattered field, posses desirable properties that help distinguishing their scattered response from clutter and other environment related false alarms. As an initial step, data collected during the MAST04 experiment is presented, and gray whale target strength measurements are obtained. Results are compared to the previously published whale target strengths. Additionally, an investigation is conducted in an effort to provide whale feature identification points suitable for automated detection and classification, as means of relating gray whale active acoustic signatures to their inherent characteristics and their motion. During the MAST04 experiment, the active sonar component feasibility has been demonstrated, while the second generation system is being developed for the MAST 07 experiment. Tracking and classification algorithams are being further developed and they will be implemented and tested during the upcoming MAST 07 experiment. MAST 07 will feature a lighter, autonomus, fuel cell powered active sonar system, implementing real time marine mammal detection, tracking and classikation algorithms.

AB  - The associations between feeding activities and environmental variables inform animal feeding tactics that maximize energetic gains by minimizing energy costs while maximizing feeding success. Relevant studies in aquatic animals, particularly marine mammals, are scarce due to difficulties in the observation of feeding behaviors in aquatic environments. This data scarcity concurrently hinders ecosystem-based fishery management in the context of small toothed-cetacean conservation. In the present study, a passive acoustic monitoring station was deployed in an East Asian finless porpoise habitat in Laizhou Bay to investigate potential relationships between East Asian finless porpoises and their prey. The data revealed that porpoises were acoustically present nearly every day during the survey period. Porpoise detection rates differed between spring and autumn in concert with activities of fish choruses. During spring, fish choruses were present throughout the afternoon, and this was the time when porpoise vocalizations were the most frequently detected. During autumn, when fish choruses were absent, porpoise detection rates decreased, and diurnal patterns were not detected. The close association between fish choruses and finless porpoise activities implies an "eavesdropping" feeding strategy to maximize energetic gains, similar to other toothed cetaceans that are known to engage similar feeding strategies. Underwater noise pollution, particularly those masking fish choruses, could interrupt finless porpoises' feeding success. Fisheries competing soniferous fishes with finless porpoise could impact finless porpoise viability through ecosystem disruption, in addition to fishing gear entanglement.

AB  - Concerns were raised about possible behavioral disturbance to narwhals (Monodon monoceros) when exposed to shipping noise in Milne Inlet, Baffin Island, Canada. We deployed passive acoustic recorders in August and September 2018 and 2019, along and adjacent to the nominal shipping corridor. We measured broadband (0.01-25 kHz) sound pressure levels (SPL) after correcting for the auditory weighting function of high frequency cetaceans. Received SPLs and counts of Whistles, Buzzes, and Knocks were compared in a before-during-after study of individual bulk carrier transits, relative to periods with no ships. Narwhal call counts were generally lower once bulk carriers were within line-of-sight, including when ship noise levels were just above ambient noise levels. Call counts varied both "before" and "after" individual bulk carriers passed by the recorders. There was no evidence of a behavioral threshold SPL below which a response did not occur. We did not observe call count reductions to the same extent in 2019 compared to 2018 as higher ambient noise levels in 2019 likely masked some individual ship noise. There was no evidence of habituation or sensitization to the bulk carrier noise within or between years. Continued acoustic monitoring is recommended, especially if bulk carrier transits increase.

AB  - Deep-diving sperm whales have a complex social structure and the largest brain of any animal, but very little is known about the ontogeny of their diving, foraging, echolocation, and communication skills. In large-brained terrestrial species, social skills develop earlier than locomotor abilities, but this may not be feasible for sperm whales, which require locomotor skills from birth to breathe, swim, and suckle. Here, we shed new light on the relative development of social and locomotor capabilities of a wild toothed whale. Sound and movement recording tags deployed on three first-year sperm whale calves for a total of 15h revealed that these calves rarely produced codas for communication with adult whales, but likely tracked the ample passive acoustic cues emitted by clicking adults. The calves' diving capabilities were well developed (maximum dive depth: 285, 337, and 662m; maximum dive time: 11, 31, and 44min) and they all produced clicks in a way that is consistent with echolocation. The calf performing the longest and deepest dives additionally emitted two echolocation buzzes, suggesting that it could haveattempted to forage. Thus, sperm whale calves may supplement their milk diet with food caught independently at depth much earlier than previously believed. Contrary to terrestrial mammals, we propose that the maturation of locomotor, diving, and echolocation skills may be favored over investment in developing social communication skills at an early age in sperm whales.Significance statementThe life of deep-diving toothed whales has up until recently been a mystery and the understanding of their behavior has generally been limited to surface observations and captive studies. Fortunately, the rapid development of animal-borne bio-logging devices has markedly improved our knowledge of the behavior of adult whales. The behavior and development of young calves are, however, still largely unknown. Sperm whale calves are challenged by being air-breathing marine mammals, which must learn to hunt prey at great depths. Using Dtags, we here show that sperm whale calves have much more pronounced diving capabilities than previously thought. The onset of independent foraging and foraging effort seems linked to the diving capability of the calf. These results show that young members of this otherwise slowly maturing species of apex predators do learn to dive and may hunt much earlier than previously believed.

AB  - A passive acoustic method is presented for tracking sperm whale dive profiles, using two or three hydrophones deployed as either a vertical or large-aperture towed array. The relative arrival times between the direct and surface-reflected acoustic paths are used to obtain the ranges and depths of animals with respect to the array, provided that the hydrophone depths are independently measured. Besides reducing the number of hydrophones required, exploiting surface reflections simplifies automation of the data processing. Experimental results are shown from 2002 and 2003 cruises in the Gulf of Mexico for two different towed array deployments. The 2002 deployment consisted of two short-aperture towed arrays separated by 170 in, while the 2003 deployment placed an autonomous acoustic recorder in tandem with a short-aperture towed array, and used ship noise to time-align the acoustic data. The resulting dive profiles were independently checked using single-hydrophone localizations, whenever multipath reflections from the ocean bottom could be exploited to effectively create a large-aperture vertical array. This technique may have applications for basic research and for real-time mitigation for seismic airgun surveys. (C) 2004 Acoustical Society of America.

AB  - High-throughput environmental sensing technologies are increasingly central to global monitoring of the ecological impacts of human activities. In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring, when coupled with automated signal recognition software, allows researchers to perform simultaneous monitoring at large spatial and temporal scales. This technique has been widely used to monitor cetaceans, bats, birds, and anurans but rarely applied to monitor primates. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of passive acoustic monitoring and automated signal recognition software for detecting the presence and monitoring the roaring behavior of the Black and Gold Howler Monkey (Alouatta caraya) over a complete annual cycle at one site in the Brazilian Pantanal. The diel pattern of roaring activity was unimodal, with high vocal activity around dawn. The howler monkey showed a clear seasonal pattern of roaring activity, with most of the roars detected during the wet season (74.9%, peak activity during November and December). The maximum vocal activity occurred during the period of maximum flowering and fruit production in the study area, suggesting a potential role of roaring in defending major feeding sites, which is in agreement with the findings of previous studies on the species. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that roaring may serve different purposes. Vocal activity was negatively associated with relative air humidity, which might be related to lower vocal activity on wetter and rainy days, while vocal activity was not related to minimum air temperature. Automated signal recognition software allowed us to detect the species in 89% of the recordings in which it was vocally active, but with a reduced time cost, since the time investment for data analyses was 2% of recording time. The good performance of the recognizer might be related to the long and loud roars of the howler monkey. Further research should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of automated signal recognition for detecting the calls of different species of primates and under different environmental conditions.

AB  - In this paper, a study is carried out for detecting North Atlantic Right Whale upcalls with measurements from passive acoustic monitoring devices. Preprocessed spectrograms of upcalls are subjected to two different tasks, one of which is based on extraction of time-frequency features from upcall contours, and the other that employs a Local Binary Pattern operator to extract salient texture features of the upcalls. Then several classifiers are used to evaluate the effectiveness of both the contour-based and texture-based features for upcall detection. Detection results reveal that popular classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and TreeBagger can achieve high detection rates. Furthermore, using LBP features for call detection shows improved accuracy of about 3% to 4% over time-frequency features when an identical classifier is used.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) has been used to gain insight into their presence and behavior. Many of their calls have been shown to be detectable through spectrogram correlation due to the low variation in these stereotyped calls. In this work, we describe rule based classifiers for tonal B and D calls using the pitch/frequency contour information obtained from a contour extractor. B calls can be detected by spectrogram correlation, but the D calls are highly variable and are therefore difficult to detect using spectrogram kernel methods. Experiments on four hours of evaluation data from different field seasons show that 91.3% of B calls and 85.8% of D calls were correctly retrieved. For both types of calls, less than 2% of the retrieved calls were false positives.

AB  - The growing interest in generating electrical power from tidal currents using tidal turbine generators raises a number of environmental concerns, including the risk that marine mammals might be injured or killed through collision with rotating turbine blades. To understand this risk, information on how marine mammals use tidal rapid habitats and in particular, their underwater movements and dive behaviour is required. Porpoises, which are the most abundant small cetacean at most European tidal sites, are difficult animals to tag, and the limited size of tidal habitats means that any telemetered animal would be likely to spend only a small proportion of time within them. Here, an alternative approach is explored, whereby passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used to obtain fine scale geo-referenced tracks of harbour porpoises in tidal rapid areas. Large aperture hydrophone arrays are required to obtain accurate locations of animals from PAM data and automated algorithms are necessary to process the large quantities of acoustic data collected on such systems during a typical survey. Methods to automate localisation, including a method to match porpoise detections on different hydrophones and separate different vocalising animals, and an assessment of the localisation accuracy of the large aperture hydrophone array are presented.

AB  - Vessels cause considerable disturbance to cetaceans world-wide, with potential long-term impacts to population viability. Here we present a comprehensive review of vessel impacts to cetacean behavior in Australian waters (2003-2015), finding inadequate protections to be in place. The majority of these studies found trends of decreased animal travel and resting behavioral states as well as low compliance to regulations, and they recommended further regulatory action such as greater enforcement or monitoring, or passive management strategies. As a case study, we conducted the first field assessment of vessel compliance with the Wildlife (Marine Mammal) Regulations 2009 in Gippsland Lakes, Australia, and provide the first assessment of the endangered Gippsland Lakes Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis) population's behavioral ecology. Dolphin behavior and vessel regulation compliance data were collected during boat-based surveys of Gippsland Lakes from July 2017 to January 2018, with a total of 22 dolphin group sightings resulting in 477 five-minute point samples. 77% of dolphin sightings involved vessel interactions (within 400 m), and 56 regulation breaches were observed. These breaches were most severe in summer (mean = 4.54 breaches/hour). Vessels were found to alter dolphin behavior before, during, and after interactions and regulation breaches, including increased mating (mate guarding) and milling behavioral states, and increased 'fish catch', 'high leap' and 'tail slap' behavioral events. These behavioral changes may indicate masking of the dolphins' acoustic communication, disturbance of prey, increased dolphin transition behaviors, and/or induced stress and changes to group structure (including increased mate guarding). While our results provide evidence of short-term altered behavior, the potential for long-term effects on population dynamics for this threatened species is high. In the context of reported inadequate cetacean protection Australia-wide, our management recommendations include greater monitoring and enforcement, and the utilisation of adaptive management.

AB  - Worldwide, the frequency (pitch) of blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) calls has been decreasing since first recorded in the 1960s. This frequency decline occurs over annual and inter-annual timescales and has recently been documented in other baleen whale species, yet it remains unexplained. In the Northeast Pacific, blue whales produce two calls, or units, that, when regularly repeated, are referred to as song: A and B calls. In this population, frequency decline has thus far only been examined in B calls. In this work, passive acoustic data collected in the Southern California Bight from 2006 to 2019 were examined to determine if A calls are also declining in frequency and whether the call pulse rate was similarly impacted. Additionally, frequency measurements were made for B calls to determine whether the rate of frequency decline is the same as was calculated when this phenomenon was first reported in 2009. We found that A calls decreased at a rate of 0.32 Hz yr(-1) during this period and that B calls were still decreasing, albeit at a slower rate (0.27 Hz yr(-1)) than reported previously. The A call pulse rate also declined over the course of the study, at a rate of 0.006 pulses/s yr(-1). With this updated information, we consider the various theories that have been proposed to explain frequency decline in blue whales. We conclude that no current theory adequately accounts for all aspects of this phenomenon and consider the role that individual perception of song frequency may play. To understand the cause behind call frequency decline, future studies might want to explore the function of these songs and the mechanism for their synchronization. The ubiquitous nature of the frequency shift phenomenon may indicate a consistent level of vocal plasticity and fine auditory processing abilities across baleen whale species.

AB  - Knowing the abundance of a population is a crucial component to assess its conservation status and develop effective conservation plans. For most cetaceans, abundance estimation is difficult given their cryptic and mobile nature, especially when the population is small and has a transnational distribution. In the Baltic Sea, the number of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) has collapsed since the mid-20th century and the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN and HELCOM; however, its abundance remains unknown. Here, one of the largest ever passive acoustic monitoring studies was carried out by eight Baltic Sea nations to estimate the abundance of the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise for the first time. By logging porpoise echolocation signals at 298 stations during May 2011-April 2013, calibrating the loggers' spatial detection performance at sea, and measuring the click rate of tagged individuals, we estimated an abundance of 71-1105 individuals (95% CI, point estimate 491) during May-October within the population's proposed management border. The small abundance estimate strongly supports that the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise is facing an extremely high risk of extinction, and highlights the need for immediate and efficient conservation actions through international cooperation. It also provides a starting point in monitoring the trend of the population abundance to evaluate the effectiveness of management measures and determine its interactions with the larger neighboring Belt Sea population. Further, we offer evidence that design-based passive acoustic monitoring can generate reliable estimates of the abundance of rare and cryptic animal populations across large spatial scales.

AB  - The source properties and radiation patterns of animal vocalisations define, along with propagation and noise conditions, the active space in which these vocalisations can be detected by conspecifics, predators, prey, and by passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). This study reports the 4 pi (360 degrees horizontal and vertical) beam profile of a free-swimming, trained harbour porpoise measured using a 27-element hydrophone array. The forward echolocation beam is highly directional, as predicted by a piston model, and is consistent with previous measurements. However, at off-axis angles greater than +/- 30 degrees, the beam attenuates more rapidly than the piston model and no side lobes are present. A diffuse back beam is also present with levels about -30 dB relative to the source level. In PAM, up to 50% of detections can be from portions of the beam profile with distorted click spectra, although this drops substantially for higher detection thresholds. Simulations of the probability of acoustically detecting a harbour porpoise show that a traditional piston model can underestimate the probability of detection compared to the actual three-dimensional radiation pattern documented here. This highlights the importance of empirical 4 pi measurements of beam profiles of toothed whales, both to improve understanding of toothed whale biology and to inform PAM.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring, a non-invasive technique, is increasingly used to study animal populations and habitats at much larger spatial and temporal scales than standard methods. However, easy to apply tools for reliable detection and classification of signals of interest among hundreds or even thousands of hours of recording are still lacking. We introduce the r package soundClass, a tool to train convolutional neural networks, and employ them to classify sound events in recordings. soundClass provides a sound event classification pipeline, from annotating recordings to automating trained networks usage in real-life situations. We illustrate the package functionality on bat echolocation calls, bird songs and whale echolocation clicks, showing that the package can be used to train networks for several types of sound events, taxonomic groups and environments; and exemplify its application. This tool facilitates the creation and usage of trained networks and was developed with a strong focus on graphical user interfaces to be used by non-specialist scientists in statistics and programming.

AB  - Navy sonar has been associated with a number of marine mammal stranding events worldwide. As a result determining the effects of anthropoge nise on marine mammals is currently an active area of research. The developemnt methods to detect and localixe the animals in their native environments is key to advance this reearch and our understanding .This paper presents a collection of algorithms for automated passive acoustic detection, classification and localization of vocalizing marine mammals in open ocean environments. The toool set known as M3R (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges) uses the large fields of wide-bandwidth bottom-mounted hydrophones that are part of the U.S Navy undersea ranges to listen for vocalizing whales. M3R employs time-frequency analysis to passively detect whale vocalizations; It then aligns detections among neighboring hydrophones to determine the difference in times of arrival (TDOA) of each vocalization. Sets of TDOA are then used to determine 2-D or 3-D position points using hyperbolic localization techniques. An M3R system is capable of continuous automated real-time monitoring of over 200 wide-bandwidth hydrophones covering 2,000+ km(2) of open ocean M3R is typically used in a collaborative fashion to localize animals in support of tagging exercises visual surveys and behavioural response experiments.

TI  - A Risk Function for Behavioral Disruption of Blainville's Beaked Whales (<i>Mesoplodon densirostris</i>) from Mid-Frequency Active Sonar
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - There is increasing concern about the potential effects of noise pollution on marine life in the world's oceans. For marine mammals, anthropogenic sounds may cause behavioral disruption, and this can be quantified using a risk function that relates sound exposure to a measured behavioral response. Beaked whales are a taxon of deep diving whales that may be particularly susceptible to naval sonar as the species has been associated with sonar-related mass stranding events. Here we derive the first empirical risk function for Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) by combining in situ data from passive acoustic monitoring of animal vocalizations and navy sonar operations with precise ship tracks and sound field modeling. The hydrophone array at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Bahamas, was used to locate vocalizing groups of Blainville's beaked whales and identify sonar transmissions before, during, and after Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar operations. Sonar transmission times and source levels were combined with ship tracks using a sound propagation model to estimate the received level (RL) at each hydrophone. A generalized additive model was fitted to data to model the presence or absence of the start of foraging dives in 30-minute periods as a function of the corresponding sonar RL at the hydrophone closest to the center of each group. This model was then used to construct a risk function that can be used to estimate the probability of a behavioral change (cessation of foraging) the individual members of a Blainville's beaked whale population might experience as a function of sonar RL. The function predicts a 0.5 probability of disturbance at a RL of 150dBrms re mu Pa (CI: 144 to 155) This is 15dB lower than the level used historically by the US Navy in their risk assessments but 10 dB higher than the current 140 dB step-function.

AB  - Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are typically dispersed throughout their circumtropical range, but the species is also known to aggregate in specific coastal areas. Accurate site descriptions associated with these aggregations are essential for the conservation of R. typus, an Endangered species. Although aggregations have become valuable hubs for research, most site descriptions rely heavily on sightings data. In the present study, visual census, passive acoustic monitoring, and long range satellite telemetry were combined to track the movements of R. typus from Shib Habil, a reef-associated aggregation site in the Red Sea. An array of 63 receiver stations was used to record the presence of 84 acoustically tagged sharks (35 females, 37 males, 12 undetermined) from April 2010 to May 2016. Over the same period, identification photos were taken for 76 of these tagged individuals and 38 were fitted with satellite transmitters. In total of 37,461 acoustic detections, 210 visual encounters, and 33 satellite tracks were analyzed to describe the sharks' movement ecology. The results demonstrate that the aggregation is seasonal, mostly concentrated on the exposed side of Shib Habil, and seems to attract sharks of both sexes in roughly equal numbers. The combined methodologies also tracked 15 interannual homing-migrations, demonstrating that many sharks leave the area before returning in later years. When compared to acoustic studies from other aggregations, these results demonstrate that R. typus exhibits diverse, site-specific ecologies across its range. Sightings-independent data from acoustic telemetry and other sources are an effective means of validating more common visual surveys.

AB  - This paper contributes to documenting a change in the distribution of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (NARWs) that occurred in the 2010s, when the whales largely abandoned their traditional summering grounds in the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy/Scotian shelf. Data from a year-round passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) network in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were exploited to build the time series of NARW incursions into this inland sea of the Northwest Atlantic, from June 2010 to November 2018. NARWs visited the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence every year from June to January, until ice freeze-up. The earliest detections were made at the end of April and the latest in mid-January. Call occurrence peaked between August and the end of October. NARW contact calls were not detected at the most upstream station at Les Escoumins, in the Lower St. Lawrence estuary, or at the northeastern connection of Belle Isle Strait with the Atlantic, which was monitored from November 2010 to November 2011. The mean daily occurrence of NARWs in the feeding grounds off Gaspe quadrupled after 2015 compared to 2011-2014. Long-term continuous PAM data provided invaluable information to document this marine mammal distribution shift.

AB  - Increased knowledge about marine mammal seasonal distribution and species assemblage from the South Orkney Islands waters is needed for the development of management regulations of the commercial fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in this region. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data were collected during the autumn and winter seasons in two consecutive years (2016, 2017), which represented highly contrasting environmental conditions due to the 2016 El Nino event. We explored differences in seasonal patterns in marine mammal acoustic presence between the two years in context of environmental cues and climate variability. Acoustic signals from five baleen whale species, two pinniped species and odontocete species were detected and separated into guilds. Although species diversity remained stable over time, the ice-avoiding and ice-affiliated species dominated before and after the onset of winter, respectively, and thus demonstrating a shift in guild composition related to season. Herein, we provide novel information about local marine mammal species diversity, community structure and residency times in a krill hotspot. Our study also demonstrates the utility of PAM data and its usefulness in providing new insights into the marine mammal habitat use and responses to environmental conditions, which are essential knowledge for the future development of a sustainable fishery management in a changing ecosystem.

AB  - We propose an approximate maximum likelihood method for estimating animal density and abundance from binary passive acoustic transects, when both the probability of detection and the range of detection are unknown. The transect survey is purposely designed so that successive data points are dependent, and this dependence is exploited to simultaneously estimate density, range of detection, and probability of detection. The data are assumed to follow a homogeneous Poisson process in space, and a second-order Markov approximation to the likelihood is used. Simulations show that this method has small bias under the assumptions used to derive the likelihood, although it performs better when the probability of detection is close to 1. The effects of violations of these assumptions are also investigated, and the approach is found to be sensitive to spatial trends in density and clustering. The method is illustrated using real acoustic data from a survey of sperm and humpback whales.

AB  - Understanding temporal patterns in distribution, occurrence and behaviour is vital for the effective conservation of cetaceans. This study used cetacean click detectors (C-PODs) to investigate spatial and temporal variation in occurrence and foraging activity of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose (Tursiops aduncus) and Indian Ocean humpback (Sousa plumbea) dolphins resident in the Menai Bay Conservation Area (MBCA), Zanzibar, Tanzania. Occurrence was measured using detection positive minutes. Inter-click intervals were used to identify terminal buzz vocalisations, allowing for analysis of foraging activity. Data were analysed in relation to spatial (location) and temporal (monsoon season, diel phase and tidal phase) variables. Results showed significantly increased occurrence and foraging activity of dolphins in southern areas and during hours of darkness. Higher occurrence at night was not explained by diel variation in echolocation rate and so were considered representative of occurrence patterns. Both tidal phase and monsoon season influenced occurrence but results varied among sites, with no general patterns found. Foraging activity was greatest during hours of darkness, High water and Flood tidal phases. Comparisons of echolocation data among sites suggested differences in the broadband click spectra of MBCA dolphins, possibly indicative of species differences. These dolphin populations are threatened by unsustainable fisheries bycatch and tourism activities. The spatial and temporal patterns identified in this study have implications for future conservation and management actions with regards to these two threats. Further, the results indicate future potential for using passive acoustics to identify and monitor the occurrence of these two species in areas where they co-exist.

AB  - In recent years, Taiwan's government has focused on policies regarding offshore wind farming near the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin habitat, where marine mammal observation is a critical consideration. The present research developed an algorithm called National Taiwan University Passive Acoustic Monitoring (NTU_PAM) to assist marine mammal observers (MMOs). The algorithm performs whistle detection processing and whistle localization. Whistle detection processing is based on image processing and whistle feature extraction; whistle localization is based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) method. To test the whistle detection performance, we used the same data to compare NTU_PAM and the widely used software PAMGuard. To test whistle localization, we designed a real field experiment where a sound source projected simulated whistles, which were then recorded by several hydrophone stations. The data were analyzed to locate the moving path of the source. The results show that localization accuracy was higher when the sound source position was in the detection region composed of hydrophone stations. This paper provides a method for MMOs to conveniently observe the migration path and population dynamics of cetaceans without ecological disturbance.

AB  - In this paper we present a method to improve the accuracy of the Time Difference of Arrivals (TDOA) estimators for reducing the uncertainty in localizing sperm whales using passive acoustics. More precisely we suggest the use of Teager-Kaiser energy operator for the enhancement of recordings made by hydrophones before applying an estimator of TDOA. Using data from the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) and standard estimators for TDOA like the Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) approaches or statistical methods based on LMS, we show that the suggested pre-processing method significantly improves the accuracy of these estimators. Simulating various Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, we are able to show the robustness of the pre-processing approach against additive noise.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) relate species information to environmental conditions to predict potential species distributions. The majority of SDMs are static, relating species presence information to long-term average environmental conditions. The resulting temporal mismatch between species information and environmental conditions can increase model inference's uncertainty. For SDMs to capture the dynamic species-environment relationships and predict near-real-time habitat suitability, species information needs to be spatiotemporally matched with environmental conditions contemporaneous to the species' presence (dynamic SDMs). Implementing dynamic SDMs in the marine realm is highly challenging, particularly due to species and environmental data paucity and spatiotemporally biases. Here, we implemented presence-only dynamic SDMs for four migratory baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean (SO): Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin, and humpback whales. Sightings were spatiotemporally matched with their respective daily environmental predictors. Background information was sampled daily to describe the dynamic environmental conditions in the highly dynamic SO. We corrected for spatial sampling bias by sampling background information respective to the seasonal research efforts. Independent model evaluation was performed on spatial and temporal cross-validation. We predicted the circumantarctic year-round habitat suitability of each species. Daily predictions were also summarized into bi-weekly and monthly habitat suitability. We identified important predictors and species suitability responses to environmental changes. Our results support the propitious use of dynamic SDMs to fill species information gaps and improve conservation planning strategies. Near-real-time predictions can be used for dynamic ocean management, e.g., to examine the overlap between habitat suitability and human activities. Nevertheless, the inevitable spatiotemporal biases in sighting data from the SO call for the need for improving sampling effort in the SO and using alternative data sources (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring) in future SDMs. We further discuss challenges of calibrating dynamic SDMs on baleen whale species in the SO, with a particular focus on spatiotemporal sampling bias issues and how background information should be sampled in presence-only dynamic SDMs. We also highlight the need to integrate visual and acoustic data in future SDMs on baleen whales for better coverage of environmental conditions suitable for the species and avoid constraints of using either data type alone.

AB  - Clicks of male sperm whales (Physeter catodon Linneaus) were recorded off Northern Norway using a hydrophone array. The 3-D diving behaviour in one complete (34 min) and four incomplete (6-36 min) dives was observed using passive acoustic localization. The vertical swim speed was 0.8-1.4 m/s, and the horizontal swim speed was 0.2-2.6 m/s. The maximum dive depth of an individual track ranged from 358 to 1494 m. The bottom depth was 500 to 1600 m and a scattering layer was present at 250 m. Clicks were usually emitted with inter-click intervals (10) of 0.5-2 s in blocks of 29-249 clicks, interspaced by pauses of 6-117 s. The length of blocks decreased with depth in a manner predictable from a pneumatic sound generator. Click sequences with shorter interclick intervals, denoted creaks and believed to indicate feeding events, were located at depths from 278 to 1245 m. This study suggests that sperm whales exploit prey in a large part of the water column below the scattering layer and use an air-driven sound production system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In the Arctic, in-situ measurement of the upper water column properties (e.g., salinity and temperature) has been a challenge because of the seasonal sea ice coverage. A Long-term Acoustic Real-Time Sensor for Polar Areas (LARA) was developed, field-tested in the shallow water off Oregon and its performance evaluated. The LARA utilizes a commercially available underwater profiler winch from NiGK, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors, and a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems. The sensor section consists of two modules: 1) a satellite antenna with a temperature and depth sensor (TD) and 2) a sensor buoy with a controller, a CTD, and a PAM. Using the two vertically separated temperature and pressure sensors, it is capable of detecting the presence of sea ice by sensing the oceanographic conditions in the upper water column. In addition, using the acoustic sensors, (1) surface wind speed can be estimated from the ambient noise level and (2) enable monitoring of marine mammal calling activity. The winch can be fully controllable from the sensor buoy by acoustic commands. It is capable of aborting an ascent in case sea ice coverage or a high sea state was detected. Although the sea ice detection algorithm could not be tested in Oregon waters, the LARA successfully repeated 94 profiles and transmitted CTD and acoustic detections data via satellite. The wind speed estimates by the PAM were in good agreement with the nearby buoy data. The PAM recorded various biological signals from 10 Hz to 60 kHz including vocalizations of fin, humpback, sperm whales and calls of Pacific white-sided dolphins. The system is capable of repeating 365 profiles or one profile per day for 1 year making it suitable for collecting high-resolution water column data in the extreme weather and water conditions of the Arctic.

AB  - We present a new method of detecting North Atlantic Right Whale (NARW) upcalls using a Multimodel Deep Learning (MMDL) algorithm. A MMDL detector is a classifier that embodies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Stacked Auto Encoders (SAEs) and a fusion classifier to evaluate their output for a final decision. The MMDL detector aims for diversity in the choice of the classifier so that its architecture is learned to fit the data. Spectrograms and scalograms of signals from passive acoustic sensors are used to train the MMDL detector. Guided by previous applications, we trained CNNs with spectrograms and SAEs with scalograms. Outputs from individual models were evaluated by the fusion classifier. The results obtained from the MMDL algorithm were compared to those obtained from conventional machine learning algorithms trained with handcrafted features. It showed the superiority of the MMDL algorithm in terms of the upcall detection rate, non-upcall detection rate, and false alarm rate. The autonomy of the MMDL detector has immediate application to the effective monitoring and protection of one of the most endangered species in the world where accurate call detection of a low-density species is critical, especially in environments of high acoustic-masking.

AB  - The study of sound in the natural environment provides interesting information for researchers and policy makers driving conservation policies in our society. The soundscape characterises the biophony, anthrophony and geophony of a particular area. The characterisation of these different sources can lead to changes in ecosystems and we need to identify these parameters in order to make the right decision in relation to the natural environment. These values could be extrapolated and potentially help different areas of ecoacoustic research. Technological advances have enabled the passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of animal populations in their natural environment. Recordings can be made with little interference, avoiding anthropogenic effects, making it a very effective method for some species such as cetaceans and other marine species in addition to underwater noise studies. Passive acoustic monitoring can be used for population census, but also to understand the effect of human activities on animals. However, recording data over long periods of time requires large storage and processing capacity to handle all the acoustic events generated. In the case of marine environments, the installation of sensors and instruments can be costly in terms of money and maintenance effort. In addition, if they are placed offshore, a data communication problem arises with coverage and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a low-cost instrument to monitor the soundscape of a marine area using ecoacoustic indices. The instrument is called MASE and provides three echo-acoustic indices at 10 min intervals that are available in real time, which drastically reduces the volume of data generated. It has been operating uninterruptedly for a year and a half since its deployment, except during maintenance periods. MASE has been able to operate uninterruptedly, and maintain an adequate temperature inside while preserving its structural integrity for long periods of time. This has allowed the monitoring and characterisation of the soundscape of the test area in Gando Bay, Gran Canaria Island (Spain) without the need for human intervention to access the data on the instrument itself. Thanks to its integration with an external server, this allows the long-term monitoring of the soundscape, and it is possible to observe changes in the soundscape. In addition, the instrument has made it possible to compare the period of acoustic inactivity during confinement and the return of anthropogenic acoustic activity at sea.

AB  - Since 2016, the Taiwan government has started the Thousand Wind Turbines Project, the goal of which is to build one thousand offshore wind turbines and provide 5.6GW power by the year 2025. On July 2nd, 2015, The Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, R.O.C announced there would be 36 potential zones for wind farms in the Taiwan Strait near the seacoast. However, most of these potential zones are close to the habitat of the critically endangered species, Sousa Chinensis. To avoid the hearing damage (temporary threshold shift and permanent threshold shift) caused by the noise of construction, including pile driving noise and operating noise, the observation of cetaceans around the construction site throughout the period of piling is important. The traditional method of observation is that the marine mammal observer (MMO) works on the vehicle and searches for the cetaceans with his naked eyes. Yet this method becomes inefficient and restricted whenever the cetacean breaks the water surface. Therefore, this research provides an advanced method using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and multiple unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to enhance the efficiency of observation.
   In this research, the whole system was built in C++ and Python as well as two popular open-source middleware - ROS (Robot Operating System) and MOOS-IvP, both of which are software for robotics and have a similar architecture to develop applications. More precisely, MOOS-IvP is software for autonomous marine vehicles. In order to make good use of the coordination of ROS and MOOS-IvP, this research built a bridge of communication connecting the two. The robotic USV system consists of two computers, namely, the front seat and the back seat. The front seat, installed in a vehicle, works by receiving the data from sensors and controlling the motors. The back seat, an additional computer connected with the front seat, is in charge of mission management, making decisions based upon the data from the front seat and commands the front seat where to move.
   Each of the two unmanned surface vehicles, equipped with two hydrophones under the ship hull, are used to localize the underwater acoustic source in this research. The two-channel hydrophone data is used to calculate the bearing angle of USV from an underwater acoustic source through the time difference of arrival method (TDOA). TDOA utilizes the receiving time of the first arrival of the acoustic wave to get the time difference between two hydrophones. Through such time difference, plus sound speed, and the distance between two hydrophones, the bearing angle can be approximatively estimated. Besides, the source localization can also be estimated by the intersection of two bearing lines from each USV.
   The whole system and algorithm were tested at Shimen Reservoir, Taoyuan, Taiwan. The water depth of the reservoir was around 12 meters, and an underwater acoustic projector was placed at the water depth of 5 meters to project an artificial chirp signal similar to the whistling sounds emitted by Sousa Chinensis. Two USVs surveyed a certain area to acquire the acoustic data. After acquiring the data, USV sent the result of the bearing angle to the shoreside computer, which would then estimate the source position by combining the results from both USVs.

AB  - The study of habitat use by top predators is important for understanding community interactions and is necessary for sound ecosystem management. In marine systems, top predators such as sharks and cetaceans have a strong impact on the structure and function of communities. While the observation of habitat use and foraging behavior of most marine predators is logistically difficult, bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus offer less of a challenge due to visible surface behavior and well-documented populations. We examined bottlenose dolphin behavior in relation to microhabitat classes at Turneffe Atoll, Belize. The dolphins were found to feed proportionally more in boundary microhabitats, areas where dense seagrass beds adjoined open sand flats, than in other microhabitats. Fish density, particularly schools of grunts (family Haemulidae), were higher in the boundary microhabitat than in seagrass or sand microhabitats. Extensive acoustic recordings yielded few fish calls, suggesting that passive listening for soniferous fish was not the dominant means of diurnal prey detection. The dolphins' disproportionate use of boundary microhabitats for feeding was likely due to the abundance and accessibility of prey.

AB  - The detection and classification of Mysticetes' vocalisations have evoked the attention of researchers over the years because of their relevance to the marine ecosystem. These vocalisations are gathered employing different passive acoustic monitoring techniques. The vocalisation datasets are accumulated over a period; thus, they are large and cannot be easily analysed manually. Consequently, efficient machine learning (ML) tools such as the hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used extensively to automatically detect and classify these huge vocalisation datasets. As with most ML tools, the detection efficiency of the HMMs depend on the adopted feature extraction technique. Feature extraction techniques such as the Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), linear predictive coefficient (LPC), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) have been adopted with the HMMs to detect different Mysticetes' vocalisations. This article introduces the method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) as a feature extraction technique that can be adopted with the HMMs for the detection of Mysticetes' vocalisations. The DMD has emerged as a robust tool for analysing the dynamics of non-stationary and non-linear signals. It is a completely data-driven tool that decomposes a signal over a certain period of time into relevant modes. Here, these spatial-temporal modes are reconstructed mathematically to form reliable feature vectors of the decomposed vocalisation signals. The performance of the proposed DMD-HMM detection technique is demonstrated using the acoustic datasets of two different Mysticetes' vocalisations: Humpback whale songs and Inshore Bryde's whale short pulse calls. In both species, the proposed DMD-HMM exhibits superior sensitivity and false discovery rate performances as compared to the MFCC-HMM, LPC-HMM, and EMD-HMM detection methods. Likewise, this proposed DMD-HMM detection method can be extended to other Mysticetes' that produce characteristics sounds.

AB  - Estimating animal abundance is fundamental for effective management and conservation. It is increasingly done by combining passive acoustics with knowledge about rates at which animals produce cues (cue rates). Narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are elusive marine mammals for which passive acoustic density estimation might be plausible, but for which cue rates are lacking. Clicking rates in narwhals were investigated using a dataset from sound and movement tag records collected in August 2013-2016 and 2019 in East Greenland. Clicking rates were quantified for similar to 1200 one-second-long systematic random samples from 8 different whales. Generalized additive models were used to model (1) the probability of being in a clicking state versus depth and (2) the clicking rate while in a clicking state, versus time and depth. The probability of being in a clicking state increased with depth, reaching similar to 1.0 at similar to 500 m, while the number of clicks per second (while in a clicking state) increased with depth. The mean cue production rate, weighted by tag duration, was 1.28 clicks per second (se = 0.13, CV = 0.10). This first cue rate for narwhals may be used for cue counting density estimation, but care should be taken if applying it to other geographical areas or seasons, given sample size, geographical, and temporal limitations.

AB  - The acoustic performance and behaviour of free-ranging cetaceans requires investigation under natural conditions to understand how wild animals use sound. This is also useful to develop quantitative evaluation techniques for passive acoustic monitoring. There have been limited studies on the acoustics of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin; nevertheless, this species is of particular concern because of the anthropogenic activity in the coastal habitats. In the present study, we used a four-hydrophone array to estimate the apparent source levels (ASLs) of biosonar sequences (click trains), of this species in San-Niang Bay, China. As the dolphins approached the array, 173 click trains were found to meet the criteria of on-axis sounds produced within 60 m of the equipment. In total, 121 unclipped click trains were used for the ASL estimation. The qualified click trains contained 36.3 +/- 32.5 clicks, lasting for 1.5 +/- 1.5 s, with average inter-click intervals (ICIs) of 51.2 +/- 38.3 ms. Average ICIs showed a bimodal distribution, with a cut-off at 20 ms. Short-range click trains, with short ICIs of,20 ms on average, were characterized by smaller ASLs, relatively stable ICIs and a shorter click train duration. The mean back-calculated ASL for humpback dolphins with an approximately maximum body size of 2.5 m was 181.7 +/- 7.0 dB re 1 mu Pa at a distance of 1.6-57.2 m. This value was comparable to that recorded for other dolphins of similar body size, although the ASL estimates obtained in this study might be conservative.

AB  - Marine mammals use sound for communication and echolocation within their ecosystems. The detection of these sounds is an important aspect of signal processing, such that we can estimate the spatial position and direction of arrival of these mammals, and have an understanding of their ecology. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is widely used to understand marine mammal movement and vocal repertoire. In PAM, datasets are accumulated over days, months or years. Thus, it is impracticable to manually analyse the datasets because it is very large. This motivated the development of automated sound detection techniques for marine mammals, which most often varies depending on the vocal duration, frequency range and call type. In this paper, continuous recordings of Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni edeni) short pulse calls (< 3.1s long) were collected on a weekly basis from December 2018 to April 2019 on sighting of the individual in a single site in the endmost South-West of South Africa. The sound, previously not documented off South Africa, was observed on visual confirmation of the presence of inshore Brydes's whale. In addition, the paper develops and analyses two automated template-based detection algorithms for this short pulse call, employing dynamic time warping (DTW) and linear predictive coding (LPC) techniques. These proposed template-based detectors are novel, as they have not being previously used in Bryde's whale sound detection in the literature. When applied to the continuous recordings of the short pulse calls, the DTW-based and LPC-based detection algorithms obtained a sensitivity of 96.04% and 97.14% respectively for high signal-tonoise ratio (about 10dB above the ambient sound). Otherwise, for low SNR, the DTW-based and LPC-based detection algorithms obtained a sensitivity of 94.98% and 96.00% respectively. These detection algorithms exhibit low computational time complexity and can be modified to analyse the movement of obscure but vocal marine species instead of manual identification.

AB  - Underwater acoustic data contain signals from a myriad of sound sources and monitoring these acoustic events is important for many ocean applications. Substantial volumes of underwater acoustic data are usually acquired in passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) experiments with a large-aperture densely-populated coherent hydrophone array system. Developing automatic, accurate and fast algorithms for the detection and classification of underwater acoustic events can help to minimize the human effort, enabling real-time processing and analysis, and hence aiding rapid scientific discoveries at sea. We utilize acoustic data from a 160-element coherent hydrophone array and beamform this data in 147 distinct bearings. To speed up the data processing, we investigate a variety of accelerating approaches, such as analyzing the effect of floating point precision, applying parallel processing, and implementing fast algorithms to run on GPU. We implemented and optimized delay and sum beamforming, both in the time domain and Fourier transform domain on NVIDIA GPUs, and achieved more than 338x speed-up compared to the basic CPU-implemented version. All of the coherent hydrophone array data preprocessing stages, including beamforming and Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation are calculated in real-time. During sea trial of the Northeastern University (NU) inhouse designed and fabricated 160-element coherent hydrophone array hardware at the U.S. Northeast coast on board the research vessel (RV) Endeavor in September 2021, we utilized the developed and optimized software, as well as high-performance computing hardware, specifically configured and assembled inhouse, to store, process and analyze data sampled at 100 kHz per hydrophone element in order to monitor acoustic events in real time. Because of the high sampling rate, we could monitor a large variety of sound sources, from high frequency events such as dolphin echolocation clicks with significant energy near 50 kHz, down to low frequency fin whale 20 Hz pulses.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring was used to document the presence of singing humpback whales off the coast of Northern Angola, and opportunistically test for the effect of seismic survey activity in the vicinity on the number of singing whales. Two Marine Autonomous Recording Units (MARUs) were deployed between March and December 2008 in the offshore environment. Song was first heard in mid June and continued through the remaining duration of the study. Seismic survey activity was heard regularly during two separate periods, consistently throughout July and intermittently in mid-October/ November. Numbers of singers were counted during the first ten minutes of every hour for the period from 24 May to 1 December, and Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were used to assess the effect of survey day (seasonality), hour (diel variation), moon phase and received levels of seismic survey pulses (measured from a single pulse during each ten-minute sampled period) on singer number. Application of GAMMs indicated significant seasonal variation, which was the most pronounced effect when assessing the full dataset across the entire season (p<0.001); however seasonality almost entirely dropped out of top-ranked models when applied to a reduced dataset during the July period of seismic survey activity. Diel variation was significant in both the full and reduced datasets (from p<0.01 to p<0.05) and often included in the top-ranked models. The number of singers significantly decreased with increasing received level of seismic survey pulses (from p<0.01 to p<0.05); this explanatory variable was included among the top ranked models for one MARU in the full dataset and both MARUs in the reduced dataset. This suggests that the breeding display of humpback whales is disrupted by seismic survey activity, and thus merits further attention and study, and potentially conservation action in the case of sensitive breeding populations.

AB  - The need to minimize bycatch of toothed whales (odontocetes) in gillnets has long been recognized, because they are often top predators and thus essential to ecosystem resilience. It is likely that a key to achieving this goal is the improvement of gillnet acoustic visibility, because these species use underwater sonar for orientation. Previous work on increasing gillnet detectability for echolocating animals by making the nets more recognizable has been based on trial and error, without understanding the fundamental acoustic properties of the tested modifications. Consequently, these studies have produced mixed and sometimes contradictory results. We systematically identified small, passive reflective objects that can improve the visibility of gillnets at a broad range of frequencies, i.e., for many odontocetes. We simulated the acoustic reflectivity of a wide range of materials in different shapes, sizes, and environmental conditions, with a focus on polymer materials. We verified the simulation results experimentally and calculated detection distances of the selected modifications. For example, if 8 mm acrylic glass spheres are attached to the net at intervals smaller than 0.5 m, the spheres have the same target strength (TS) at 130 kHz as the most recognizable part of a gillnet, the floatline. Modifications of the netting material itself, e.g., using barium sulfate additives, do not substantially increase the acoustic reflectivity of the net.

AB  - Ocean ambient noise is well studied in the North Pacific and North Atlantic but is poorly described for most of the worlds' oceans. Calibrated passive acoustic recordings were collected during 2009-2010 at seven locations in the central and western tropical and subtropical Pacific. Monthly and hourly mean power spectra (15-1000 Hz) were calculated in addition to their skewness, kurtosis, and percentile distributions. Overall, ambient noise at these seven sites was 10-20 dB lower than reported recently for most other locations in the North Pacific. At frequencies <100Hz, spectrum levels were equivalent to those predicted for remote or light shipping. Noise levels in the 40Hz band were compared to the presence of nearby and distant ships as reported to the World Meteorological Organization Voluntary Observing Ship Scheme (VOS) project. There was a positive, but nonsignificant correlation between distant shipping and low frequency noise (at 40 Hz). There was a seasonal variation in ambient noise at frequencies >200Hz with higher levels recorded in the winter than in the summer. Several species of baleen whales, humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), and fin (B. physalus) whales, also contributed seasonally to ambient noise in characteristic frequency bands.

AB  - Passive acoustic recordings made in Fowlers Bay, South Australia, during the austral winter of 2013-2017 revealed the presence of several sources of underwater sound. Sound sources of biological origin include baleen and toothed whales, fish and shrimp. Physical sources of underwater sound include wind-and rain-driven noises, and underwater sounds of anthropogenic origin were primarily from boats and occasionally from an aircraft. Biological sound sources were commonly recorded within the frequency range of around 25 Hz to nearly 17 kHz, with baleen whales within the range of 25 Hz to 6 kHz, and dolphins at higher frequencies of approximately 2.5-17 kHz. Broadband sounds from physical and anthropogenic sound sources were noticeable at frequencies above 50 Hz. The ambient noise level in Fowlers Bay at frequencies below 100 Hz was relatively low (around 75 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz for the 95% percentile) due to an insignificant contribution of noise from distant shipping. At higher frequencies, the noise level was governed primarily by noise from wind and varied by nearly 30 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz depending on weather conditions, up to around 80 dB re 1 mu Pa-2/Hz for the 95% percentile during periods of strong winds and intense rainfall.

AB  - A data set consisting of North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis),vocalizations were provided as part of the 2003 International Workshop on Detection and Localization of Marine Mammals using Passive Acoustics in, Halifax, Nova Scotia. These vocalizations were processed using a set of detection and localization algorithms developed as part of the Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges (M3R) program. Localization is performed using hyperbolic multilateration on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) data from a two stage FFT based energy detector. Binary FFTs are computed from the raw time series by thresholding the FFT using a time average in each bin as the threshold criteria. Clicks are detected by comparing the total number of bins above threshold to a secondary threshold. Detected clicks are split out of the data stream and the rest of the data is aligned using a spectrogram cross-correlation. Details of the marine mammal monitoring algorithms will lie presented as well as results from the data set.

AB  - Simple Summary Marine mammal welfare research of professionally managed species has primarily focused on enrichment, habitat usage, and activity, as well as the impacts of human-oriented training sessions. However, the importance of sound in the welfare of marine mammals has rarely been mentioned. In this review, methods for acoustic welfare monitoring are discussed, including hearing tests, the incorporation of listening systems to monitor noise and communication, and cataloguing vocalizations in various health contexts. Examples from the US Navy Marine Mammal program are provided, as well as opportunities for facilities to initiate acoustic welfare monitoring. Suggested future directions of study, such as research examining the impact of sound on cognition, are also discussed. Research evaluating marine mammal welfare and opportunities for advancements in the care of species housed in a professional facility have rapidly increased in the past decade. While topics, such as comfortable housing, adequate social opportunities, stimulating enrichment, and a high standard of medical care, have continued to receive attention from managers and scientists, there is a lack of established acoustic consideration for monitoring the welfare of these animals. Marine mammals rely on sound production and reception for navigation and communication. Regulations governing anthropogenic sound production in our oceans have been put in place by many countries around the world, largely based on the results of research with managed and trained animals, due to the potential negative impacts that unrestricted noise can have on marine mammals. However, there has not been an established best practice for the acoustic welfare monitoring of marine mammals in professional care. By monitoring animal hearing and vocal behavior, a more holistic view of animal welfare can be achieved through the early detection of anthropogenic sound sources, the acoustic behavior of the animals, and even the features of the calls. In this review, the practice of monitoring cetacean acoustic welfare through behavioral hearing tests and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), passive acoustic monitoring, such as the Welfare Acoustic Monitoring System (WAMS), as well as ideas for using advanced technologies for utilizing vocal biomarkers of health are introduced and reviewed as opportunities for integration into marine mammal welfare plans.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring with widely-dispersed hydrophones has been suggested as a costeffective method to monitor population densities of echolocating marine mammals. This requires an estimate of the area around each receiver over which vocalizations are detected-the "effective detection area" (EDA). In the absence of auxiliary measurements enabling estimation of the EDA, it can be modelled instead. Common simplifying model assumptions include approximating the spectrum of clicks by flat energy spectra, and neglecting the frequency-dependence of sound absorption within the click bandwidth (narrowband assumption), rendering the problem amenable to solution using the sonar equation. Here, it is investigated how these approximations affect the estimated EDA and their potential for biasing the estimated density. EDA was estimated using the passive sonar equation, and by applying detectors to simulated clicks injected into measurements of background noise. By comparing model predictions made using these two approaches for different spectral energy distributions of echolocation clicks, but identical click source energy level and detector settings, EDA differed by up to a factor of 2 for Blainville's beaked whales. Both methods predicted relative density bias due to narrowband assumptions ranged from 5% to more than 100%, depending on the species, detector settings, and noise conditions.

AB  - The distribution of odontocetes on a daily scale is largely driven by bottom-up processes that in turn influence foraging opportunities. Environmental variables such as bathymetry may help indicate productive foraging regions and serve as useful tools when assessing dolphin spatial and temporal patterns. To begin to understand daily spatial patterns of different odontocete species relative to heterogeneous benthic habitat, passive acoustic monitoring was conducted near an understudied basin of the Hawaiian Islands, the MauiNui region (Maui, Lana'i, Kaho' olawe, Moloka'i). Results showed that the acoustic activity of smaller species was stronger at night than day, particularly closer to shelf waters. In contrast, the acoustic activity of less common larger species tended not to follow a diel pattern, except at sites of a moderate proximity to shelf waters. These findings support previous research showing that smaller odontocetes, such as spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris), track and feed upon the daily vertically migrating mesopelagic boundary community at night, while larger odontocetes, such as false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), may forage across most of the region during both the day and night. This information will help inform best management practices that account for interspecies variation in use of the Maui Nui basin.

AB  - Author summaryMachine learning algorithms have proven to be effective for tools for detection and classification tasks in many fields, however, these processes are generally data-hungry and their use in marine acoustics has been limited by a lack of large labeled datasets for algorithms to learn from. In underwater acoustic recordings, many signals generated by animals, human activities and physical processes mingle together, and their sounds can change depending on ocean temperatures, locations, and behavior. Manual classification of these datasets is unmanageable without an in-depth knowledge of the acoustic context of each recording location. This paper presents a process which combines unsupervised and supervised learning phases and expert oversight to generate and use large datasets for acoustic classification of marine mammal and human-generated signals. Unsupervised learning is used to automatically generate the large training datasets needed to teach a supervised learning algorithm to correctly classify seven different signal types commonly recorded in the Southern California Bight. Using this process, researchers with large unlabeled acoustic datasets can begin to take advantage of widespread advances in machine learning.
   Machine learning algorithms, including recent advances in deep learning, are promising for tools for detection and classification of broadband high frequency signals in passive acoustic recordings. However, these methods are generally data-hungry and progress has been limited by challenges related to the lack of labeled datasets adequate for training and testing. Large quantities of known and as yet unidentified broadband signal types mingle in marine recordings, with variability introduced by acoustic propagation, source depths and orientations, and interacting signals. Manual classification of these datasets is unmanageable without an in-depth knowledge of the acoustic context of each recording location. A signal classification pipeline is presented which combines unsupervised and supervised learning phases with opportunities for expert oversight to label signals of interest. The method is illustrated with a case study using unsupervised clustering to identify five toothed whale echolocation click types and two anthropogenic signal categories. These categories are used to train a deep network to classify detected signals in either averaged time bins or as individual detections, in two independent datasets. Bin-level classification achieved higher overall precision (>99%) than click-level classification. However, click-level classification had the advantage of providing a label for every signal, and achieved higher overall recall, with overall precision from 92 to 94%. The results suggest that unsupervised learning is a viable solution for efficiently generating the large, representative training sets needed for applications of deep learning in passive acoustics.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring techniques provide a useful alternative to visual surveys for monitoring of marine mammals since they are less affected by adverse weather conditions. An autonomous unmanned Wave Glider, equipped with a towed hydrophone and recording system was used to collect acoustic data in the Brazilian offshore waters of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean between 6 and 25 February 2016. Nearly continuous data were obtained during this period (light and dark hours) for the 750 km traveled. There were 165,130 high-frequency detections in 31 encounters, including 1789 whistles, 389 burst-pulse sounds, and 162,952 echolocation clicks. A total of 705 low-frequency tonal signals were recorded in 5 encounters. Although high-frequency detections occurred at all hours of the day, the majority occurred during dark hours. Low-frequency detections were not evenly spread through all hours of the day, with the majority of them occurring during dark hours. High-frequency and low-frequency detections represented 26% and 3% of the recording hours, respectively. Duration, the number of emissions, and ocean depth varied among acoustic encounters. Encounters composed by high-frequency sounds were separated into seven different groups, probably different species. One of the encounters presented whistles that were previously recorded in the Rio de Janeiro Coast for Steno bredanensis (Rough-toothed dolphins). All of the low-frequency encounters were composed of a type of Balaenoptera brydei (Bryde's whales) call. This type of data collection is un-precedented for the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean and highlighted the use of the sampled area by delphinids on different days and different times of the day, including the dark hours.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring is a promising method for surveying wildlife populations that are easier to detect acoustically than visually. When animal vocalisations can be uniquely identified on an array of sensors, the potential exists to estimate population density through acoustic spatial capture-recapture (ASCR). However, sound classification is imperfect, and in some situations, a high proportion of sounds detected on just a single sensor ('singletons') are not from the target species. We present a case study of bowhead whale calls (Baleana mysticetus) collected in the Beaufort Sea in 2010 containing such false positives. We propose a novel extension of ASCR that is robust to false positives by truncating singletons and conditioning on calls being detected by at least two sensors. We allow for individual-level detection heterogeneity through modelling a variable sound source level, model inhomogeneous call spatial density, and include bearings with varying measurement error. We show via simulation that the method produces near-unbiased estimates when correctly specified. Ignoring source-level variation resulted in a strong negative bias, while ignoring inhomogeneous density resulted in severe positive bias. The case study analysis indicated a band of higher call density approximately 30 km from shore; 59.8% of singletons were estimated to have been false positives.

AB  - A paucity of information on the basic biology and ecology of Cook Inlet beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas remains a decade after the species was listed as endangered in 2008. The causes of its continued decline remain unclear. This lack of knowledge limits our understanding of, and ability to manage, potential threats impeding the recovery of this endangered population. Seasonal distribution and foraging ecology, particularly during winter, are currently among the most basic gaps in knowledge. Therefore, we conducted a year-round passive acoustic monitoring program from 2008-2013, monitoring 13 locations within the belugas' critical habitat. We identified seasonal occurrence patterns across years at most locations. Detections were higher in the upper inlet during summer, peaking in known concentration areas. The occurrence of whales in the upper inlet when ice coverage peaked during winter was more prevalent than previously suggested. We documented seasonal differences in foraging habitat preference, with foraging behavior more prevalent during summer, particularly near upper inlet rivers, than during winter. Foraging peaks coincided with the presence of different anadromous fish runs from spring to fall. Low levels of feeding activity in winter suggest a lack of feeding aggregation areas, feeding in non-monitored offshore waters, or increased effort on benthic prey. These results represent a substantial contribution to our knowledge of Cook Inlet beluga seasonal distribution and foraging ecology, which will strengthen conservation and management strategies and thus more effectively promote recovery of this endangered population.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a cost-effective method for monitoring cetacean populations compared with techniques such as aerial and ship-based surveys. The Cetacean POrpoise Detector (C-POD) has become an integral tool in monitoring programs globally for over a decade, providing standardized metrics of occurrence that can be compared across time and space. However, the phasing out of C-PODs following the development of the new Full waveform capture POD (F-POD) with increased sensitivity, improved train detection, and reduced false-positive rates represents an important methodological change in data collection, particularly when being introduced into existing monitoring programs. Here, we compare the performance of the C-POD with that of its successor, the F-POD, co-deployed in a field setting for 15 months, to monitor harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). While similar temporal trends in detections were found for both devices, the C-POD detected only 58% of the detection-positive minutes (DPM), recorded by the F-POD. Differences in detection rates were not consistent through time making it difficult to apply a correction factor or directly compare results obtained from the two PODs. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to test whether these differences in detection rates would have an effect on analyses of temporal patterns and environmental drivers of occurrence. No differences were found in seasonal patterns or the environmental correlates of porpoise occurrence (month, diel period, temperature, environmental noise, and tide). However, the C-POD failed to detect sufficient foraging rates to identify temporal patterns in foraging behavior, which were shown by the F-POD. Our results suggest that the switch to F-PODs will have little effect on determining broad-scale seasonal patterns of occurrence but may improve our understanding of fine-scale behaviors such as foraging. We highlight how care must be taken interpreting F-POD results as indicative of increased occurrence when used in time-series analysis.

AB  - To understand the biosonar click characteristics of Ganges river dolphins (adults, young adults, and calves) in a wild environment along with periodic visual observations, an ongoing program for long-term in situ monitoring has been carried out using a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) system. During monitoring phase 4 (2012), migrating Ganges river dolphin groups with small calves were visually observed, and click trains having a short interclick interval (ICI: from 6 to 12 ms) were concurrently found from the acoustic data corresponding to the period. Click trains having a short ICI have also been observed in other small-toothed whales during foraging and socializing activities (called buzz) (Thoms, Moss, & Vater, 2004; Simard & Mann, 2008). For analysis of the short ICI click trains produced by the Ganges river dolphins, an advanced technique that automatically detects and discriminates a short ICI click train from other click sequences during the selected periods of data recorded by a PAM system was developed. For a robust algorithm, a smaller mean ICI caused by overlapping click trains from multiple dolphins that fulfill the range of ICI values that may get incorrectly labeled as short ICI click train was considered to judiciously detect a reliable click train. By applying the selected parameters and ICI values (default or given), the performance of the proposed technique was demonstrated using sample data. The results showed the reliability of the technique for the extraction of a variety of short ICI click trains from other click trains.

AB  - The impact of shipping noise on marine life and quality of marine mammal habitats in oceans and coastal environments has become a major concern worldwide. Background noise can also limits detection of marine mammal sounds in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems. Characterisation of this noise over long time periods and estimates of the exposure of the different marine mammal groups are still very fragmentary and limited to only a few locations. This paper presents such observations for a part of a busy seaway of North America, the St. Lawrence Seaway, which cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and crosses several cetaceans and pinnipeds feeding areas. Noise was continuously recorded for a 5-month period in summer 2005 by an AURAL autonomous hydrophone deployed close to the bottom in the 300-m deep seaway. The maximum received noise level in the 20 Hz-0.9 kHz band reached 136 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms. The median level of 112 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms was exceeded 50% of the time due to transiting merchant ships. Median spectral level tracks the reference curve for heavy traffic in oceans and 50% of the noise is within a +/- 6 dB envelope around it. Strong spectral lines were common at low frequencies and in the 400-800 Hz band. M-weighting functions applied for the three groups of cetaceans and pinnipeds indicate wideband median levels varying from 106 to 112 dB-M re 1 mu Pa-rms surrounded by a +/- 5 dB two-quartile interval. Higher values are expected for animals frequenting the sound channel at intermediate depths. As expected, the highest M-weighting levels correspond to low-frequency specialists and pinnipeds. Criteria for assessing the behavioural and physiological impacts of long term exposure of marine mammals to such shipping noise levels need to be worked out.

AB  - Knowledge of fine-scale seasonal and diel activity patterns of animals provides insights into habitat utilization dynamics and informs conservation action planning against potential human impacts. Such information is particularly important for riverine cetaceans, such as the Yangtze finless porpoise, which is threatened by habitat loss and disturbances by a variety of human activities. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques were used to survey the seasonal and diel activities of the Yangtze finless porpoise in two natural habitat patches of the Anqing Yangtze Finless Porpoise Natural Reserve, and in one highly disturbed area adjacent to the reserve. In the two natural habitat patches, significantly higher detection rates of porpoises were observed during autumn and winter. The detection rates during autumn and winter were significantly higher at night than during daytime, whereas during spring and summer the diel difference in porpoise detection rates was not statistically significant. In the highly disturbed habitat, the porpoise detection rates were significantly lower than those in the two natural habitats. Although seasonal differences in porpoise detection rates were not statistically significant, diel detection rates were significantly different in autumn and winter. Information on seasonal patterns of porpoise activities suggested strengthening monitoring and law enforcement during autumn and winter, during the period in which diel activity patterns implied a potential conservation gap during nighttime. Extremely low levels of porpoise activities in port areas implied an ecological impact of coastal engineering on megafauna viability through the alteration of habitat functionality. To provide information on animal occurrences and activities and to minimize the bias of 'false-absence' from visual surveys, the census survey design should consider both visual and PAM techniques. In seasons when occurrences of river cetaceans and habitat use are increasing, heightened conservation monitoring and law enforcement efforts are required, particularly during nighttime.

AB  - A method is presented for passive localization of impulsive acoustic sources in a stratified ocean by measuring relative times of direct and surface-reflected arrivals at two hydrophones. The proposed method is based on ray theory and takes into account the effects of refraction on the geometry of acoustic paths (ray bending) and travel times, generalizing previous approaches based on the homogeneous-ocean assumption (straight-line localization). If the hydrophone depths are known, then the source depth and distance from each hydrophone can be estimated from the three differential arrival times. If in addition the hydrophone separation is known, the bearing of the source can be estimated as well. Apart from the effects on ray geometry and travel times, stratification affects localization by introducing shadow zones and caustics. For source locations in the neighborhood of caustics, the localization problem accepts two solutions, one of which is the true source location and the other one which is an artifact (ghost solution). This ambiguity can be resolved in the case of tracking moving sources since as the source moves away from the caustic only the track corresponding to the true source position will be continued. The present method has been developed primarily for monitoring the dive behavior of sperm whales producing acoustic clicks, yet it is general and can be applied for the localization and tracking of any kind of impulsive acoustic, source in the ocean.

AB  - Singing behaviour by male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) has traditionally been associated with low-latitude breeding grounds. However, in recent years, this vocal behaviour has been increasingly reported outside these areas. All singers in a given population sing the same version of a song and this song is continually evolving over time with modifications on different levels within the song structure. Tracing changes in whale song will help to undercover the drivers underlying this vocal display and contribute to the understanding of animal culture and its evolution. To determine the progressive changes in songs found on a subarctic feeding ground and migratory stopover, a detailed analysis of humpback whale song recordings from Northern Norway was conducted. Passive acoustic data from the Lofoten-Vesteralen Ocean Observatory (LoVe), collected using a bottom-moored underwater hydrophone, were used from January - April 2018 and January 2019. Two measures of the song structure were examined: (1) sequence similarities using the Levenshtein distance and (2) song complexity using a principal component analysis (PCA). In total, 21 distinct themes were identified which presented highly directional, structural changes over time. Two themes from 2018 reoccurred in 2019, whereas all other themes in 2019 appeared to be evolved versions of 2018 themes. All songs grouped into three general clusters, reflecting the rapid evolution over the study period. With all sampled animals singing the same version of the song, this might indicate that the singers are either from the same breeding population or that song learning occurred before the study period. Song complexity appeared to follow the trend of song progression; songs became more complex as they evolved over the months in 2018 and decreased in complexity between the years, returning to a more simplified song in 2019. The results confirm that humpback whale song exhibits a rapid progression on a shared subarctic feeding ground, with strong potential for song exchange and opportunities for cultural transmission between populations in the North Atlantic.

AB  - The soundscape of critical habitat for southern resident killer whale (SRKW) Orcinus orca in the Salish Sea, the waters around southern British Columbia, Canada, and northern Washington State, USA, is shaped by wind and wave noise as well as heavy commercial and recreational vessel traffic loads. First, we used recordings from 6 passive acoustic moorings to characterize the acoustic landscape experienced by SRKW in this region, focusing on the frequencies used for communication and echolocation. Mid-frequency wind noise was prevalent in winter sound fields, whereas higher-frequency noise levels associated with increased numbers of recreational vessels increased during summer. Commercial vessel presence was consistent, with acoustic inputs prevalent in the western part of the study area. The potential implications of these additions on SRKW acoustics use were then explored for the frequency band 1-40 kHz to represent communication calls and at 50 kHz to consider echolocation. The inputs of wind were extrapolated from modelled hourly wind speed measures and commercial shipping noise. The noise impact was expressed as a proportional reduction of communication and echolocation extent compared to maximum acoustic ranges at 'minimum ambient' levels, void of vessel and abiotic noise. The reductions calculated were substantial, with the presence and impact of vessel noise greater than wind-derived additions and the greatest impacts around shipping lanes. Impacts were found for SRKW foraging areas, with implications for group cohesion and feeding success. This interpretation of the influence of natural and vessel noise more clearly demonstrates the potential implications of altered soundscapes for SRKW.

Ocean bottom seismometer networks provide data sets of opportunity for studying blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) which vocalize extensively at seismic frequencies. We describe methods to localize calls and obtain tracks using the B call of northeast Pacific blue whale recorded by a large network of widely spaced ocean bottom seismometers off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The first harmonic of the B call at similar to 15 Hz is detected using spectrogram cross-correlation. The seasonality of calls, inferred from a dataset of calls identified by an analyst, is used to estimate the probability that detections are true positives as a function of the strength of the detection. Because the spacing of seismometers reaches 70 km, faint detections with a significant probability of being false positives must be considered in multi-station localizations. Calls are located by maximizing a likelihood function which considers each strong detection in turn as the earliest arrival time and seeks to fit the times of detections that follow within a feasible time and distance window. An alternative procedure seeks solutions based on the detections that maximize their sum after weighting by detection strength and proximity. Both approaches lead to many spurious solutions that can mix detections from different B calls and include false detections including misidentified A calls. Tracks that are reliable can be obtained iteratively by assigning detections to localizations that are grouped in space and time, and requiring groups of at least 20 locations. Smooth paths are fit to tracks by including constraints that minimize changes in speed and direction while fitting the locations to their uncertainties or applying the double difference relocation method. The reliability of localizations for future experiments might be improved by increasing sampling rates and detecting harmonics of the B call.

AB  - This study addresses the problem of determining optimal design of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems for detecting and localizing whale calls in real-time in variable-noise environments. The performance of various PAM system is assessed using the detection theory and simulation modeling applied to the context of North Atlantic right whale (NARW) upcalls in feeding grounds and noisy shipping corridor of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Realistic simulations are performed using an estimated NARW upcall source level (SL), the actual shipping traffic, measured local fleet ship SLs, and transmission loss (TL) from a regional 2.5-D propagation model accounting for the bathymetric and environmental structures. The comparisons consider single-hydrophone and hydrophone-array PAM systems, mounted on buoys, gliders, or cabled to shore and three families of NARW upcall detectors. The targeted performance is a low false-alarm rate of 1 per day and a detection probability > 0.5. The time-frequency-based detector offers the best trade-off between detection performance and robustness against NARW upcall variability. The effective detection ranges are similar to 15 times lower with single-hydrophone systems compared to hydrophone-arrays, whose beamforming enhances the signal in the upcall direction while damping interfering discrete noise from nearby transiting ships in other directions. Detecting and localizing NARWs in the large target areas (>10000-km(2) scale) is possible with a few well-located arrays of 10-20 hydrophones, which appears as the optimal cost/performance trade-off.

AB  - We successfully developed an extension of the OBIS-SEAMAP database, a global biogeographic database specializing in marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles, to integrate passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data with other commonly collected data types (i.e. line-transect visual sightings, animal telemetry, and photo-identification). As part of this effort, we made significant improvements in mapping and visualization tools for PAM data, including spatially and temporally interactive summary statistics, diel plots, temporal effort representation, and the unique rendering of PAM data to distinguish them from other data types. In this paper, we summarize technical challenges we overcame, report the methodologies and implementation of the integration, and conduct case studies using visual sightings and PAM data from bowhead whales and Risso's dolphins to demonstrate how the integrated database facilitates in-depth ecological assessments that form the foundation for spatially-explicit conservation efforts.

AB  - Monitoring Arctic wildlife is important due to the increasing potential impact of environmental and industrial changes. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be an important tool for wildlife management through observations of several species simultaneously along with abiotic elements such as industrial activity. Here, we use PAM methods to monitor the occurrence of marine mammals over an 8-month period (Oct 2012-May 2013) in Scott Inlet, Nunavut. When marine mammals were present, we investigated possible environmental correlates. Sea ice coverage strongly influenced detections of marine mammal sounds: narwhals and bowhead whales were only present before full ice cover occurred in the fall, while bearded seals and walruses could only be detected after ice formation. Tidal phase, time of the day, water temperature at 300 m depth, and air temperature all influenced detections of narwhal clicks. This PAM study provides a baseline measure for the presence of marine mammals over the fall to spring in Scott Inlet. Long-term PAM in the same location would allow us to document changes in the phenology of marine mammals at this site in relation to environmental changes.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a useful technique for monitoring marine mammals. However, the quantity of data collected through PAM systems makes automated algorithms for detecting and classifying sounds essential. Deep learning algorithms have shown great promise in recent years, but their performance is limited by the lack of sufficient amounts of annotated data for training the algorithms. This work investigates the benefit of augmenting training datasets with synthetically generated samples when training a deep neural network for the classification of North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls. We apply two recently proposed augmentation techniques, SpecAugment and Mixup, and show that they improve the performance of our model considerably. The precision is increased from 86% to 90%, while the recall is increased from 88% to 93%. Finally, we demonstrate that these two methods yield a significant improvement in performance in a scenario of data scarcity, where few training samples are available. This demonstrates that data augmentation can reduce the annotation effort required to achieve a desirable performance threshold.

AB  - An automated algorithm for passive acoustic detection of blue whale D-calls was developed based on established deep learning methods for image recognition via the DenseNet architecture. The detector was trained on annotated acoustic recordings from the Antarctic, and performance of the detector was assessed by calculating precision and recall using a separate independent dataset also from the Antarctic. Detections from both the human analyst and automated detector were then inspected by an independent judge to identify any calls missed by either approach and to adjudicate whether the apparent false-positive detections from the automated approach were actually true positives. A final performance assessment was conducted using double-observer methods (via a closed-population Huggins mark-recapture model) to assess the probability of detection of calls by both the human analyst and automated detector, based on the assumption of false-positive-free adjudicated detections. According to our double-observer analysis, the automated detector showed superior performance with higher recall and fewer false positives than the original human analyst, and with performance similar to existing top automated detectors. To understand the performance of both detectors we inspected the time-series and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detections for the test dataset, and found that most of the advantages from the automated detector occurred at low and medium SNR.

AB  - Two populations of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) migrate annually between their summering grounds in the eastern Chukchi and eastern Beaufort Seas, and overwintering areas in the Bering Sea. To contribute to the understanding of migratory streams of this highly vocal species, we investigated temporal peaks in acoustic detections from 4-year-long (2010-2011) recorders located in the northeastern Chukchi (inshore and offshore), western Beaufort, and northern Bering Seas. Beluga calls were detected throughout summer (July-August) in the western Beaufort; other studies suggest these animals are likely from the eastern Chukchi population. In autumn (September-November), calls were detected in the western Beaufort and northeastern Chukchi, which were likely from both the eastern Beaufort and eastern Chukchi populations. A strong peak at the inshore northeastern Chukchi site occurred in late-November; this peak is likely to be from the eastern Chukchi population. During spring, beluga calls were detected in the northeastern Chukchi and western Beaufort in two distinct vocal peaks (early-and late-May). The timing was consistent with the hypothesis that both vocal peaks were caused by the eastern Beaufort population. This suggests that migration of populations can be discriminated when temporal differences between vocal peaks are large enough to be identified as independent events. Our study results complement and support the population identity of peaks suggested by satellite telemetry, aerial surveys, and other acoustical studies. Passive acoustic monitoring improves our understanding of the migratory timing of beluga populations for management and conservation in a region undergoing rapid change.

AB  - Deployments of underwater passive acoustic recorders have been widely used to study marine biodiversity, especially to detect vocal cetaceans. To process the huge amount of data collected, automatic detection and classification methods are necessary. Recently the development of such methods, which includes training and then testing the models, is mainly based on so-called ground-truth labels, obtained by manual annotation of audio files.
   However, manual annotation is a difficult and time-consuming process because of the large size of the datasets, the large diversity of the sounds, their unfamiliar representation, the variant quality of the acoustic recordings and the variability in human appreciation.
   These different factors induce non-negligible differences from one annotator to another, and better quantifying and understanding such differences is capital to make progress in machine learning applications.
   On this topic, the inter-annotator variability is investigated on three multi-annotator annotation campaigns performed on different marine bioacoustics datasets. Each of them gathered more than 10 annotators with different profiles, from novices to field experts, covering different annotation tasks, different geographical areas and varieties of sound classes. From this multi-annotation, this work enhances the understanding of the inter-annotator variability through the kappa-metrics. In a second part, from a grouping method of annotation based on a majority vote, a drastic reduction of the potential errors in the annotation from novice annotators is observed. This last observation enlightens the possibility of using citizen sciences to overcome the lack of annotation, while maintaining a quality of annotation expected by an expert.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a powerful method to study the occurrence, movement and behavior of echolocating odontocetes (toothed whales) in the wild. However, in areas occupied by more than one species, echolocation clicks need to be classified into species. The present study investigated whether the echolocation clicks produced by small, at-risk, resident sympatric populations of Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in Menai Bay, Zanzibar, East Africa, could be classified to allow species specific monitoring. Underwater sounds of S. plumbea and T. aduncus groups were recorded using a SoundTrap 202HF in January and June-August 2015. Eight acoustic parameters, i.e. -10 dB duration, peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies, and -3 dB, -10 dB and root-mean-squared bandwidth, were used to describe and compare the two species' echolocation clicks. Statistical analyses showed that S. plumbea clicks had significantly higher peak, centroid, lower -3 and lower -10 dB frequencies compared to T. aduncus, whereas duration and bandwidth parameters were similar for the two species. Random Forest (RF) classifiers were applied to determine parameters that could be used to classify the two species from echolocation clicks and achieved 28.6% and 90.2% correct species classification rates for S. plumbea and T. aduncus, respectively. Both species were classified at a higher rate than expected at random, however the identified classifiers would only be useful for T. aduncus monitoring. The frequency and bandwidth parameters provided most power for species classification. Further study is necessary to identify useful classifiers for S. plumbea. This study represents a first step in acoustic description and classification of S. plumbea and T. aduncus in the western Indian Ocean region, with potential application for future acoustic monitoring of species-specific temporal and spatial occurrence in these sympatric species.

AB  - Detecting whistle events is essential when studying the population density and behavior of cetaceans. After eight months of passive acoustic monitoring in Xiamen, we obtained long calls from two Tursiops aduncus individuals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with an unbiased gammatone multi-channel Savitzky-Golay for smoothing dynamic continuous background noise and interference from long click trains. The algorithm uses the method of least squares to perform a local polynomial regression on the time-frequency representation of multi-frequency resolution call measurements, which can effectively retain the whistle profiles while filtering out noise and interference. We prove that it is better at separating out whistles and has lower computational complexity than other smoothing methods. In order to further extract whistle features in enhanced spectrograms, we also propose a set of multi-scale and multi-directional moving filter banks for various whistle durations and contour shapes. The final binary adaptive decisions at frame level for whistle events are obtained from the histograms of multi-scale and multi-directional spectrograms. Finally, we explore the entire data set and find that the proposed scheme achieves the highest frame-level F-1-scores when detecting T. aduncus whistles than the baseline schemes, with an improvement of more than 6%.

AB  - In situ time series measurements of ocean ambient noise, have been made in deep waters of the Arabian Sea, using an autonomous passive acoustic monitoring system deployed as part of the Ocean Moored buoy network in the Northern Indian Ocean (OMNI) buoy mooring operated by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), in Chennai during November 2018 to November 2019. The analysis of ambient noise records during the spring (April-June) showed the presence of dolphin whistles but contaminated by unwanted impulsive shackle noise. The frequency contours of the dolphin whistles occur in narrow band in the range 4-16 kHz. However, the unwanted impulsive shackle noise occurs in broad band with the noise level higher by similar to 20 dB over the dolphin signals, and it reduces the quality of dolphin whistles. A wavelet based threshold denoising technique followed by a subtraction method is implemented. Reduction of unwanted shackle noise is effectively done and different dolphin whistle types are identified. This wavelet denoising approach is demonstrated for extraction of dolphin whistles in the presence of challenging impulsive shackle noise. Furthermore, this study should be useful for identifying other cetacean species when the signal of interest is interrupted by unwanted mechanical noise.

AB  - This paper provides a novel echo-robust and real-time passive underwater acoustic method to track whales using five omni-directional widely-spaced bottom-mounted hydrophones. The interest in online marine mammal monitoring for behavioral studies of endangered species has increased. Practically, these systems are required to be real-time and robust to underwater echoes, which dramatically affect tracking results. To meet these demands, a real-time tracking algorithm was developed with simple but efficient echo cancellation. The processing is all done in the time-domain. After signal decimation, rough time delays of arrival (TDOAs) are calculated, selected and filtered, before precise TDOAs are re-estimated on the original signals. The complete algorithm is tested on real data from the Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the Atlantic Undersea Test & Evaluation Center-Bahamas. The attractive advantage of the method is that it runs two times faster than real-time, but generates similar tracks to other state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Kona coast of the island of Hawaii hosts many species of odontocetes. These marine mammals are top predators and their foraging activity plays an important role in the ecosystem dynamics. Three passive acoustics recorders were used to study the temporal and spatial occurrence of the foraging activity of odontocetes (excluding beaked and sperm whales) at three locations along the Kona coast of Hawaii between 2012 and 2013. Echolocation clicks were detected using the M3R1 (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges) system, and custom-designed Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) programs were designed to analyze the detected data. A Generalized Linear Model was used to understand the influence of location and month on the foraging activity. Both location and month affected the foraging activity of Odontocetes in Hawaii. In general, the foraging activity was the highest in the north and the lowest in the south part of the study area. The model revealed that, at each location, the foraging activity tended to decrease over the time of the study. A seasonality seems to be seen for the two southernmost locations. At the northernmost location the foraging activity decreased from February 2012 till 11 months later (January 2013). Odontocetes daily foraging activity was higher at night-time at all locations sampled.

AB  - The Cumberland Sound (Nunavut, Canada) beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)) population has been designated as threatened and updated biological information about summer distribution is required for a sound recovery plan. Variation in aerial survey counts are speculated to occur due to movement of belugas in and out of the fiord, and there is still uncertainty related to their distribution within key summer habitat. To address these knowledge gaps, non-invasive passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems were deployed in August of 2010 and 2011. An automated detector was used to determine presence/absence and quantify calls by recorder site. Results were verified by partial manual analysis of 20% of the files. The detector had a minimum accuracy of 85% for presence/ absence and 42% for call quantification. Belugas were detected primarily at the uppermost site of Clearwater Fiord, with detections subsiding with increasing proximity to the fiord entrance. Diel variation in call patterns were quantified at two separate sites in different years, but no correlation was observed between tidal cycles and number of detections. This study indicates that Cumberland Sound beluga may prefer sites at the head of Clearwater Fiord. Further research is required to identify which environmental variables contribute to this observed summer distribution.

AB  - Acoustically equipped deep-water mobile autonomous platforms can be used to survey for marine mammals over intermediate spatiotemporal scales. Direct comparisons to fixed recorders are necessary to evaluate these tools as passive acoustic monitoring platforms. One glider and two drifting deep-water floats were simultaneously deployed within a deep-water cabled hydrophone array to quantitatively assess their survey capabilities. The glider was able to follow a pre-defined track while float movement was somewhat unpredictable. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 20 Hz pulses were recorded by all hydrophones throughout the two-week deployment. Calls were identified using a template detector, which performed similarly across recorder types. The glider data contained up to 78% fewer detections per hour due to increased low-frequency flow noise present during glider descents. The glider performed comparably to the floats and fixed recorders at coarser temporal scales; hourly and daily presence of detections did not vary by recorder type. Flow noise was related to glider speed through water and dive state. Glider speeds through water of 25 cm/s or less are suggested to minimize flow noise and the importance of glider ballasting, detector characterization, and normalization by effort when interpreting glider-collected data and applying it to marine mammal density estimation are discussed.

AB  - The detection range of calling animals is commonly described by the passive sonar equations. However, the sonar equations do not account for interactions between source and ambient sound level, i.e., the Lombard effect. This behavior has the potential to introduce non-linearities into the sonar equations and result in incorrectly predicted detection ranges. Here, we investigate the relationship between ambient sound and effective detection ranges for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in Cape Cod Bay, MA, USA using a sparse array of acoustic recorders. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the probability that a call was detected as a function of distance between the calling animal and the sensor and the ambient sound level. The model suggests a non-linear relationship between ambient sound levels and the probability of detecting a call. Comparing the non-linear model to the linearized version of the same model resulted in 12 to 25% increases in the effective detection range. We also found evidence of the Lombard effect suggesting that it is the most plausible cause for the non-linearity in the relationship. Finally, we suggest a simple modification to the sonar equation for estimating detection probability for single sensor monitoring applications.

AB  - Highly mobile marine megafauna species, while widely distributed and frequently threatened, often aggregate in distinct localized habitats. Implementation of local management initiatives within these hotspots is more achievable than developing effective conservation strategies that encompass their entire distributions. Such measures have the potential for disproportionate population-level benefits but rely on a detailed understanding of spatiotemporal habitat use. To that end, we examined the residency and small-scale habitat use of 51 whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) over 5 years at an aggregation site in Tanzania using passive acoustic telemetry. Whale sharks were highly resident within and across years, with a combined maximum residency index of 0.39. Although fewer sharks were detected from March to September, residency was high throughout the year. Ancillary photographic-identification data showed that individual residency persisted before and after tag attachment. Kernel utilization distributions (KUD) and movement networks both revealed the same spatiotemporal pattern of habitat use, with a small core habitat (50% KUD area for all sharks combined = 12.99 km(2)) that predictably changed on a seasonal basis. Activity spaces did not differ with time of day, sex, or size of the sharks, indicating a population-level pattern driven by prey availability. The small and predictable core habitat area at this site means that site-based management options to reduce shark injuries and mortality from boat strike and fishing gear entanglement can be spatially targeted for maximum effectiveness and compliance by human users.

AB  - Marine mammals (whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, sea cows) use sound both actively and passively to communicate and sense their environment, covering frequencies from a few hertz to greater than 100 kHz, differing with species. Although a few documents on marine mammal sound production and reception date back 200 years, concern about the effects of man-made noise on marine mammals has only been documented since the 1970s. Underwater noise can interfere with key life functions of marine mammals (e.g., foraging, mating, nursing, resting, migrating) by impairing hearing sensitivity, masking acoustic signals, eliciting behavioral responses, or causing physiological stress. Many countries are developing and updating guidelines and regulations for underwater noise management in relation to marine mammal conservation. In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, enacted in 1972, is increasingly being applied to underwater noise emission. Common mitigation methods include (1) time/area closures, (2) the establishment of safety zones that are monitored by visual observers or passive acoustics and that lead to shut-down or low-power operations if animals enter these zones, (3) noise reduction gear like bubble curtains around pile driving, and (4) noise source modifications or operational parameters like soft starts. Mitigation management mostly deals with single operations (like a one-month seismic survey). Key questions that remain are how noise impacts accumulate over time and multiple exposures, how multiple acoustic and nonacoustic stressors interact, and how effects on individuals affect a population as a whole.

AB  - As development of offshore wind energy areas (WEAs) progresses along the US Atlantic coast, so will the spatiotemporal overlap and potential space-use conflict with vulnerable or protected wildlife, including Critically Endangered North Atlantic right whales (NARWs). Assessments of potential impacts from construction and operational activities on NARWs are dependent on the spatial, temporal, and acoustic overlaps between those activities and the occurrence of NARWs. Additionally, baseline distribution data of NARWs and data-driven policies are crucial to guide management decisions that minimize risk. The Massachusetts (MA) and Rhode Island-Massachusetts (RI-MA) Offshore WEAs currently comprise some of the largest lease areas and the first industry-scale offshore WEAs in the USA. Continuous passive acoustic data from 2011 through 2015 reveal highly variable seasonal, diel, and spatial NARW occurrence patterns within and near the MA and RI-MA WEAs. Under low (5th percentile) and median (50th percentile) noise conditions in the NARW communication frequency band (upcalls 71-224 Hz), we estimated detection ranges of 22 km (14 inter-quartile ranges [IQR]) and 8 km (5 IQR), respectively. Results underscore the influences of existing noise conditions on NARW communication and detectability within the MA and RI-MA WEAs. These dynamic NARW spatial and temporal occurrence data provide empirical support to enhance monitoring and mitigation strategies for minimizing risk to NARWs during periods of construction and identify time periods when heightened seasonal monitoring throughout the year during operations may be warranted.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used for many vocal species. However, few studies have quantified the fraction of vocalisations captured, and how animal distance and sound source level affect detection probability. Quantifying the detection probability or effective detection area (EDA) of a recorder is a prerequisite for designing and implementing monitoring studies, and essential for estimating absolute density and abundance from PAM data. We tested the detector performance of cetacean click loggers (C-PODs) using artificial and recorded harbour porpoise clicks played at a range of distances and source levels. Detection rate of individual clicks and click sequences (or click trains) was calculated. A Generalised Additive Model (GAM) was used to create a detection function and estimate the effective detection radius (EDR) and EDA for both types of signals. Source level and distance from logger influenced the detection probability. Whilst differences between loggers were evident, detectability was influenced more by the deployment site than within-logger variability. Maximum distance for detecting real recorded porpoise clicks was 566 m. Mean EDR for artificial signals with source level 176 dB re 1 mu Pa @ 1m was 187 m., and for a recorded vocalisation with source level up to 182 dB re 1 mu Pa was 188 m. For detections classified as harbour porpoise click sequences the mean EDR was 72 m. The analytical methods presented are a valid technique for estimating the EDA of any logger used in abundance estimates. We present a practical way to obtain data with a cetacean click logger, with the caveat that artificial playbacks cannot mimic real animal behaviour and are at best able to account for some of the variability in detections between sites, removing logger and propagation effects so that what remains is density and behavioural differences. If calibrated against real-world EDAs (e.g., from tagged animals) it is possible to estimate site-specific detection area and absolute density. We highlight the importance of accounting for both biological and environmental factors affecting vocalisations so that accurate estimates of detection area can be determined, and effective monitoring regimes implemented.

AB  - An eight-element oil-filled hydrophone array is used to measure the acoustic field in littoral waters. This prototype array was deployed during an experiment between Jeffrey's Ledge and the Stellwagen Bank region off the coast of Rockport, Massachusetts USA. During the experiment, several humpback whale vocalizations, distant ship tonals and high frequency conventional echosounder pings were recorded. Visual confirmation of humpback moving in bearing relative to the array verifies the directional sensing from array beamforming. During deployment, the array is towed at speeds varying from 4-7 kts in water depths of roughly 100 m with conditions at sea state 2 to 3. This array system consists of a portable winch with array, tow cable and 3 water-resistant boxes housing electronics. This system is deployed and operated by 2 crew members onboard a 13 m commercial fishing vessel during the experiment.
   Non-acoustic sensor (NAS) information is obtained to provide depth, temperature, and heading data using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components utilizing RS485/232 data communications. Acoustic data sampling was performed at 8 kHz, 30 kHz and 100 kHz with near real-time processing of data and enhanced Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) from beamforming. The electrical system components are deployed with 3 stacked electronics boxes housing power, data acquisition and data processing components in water resistant compartments. A laptop computer with 8 TB of external storage and an independent Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna is used to run Passive Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (POAWRS) software providing beamformed spectrogram data and live NAS data with capability of capturing several days of data. The acquisition system consists of Surface Mount Device (SMD) pre-amplifiers with filter to an analog differential pair shipboard COTS acquisition system. Pre-amplifiers are constructed using SMD technology where components are pressure tolerant and potting is not necessary. Potting of connectors, electronics and hydrophones via 3D printed molding techniques will be discussed.
   Array internal components are manufactured with Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) 3D printed material to dampen array vibrations with forward and aft vibration isolation modules (VIM). Polyurethane foam (PUF) used to scatter breathing waves and dampen contact from wires inside the array without attenuating high frequencies and allowing for significant noise reduction. A single Tygon array section with a length of 7.5 m and diameter of 38 mm contains 8 transducer elements with a spacing of 75 cm (1 kHz design frequency). Preamplifiers and NAS modules are affixed using Vectran and steel wire rope positioned by swaged stops along the strength member. The tow cable length is 100 m with a diameter of 22 mm that is potted to a hose adapter to break out 12 braided copper wire twisted pair conductors and terminates the tow cable Vectran braid.
   This array in its current state of development is a low-cost alternative to obtain quality acoustic data from a towed array system. Used here for observation of whale vocalizations, this type of array also has many applications in military sonar and seismic surveying. Maintenance on the array can be performed without the use of special facilities or equipment for dehosing and conveniently uses castor oil as an environmentally safe pressure compensating and coupling fluid. Array development including selection of transducers, NAS modules, acoustic acquisition system, array materials and method of construction with results from several deployments will be discussed. We also present beamformed spectrograms containing humpback whale downsweep moans and underwater blowing (bubbles) sounds associated with feeding on sand lance (Ammodytes dubius).

AB  - The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) is an endangered freshwater porpoise subspecies unique to the Yangtze River basin. Seasonal variations in local distribution of the animal, as well as fish presence, sand dredging, ship navigation, and bridges were examined as potential factors affecting the occurrence of the animals. Passive acoustic surveys were performed regularly from May 2007 to August 2010, near the conjunction of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. The distribution of the porpoises was seasonally site-specific. In May and August, the animals were detected more often at river junctions than in the lake, but vice versa from November to February. The rate of the porpoise detection was significantly higher in areas of fish presence than in areas of absence. The number of porpoises detected did not differ significantly between the sand dredging operation and the prohibition period (in 2008), although the number of vessels obviously declined in 2008. Ship traffic and bridges also did not appear to affect the presence of porpoises. These results showed the relative importance of the various environmental factors, which is important for conservation of not only Yangtze finless porpoise but also endangered isolated cetaceans.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two-stage classification strategies in detecting north Atlantic right whale upcalls. Time-frequency measurements of data from passive acoustic monitoring devices are evaluated as images. Vocalization spectrograms are preprocessed for noise reduction and tone removal. First stage of the algorithm eliminates non-upcalls by an energy detection algorithm. In the second stage, two sets of features are extracted from the remaining signals using contour-based.and texture based methods. The former is based on-extraction of time-frequency features from upcall contours, and the latter employs a Local Binary Pattern operator to extract distinguishing texture features of the upcalls. Subsequently evaluation phase is carried out by using several classifiers to assess the effectiveness of both the contour-based and texture-based features for upcall detection. Comparing ROC curves of machine learning algorithms obtained from Cornell University's dataset reveals that LBP features improved performance accuracy up to 43% over time-frequency features. Classifiers such as the Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and TreeBagger achieve highest upcall detection rates with LBP features.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas, have a graded call system; call types exist on a continuum making classification challenging. A description of vocalizations from the eastern Beaufort Sea beluga population during its spring migration are presented here, using both a non-parametric classification tree analysis (CART), and a Random Forest analysis. Twelve frequency and duration measurements were made on 1019 calls recorded over 14 days off Icy Cape, Alaska, resulting in 34 identifiable call types with 83% agreement in classification for both CART and Random Forest analyses. This high level of agreement in classification, with an initial subjective classification of calls into 36 categories, demonstrates that the methods applied here provide a quantitative analysis of a graded call dataset. Further, as calls cannot be attributed to individuals using single sensor passive acoustic monitoring efforts, these methods provide a comprehensive analysis of data where the influence of pseudo-replication of calls from individuals is unknown. This study is the first to describe the vocal repertoire of a beluga population using a robust and repeatable methodology. A baseline eastern Beaufort Sea beluga population repertoire is presented here, against which the call repertoire of other seasonally sympatric Alaskan beluga populations can be compared.

AB  - The Northeast Pacific (NEP) population of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus musculus is currently managed as a single stock. We investigated the fine-scale frequency characteristics of 1 NEP blue whale song unit, the B call. We analyzed B calls from passive acoustic data collected between 2010 and 2013 at 2 low-latitude sites, Palmyra Atoll and the Hawaiian Islands, and 3 higher-latitude sites, off southern California, off Washington state and in the Gulf of Alaska. Frequency measurements were extracted along the contour of the third harmonic from each call, and data from each region were compared. Calls from the Gulf of Alaska and Hawai'i presented a downshift in frequency, beginning just past the midway point of the contour, which was not present in calls recorded from southern California or Palmyra Atoll. Calls from Washington displayed intermediate characteristics between those from the other 2 high-latitude sites. Cluster analysis resulted in consistent grouping of call contours from Washington and southern California, in what we termed the NEP B1 variant, while contours from Hawai'i and the Gulf of Alaska were grouped together, as a NEP B2 variant. Frequency differences were also observed among the variants; the Gulf of Alaska displayed the highest frequency on average, followed by Washington, then southern California. Consistent with other studies, a yearly decline in the frequency of B calls was also observed. This discovery of at least 2 geographically distinct variants provides the first evidence of vocally distinct subpopulations within the NEP, indicating the possibility of a need for finer-scale population segmentation.

AB  - The passive listening hypothesis proposes that dolphins and whales detect acoustic signals emitted by prey, including sound-producing (soniferous) fishes. Previous work showed that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) behaviorally orient toward the sounds of prey, including the advertisement calls of male Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta). In addition, soniferous fishes constitute over 80% of Tursiops diet, and toadfishes alone account for approximately 13% of the stomach contents of adult bottlenose dolphins. Here, we used both behavioral (vocalizations) and physiological (plasma cortisol levels) parameters to determine if male Gulf toadfish can, in turn, detect the acoustic signals of bottlenose dolphins. Using underwater playbacks to toadfish in their natural environment, we found that low-frequency dolphin sounds ('pops') within the toadfish's range of hearing dramatically reduce toadfish calling rates by 50%. High-frequency dolphin sounds (whistles) and low-frequency snapping shrimp pops (ambient control sounds) each had no effect on toadfish calling rates. Predator sound playbacks also had consequences for circulating stress hormones, as cortisol levels were significantly elevated in male toadfish exposed to dolphin pops compared with snapping shrimp pops. These findings lend strong support to the hypothesis that individuals of a prey species modulate communication behavior in the presence of a predator, and also suggest that short-term glucocorticoid elevation is associated with anti-predator behavior.

AB  - Northward range shifts are increasingly being identified in mobile animals that are responding to climate change. Range shifts are consequential to animal ecology, ecosystem function, and conservation goals, yet for many species these cannot be characterised without means of synoptically measuring their distribution. The distribution of critically endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis; NARW) north of 45 degrees N has been largely unknown due to a lack of systematic monitoring. The objectives of this study were to characterize the spatial and temporal variation in NARW acoustic occurrence in the northern portion of their foraging range. In addition, we sought to identify relevant NARW migratory corridors and explore potential previously unidentified high-use habitats beyond the highly surveyed Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL). To achieve this, passive acoustic monitoring data were collected and analyzed from 67 moorings and 13 gliders deployed (across 38 recording stations) throughout the Atlantic Canadian continental shelf, between 42 degrees N and 58 degrees N during 2015 through 2017. The results support that while a portion of the population has moved northward into the GSL, this shift was constrained to temperate latitudinal ranges < 52 degrees N during the study period. NARWs were not detected in the Labrador Sea and Newfoundland Shelf, despite their preferred prey occurring in those areas. NARWs were present on the Scotian Shelf (45 degrees N) nearly year-round, but only from May through December in the Cabot Strait (50 degrees N). These results indicate that the northern range of the population is probably influenced by energetic requirements to minimize the distance between suitable foraging habitat and low latitude calving grounds, rather than an absence of suitable foraging conditions in high latitude waters, or other environmental or physiological factors. This work provides critical information to conserve the species and mitigate human-induced risks.

AB  - A simple passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) setup was used to localize and track beluga whales underwater in three dimensions (3D) in a fiord. In June 2009, beluga clicks were recorded from a cabled hydrophone array in a regularly frequented habitat in Eastern Canada. Beluga click energy was concentrated in the 30-50 kHz frequency band. The click trains detected on several hydrophones were localized from their time difference of arrivals. Cluster analysis linked localizations into tracks based on criteria of spatial and temporal proximity. At close ranges from the array, the localized click-train series allowed three-dimensional tracking of a beluga during its dive. Clicks within a train spanned a large range of durations, inter-click intervals, source levels and bandwidths. Buzzes sometimes terminated the trains. Repeated click packets were frequent. All click characteristics are consistent with oblique observations from the beam axis, and ordered variation of the source pattern during a train, likely resulting from a scan of angles from the beam axis, was observed before click trains indicated focusing of the echolocation clicks in one direction. The click-train series is interpreted as echolocation chasing for preys during a foraging dive. Results show that a simple PAM system can be configured to passively and effectively 3D track wild belugas and small odontocetes in their regularly frequented habitat. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Yangtze River exhibits a high biodiversity and plays an important role in global biodiversity conservation. As the world's busiest inland river in regard to shipping, little attention has been paid to underwater noise pollution. In 2017, the underwater noise level in 25 riverside locations along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River mainly at night time were investigated by using passive acoustic monitoring method. Approximately 88% and 40% of the sampled sites exhibit noise levels exceeding the underwater acoustic thresholds of causing responsiveness and temporary threshold shift, respectively, in cetacean. Noise pollution may impose a high impact on fish with physostomous swim bladders and Weberian ossicles, such as silver carp, bighead carp, goldfish and common carp, whereas it may affect fish with physoclistous swim bladders and without Weberian ossicles, such as lake sturgeon and paddlefish, to a lesser extent. Noise levels reductions of approximately 10 and 20 dB were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively, of the Yangtze River over the 2012 level. The green development mode of the ongoing construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, including the development of green shipping lanes, ports, ships and transportation organizations, may account for the alleviated underwater noise pollution. Follow-up noise mitigation endeavors, such as the extension of ship speed restrictions and the study and implementation of the optimal navigation speed in ecologically important areas, are required to further reduce the noise level in the Yangtze River to protect local porpoises and fish.

AB  - The Baltic Proper harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is currently listed as critically endangered (CR), with the Static Acoustic Monitoring of the Baltic Sea Harbor Porpoise (SAMBAH) project concluding that only similar to 500 individuals remain. This population has a distribution that spans the waters of nine countries, making regular abundance estimates and management action challenging. Given the continued decline of other depleted porpoises, namely the vaquita (Phocoena sinus), the question is often raised about whether management action would even have a positive impact, or whether it is too late for population recovery. When abundance estimates are sparse over time, monitoring programs at key sites are likely to serve as the best indication of population trends, and may provide an early indication of changes at the population level. We compared passive acoustic monitoring data from 12 stations that were utilized both in the SAMBAH project (2011-2013) and as a part of the Swedish National Monitoring Program (2017-2020) to determine trends in detection rates. There was a 29% increase in mean daily detection rate during May-October (over the breeding season) between the two study periods. At the three stations with the highest number of detections, log linear regression revealed a yearly increase of 2.4% between 2011 and 2019 (-4.4-9.6, 95% CI). This may be indicative of the beginnings of population recovery, or simply an indication that the decline has stalled. The rate of increase is still well below what is likely to be possible for porpoise populations, and unlikely to buffer against any potential increase in pressures in the future. We therefore call for urgent management action to remove threats and protect this CR population, the only resident cetacean in the Baltic region, in order to give it the best chance of recovery.

AB  - Offshore Oil and Gas (O&G) exploration and production has been cycling from cradle to grave for over 100 years, spanning many generations of marine fauna. Despite global occurrence of offshore infrastructure, implications of their presence for apex predators, including cetaceans, is understudied. We analyzed data from autonomous underwater passive-echolocation-click detectors (C-PODs) deployed at an offshore O&G production platform and at control locations to investigate acoustic activity of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) from 2015 to 2020, before, during, and after platform construction. Despite a statistically significant decrease in porpoise detections following platform construction and initial drilling operations (2015-2016), detections returned to baseline levels within five months. We detected no long-term effects of platform presence on porpoise-detection rates. While additional study is required to further understand activity of porpoise at O&G platforms during continued operation through to decommissioning, our findings, nonetheless, have important implications for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), which do not currently consider effects of platform presence on marine mammals in any context other than short-term noise mitigation. While we know porpoise forage at ageing platforms, this is the first study to demonstrate porpoise also utilize space around new platforms, which must be accommodated in long-term EIA processes.

AB  - Autonomous passive acoustic recorders were deployed to record sounds of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the southeast Beaufort Sea for periods of 30-55 days during the late summer, open-water seasons of 2008-2010. Recordings were made in three areas licensed for hydrocarbon exploration, spanning the continental slope and adjacent outer shelf, and in a shallow inner-shelf area where bowheads have been observed congregating to feed in recent decades. Bowhead sounds were counted in samples comprising 10% of each recorded hour. In mid-August and September in all 3 years, the rate of bowhead calling at outer shelf sites exceeded that at adjacent continental slope sites by one to two orders of magnitude. Higher rates of calling occurred on the slope in late July and early August than at later dates. Calling rates varied by an order of magnitude between years in the one area that was monitored in different years. The highest rates of calling occurred on the inner shelf, offshore of the northern Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula. These trends are consistent with patterns of habitat use previously reported from aerial surveys in this and nearby areas of the Beaufort Sea and with the results of satellite tagging studies.

AB  - In bioacoustics, passive acoustic monitoring of animals living in the wild, both on land and underwater, leads to large data archives characterized by a strong imbalance between recorded animal sounds and ambient noises. Bioacoustic datasets suffer extremely from such large noise-variety, caused by a multitude of external influences and changing environmental conditions over years. This leads to significant deficiencies/problems concerning the analysis and interpretation of animal vocalizations by biologists and machine-learning algorithms. To counteract such huge noise diversity, it is essential to develop a denoising procedure enabling automated, efficient, and robust data enhancement. However, a fundamental problem is the lack of clean/denoised ground-truth samples. The current work is the first presenting a fully-automated deep denoising approach for bioacoustics, not requiring any clean ground-truth, together with one of the largest data archives recorded on killer whales (Orcinus Orca) - the Orchive. Therefor, an approach, originally developed for image restoration, known as Noise2Noise (N2N), was transferred to the field of bioacoustics, and extended by using automatic machine-generated binary masks as additional network attention mechanism. Besides a significant cross-domain signal enhancement, our previous results regarding supervised orca/noise segmentation and orca call type identification were outperformed by applying ORCA-CLEAN as additional data preprocessing/enhancement step.

TI  - Can acoustic multipath explain finback (B-physalus) 20-Hz doublets in shallow water?

KW  - WHALES
AB  - A broadband acoustic propagation code is combined with an empirically derived geoacoustic seafloor model for the purpose of interpreting finback doublet sequences recorded in the northern Gulf of California by Thompson et al. in 1987 [Thompson et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 92, 3051-3057 (1992)]. The result is that for ranges less than 30 km, it is plausible to explain the appearance of the finback doublet in this environment in terms of multipath propagation through the water column and the seafloor. For a channel depth as shallow as 50 m, the detection range of the subbottom arrival may exceed that of the water-borne arrival. This result may have important implications for the accuracy of hyperbolic localization algorithms which assume a sound speed consistent with a water-borne propagation path. When doublet propagation is supported, the interpulse delay is demonstrated to be strongly range dependent. With prior knowledge of the geoacoustic environment, the interpulse delay may provide a practical tool for the real-time passive ranging of finbacks using only a single hydrophone or sensor array. Scientists might consider the impact the multipath-induced doublet has on long distance communication between whales based on temporal cues encoded in patterned 20-Hz pulse sequences.

AB  - This work examines the impact of the dynamic soundscape on estimates of the signal detection area (DA) of passive acoustic monitoring stations. The range of signal detection was investigated at three site locations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System (CTBTO IMS). Transmission loss to each hydrophone was computed using the OASIS Peregrine parabolic equation model for a source within the upper 300 m of the water column to be consistent with the hypothesized location of vocalizing baleen whales. Seasonal, monthly, and daily soundscape measurements were incorporated into the sonar equation to estimate the variability in signal DA as a function of sound level and time As a comparison, the seasonal analysis was repeated with a constant noise level to quantify the extent of variability due solely to changes in the seasonal sound speed profile. The greatest DA variability was observed at the Wake Island location in the Pacific Ocean where only a maximum of 18% of the 71 to 85% difference in DA estimates across seasons was attributable to changes in the sound speed profile. Differences in the daily DA estimate distributions as a function of frequency and location illustrate the impact of local sound field dynamics on the overall soundscape and the resulting signal detection range.

AB  - The ambient sound field in the ocean is a combination of natural and manmade sounds. Consequently, the interpretation of the ambient sound field can be used to quantify these processes. In the frequency range from 1 to 50 kHz, the general character of ocean ambient sound is a slowly changing background that is closely associated with local wind speed, interspersed with shorter time scale events such as rain storms, ships and animal calls. At lower frequencies the underwater ambient sound budget includes geologically generated sound activities including underwater volcanic eruptions, seismic and seepage faults that generate bubbles, etc. that can also potentially be classified and quantified. Acoustic data are collected on hydrophones. Hydrophones are simple, robust sensors that can be deployed on most ocean instrumentation systems including surface or sub-surface moorings, bottom mounted systems, drifters. ARGO floats or autonomous underwater platforms. A dedicated oceanic underwater recorder called a passive acoustic listener (PAL) has been developed. A principal issue is to accurately distinguish different sound sources so that they can be quantified as part of a sound budget, and then quantified if appropriate. Based on ongoing data collected from the Poseidon II network the retrieval potential of multi-parameters from underwater sound, including meteorological (i.e., precipitation and winds) and in general geophysical, anthropogenetic (i.e., ships, submarines, etc.) and biological (whales, etc.) sources is presented.

AB  - The vocalization behavior of humpback whales was monitored over vast areas of the Gulf of Maine using the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing technique (POAWRS) over multiple diel cycles in Fall 2006. The humpback vocalizations comprised of both song and non-song are analyzed. The song vocalizations, composed of highly structured and repeatable set of phrases, are characterized by inter-pulse intervals of 3.5 +/- 1.8 s. Songs were detected throughout the diel cycle, occuring roughly 40% during the day and 60% during the night. The humpback non-song vocalizations, dominated by shorter duration (3 s) downsweep and bow-shaped moans, as well as a small fraction of longer duration (approximate to 5 s) cries, have significantly larger mean and more variable inter-pulse intervals of 14.2 +/- 11 s. The non-song vocalizations were detected at night with negligible detections during the day, implying they probably function as nighttime communication signals. The humpback song and non-song vocalizations are separately localized using the moving array triangulation and array invariant techniques. The humpback song and non-song moan calls are both consistently localized to a dense area on northeastern Georges Bank and a less dense region extended from Franklin Basin to the Great South Channel. Humpback cries occur exclusively on northeastern Georges Bank and during nights with coincident dense Atlantic herring shoaling populations, implying the cries are feeding-related.

AB  - Over the past two years, researchers at Fisheries and Oceans Canada have been running an acoustic monitoring project at multiple study sites throughout Nova Scotia, Canada to investigate baleen whale presence and levels of underwater noise. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a passive acoustic monitor (PAM) was in place in the study site located in the approaches to Halifax Harbor, a major Canadian port. This provided a unique opportunity to determine if changes in vessel noise levels occurred after pandemic restrictions were put in place. To investigate this, we analyzed and compared acoustic data collected from March 28 to April 28 and August 6 to October 22 in both 2019 and 2020. We also investigated possible changes in vessel traffic from February 1 through April 28 and July 1 through July 28 in 2019 and 2020 using terrestrial-based automatic identification system (AIS) data provided by the Canadian Coast Guard and cargo information provided by the Port of Halifax. The acoustic data were analyzed in 1/3 octave frequency bands. For the 89.1-112 Hz frequency band, we found an 8.4 dB increase in the daily minimum sound pressure level (SPL) in April 2020 compared to April 2019 due the presence of a large crane vessel stationed near the mooring site. For the period of August to October, we found an approximately 1.7 dB reduction in the same metric from 2019 to 2020. The most noticeable change in vessel composition was the dramatic decrease in the number and occurrence of pleasure craft in July 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. While this analysis looked at only a single PAM and a limited amount of data, we observed changes in sound levels in the frequency band known to be associated with shipping as well as changes in vessel traffic; we conclude that these observed changes may be related to pandemic restrictions.

AB  - Cue counting is a method developed for estimating vocally active wildlife density by dividing the density of cues (number of cues per unit area surveyed per unit time) by the average cue rate (ACR) at which individuals vocalize. It has been used successfully to estimate whale density using passive acoustic monitoring, but its efficacy has had limited testing in birds. We tested whether cue counting can be used to infer bird abundance using autonomous recording units and estimated the minimum effort required to obtain a reliable cue rate at individual and population levels. We recorded Dupont's Lark (Chersophilus duponti) vocalizations at 31 sites where traditional field censuses were also performed. We estimated the ACR using three methodologies: directional recordings, recordings from an online database of bird sounds (xeno-canto), and behavioral field studies. The ACRs estimated using directional recordings and behavioral field studies were similar, and bird numbers were over and underestimated by 0.8 and 10%, respectively (74-77% of the sampling sites were well estimated). However, the ACR estimated using xeno-canto recordings was much higher than those estimated using the other two methods, and bird numbers were underestimated by 41%. We also performed a cost-effectiveness assessment of the number of individuals and recording durations needed to optimize the estimation of a reliable ACR. We found that ACR estimates were more efficient if long (25 min) recordings were used when < 4 males were recorded, whereas 5-min recordings were more efficient for >= 20 males. We conclude that cue counting can be useful to infer bird density around recorders but requires an accurate measure of the ACR. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of passive cue counting on a large number of species and under different circumstances.

AB  - Shelf-seas are highly dynamic and oceanographically complex environments, which likely influences the spatio-temporal distributions of marine megafauna such as marine mammals. As such, understanding natural patterns in habitat use by these animals is essential when attempting to ascertain and assess the impacts of anthropogenically induced disturbances, such as those associated with marine renewable energy installations (MREIs). This study uses a five year (2009-2013) passive acoustics (C-POD) dataset to examine the use of an oceanographically dynamic marine renewable energy test site by small cetaceans, dolphins (unspecified delphinids) and harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena, in the southern Celtic Sea. To examine how temporal patterns in habitat use across the site related to oceanographic changes occurring over broad seasonal scales as well as those driven by fine scale (bi-weekly) localised processes (that may be masked by seasonal trends), separate analyses were conducted using (1) all daily animal detection rates spanning the entire five year dataset and (2) daily animal detection rates taken only during the summer months (defined as mid June to mid-October) of 2010 (when continuous monitoring was carried out at multiple discrete locations across the site). In both instances, generalised additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) were used to link detection rates to a suite of environmental variables representative of the oceanography of the region. We show that increased harbour porpoise detection rates in the late winter/early spring (January-March) are associated with low sea surface temperatures (SST), whilst peaks in dolphin detection rates in the summer (July-September) coincide with increased SSTs and the presence of a tidal-mixing front. Moreover, across the summer months of 2010, dolphin detection rates were found to respond to small scale changes in SST and position in the spring-neap cycle, possibly reflective of a preference for the stratified waters immediately offshore of the front. Together, these findings suggest that habitat use by small cetaceans within shelf-seas is temporally variable, species specific and likely driven by complex bottom-up processes. As such, the effective conservation management of shelf-seas requires that we understand the dynamic complexities of these systems and the species that inhabit them. In particular, we emphasise the need for a good understanding of the natural drivers of habitat use by marine megafauna before the potential impacts of anthropogenically induced disturbances, such as those associated with the construction, maintenance and operation of MREls, can be assessed.

AB  - Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, Washington, has been selected as a potential tidal energy site. It is located near shipping lanes, is possibly a highly variable acoustic environment, and is frequented by the endangered Southern Resident killer whale (SRKW). Resolving environmental impacts is the first step to receiving approval to deploy tidal turbines. Several monitoring technologies are being considered to determine the presence of SRKW near the turbines. Broadband noise level measurements are critical for determining design and operational specifications of these technologies. Acoustic environment data at the proposed site were acquired at different depths using a cabled vertical line array from two cruises during flood and ebb tidal periods in May and June 2011. The ambient noise level decreases approximately 5 dB re 1 mu Pa per octave for frequency ranges of 1-70 kHz and increases approximately 5 dB re 1 mu Pa per octave for the frequency from 70 to 100 kHz. The difference between noise pressure levels in different months varies from 10 to 30 dB re 1 mu Pa for the frequency range below 70 kHz. Commercial shipping and ferry vessel traffic were found to be the most significant contributors to sound pressure levels for the frequency range of 1-50 kHz, and the variation could be as high as 30 dB re 1 mu Pa. These noise level measurements provide the basic information for designing and evaluating both active and passive monitoring systems proposed for deployment and operation of a tidal power generation alert system.

TI  - Results from a high-resolution acoustic device for monitoring finless porpoises in coastal precincts off Japan
T2  - OCEANS 2006 - ASIA PACIFIC, VOLS 1 AND 2
LA  - English
CP  - Oceans 2006-Asia Pacific Conference
AB  - Finless porpoise populations in coastal precincts are adversely impacted by human activities that cause water pollution, lack of food and denial of migratory paths. Proper survey and management of their populations has therefore become necessary. Visual-based surveys are very tedious, labor intensive, have limited accuracy, and are strongly subject to visibility conditions. These cetaceans produce characteristic echolocation pulses that make them acoustically visible, night or day. Acoustic-based survey methods are expected to be indispensable for surveying finless porpoises that do not exhibit visually dramatic behavior like the oceanic dolphins and spend most of their time underwater. Passive observation of echolocation clicks on arrays of high frequency hydrophones can simultaneously localize several underwater sound sources as they move around. Since the click characteristics are known to be species-specific, individuals belonging to the same group need to be precisely discriminated on basis of their location and movement pattern alone. This paper reports the results from testing a compact and portable acoustic survey device designed for monitoring underwater behavior of groups finless porpoises.
   The acoustic sensor system consists of 3 hydrophones forming a main vertical linear array, together with two more hydrophones forming a small 3-element triangle array with the central hydrophone, in a plane perpendicular to the linear array axis. It is housed in a "bird-cage" structure that weighs 25kg and is 3.6m tall, 30cm in diameter, and is deployed vertically with a buoy and a weight. The device has been tested in shallow waters of less than 10 meters depth off-Choshi port on the Pacific coast of Japan. Echolocation pulses from several porpoises were recorded. One feature has been the differences in strength of the click signal observed on the hydrophones in the vertical array that is indicative of a narrow beam pattern of the porpoise. The main challenge in localization has been to eliminate surface and bottom reflections that inevitably occur in shallow water. In addition, echolocation pulses of some dolphins in the vicinity were also simultaneously recorded. An attempt has been made to segregate the porpoise clicks from those of the dolphins, and then to localize the porpoises.
   The experiment demonstrates the capability of the device for individually tracking several vocalizing animals. This novel tracking system will be used to survey populations of finless porpoises in coastal precincts.

AB  - Understanding drivers of habitat use and selection of mobile species is critical for understanding the impacts of climate change and formulating management plans. Eastern Beaufort Sea beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas form large summering aggregations in the warm, fresh waters of the Mackenzie Estuary, Northwest Territories, Canada; however, the environmental factors driving spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use within the estuary are not fully understood. We used passive acoustic monitoring to record beluga presence during their summer aggregation (June-August) at known congregation areas and locations with unique oceanographic features in Kugmallit Bay in the Mackenzie River Estuary, while simultaneously recording environmental and oceanographic data. The effectiveness of hydrophones at determining beluga presence/absence was validated using shore-based observations. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the influence of environmental conditions on presence/absence of belugas. Results indicate that temporal patterns of habitat use varied by location, and were influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, and wind speed. Belugas did not frequent commonly used locations during periods with high-speed winds and moved farther into the estuary during periods of cold oceanic influxes. This study provides support for hypotheses that belugas use the location for moulting or to provide a thermal advantage for young belugas. This information can be used to inform decisions by northern communities and policy makers, thus aiding in management of the Beaufort Sea beluga population.

AB  - To develop a passive acoustic monitoring system for diversity detection and thereby adapt to the challenges of a complex marine environment, this study harnesses the advantages of empirical mode decomposition in analyzing nonstationary signals and introduces energy characteristics analysis and entropy of information theory to detect marine mammal vocalizations. The proposed detection algorithm has five main steps: sampling, energy characteristics analysis, marginal frequency distribution, feature extraction, and detection, which involve four signal feature extraction and analysis algorithms: energy ratio distribution (ERD), energy spectrum distribution (ESD), energy spectrum entropy distribution (ESED), and concentrated energy spectrum entropy distribution (CESED). In an experiment on 500 sampled signals (blue whale vocalizations), in the competent intrinsic mode function (IMF2) signal feature extraction function distribution of ERD, ESD, ESED, and CESED, the areas under the curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.4621, 0.6162, 0.3894, and 0.8979, respectively; the Accuracy scores were 49.90%, 60.40%, 47.50%, and 80.84%, respectively; the Precision scores were 31.19%, 44.89%, 29.44%, and 68.20%, respectively; the Recall scores were 42.83%, 57.71%, 36.00%, and 84.57%, respectively; and the F1 scores were 37.41%, 50.50%, 32.39%, and 75.51%, respectively, based on the threshold of the optimal estimated results. It is clear that the CESED detector outperforms the other three detectors in signal detection and achieves efficient sound detection of marine mammals.

AB  - Soundscape ecology in the context of physical oceanographic features is an emerging area of research revealing interactions between physically, biologically and anthropogenically driven sounds and their sources. Sound-scapes can shape and reveal distributions of a range of species, from fish larvae to whales, within marine eco-systems. The northern Indian Ocean is a region of high environmental variability driven by seasonally reversing monsoonal winds. The mid-oceanic islands within these waters consist of steep slopes forming a crucial interface between shallow reef and deep oceanic habitats. Studies on soundscape are limited in these waters. The aim of this study was to characterize major sound sources off the southern and northern side of the Kavaratti atoll in Lakshadweep islands, India, located at the northern part of the Laccadive-Maldives-Chagos Ridge. A first look at shallow water soundscapes are provided here using passive acoustic monitoring, and how they correlate with satellite-derived oceanographic variables. Geophonic and biophonic sources across different frequency bands are identified with three major choruses - a dusk fish chorus, a midnight chorus that is speculated to be produced by myctophids, and a snapping shrimp night chorus. Low frequency biophonic choruses peaked in inter-monsoon months (January to March), while low frequency geophonic sound levels peaked during monsoon months (June to October) and increased with wind speed. The dusk fish chorus and the midnight chorus (at the south site) decreased with increasing sea surface salinity, while the snapping shrimp chorus (at the south site) increased with increasing sea surface salinity. Snapping shrimp chorus levels increased with decreasing wind speed. The dusk fish chorus peaked during full and waning moon, and the midnight and snapping shrimp choruses peaked during new moon periods. The sources and patterns described in this study will help compare with future soundscape and sound pressure level measurements within this region. This will be useful in the context of a changing climate and for planning future developmental projects on the islands. Reef choruses link with peak larval recruitment, spawning, or feeding activities, and further investigation into the peak calling times reported here will help uncover the function of choruses. Expanding the collection of passive acoustic monitoring data and oceanographic measurements over longer timescales will significantly advance 'soundscape oceanography'.

AB  - Fine-scale information on the occurrence of coastal cetaceans is required to support regulation of offshore energy developments and marine spatial planning. In particular, the EU Habitats Directive requires an understanding of the extent to which animals from Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) use adjacent waters, where survey effort is often sparse. Designing survey regimes that can be used to support these assessments is especially challenging because visual sightings are expected to be rare in peripheral parts of a population's range. Consequently, even intensive visual line-transect surveys can result in few encounters. Static passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) provides new opportunities to extend survey effort by using echolocation click detections to quantify levels of occurrence of coastal dolphins, but this does not provide information on species identity. In NE Scotland, assessments of proposed offshore energy developments required information on spatial patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins in waters in and next to the Moray Firth SAC. Here, we illustrate how this can be achieved by integrating data from broad-scale PAM arrays with presence-only data from visual surveys. Generalized estimating equations were used with PAM data to model the occurrence of dolphins in relation to depth, distance to coast, slope, and sediment, and to predict the spatial variation in the cumulative occurrence of all dolphin species across a 4 x 4 km grid of the study area. Classification tree analysis was then applied to available visual sightings data to estimate the likely species identity of dolphins sighted in each grid cell in relation to local habitat. By multiplying these probabilities, it was possible to provide advice on spatial variation in the probability of encountering bottlenose dolphins from this protected population at a regional scale, complementing data from surveys that estimate average density or overall abundance within a region.

AB  - Admiralty Inlet has been selected as a potential tidal energy site. It is located near shipping lanes, is a highly variable acoustic environment, and is frequented by the endangered southern resident killer whale (SRKW). Resolving environmental impacts is the first step to receiving approval to deploy tidal turbines at Admiralty Inlet. Of particular concern is the potential for blade strike or other negative interactions between the SRKW and the tidal turbine. A variety of technologies including passive and active monitoring systems are being considered as potential tools to determine the presence of SRKW in the vicinity of the turbines. Broadband noise level measurements are critical for determining design and operational specifications of ocean energy capture technologies. Acoustic environment data at the proposed site was acquired at different depths using a cabled vertical line array (VLA) with four calibrated hydrophones. The power spectrum density of the sound pressure level (SPL) was estimated using the fast Fourier transform. This study describes the first broadband SPL measurements for this site at different depths with frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 480 kHz in combination with other information. To understand the SPL caused by bedload transport, three different pressure sensors with temperature and conductivity were also assembled on the VLA to measure the conditions at the hydrophone deployment depth. The broadband SPL levels at frequency ranges of 3 kHz to 7 kHz as a function of depth were estimated. Only the hydrophone at an average depth of 40 m showed the strong dependence of SPL with distance from the bottom, which was possibly caused by the cobbles shifting on the seabed. Automatic Identification System data were also studied to understand the influence of ship traffic on SPL measurements.

AB  - The harbour porpoise is the only resident cetacean species in the German Baltic Sea. Within the last several decades this harbour porpoise stock declined drastically, causing deep concern about its status. Plans of the German government for proposing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to implement Natura 2000 and for assessing the impact of offshore windmill constructions on the marine environment led to an increased research effort on the harbour porpoise in German waters. For the first nine, long-term passive acoustic monitoring has been conducted in the German Baltic Sea from the Kiel Bight to the Pomeraman Bay From August 2002 to December 2005. Porpoise detectors (T-PODs) have been installed five to seven metres below the water surface at up to 42 measuring positions throughout the investigated area, registering the exact times of echolocation signals of passing harbour porpoises. The proportion of monitored days with porpoise detection in each quarter of the years has been analysed. A correlation of the results with the longitude of the measuring position revealed a significant decrease from west to cast in the percentage of days with porpoise detections. Comparison of data gathered in the first quarters with the third quarters of the monitoring years displayed a seasonal variation with fewer days of porpoise detections in winter time than in summer time. Nevertheless, harbour porpoises have been detected year-round at most of the measuring positions in the German Baltic Sea. The present study clearly indicates a regular use of the German Baltic Sea by harbour porpoises with a geographical and seasonal variation in the usage of the German Baltic Sea. The larger numbers of harbour porpoise detections III spring to autumn compared with winter suggests that the German Baltic Sea is an important breeding and mating area for these animals.

AB  - Observing marine mammal (MM) populations continuously in time and space over the immense ocean areas they inhabit is challenging but essential for gathering an unambiguous record of their distribution, as well as understanding their behaviour and interaction with prey species(1-6). Here we use passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS)(7,8) in an important North Atlantic feeding ground(9,10) to instantaneously detect, localize and classify MM vocalizations from diverse species over an approximately 100,000 km(2) region. More than eight species of vocal MMs are found to spatially converge on fish spawning areas containing massive densely populated herring shoals at night-time(11-16) and diffuse herring distributions during daytime. We find the vocal MMs divide the enormous fish prey field into species-specific foraging areas with varying degrees of spatial overlap, maintained for at least two weeks of the herring spawning period. The recorded vocalization rates are diel (24 h)-dependent for all MM species, with some significantly more vocal at night and others more vocal during the day. The four key baleen whale species of the region: fin, humpback, blue and minke have vocalization rate trends that are highly correlated to trends in fish shoaling density and to each other over the diel cycle. These results reveal the temporospatial dynamics of combined multi-species MM foraging activities in the vicinity of an extensive fish prey field that forms a massive ecological hotspot, and would be unattainable with conventional methodologies. Understanding MM behaviour and distributions is essential for management of marine ecosystems and for accessing anthropogenic impacts on these protected marine species(1-5,17,18).

AB  - Passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) employs a large aperture coherent hydrophone array system to provide instantaneous wide-area (similar to 100 km diameter region) remote sensing and monitoring of sound producers in marine ecosystems, including detection, localization and classification. Coherent array processing techniques such as beam-forming can (1) enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of received signals by filtering noise outside of the signal beam, (2) provide estimates of signal bearing, and hence (3) enhance signal detection ranges by one to two orders of magnitude over that of a single hydrophone. A bearing-time trajectory sequence of detected signals from a sound producer can be employed for localization estimation, from which geographic maps of different sound producers can be generated. Here we provide examples of POAWRS wide-area sensing of sound producers in several distinct marine ecosystems, the Gulf of Maine (2006), the Great South Channel and deep ocean south of Rhode Island (2021) off the US Northeast coast, and the Norwegian and Barents Seas (2014). The sound producers include marine mammal vocalizations from a large variety of baleen and toothed whale species, fish grunts and other fish-produced signals; ship generated tonal and broadband sounds; seismic airgun and other natural and man-made sound sources. When POAWRS observations are combined with other sensing modalities, such as OAWRS echosounding and imaging, ultrasonic echosounding, tagging, visual and underwater photography, important behavioral dynamics including predator-prey interactions at a variety of temporal-spatial scales can be elucidated. POAWRS applications can include real-time environmental assessment for seismic surveys and other geophysical prospecting activities, monitoring marine ecosystems around wind farms and marine directional soundscaping, in addition to maritime surveillance and defense.

AB  - Aim: Species distribution models (SDMs) are essential tools in ecology and conservation. However, the scarcity of visual sightings of marine mammals in remote polar areas hinders the effective application of SDMs there. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data provide year-round information and overcome foul weather limitations faced by visual surveys. However, the use of PAM data in SDMs has been sparse so far. Here, we use PAM-based SDMs to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of the critically endangered Antarctic blue whale in the Weddell Sea.Location: The Weddell Sea.Methods: We used presence-only dynamic SDMs employing visual sightings and PAM detections in independent models. We compared the two independent models with a third combined model that integrated both visual and PAM data, aiming at leveraging the advantages of each data type: the extensive spatial extent of visual data and the broader temporal/environmental range of PAM data.Results: Visual and PAM data prove complementary, as indicated by a low spatial overlap between daily predictions and the low predictability of each model at detections of other data types. Combined data models reproduced suitable habitats as given by both independent models. Visual data models indicate areas close to the sea ice edge (SIE) and with low-to-moderate sea ice concentrations (SIC) as suitable, while PAM data models identified suitable habitats at a broader range of distances to SIE and relatively higher SIC.Main Conclusions: The results demonstrate the potential of PAM data to predict year-round marine mammal habitat suitability at large spatial scales. We provide reasons for discrepancies between SDMs based on either data type and give methodological recommendations on using PAM data in SDMs. Combining visual and PAM data in future SDMs is promising for studying vocalized animals, particularly when using recent advances in integrated distribution modelling methods.

AB  - Offshore wind energy development is rapidly ramping up in United States (U.S.) waters in order to meet renewable energy goals. With a diverse suite of endangered large whale species and a multitude of other protected marine species frequenting these same waters, understanding the potential consequences of construction and operation activities is essential to advancing responsible offshore wind development. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) represents a newer technology that has become one of several methods of choice for monitoring trends in the presence of species, the soundscape, mitigating risk, and evaluating potential behavioral and distributional changes resulting from offshore wind activities. Federal and State regulators, the offshore wind industry, and environmental advocates require detailed information on PAM capabilities and techniques needed to promote efficient, consistent, and meaningful data collection efforts on local and regional scales. PAM during offshore wind construction and operation may be required by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management through project-related permits and approvals issued pursuant to relevant statutes and regulations. The recommendations in this paper aim to support this need as well as to aid the development of project-specific PAM Plans by identifying minimum procedures, system requirements, and other important components for inclusion, while promoting consistency across plans. These recommendations provide an initial guide for stakeholders to meet the rapid development of the offshore wind industry in United States waters. Approaches to PAM and agency requirements will evolve as future permits are issued and construction plans are approved, regional research priorities are refined, and scientific publications and new technologies become available.</p>

AB  - In this paper, the conceptual design and practical construction of a wind propelled Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV), for marine research are described. The ASPire (Autonomous Sailing Platform) will be deployed for collecting marine sensor data (i.e., Conductivity, Temperature and Density (CTD) measurements) and for passive-acoustic monitoring (PAM) of harbor porpoise in the vicinity of the Aland Islands in the Baltic Sea. The construction of hull and rig is presented, along with propulsion methods and energy harvesting strategies. Supplementary electronics, sensors, control systems, communication methods and obstacle avoidance strategies are also described. The ASV design includes several novel features, four are mentioned here.
   1) The perhaps most notable feature is the rig with a free rotating rigid wingsail. The rig has two servo wings, one in front of, and one behind the main wing. To our knowledge, this is the first design of a surface vessel that uses such a three- surface configuration for wind propulsion.
   2) Another novel feature of the ASPire is the single-axis solar tracker developed for the purpose of increasing the amount of harvested solar energy. The solar panel is angled based on the position and heading of the ASV as well as the time of day.
   3) A windvane self steering device is furthermore used to keep the ASV at a straight course relative to the wind in an energy efficient manner. Although the design of the windvane is well known, its use in an autonomous vessel has not been explored.
   4) A forward-looking Thermal Imaging Camera (TIC) is utilized for obstacle detection. This approach is currently under-explored for ASV.
   The ASPire is suited for operation in shallow waters. It is sufficiently large for carrying payload needed for marine sensor measurements and monitoring of high-frequency cetaceans such as harbor porpoise. One further advantage of wind propulsion for audio measurement is the possibility to operate without contributing noise from propulsion engines.

AB  - For many undersea research application scenarios, instruments need to be deployed for more than one month which is the basic time interval for many phenomena. With limited power supply and memory, management strategies are crucial for the success of data collection. For acoustic recording of undersea activities, in general, either preprogrammed duty cycle is configured to log partial time series, or spectrogram. of signal is derived and stored, to utilize the available memory storage efficiently. To overcome this limitation, we come up with an algorithm to classify different sound patterns and store only the sound data of interest.
   Conventionally, pattern recognition for acoustic signal is done in spectral level. Features like characteristic frequencies, large amplitude of selected frequencies or intensity threshold are used to identify or classify different patterns. On main limitation for this type of approaches is that the algorithm is generally range-dependent, as a result, also sound-level-dependent. This type of algorithms will be less robust to the change of the environment. One the other hand, one interesting observation is that when human beings look at the spectrogram, they will immediately tell the difference between two patterns. Even though no knowledge about the nature of the source, human beings still can discern the tiny dissimilarity and group them accordingly. This suggests that the recognition and classification can be done in spectrogram as an image processing and recognition problem. In this work, we propose to modify PCA (Principal Component Analysis), a popular technique used in face recognition, to classify sounds of interest in the ocean. Among all different sound sources in the ocean, we focus on three categories of our interest, i.e., rain, ship and whale and dolphin.
   The sound data were recorded with an instrument called PAL (Passive Acoustic Listener) developed by Nystuen [1], Applied Physics Lab, University of Washington. The recording strategy is to turn on the system and picks up 4.5 seconds at the beginning of the pre-set duty cycle. Spectrogram is derived to check if certain frequency band with significant intensity exists. If so, additional 4.5 seconds clips will be recorded until the conditions cease to exist. Otherwise, the system goes to sleep mode and waits for the next duty cycle. Therefore, the final data file consists of intermittent recording of 4.5 seconds clips for most of the time.
   Conventional PCA takes the whole m x n face image (in our case the spectrogram) and stretch it into a long mn x 1 vector. M training images, represented by these mn x 1 vectors, are used to obtain eigen vectors. The vectors corresponding to the largest-k eigenvalues are used to construct the recognition space, thus all the images are points in this space. Face recognition is then reformulated as finding the shortest Euclidian distance between points. For our case, unlike human faces, there are no well-defined features like eyes, ears, mouth and nose. For this reason, the original spectrogram. is not suitable to be used directly as the input for PCA. In stead, the invariant moments of a spectrogram image serves this purpose better. Our modified PCA uses the first seven invariant moments (all scalars) of each spectrogram image frame to constitute the 7 x 1 feature vector. The rest of the procedure follows exactly as the conventional PCA.
   Among all the data, we manually identify twenty frames for each cases, and use them as the base training set. Feed several unknown clips for classification experiments, we suggest that both point-based feature extraction are effective ways to describe whistle vocalizations and believe that this algorithm would be useful for extracting features from noisy recordings of the callings of a wide variety of species.
