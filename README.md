# CiteSource

This package would have multiple benefits in analyzing the efficacy of specific databases. While there are many tools that allow for deduplication of citations (ASySD, revtools, synthesisr, EndNote, etc), no tool exists that can deduplicate citations while maintaining source metadata related to each of the deduplicated records. 

When teams are selecting databases for inclusion in a review it can be extremely difficult to determine the best resources and determine the ROI in terms of the time it takes to apply searches. This is especially true in environmental research where research is often cross-disciplinary. 

By tracking where citations come from, the evidence synthesis community could in turn track the efficacy of various databases and identify the most relevant resources as it relates to their research topic. 

The package would take in .ris files with source information included in a specific metadata field, the package would then analyze the citations similar to the deduplication process and provide the user with an overview of the # of citations from each resource that are unique, and the # that are duplicated between resources. 

Furthermore, once the screening process has been complete, the final .ris could be uploaded and researchers would also understand how much impact each database had on the review. Analysis could be run on citations coming from different databases and comparing different sources.

As the community continues to apply this analysis to resources, this information would be extremely valuable to researchers and librarians. From the library's perspective this tool could have a substantial impact on collection development decisions and resource recommendations. 

The package will be developed with a GUI for accessibility by researchers/librarians without programming skill sets as well as with the ability to visualize results.
