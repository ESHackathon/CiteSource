Objective: This review aimed to determine the prevalence of long-term mental health issues in Australian populations exposed to bushfires. Method: A systematic search was conducted in five databases (Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify studies focusing on Australian populations impacted by bushfires with the prevalence of mental health issues reported at 2+ years after bushfire. The Joanna Briggs Institute prevalence critical appraisal tool was utilised. We conducted meta-analyses to determine the prevalence of general psychological distress in the general population, and a narrative synthesis. Results: We included 21 articles based on 5 studies and conducted on 3 bushfire events. Meta-analyses showed a pooled prevalence of 14% (95% CI 12%-16%) for psychological distress in the general population at 2-4 years post bushfire. The overall prevalence of long-term psychological problems in firefighters at 2-7 years ranged from 28% to 47.6%. The prevalence of some psychological issues decreased with time and was directly proportional to the level of bushfire impact. Conclusions: As the magnitude of long-term bushfire-related mental health impacts in Australia is severe, it is important to monitor psychological problems and assist communities in future. Future research needs include: (a) more studies on the full range of long-term psychological impacts of bushfires, and (b) consensus on instruments and diagnostic criteria to define mental health issues.

This systematic review evaluated the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and the risk of perinatal, obstetric, and early childhood health outcomes. METHODS: We searched CINAHL Complete, Ovid/EMBASE, Ovid/MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant epidemiological observational studies indexed through September 2023. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed by pairs of independent reviewers. RESULTS: Our systematic search yielded 28,549 records. After duplicate removal, we screened 14,009 studies, identifying 31 for inclusion in the present review. Data extraction highlighted high methodological heterogeneity between studies, including a lack of geographic variation. Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1). Pooled meta-analysis for birthweight and low birthweight were inconclusive, likely due to low number of methodologically homogenous studies. However, the reviewed studies provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of birthweight reduction, low birthweight, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified 31 studies evaluating the impacts of maternal wildfire smoke exposure on maternal, infant, and child health. Although we found suggestive evidence of harm from exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy, more methodologically homogenous studies are required to enable future meta-analysis with greater statistical power to more accurately evaluate the association between maternal wildfire smoke and adverse birth outcomes and other health outcomes.","10.1016/j.envres.2023.117527","241","ei2, 0147621","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165621222","117527","00139351","116-209-377-209-730","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00139351","117527","ei2, 0147621"

However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents.Recent FindingsWe searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM2.5 during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05–1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst − 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, − 32.92 to − 10.50) per 10 µg/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM2.5/all-source PM2.5 during wildfire event.SummaryThe majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions.","10.1007/s40572-023-00420-9","11","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166540269","46","21965412","069-784-161-631-703","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","21965412","46","1"

We calculated the within-study ratio of relative risks (RRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to examine heterogeneity of effect by population subgroup, and then summarized the RRRs using meta-analysis. We found evidence of a greater effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health among females relative to males for asthma (RRR: 1.035, 95% CI: 1.013, 1.057) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RRR: 1.018, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.032).

However, data were insufficient to quantitatively evaluate effect modification by these characteristics.

The systematic review of the current evidence on long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure on human health has not been performed yet. To provide a systematic review and identify potential knowledge gaps in the current evidence of long-term impacts of non-occupational exposure to wildfire smoke and/or wildfire impacts on human health. We conducted a systematic search of the literature via MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus from the database inception to July 05, 2022. References from the included studies and relevant reviews were also considered. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and a validated quality assessment framework were used to evaluate the quality of observational studies. Study results were synthesized descriptively. A total of 36 studies were included in our systematic review. Most studies were from developed countries (11 in Australia, 9 in Canada, 7 in the United States). Studies predominantly focused on mental health (21 studies, 58.33%), while evidence on long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on health outcomes other than mental health is limited. Current evidence indicated that long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure were associated with mortality (COVID-19 mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and acute myocardial disease mortality), morbidity (mainly respiratory diseases), mental health disorders (mainly posttraumatic stress disorder), shorter height of children, reduced lung function and poorer general health status. However, no significant associations were observed for long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on child mortality and respiratory hospitalizations. The population-based high-quality evidence with quantitative analysis on this topic is still limited. Future well-designed studies considering extensive wildfire smoke air pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen oxides) and estimating risk coefficient values for extensive health outcomes (e.g., mortality, morbidity) are warranted to fill current knowledge gaps.","10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121041","320","dvl, 8804476","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154368174","121041","02697491","029-369-493-776-109","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","02697491","121041","dvl, 8804476"

The available literature was searched according to Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (PECOS) database defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a meta-analysis was conducted whenever possible. Data obtained through PECOS characterized information from the USA, Europe, Australia, and some Asian countries; South American countries were seldom characterized, and no data were available for Africa and Russia. Extremely high levels of pollutants, mostly of fine fraction of particulate matter (PM) and ozone, were associated with intense WF emissions in North America, Oceania, and Asia and reported to exceed several-fold the WHO guidelines. Adverse health outcomes include emergency department visits and hospital admissions for cardiorespiratory diseases as well as mortality. Despite the heterogeneity among exposure and health assessment methods, all-cause mortality, and specific-cause mortality were significantly associated with WF emissions in most of the reports. Globally, a significant association was found for all-cause respiratory outcomes including asthma, but mixed results were noted for cardiovascular-related effects. For the latter, estimates were only significant several days after WF emissions, suggesting a more delayed impact on the heart. Different research gaps are presented, including the need for the application of standardized protocols for assessment of both exposure and adverse health risks. Mitigation actions also need to be strengthened, including dedicated efforts to communicate with the affected populations, to engage them for adoption of protective behaviors and measures.","10.1080/10937404.2023.2236548","26","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160820276","387","10937404","108-526-778-523-180","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10937404","387","7"

In this review, we describe the impacts of these events on the health workforce, and strategies responding to these challenges. METHODS: This rapid systematic review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses and a registered protocol (PROSPERO CRD42023433610). Eight databases were searched in May 2022 and again in June 2023. Empirical studies discussing climate change and workforce policy, planning, preparedness, and capacity were included. Inductive thematic analysis of extracted data was conducted. RESULTS: From the 60 included studies, two categories emerged: the impacts of climate events on the health workforce (n = 39), and workforce responses to and preparations for climate events (n = 58). Thirty-seven studies reported on both categories. Four impact themes were identified: absenteeism, psychological impacts, system breakdown, and unsafe working conditions; and six responses and preparations themes: training/skill development, workforce capacity planning, interdisciplinary collaboration, role flexibility, role incentivisation, and psychological support. CONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of some of the deleterious impacts of climate events on the health workforce, as well as potential strategies for the health workforce to prepare or respond to climate events. Future studies should assess the implementation and effectiveness of these strategies to ensure a continuously improving healthcare system, and a well-supported health workforce.","10.1002/hpm.3769","39","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168536281","781","10991751 and 07496753","064-718-815-265-363","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10991751 and 07496753","781","3"

However, modern methods are barely adopted by administrative authorities, globally, especially those considering probabilistic models concerning human-caused fires. An exhaustive review on wildfire danger studies has not yet been performed. Therefore, the present review aims at collecting and analyzing integrated modeling approaches in estimating forest fire danger, examining the driving factors, and evaluating their influence on fire occurrence. The main objective is to propose the top performing methods and the most important risk factors for the development of an Integrated Wildfire Danger Risk System (IWDRS). Studies were classified based on the applied technique, i.e., geographic information systems, remote sensing, statistics, machine learning, simulation modeling and miscellaneous techniques. The conclusions of each study concerning the relative importance of model input variables are also reported. Online search engines such as 'Scopus', 'Google Scholar', 'WorldWideScience', 'ScienceDirect' and 'ResearchGate' were used in relevant literature searches published in scientific journals, manuals and technical documentation. A total of 230 studies were gathered with a selected subset being evaluated in a meta-analysis process. Machine learning techniques outperform average classic statistics, although their predictability relies heavily on the quantity and the quality of the input data. Geographic information systems and remote sensing are considered valuable yet supplementary tools. Modeling techniques apply best to fire behavior prediction, while other techniques referenced in the current review are potentially useful but further investigation is needed. In conclusion, wildfire danger is a function of seven thematic groups of variables: meteorology, vegetation, topography, hydrology, socio-economy, land use and climate. Ninety-five explanatory drivers are proposed.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165704","899","uj0, 0330500","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162671456","165704","18791026 and 00489697","066-202-658-404-328","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","18791026 and 00489697","165704","uj0, 0330500"

This study aimed to provide a summary of the domains and psychometric properties of the available scales that assess preparedness for disasters, or one of its main types, among individuals or households. METHODS: This study is a systematic review of the literature on disaster preparedness tools. Studies published up to December 2022 were identified through a systematic search of four databases: Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) were used to review and evaluate the psychometric properties. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used to report this article. RESULTS: Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria. Among them, five scales measured general disaster preparedness, five measured earthquake preparedness, one measured flood preparedness, and one measured bushfire preparedness. The scales had a number of dimensions ranging from one to six. The most common item topics in the included scales were as follows: having an evacuation plan (n = 7), information source (n = 7), fire extinguisher (n = 6), and emergency kit (n = 5). The scales were rated sufficient for content validity (n = 10), structural validity (n = 5), internal consistency (n = 5), and test-re-test reliability (n = 6). One scale was checked for criterion validity and was rated as insufficient according to the COSMIN guidelines. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest the need to improve the psychometric properties of the scales, expand their contents, and develop scales relevant to target populations. This study provides useful information for researchers to develop comprehensive assessment tools and valuable sources of items for future scales.","10.1017/s1049023x23006386","38","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164499000","636","19451938 and 1049023x","144-226-738-182-394","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","19451938 and 1049023x","636","5"

Two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) were used to identify key literature. A total of 83 studies from across 11 countries were identified to have assessed the risk of wildfires on aquatic animals. We provide a summary of the main ecosystem-level changes associated with wildfires and the main responses of aquatic fauna to such disturbances. We pay special focus to physiological tools and biomarkers used to assess how wildfires impact aquatic animals. We conclude by providing an overview of how physiological biomarkers can further our understanding of wildfire-related impacts on aquatic fauna, and how different physiological tools can be incorporated into management and conservation plans and serve as early warning signs of wildfire disturbances.","10.1111/gcb.16088","28","8","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144736079","2578","13541013","012-059-447-756-990","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","13541013","2578","8"

Currently, knowledge of the extent and characteristics of animal mortality rates during fire remains rudimentary, hindering our ability to predict how animal populations may be impacted in the future. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a global systematic review of the direct effects of fire on animal mortality rates, based on studies that unequivocally determined the fate of animals during fire. From 31 studies spanning 1984-2020, we extracted data on the direct impacts of fire on the mortality of 31 species from 23 families. From these studies, there were 43 instances where direct effects were measured by reporting animal survival from pre- to post-fire. Most studies were conducted in North America (52%) and Oceania (42%), focused largely on mammals (53%) and reptiles (30%), and reported mostly on animal survival in planned (82%) and/or low severity (70%) fires. We found no studies from Asia, Europe or South America. Although there were insufficient data to conduct a formal meta-analysis, we tested the effect of fire type, fire severity, fire regime, animal body mass, ecological attributes and class on survival. Only fire severity affected animal mortality, with a higher proportion of animals being killed by high than low severity fires. Recent catastrophic fires across the globe have drawn attention to the plight of animals exposed to wildfire. Yet, our systematic review suggests that a relatively low proportion of animals (mean predicted mortality [95% CI] = 3% [1%-9%]) are killed during fire. However, our review also underscores how little we currently know about the direct effects of fire on animal mortality, and highlights the critical need to understand the effects of high severity fire on animal populations.","10.1111/gcb.16044","28","6","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144470351","2053","13541013","065-162-904-945-147","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","13541013","2053","6"

This trend is predicted to continue, causing significant adverse health effects to nearby residential populations and placing a potential strain on local emergency departments (EDs). STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this literature review was to identify papers relating to wildfires and their impact on EDs, specifically patient presentation characteristics, resource utilization, and patient outcomes. METHOD: This integrative literature review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for data collection, and Whittemore and Knafl's framework for data analysis. Data were collected from OvidSP, MEDLINE, DARE, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus databases. Various Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords identified papers relevant to wildfires/bushfires and EDs. RESULTS: Literature regarding the relationship between ED presentations and wildfire events, however, is primarily limited to studies from the United States and Australia and indicates particulate matter (PM) is principally linked to adverse respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes. Observable trends in the literature principally included a significant increase in respiratory presentations, primarily with a lag of one to two days from the initial event. Respiratory and cardiovascular studies that stratified results by age indicated individuals under five, over 65, or those with pre-existing conditions formed the majority of ED presentations. CONCLUSION: Key learnings from this review included the need for effective and targeted community advisory programs/procedures, prior to and during wildfire events, as well as pre-event planning, development, and robust resilience strategies for EDs.","10.1017/s1049023x22001054","37","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149726182","657","19451938 and 1049023x","045-998-965-419-452","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","19451938 and 1049023x","657","5"

Increased floral display size can attract more pollinators and increase the absolute fruit and seed production immediately after the fire. However, anthropogenic increases in fire frequency may alter these responses. We aim to assess the effects of fire on pollination and reproductive success of plants at the global scale. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to examine overall fire effects as well as different fire parameters on pollination and on plant reproduction. We also explored to what extent the responses vary among pollinators, pollination vectors, plant regeneration strategies, compatibility systems, vegetation types and biomes. KEY RESULTS: Most studies were conducted in fire-prone ecosystems. Overall, single fires increased pollination and plant reproduction but this effect was overridden by recurrent fires. Floral visitation rates of pollinators were enhanced immediately following a wildfire, and especially in bee-pollinated plants. Fire increased the absolute production of fruits or seeds but not the fruit or seed set. The reproductive benefits were mostly observed in wind-pollinated (graminoids), herbaceous and resprouter species. Finally, fire effects on pollination were positively correlated with fire effects on plant reproductive success. CONCLUSIONS: Fire has a central role in pollination and plant sexual reproduction in fire-prone ecosystems. The increase in the absolute production of fruits and seeds suggests that fire benefits on plant reproduction are likely driven by increased abiotic resources and the consequent floral display size. However, reproduction efficiency, as measured by fruit or seed set, does not increase with fire. In contrast, when assessed on the same plant simultaneously, fire effects on pollination are translated into reproduction. Increased fire frequency due to anthropogenic changes can alter the nature of the response to fire.","10.1093/aob/mcae033","","0372347","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169400581","mcae033","10958290 and 03057364","194-617-821-381-37X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10958290 and 03057364","mcae033","0372347"

Predators also exert strong effects on ecological communities, through top-down regulation of prey and competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their ubiquity, ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor, hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators world-wide. We found 160 studies spanning 1978-2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes (Hedges' g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas, or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations, taxonomic families and study designs, but most were located in North America and Oceania (59% and 24%, respectively), and largely focussed on felids (24%) and canids (25%). Half (50%) of the studies reported responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life-history traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red foxes Vulpes vulpes mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers Coluber constrictor negatively, with variances overlapping zero only slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context-specific management of predator-fire relationships is required.","10.1111/1365-2656.13153","89","4","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122914179","955","00218790","002-832-911-954-193","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00218790","955","4"

Various studies and few meta-analyses have been done and some might be inconsistent; therefore, this meta-analysis was done to assess the relationship between different ABO and Rhesus blood types on the susceptibility to COVID-19 infections. This meta-analysis assessed the odds ratio of COVID-19 infection of different ABO and Rhesus blood types. Subgroup analyses according to (1) age and gender matched; (2) different blood group antigens; (3) Rhesus positive and negative of each blood group were carried out. Publication bias and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) were also done to assess the risk of bias in these publications. It was found that blood group A showed significant difference in odds ratio of COVID-19 infection (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08-1.24). Blood group AB showed significant difference in odds ratio when studies with lower QUADAS-2 score were removed. This means that populations with blood group A and AB are more likely to be infected with COVID-19. As there is a higher tendency that blood group A and AB to be infected with COVID- 19, precautious care should be taken by these populations.","10.47665/tb.39.1.015","39","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147133138","126","25219855 and 01275720","055-122-386-336-181","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","25219855 and 01275720","126","1"

The continued growth of data sets and publications allows powerful synthesis approaches to be applied to such questions at increasingly fine scales. Here, we report results from a synthesis that used meta-analysis of published studies and two large observational databases to quantify disturbance and management impacts on SOC stocks. We conducted this, the third in a series of ecoregional SOC assessments, for the Pacific Northwest, which comprises ~8% of the land area but ~12% of the U.S. forest sector C sink. At the ecoregional level, our analysis indicated that fundamental patterns of vegetation, climate, and topography are far more important controls on SOC stocks than land use history, disturbance, or management. However, the same patterns suggested that increased warming, drying, wildland fire, and forest regeneration failure pose significant risks to SOC stocks across the region. Detailed meta-analysis results indicated that wildfires diminished SOC stocks throughout the soil profile, while prescribed fire only influenced surface organic materials and harvesting had no significant overall impact on SOC. Independent observational data corroborated the negative influence of fire on SOC derived from meta-analysis, suggested that harvest impacts may vary subregionally with climate or vegetation, and revealed that forests with agricultural uses (e.g., grazing) or legacies (e.g., cultivation) had smaller SOC stocks. We also quantified effects of a range of common forest management practices having either positive (organic amendments, nitrogen [N]-fixing vegetation establishment, inorganic N fertilization) or no overall effects on SOC (other inorganic fertilizers, urea fertilization, competition suppression through herbicides). In order to maximize the management applications of our results, we qualified them with ratings of confidence based on degree of support across approaches. Last, similar to earlier published assessments from other ecoregions, we supplemented our quantitative synthesis results with a literature review to arrive at a concise set of tactics for adapting management operations to site-specific criteria.","10.1002/eap.2611","32","6","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146835037","e2611","10510761","038-307-887-566-561","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10510761","e2611","6"

Despite an emerging global interest in this association, Africa remains poorly represented in the literature. METHODS: A scoping review of peer-reviewed studies was conducted to determine the adverse mental health outcomes associated with extreme weather events in Africa (2008-2021). The review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). RESULTS: A total of 12,204 peer-reviewed articles were identified of which 12 were retained for analysis. These studies were all conducted in 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adverse mental health outcomes were identified resulting from flood (n = 4), drought (n = 4), extreme heat (n = 1), bushfire (n = 1), and multiple events (n = 2). Findings included pathological outcomes with predictable symptomatology including mood disorders; trauma- and stressor-related disorders; and suicide. Additionally, conditions indicating psychological distress which were below the pathological threshold including emotion regulation difficulties, disturbed sleep, alcohol use, stress, and anxiety. The quantitative evidence for the association between extreme weather events and mental health was limited primarily by a lack of longitudinal data, exposure gradient, and comparison to an unaffected group, as well as a failure to provide an objective exposure measure. The qualitative evidence for this association was complimentary but without sufficient clinical measurement these outcomes cannot be verified as psychological morbidities. In addition, this review provided insight into the mental health of vulnerable communities affected by extreme weather events including those living in poverty, farmers, pastoralists, women, and children. CONCLUSION: This review provided some preliminary evidence for the association between extreme weather events and adverse mental health outcomes for populations in Africa. The review also provides insight to vulnerable populations affected by extreme weather events.

Yet, how microorganisms respond to postfire phosphorus (P) enrichment to alter soil N transformations remains unclear in N-limited boreal forests. Here, we investigated postfire N-P interactions using an intensive regional-scale sampling of 17 boreal forests in the Greater Khingan Mountains (Inner Mongolia-China), a laboratory P-addition incubation, and a continental-scale meta-analysis. We found that postfire soils had an increased risk of N loss by accelerated <i>N</i><sub>min</sub> and nitrification along with low plant N demand, especially during the early vegetation recovery period. The postfire N/P imbalance created by P enrichment acts as a ""N retention"" strategy by inhibiting <i>N</i><sub>min</sub> but not nitrification in boreal forests. This strategy is attributed to enhanced microbial N-use efficiency and N immobilization. Importantly, our meta-analysis found that there was a greater risk of N loss in boreal forest soils after fires than in other climatic zones, which was consistent with our results from the 17 soils in the Greater Khingan Mountains.

METHODS: Observational studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 17, 2020 on health effects of extreme weather events in Europe were searched systematically in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The exposures of interest included extreme temperature, heat waves, cold waves, droughts, floods, storms and wildfires. The health impacts included total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, respiratory mortality and morbidity, and mental health. We conducted the systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the NICE quality appraisal checklist (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). RESULTS: The search yielded 1472 articles, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Studies regarding five extreme weather events (extreme heat events, extreme cold events, wildfires, floods, droughts) were found. A positive association between extreme heat/cold events and overall, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was reported from most studies. Wildfires are likely to increase the overall and cardiovascular mortality. Floods might be associated with the deterioration of mental health instead of mortality. Depending on their length, droughts could have an influence on both respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Contradictory evidence was found in heat-associated morbidity and wildfire-associated respiratory mortality. The associations are inconclusive due to the heterogeneous study designs, study quality, exposure and outcome assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from most of the included studies showed that extreme heat and cold events, droughts, wildfires and floods in Europe have negative impacts on human health including mental health, although some of the associations are not conclusive. Additional high-quality studies are needed to confirm our results and further studies regarding the effects of other extreme weather events in Europe are to be expected.","10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113688","233","do6, 100898843","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135008819","113688","1618131x and 14384639","109-283-188-084-133","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1618131x and 14384639","113688","do6, 100898843"

Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively. RESULTS: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (n = 2), PM<sub>10</sub> (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth. Well-designed comprehensive studies are needed to better understand the perinatal effects of wildfires.","10.1016/j.envint.2021.106644","156","du1, 7807270","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138209644","106644","01604120","020-279-536-485-656","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","01604120","106644","du1, 7807270"

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis on the response of soil C cycling and storage across soil profiles (organic layer, 0-5 cm, 0-10 cm, 0-20 cm, and 20-100 cm) to fire reported in 308 studies across 383 sites and examined the role of fire frequency, fire type, soil type, ecosystem type, and post-fire time in regulating the response of soil C dynamics to fire. Overall, we found soil C cycling and storage were more responsive to one fire and wildfire as compared to frequent fire and prescribed fire, respectively. Soil respiration significantly decreased by 22 ± 9% by one fire, but was not significantly affected by frequent fire across ecosystems. One fire significantly reduced soil C content in the organic, 0-10 cm, and 20-100 cm layers by 27 ± 16%, 10 ± 9%, and 33 ± 18%, respectively, while frequent fire significantly reduced soil C content at a depth of 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm by 29 ± 8% and 16 ± 12%, respectively. Soil C cycling and storage showed little response to frequent prescribed fire. In addition, the response of soil C cycling and storage varied among different soil and ecosystem types, with a stronger response being observed in forest than in grassland. Within 20 years post-fire, soil C cycling and storage tended to recover only after one fire but not after frequent fire. We also found that soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities were more responsive to one fire than frequent fire, which could indirectly affect the effects of fire on soil C cycling and storage. The results of our study have filled some critical gaps in previous meta-analyses in fire ecology.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153921","825","uj0, 0330500","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145701664","153921","18791026 and 00489697","015-395-986-119-028","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","18791026 and 00489697","153921","uj0, 0330500"

In this study we aimed to investigate the association between PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations and hospital visits by children to address respiratory disease, conjunctivitis, and dermatitis. We examined and compared these associations by the presence of vegetation fire events on a given day (burning, non-burning, and mixed) across the upper northern region of Thailand from 2014 through 2018. A vegetation burning was defined when a fire hotspot (obtained from NASA-MODIS) exceeded the 90th percentile of the entire region and PM<sub>10</sub> concentration was over 100 μg/m<sup>3</sup>. To determine the association between hospital visits among children with PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations on burning and non-burning days, we performed a time-stratified case-crossover analysis fitted with conditional logistic regression for each province.

Wearable electronic devices (wearables) present a potential solution to this research gap. Wearables have become widely accepted in various areas of health research for ecological momentary assessment, and some studies have used wearables in the field of climate change and health. However, these studies vary in study design, demographics, and outcome variables, and existing research has not been mapped. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aimed to map existing research on wearables used to detect direct health impacts and individual exposure during climate change-induced weather extremes, such as heat waves or wildfires. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework and systematically searched 6 databases (PubMed [MEDLINE], IEEE Xplore, CINAHL [EBSCOhost], WoS, Scopus, Ovid [MEDLINE], and Google Scholar). The search yielded 1871 results. Abstracts and full texts were screened by 2 reviewers (MK and IM) independently using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria comprised studies published since 2010 that used off-the-shelf wearables that were neither invasive nor obtrusive to the user in the setting of climate change-related weather extremes. Data were charted using a structured form, and the study outcomes were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: The review included 55,284 study participants using wearables in 53 studies. Most studies were conducted in upper-middle-income and high-income countries (50/53, 94%) in urban environments (25/53, 47%) or in a climatic chamber (19/53, 36%) and assessed the health effects of heat exposure (52/53, 98%). The majority reported adverse health effects of heat exposure on sleep, physical activity, and heart rate. The remaining studies assessed occupational heat stress or compared individual- and area-level heat exposure. In total, 26% (14/53) of studies determined that all examined wearables were valid and reliable for measuring health parameters during heat exposure when compared with standard methods. CONCLUSIONS: Wearables have been used successfully in large-scale research to measure the health implications of climate change-related weather extremes. More research is needed in low-income countries and vulnerable populations with pre-existing conditions. In addition, further research could focus on the health impacts of other climate change-related conditions and the effectiveness of adaptation measures at the individual level to such weather extremes.","10.2196/39532","10","9","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149775846","e39532","22915222","094-794-100-466-287","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","22915222","e39532","9"

The terms used were air pollution OR climate changes OR smoke, AND children OR health. SYNTHESIS OF DATA: The increase in the prevalence of some diseases, such as allergic ones, is attributed to the interactions between genetic potential and the environment. However, disordered growth combined with inadequate waste management has caused problems for the planet, such as heatwaves, droughts, forest fires, increased storms and floods, interference in food crops and their nutritional values, changes in the infectious disease pattern, and air pollution resulting from the continuous use of fossil fuels. Children, beings still in the development stage with immature respiratory and immune systems, are the primary victims of the climate crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The authors documented that prenatal and postnatal exposure to ambient air pollutants will accelerate or worsen the morbidity and mortality of many health conditions, including allergic diseases. Ambient air pollutants change the microbiota, interfere with the immune response, and take direct action on the skin and respiratory epithelium, which facilitates the penetration of allergens.

Common experiences reported by vulnerable individuals affected by drought included worry, hopelessness, isolation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Those affected by fire reported experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anger. These mental health problems exacerbated existing health and socioeconomic challenges. The evidence base about mental health in vulnerable communities affected by natural hazards can be improved by including standardized measures and comparison groups, examining the role of intersectional vulnerabilities, and disaggregating data routinely to allow for analyses of the particular experiences of vulnerable communities. Such efforts will help ensure that programs are informed by an understanding of the unique needs of these communities.","10.1017/gmh.2023.13","10","101659641","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157225842","e24","20544251","132-341-320-568-677","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","20544251","e24","101659641"

This systematic review and meta‐analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially recent mixed‐severity fires with representative patches of high‐severity burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from post‐fire logging. Meta‐analysis of mean standardized effects (Hedge's d ) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a significant positive foraging habitat selection for low‐severity burned forest. Multi‐level mixed‐effects meta‐regressions (hierarchical models) of Hedge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction was positively correlated with the percent of high‐severity fire in owl territories; and positive selection for foraging in low‐ and moderate‐severity burned forest, with high‐severity burned forest used in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta‐analysis of variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in estimates of occupancy, demography, and survival, and lower variation in estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low‐severity burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by mixed‐severity fire, as 83% of all studies and 60% of all effects found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl, mixed‐severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for Spotted Owls.","10.1002/ecs2.2354","9","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105776410","1","21508925","074-205-191-760-444","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","21508925","1","7"

What is less clear is the role of outdoor environmental education in educating participants with the knowledge and motivation to act. Experiential programs that take students outdoors seemingly provide the ideal context to equip students with knowledge and skills to be the vital change agents that the world needs. If outdoor educators are unconvinced of the impacts of climate change, then recent impacts on outdoor programming and practices should call attention to the issue. Changing climatic factors include increased temperatures, droughts, increased severity and frequency of storms, bushfires and floods, and national park closures. The implications of such impacts have not been widely considered, and our research aims to elucidate these concerns. This article uses a systematic literature review to examine the prevalence of climate change as a focus for published research in JOEE and its predecessor, AJOE. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the abstract of every single peer-reviewed paper and six themes emerged from our analysis of these articles. Findings from this review indicate that there is not a substantive focus on climate change in refereed articles published in the journal as only 14 of the 251 peer-reviewed articles published in AJOE/JOEE mentioned climate change. We conclude that more research needs to be undertaken to ascertain how outdoor environmental educators can facilitate a climate change curriculum and how outdoor environmental education programs in Australia are impacted by climate change.","10.1007/s42322-022-00119-9","26","2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153494199","167","22063110 and 2522879x","173-571-489-683-022","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","22063110 and 2522879x","167","2"

Smoke events were associated with an increased risk of EDVs for all respiratory diseases at lag 1 [14.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI): (6.8, 22.5)], asthma at lag 0 [57.1% (44.5, 70.8)], and chronic lower respiratory disease at lag 0 [12.7% (6.2, 19.6)]. We also found positive associations with EDVs for all cardiovascular diseases at lag 10. Mixed results were observed for mental health outcomes. Stratified results revealed potential disparities by race/ethnicity. Short-term exposure to smoke events was associated with increased respiratory and schizophrenia EDVs. Cardiovascular impacts may be delayed compared to respiratory outcomes.","10.1016/j.envres.2023.117154","238","Pt 1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164095359","117154","00139351","155-953-623-595-498","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00139351","117154","Pt 1"

We performed a meta-analysis to predict which traits, habitat, or study variables and fire characteristics affect how mammal species respond to fire. We modeled effect sizes of measures of population abundance or occupancy as a function of various combinations of these traits and variables with phylogenetic least squares regression. Nine of 115 modeled species (7.83%) returned statistically significant effect sizes, suggesting most mammals are resilient to fire. The top-ranked model predicted a negative impact of fire on species with lower reproductive rates, regardless of fire type (estimate = -0.68), a positive impact of burrowing in prescribed fires (estimate = 1.46) but not wildfires, and a positive impact of average fire return interval for wildfires (estimate = 0.93) but not prescribed fires. If a species' International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List assessment includes fire as a known or possible threat, the species was predicted to respond negatively to wildfire relative to prescribed fire (estimate = -2.84). These findings provide evidence of experts' abilities to predict whether fire is a threat to a mammal species and the ability of managers to meet the needs of fire-threatened species through prescribed fire. Where empirical data are lacking, our methods provide a basis for predicting mammal responses to fire and thus can guide conservation actions or interventions in species or communities.","10.1111/cobi.14062","37","4","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154905120","e14062","08888892","175-537-330-221-516","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","08888892","e14062","4"

WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Those with a higher external locus of control are more prone to develop PTSD symptoms since the perceived external locus of control is among the predictors of PTSD. An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: It is known that nurses are deployed in clinical and fieldwork during disaster and assume key roles both interventional practices and psychosocial education. Thus, it is of particular importance for mental health nurses to be aware of the locus of control in themselves, their colleagues, and the community before, during and after disasters to be able to combat the risk/presence of PTSD. ABSTRACT: AIM: The present systematic review explored the impacts of perceived locus of control on PTSD among individuals experiencing disasters. METHOD: This is a systematic review study carried out through a search of the relevant research published in English over the period December 2021 to April 2022. Accordingly, we sought the studies to review on the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases using the keywords ""Child, Children, Adolescent, Adolescence, Adult, Aged, Elderly, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, Internal-External Control, Locus of Control, Disasters, Natural Disasters."" RESULTS: A total of 1.011 studies were found in the five databases using the keywords above. Following the exclusions, the remaining six studies were recruited for this systematic review. The six studies in question addressed earthquakes (2), hurricanes (1), wildfires (1), SARS (1) and fireworks explosions (1). In the study with wildfire survivors, there was a weak significant association between external locus of control and PTSD among those directly exposed to the disaster (r = .15, p < .01). The study with survivors of the SARS epidemic demonstrated that those with a high perceived chance (external) locus of control suffered PTSD (p = .001). An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that perceived locus of control is related to PTSD in individuals experiencing a disaster. The additional evidence was that post-disaster PTSD among those with a high perceived external locus of control is stronger than those with a high perceived internal locus of control.","10.1111/jpm.13030","","9439514, b6e","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168745424","","13652850 and 13510126","074-961-710-843-123","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","13652850 and 13510126","","9439514, b6e"

Of particular concern to forest and wildfire managers is the influence of MPB outbreaks on wildfire via spatial legacies left in impacted forest stands. There is, however, limited consensus in the literature regarding how MPB outbreaks affect wildfire across western North America.ObjectivesThis meta-analysis aims to (1) summarize available evidence regarding MPB-wildfire interactions, and (2) identify environmental and methodological indicators associated with various wildfire responses (i.e., amplified, neutral, or dampened) post-outbreak.MethodsWe include peer-reviewed publications focusing on MPB outbreaks and subsequent wildfire activity in forests across western Canada and the USA between 2000 and 2021. A classification scheme was used to examine attributes of each publication to assess which indicators contribute most to their associated wildfire response.ResultsWe found that spatial scale, forest fuels, and weather are main drivers of variation in wildfire response post-outbreak. Metrics of forest fuels and inclusion of weather data on a stand-scale are related to amplified fire responses, whereas dampened responses correspond to landscape-scale analyses. Furthermore, red-stage stands are associated with amplified fire response, whereas other stages are associated with dampened response—supporting current conceptual models of the importance of outbreak stage on wildfire.ConclusionsAdvancing our understanding regarding drivers of wildfire responses post-MPB outbreak is key to developing accurate, and comparative research studies. These findings provide crucial information for wildfire, and forest management agencies, especially in forests newly exposed to this disturbance interaction under climate change.","10.1007/s10980-023-01720-z","38","9","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160681537","2159","09212973","147-130-857-250-022","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","09212973","2159","9"

Although wildfire is an integral part of certain ecosystems, fires in many places are becoming larger and more intense, driven largely by climate change, land abandonment, and changes in fuel management with important socioeconomic, environmental, and ecosystem services consequences for Europe. In order to envision a comprehensive fire risk mitigation strategy for Europe, a spatial assessment of opportunities to manage fuels at the landscape-scale is needed. Our study explored the suitability of three land management strategies (LMS)-herbivory, mechanical fuel removal, and prescribed burn-which can create more heterogenous fuelscapes, thereby reducing an element of fire risk. We created suitability maps for each of the LMS using adoption factors identified in a systematic literature review (n = 123). We compared these maps with areas of historical fire occurrence as a proxy for fire risk to prioritize key areas for intervention. We found that over a quarter of Europe was suitable for multiple LMS within areas of greater fire risk, creating opportunities for concurrent and synergistic use of the strategies. Options were more limited in areas of southern Europe, where prescribed burn was found to be uniquely viable amongst the LMS evaluated. Opportunities were also restricted in some areas of high fire risk in northern Europe, where herbivory was found to be the only suitable LMS. Our findings take a wide-view of fuel management to target landscape-scale decision making focused on reducing fire risk. However, many other factors must be taken into account to successfully manage fuels at local scales, including the socio-cultural appropriateness of the LMS, the viability of incentive schemes, and possible trade-offs with other management goals, such as carbon storage and biodiversity.","10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118941","346","0401664, du5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164088892","118941","03014797","038-153-653-173-571","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03014797","118941","0401664, du5"

Efficacy for energy psychology protocols has been established in more than 120 clinical trials, with meta-analyses showing strong effect sizes for PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The approach has been applied in the wake of natural and human-made disasters in more than 30 countries. Four tiers of energy psychology interventions following the establishment of safety, trust, and rapport are described, including (1) immediate relief/stabilization, (2) reducing limbic arousal to trauma-based triggers, (3) overcoming complex psychological difficulties, and (4) promoting optimal functioning. The first tier is most pertinent in psychological first aid immediately following a disaster, with the subsequent tiers progressively being introduced over time with complex stress reactions and chronic disorders. Advantages of adding the stimulation of acupuncture points to a conventional exposure approach are identified, and challenges around cultural sensitivities and unintended effects are discussed. After establishing a framework for introducing energy psychology in disaster relief efforts, reports from a sampling of settings are presented, based on interviews with this paper's author. These include accounts of relief work with survivors of mass shootings, genocide, ethnic warfare, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of other reports from the field show a pattern of strong outcomes following the use of energy psychology in the days or weeks after a disaster and in the subsequent treatment of trauma-based psychological problems. Many of these accounts corroborate one another in terms of rapid relief and long-term benefits. Finally, examples of more efficient delivery methods utilizing large groups, lay counselors, digital technology, and cultivating community resilience are presented.","10.3389/fpsyg.2022.856209","13","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147359476","856209","1664-1078","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1664-1078","856209",""

However, there is a limited assessment of the health economic losses attributable to wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). METHODS: We collected daily time-series data on all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality from 510 immediate regions in Brazil during 2000-2016. The chemical transport model GEOS-Chem driven with Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED), in combination with ground monitored data and machine learning was used to estimate wildfire-related PM<sub>2.5</sub> data at a resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. A time-series design was applied in each immediate region to assess the association between economic losses due to mortality and wildfire-related PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the estimates were pooled at the national level using a random-effect meta-analysis. We used a meta-regression model to explore the modification effect of GDP and its sectors (agriculture, industry, and service) on economic losses. RESULTS: During 2000-2016, a total of US$81.08 billion economic losses (US$5.07 billion per year) due to mortality were attributable to wildfire-related PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Brazil, accounting for 0.68% of economic losses and equivalent to approximately 0.14% of Brazil's GDP. The attributable fraction (AF) of economic losses due to wildfire-related PM<sub>2.5</sub> was positively associated with the proportion of GDP from agriculture, while negatively associated with the proportion of GDP from service. CONCLUSION: Substantial economic losses due to mortality were associated with wildfires, which could be influenced by the agriculture and services share of GDP per capita. Our estimates of the economic losses of mortality could be used to determine optimal levels of investment and resources to mitigate the adverse health impacts of wildfires.","10.1016/j.envint.2023.107906","174","du1, 7807270","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156638006","107906","01604120","068-507-829-937-808","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","01604120","107906","du1, 7807270"

Daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 levels were estimated through chemical transport models and machine-learning calibration. Quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag nonlinear models and random-effects meta-analysis were applied to estimate associations between wildfire-specific PM2.5 and diabetes hospitalization. Subgroup analyses were by age, sex, location income level, and country or territory. Diabetes hospitalizations attributable to wildfire-specific PM2.5 and nonwildfire PM2.5 were compared. RESULTS: Each 10 µg/m3 increase in wildfire-specific PM2.5 levels over the current day and previous 3 days was associated with relative risks (95% CI) of 1.017 (1.011-1.022), 1.023 (1.011-1.035), 1.023 (1.015-1.032), 0.962 (0.823-1.032), 1.033 (1.001-1.066), and 1.013 (1.004-1.022) for all-cause, type 1, type 2, malnutrition-related, other specified, and unspecified diabetes hospitalization, respectively. Stronger associations were observed for all-cause, type 1, and type 2 diabetes in Thailand, Australia, and Brazil; unspecified diabetes in New Zealand; and type 2 diabetes in high-income locations. Relative risks (95% CI) of 0.67% (0.16-1.18%) and 1.02% (0.20-1.81%) for all cause and type 2 diabetes hospitalizations were attributable to wildfire-specific PM2.5.

After an overview of the mostly bacterial microbiome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, worldwide data from forests reveal ecological differentiation with respect to major guilds of predominantly fungal plant root symbionts. The plant-microbiome association forms a new holobiont, an integrated unit for ecological adaptation and evolutionary selection. Researchers explored the impact of the microbiome on the capacity of plants to adapt to changing climate conditions. They investigated the impact of the microbiome in reforestation programs, after wildfire, drought, salination and pollution events in forestry, grasslands and agriculture. With increasing temperatures plant populations migrate to higher latitudes and higher altitudes. Ecological studies compared the dispersal capacity of plant seeds with that of soil microbes and the response of soil and root microbes to experimental heating of soils. These studies described a succession of microbiome associations and the kinetics of a release of stored soil carbon into the atmosphere enhancing global warming. Scientists explored the impact of synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) on rice productivity or tea quality; of whole soil addition in grassland restoration; or single fungal inoculation in maize fields. Meta-analyses of fungal inoculation showed overall a positive effect, but also a wide variation in effect sizes. Climate change will be particularly prominent in urban areas (""urban heat islands"") where more than half of the world population is living. Urban landscape architecture will thus have an important impact on human health and studies started to explore the contribution of the microbiome from urban greenspace to ecosystem services.","10.1111/1751-7915.14482","17","6","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172695152","e14482","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","e14482","6"

Post-fire forest restoration is therefore indispensable for maintaining forest ecological integrity and for the sustainability of the affected forest landscapes. In this study, we conduct a systematic review of the available literature on forest restoration in the past two decades (2002–2022) and propose a comprehensive framework for consideration in forest restoration after the occurrence of forest fires. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model was adopted for this study, where three academic literature databases (Scopus, CAB Direct, Web of Science), the Google Scholar search engine, and specialized websites were used for literature searches.

The study findings reveal a dearth of information in the field of post-fire forest restoration in an integrated, balanced, and comprehensive manner, as there was no single methodology or unified protocol that guides post-fire forest restoration. There was also a notable bias in the geographical distribution of the relevant studies in restoration as influenced by economic prosperity, political stability, and scientific and technical advancement. This study recommends a 6-criteria comprehensive framework with 29 indicators for post-fire forest restoration based on the reviewed studies. The criteria integrate environmental, economic, social, cultural and aesthetic, management, infrastructure, and education objectives in their design and implementation for better outcomes in achieving the restoration goals.","10.3390/f13091354","13","9","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150521318","1354","19994907","113-616-025-706-02X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","19994907","1354","9"

However, soil C and N recovered to control levels approximately 10 years after fire, which is a shorter period than previously determined.

Yet, the association between numerous climate change-related environmental stressors and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events has not been systematically reviewed. Objective: To review the current evidence on the association between climate change-related environmental stressors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Evidence Review: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications from January 1, 1970, through November 15, 2023, that evaluated associations between environmental exposures and cardiovascular mortality, acute cardiovascular events, and related health care utilization. Studies that examined only nonwildfire-sourced particulate air pollution were excluded. Two investigators independently screened 20 798 articles and selected 2564 for full-text review. Study quality was assessed using the Navigation Guide framework. Findings were qualitatively synthesized as substantial differences in study design precluded quantitative meta-analysis. Findings: Of 492 observational studies that met inclusion criteria, 182 examined extreme temperature, 210 ground-level ozone, 45 wildfire smoke, and 63 extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, dust storms, and droughts. These studies presented findings from 30 high-income countries, 17 middle-income countries, and 1 low-income country. The strength of evidence was rated as sufficient for extreme temperature; ground-level ozone; tropical storms, hurricanes, and cyclones; and dust storms. Evidence was limited for wildfire smoke and inadequate for drought and mudslides. Exposure to extreme temperature was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but the magnitude varied with temperature and duration of exposure. Ground-level ozone amplified the risk associated with higher temperatures and vice versa. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, were associated with increased cardiovascular risk that persisted for many months after the initial event. Some studies noted a small increase in cardiovascular mortality, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease after exposure to wildfire smoke, while others found no association. Older adults, racial and ethnic minoritized populations, and lower-wealth communities were disproportionately affected. Conclusions and Relevance: Several environmental stressors that are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but data on outcomes in low-income countries are lacking. Urgent action is needed to mitigate climate change-associated cardiovascular risk, particularly in vulnerable populations.","10.1001/jamacardio.2024.1321","9","8","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172785365","","23806591 and 23806583","014-675-091-756-325","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","23806591 and 23806583","","8"

A better understanding of how soil communities respond to Amazonian deforestation is crucially needed to inform policy interventions that effectively protect biodiversity and the essential ecosystem services it provides. We assessed the impact of deforestation and ecosystem conversion to arable land on Amazonian soil biodiversity through a meta-analysis. We analyzed 274 pairwise comparisons of soil biodiversity in Amazonian primary forests and sites under different stages of deforestation and land-use conversion: disturbed (wildfire and selective logging) and slash-and-burnt forests, pastures, and cropping systems. Overall, 60% and 51% of responses of soil macrofauna and microbial community attributes (i.e., abundance, biomass, richness, and diversity indexes) to deforestation were negative, respectively. We found few studies on mesofauna (e.g., microarthropods) and microfauna (e.g., protozoa and nematodes), so those groups could not be analyzed. Macrofauna abundance and biomass were more vulnerable to the displacement of forests by pastures than by agricultural fields, whereas microbes showed the opposite pattern. Effects of Amazonian deforestation on macrofauna were more detrimental at sites with mean annual precipitation >1900 mm, and higher losses of microbes occurred in highly acidic soils (pH < 4.5). Limited geographic coverage, omission of meso- and microfauna, and low taxonomic resolution were main factors impairing generalizations from the data set. Few studies assessed the impacts of within-forest disturbance (wildfires and selective logging) on soil species in Amazonia, where logging operations rapidly expand across public lands and more frequent severe dry seasons are increasing the prevalence of wildfires.","10.1111/cobi.13234","33","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107527799","590","08888892","012-765-359-960-551","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","08888892","590","3"

A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future. METHOD: We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research. RESULTS: We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. EPA regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity. CONCLUSION: Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies.","10.1016/j.envres.2014.10.015","136","ei2, 0147621","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009945528","120","00139351","009-256-084-499-933","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00139351","120","ei2, 0147621"

This review was conducted according to the PICO strategy and following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Greenfile) were searched for articles from 2015 to 2022. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria,nineteen studies were included. The findings indicated that various climate change phenomena are associated with an elevated risk of mortality and morbidity outcomes in older adults. These included cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and mental diseases, along with physical injuries. Notably, the impact of climate change was influenced by gender, socioeconomic status, education level, and age-vulnerability factors. Climate change directly affected the health of older adults through ambient temperature variability, extreme and abnormal temperatures, strong winds, sea temperature variability, extreme El Niño-southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and droughts, and indirectly by air pollution resulting from wildfires. This review presents further evidence confirming that climate change significantly impacts the health and well-being of older adults. It highlights the urgency for implementing effective strategies to facilitate adaptation and mitigation, enhancing the overall quality of life for all individuals.","10.1371/journal.pone.0297116","19","4","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171015465","e0297116","19326203","035-663-703-983-814","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","19326203","e0297116","4"

The 2019-20 bushfire season in Australia burnt 5.4 million hectares of land in New South Wales alone, with smoke so severe it affected cities in Argentina, 11,000 km away. The smoke emitted by bushfires consists of both gaseous and particle components. It is important to note that exposure to particulate matter has been shown to be linked to a heightened risk of stroke, which is the primary kind of cerebrovascular illness, as well as an increased likelihood of hospitalisations and mortality. However, the available data is inadequate in terms of documenting the response of patients diagnosed with a proven cerebrovascular illness to bushfire smoke. Additionally, there is a lack of information about the health effects associated with particulate matter throughout the bushfire season and on days when smoke was present in 2019 and 2020.Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of (i) short-term air pollution triggered by bushfires and (ii) high smoke days in increasing the daily number of hospital admissions with cerebrovascular diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospitalisation data were accessed from the admitted patient dataset from seven local Government areas of Hunter New England Local Health District. The bushfire period was defined from 1 October 2019 to 10 February 2020, and a same period from 2018-19 as the control. High bushfire smoke days were days when the average daily concentration of particulate matter was higher than the 95th percentile of the control period. Poisson regression models and fixed effect meta-analysis were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: In total, 275 patients with cerebrovascular admissions were identified, with 147 (53.5%) during the bushfire (2019-20) and 128 (46.5%) in the control period (2018-19). There was no significant increase in daily admissions for cerebrovascular disease (Incidence Rate Ratio, IRR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.81-1.34; <i>p</i>-value: 0.73), acute stroke (IRR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.88-1.50; <i>p</i>-value: 0.29) or acute ischaemic stroke (IRR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.87-1.59; <i>p</i>-value: 0.28), over the entire bushfire period. However, the high bushfire smoke days were associated with increased acute ischaemic stroke-related hospital admissions across lead 0-3 and the highest cumulative effect was observed with lead 0 (IRR:1.52; 95% CI: 1.01-2.29; <i>p</i>-value: 0.04). In addition, during the bushfire period, particulate matter, both PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (defined as particulates that have an effective aerodynamic diameter of 10, and 2.5 microns, respectively), were also associated with increased acute ischaemic stroke admissions with a lag of 0-3 days. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results suggested a possible association between particulate matter and high smoke days with increased hospital admissions due to acute ischaemic stroke during the recent Australian bushfire season.","10.1177/23969873231223307","9","2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168161769","468","23969881 and 23969873","193-086-449-514-108","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","23969881 and 23969873","468","2"

While some risk factors such as the presence of comorbidities, old age, and ethnicity have been recognized, not a lot is known about who the virus will strike first or impact more. In this hopeless scenario, exploration of time-tested facts about viral infections, in general, seems to be a sound basis to prop further research upon. The fact that immunity and its various determinants (e.g., micronutrients, sleep, and hygiene) have a crucial role to play in the defense against invading organisms, may be a good starting point for commencing research into these as yet undisclosed territories. Herein, the excellent immunomodulatory, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory roles of Vitamin D necessitate thorough investigation, particularly in COVID-19 perspective. This article reviews mechanisms and evidence suggesting the role Vitamin D plays in people infected by the newly identified COVID-19 virus. For this review, we searched the databases of Medline, PubMed, and Embase. We studied several meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of Vitamin D in influenza and other contagious viral infections. We also reviewed the circumstantial and anecdotal evidence connecting Vitamin D with COVID-19 emerging recently. Consequently, it seems logical to conclude that the immune-enhancing, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and lung-protective role of Vitamin D can be potentially lifesaving. Hence, Vitamin D deserves exhaustive exploration through rigorously designed and controlled scientific trials. Using Vitamin D as prophylaxis and/or chemotherapeutic treatment of COVID-19 infection is an approach worth considering. In this regard, mass assessment and subsequent supplementation can be tried, especially considering the mechanistic evidence in respiratory infections, low potential for toxicity, and widespread prevalence of the deficiency of Vitamin D affecting many people worldwide.","10.4103/ijp.ijp_654_20","53","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143545838","394","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","394","5"

However, no study to date has systematically examined the associations of wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub> exposure with mortality globally. METHODS: We did a multicountry two-stage time series analysis. From the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network, data on daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths were obtained from 749 locations in 43 countries or areas, representing overlapping periods from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016. We estimated the daily concentration of wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub> in study locations using a chemical transport model, and then calibrated and downscaled O<sub>3</sub> estimates to a resolution of 0·25° × 0·25° (approximately 28 km<sup>2</sup> at the equator). Using a random-effects meta-analysis, we examined the associations of short-term wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub> exposure (lag period of 0-2 days) with daily mortality, first at the location level and then pooled at the country, regional, and global levels. Annual excess mortality fraction in each location attributable to wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub> was calculated with pooled effect estimates and used to obtain excess mortality fractions at country, regional, and global levels. FINDINGS: Between 2000 and 2016, the highest maximum daily wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (≥30 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) were observed in locations in South America, central America, and southeastern Asia, and the country of South Africa. Across all locations, an increase of 1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in the mean daily concentration of wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub> during lag 0-2 days was associated with increases of 0·55% (95% CI 0·29 to 0·80) in daily all-cause mortality, 0·44% (-0·10 to 0·99) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0·82% (0·18 to 1·47) in daily respiratory mortality. The associations of daily mortality rates with wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub> exposure showed substantial geographical heterogeneity at the country and regional levels. Across all locations, estimated annual excess mortality fractions of 0·58% (95% CI 0·31 to 0·85; 31 606 deaths [95% CI 17 038 to 46 027]) for all-cause mortality, 0·41% (-0·10 to 0·91; 5249 [-1244 to 11 620]) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0·86% (0·18 to 1·51; 4657 [999 to 8206]) for respiratory mortality were attributable to short-term exposure to wildfire-related O<sub>3</sub>.

Most frequently involved sites of mucormycosis are rhino-orbital, rhino-sinusal and rhino-orbito-cerebral. The hallmark sign of mucormycosis is tissue necrosis, which is often a late sign. The fatality rate of mucormycosis is 46% globally. Despite early aggressive combined surgical and medical therapy, the prognosis of mucormycosis is poor. MethodsWe searched the electronic database of PubMed, web of science, Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar from Jan 2020 until December 2021 using keywords. We retrieved all the granular details of original research articles, case reports/series of patients with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM), and COVID-19 reported worldwide. Subsequently, we analyzed the patient characteristics, associated comorbidities, location of mucormycosis, treatment given and its outcome in people with COVID-19. (Prospero registration—CRD42021256830, June 4, 2021). ResultsOverall, 544 rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis patients were included in our review with a history of Covid-19 infection. Out of which 410 patients had diabetes mellitus which has proven to be major contributing immunocompromised disease. Other diseases like hypertension, chronic kidney diseases, hypothyroidism, etc., were also attributed as an immunocompromised disease causing increased number of covid associated mucormycosis cases. We found out that total number of patients alive after taking only antifungal drug treatment were 25 in number, whereas total number of patients alive when antifungal drugs were combined with surgical intervention were 428 which was significantly higher.ConclusionOur systematic review concluded that surgical debridement should be performed whenever feasible in parallel to antifungal treatment in order to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 associated rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis patients.","10.1007/s12663-023-01878-8","","101538309","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156139903","1","09728279 and 09728270 and 0974942x","007-697-212-927-842","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","09728279 and 09728270 and 0974942x","1","101538309"

Fires, which are becoming increasingly frequent and intense due to global change, can affect these ecosystems in many ways, but this relationship is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic review to characterize the literature on the effects of fires on stream ecosystems and found that (1) abiotic indicators were more commonly investigated than biotic ones, (2) most previous research was conducted in North America and in the temperate evergreen forest biome, (3) following a control-impact (CI) or before-after (BA) design, (4) predominantly assessing wildfires as opposed to prescribed fires, (5) in small headwater streams, and (6) with a focus on structural and not functional biological indicators. After quantitatively analyzing previous research, we detected great variability in responses, with increases, decreases, and no changes being reported for most indicators (e.g., macroinvertebrate richness, fish density, algal biomass, and leaf decomposition). We shed light on these seemingly contradicting results by showing that the presence of extreme hydrological post-fire events, the time lag between fire and sampling, and whether the riparian forest burned or not influenced the outcome of previous research. Results suggest that although wildfires and the following hydrological events can have dramatic impacts in the short term, most biological endpoints recover within 5-10 years, and that detrimental effects are minimal in the case of prescribed fires. We also detected that no effects were more often reported by BACI studies than by CI or BA studies, raising the question of whether this research field may be biased by the inherent limitations of CI and BA designs. Finally, we make recommendations to help advance this field of research and guide future integrated fire management that includes the protection of freshwater ecosystems.","10.1111/gcb.17389","30","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173660146","e17389","13541013","013-114-568-007-182","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","13541013","e17389","7"

Biodiversity response to disturbance also depends on the community characteristics and habitat requirements of species. Untangling the mechanistic interplay of these factors has guided disturbance ecology for decades, generating mixed scientific evidence of biodiversity responses to disturbance. Understanding the impact of natural disturbances on biodiversity is increasingly important due to human-induced changes in natural disturbance regimes. In many areas, major natural forest disturbances, such as wildfires, windstorms, and insect outbreaks, are becoming more frequent, intense, severe, and widespread due to climate change and land-use change. Conversely, the suppression of natural disturbances threatens disturbance-dependent biota. Using a meta-analytic approach, we analysed a global data set (with most sampling concentrated in temperate and boreal secondary forests) of species assemblages of 26 taxonomic groups, including plants, animals, and fungi collected from forests affected by wildfires, windstorms, and insect outbreaks. The overall effect of natural disturbances on α-diversity did not differ significantly from zero, but some taxonomic groups responded positively to disturbance, while others tended to respond negatively. Disturbance was beneficial for taxonomic groups preferring conditions associated with open canopies (e.g. hymenopterans and hoverflies), whereas ground-dwelling groups and/or groups typically associated with shady conditions (e.g. epigeic lichens and mycorrhizal fungi) were more likely to be negatively impacted by disturbance. Across all taxonomic groups, the highest α-diversity in disturbed forest patches occurred under moderate disturbance severity, i.e. with approximately 55% of trees killed by disturbance. We further extended our meta-analysis by applying a unified diversity concept based on Hill numbers to estimate α-diversity changes in different taxonomic groups across a gradient of disturbance severity measured at the stand scale and incorporating other disturbance features. We found that disturbance severity negatively affected diversity for Hill number q = 0 but not for q = 1 and q = 2, indicating that diversity-disturbance relationships are shaped by species relative abundances. Our synthesis of α-diversity was extended by a synthesis of disturbance-induced change in species assemblages, and revealed that disturbance changes the β-diversity of multiple taxonomic groups, including some groups that were not affected at the α-diversity level (birds and woody plants). Finally, we used mixed rarefaction/extrapolation to estimate biodiversity change as a function of the proportion of forests that were disturbed, i.e. the disturbance extent measured at the landscape scale. The comparison of intact and naturally disturbed forests revealed that both types of forests provide habitat for unique species assemblages, whereas species diversity in the mixture of disturbed and undisturbed forests peaked at intermediate values of disturbance extent in the simulated landscape. Hence, the relationship between α-diversity and disturbance severity in disturbed forest stands was strikingly similar to the relationship between species richness and disturbance extent in a landscape consisting of both disturbed and undisturbed forest habitats. This result suggests that both moderate disturbance severity and moderate disturbance extent support the highest levels of biodiversity in contemporary forest landscapes.","10.1111/brv.12876","97","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149355650","1930","1469185x and 00063231 and 14647931","159-386-654-364-710","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1469185x and 00063231 and 14647931","1930","5"

OBJECTIVES: We examined the cardiopulmonary effects of short-term exposure to [Formula: see text] on smoke days in the United States to evaluate whether health effects are consistent with those during non-smoke days. METHODS: We examined cardiopulmonary hospitalizations among adults [Formula: see text] y of age, in U.S. counties ([Formula: see text]) within [Formula: see text] of 123 large wildfires during 2008-2010. We evaluated associations during smoke and non-smoke days and examined variability with respect to modeled and observed exposure metrics. Poisson regression was used to estimate county-specific effects at lag days 0-6 (L0-6), adjusted for day of week, temperature, humidity, and seasonal trend. We used meta-analyses to combine county-specific effects and estimate overall percentage differences in hospitalizations expressed per [Formula: see text] increase in [Formula: see text]. RESULTS: Exposure to [Formula: see text], on all days and locations, was associated with increased hospitalizations on smoke and non-smoke days using modeled exposure metrics. The estimated effects persisted across multiple lags, with a percentage increase of 1.08% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28, 1.89] on smoke days and 0.67% (95% CI: [Formula: see text], 1.44) on non-smoke days for respiratory and 0.61% (95% CI: 0.09, 1.14) on smoke days and 0.69% (95% CI: 0.19, 1.2) on non-smoke days for cardiovascular outcomes on L1.

Understanding how soil pools of these two elements change in response to disturbance and management is critical to maintaining ecosystem services such as forest productivity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water resource protection. Fire is one of the principal disturbances acting on forest soil C and N storage and is also the subject of enormous management efforts. In the present article, we use meta-analysis to quantify fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage. Across a combined total of 468 soil C and N response ratios from 57 publications (concentrations and pool sizes), fire had significant overall effects on soil C (-26%) and soil N (-22%). The impacts of fire on forest floors were significantly different from its effects on mineral soils. Fires reduced forest floor C and N storage (pool sizes only) by an average of 59% and 50%, respectively, but the concentrations of these two elements did not change. Prescribed fires caused smaller reductions in forest floor C and N storage (-46% and -35%) than wildfires (-67% and -69%), and the presence of hardwoods also mitigated fire impacts. Burned forest floors recovered their C and N pools in an average of 128 and 103 years, respectively. Among mineral soils, there were no significant changes in C or N storage, but C and N concentrations declined significantly (-11% and -12%, respectively). Mineral soil C and N concentrations were significantly affected by fire type, with no change following prescribed burns, but significant reductions in response to wildfires. Geographic variation in fire effects on mineral soil C and N storage underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and the role of fire type in mediating C and N shifts (especially in the forest floor) indicates that averting wildfires through prescribed burning is desirable from a soils perspective.","10.1890/10-0660.1","21","4","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052891969","1189","10510761","000-748-463-881-466","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10510761","1189","4"

Given increasing wildfire frequency in a changing climate, it is important to understand the magnitude of water quality impacts following fire. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore post-fire changes in the concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) species, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended sediments in 121 sites around the world. Changes were documented over each study’s respective duration, which for 90% of sites was five years or fewer. We find concurrent increases in C, N and P species, highlighting a tight coupling between biogeochemical cycles in post-fire landscapes. We find that fire alters N and P speciation, with median increases of 40%–60% in the proportion of soluble inorganic N and P relative to total N and P. We also found that fire decreases C:N and C:P ratios, with median decreases ranging from 60% to 70%. Finally we observe a ‘hockey stick’-like response in changes to the concentration distribution, where increases in the highest concentration ranges are much greater than increases at lower concentrations.

To evaluate spatial variability in relative vulnerability, we: 1) identified climate change-related risk factors at the dissemination area level; 2) created actionable health vulnerability index scores to map community risks to extreme heat, flooding, wildfire smoke, and ground-level ozone; and 3) spatially evaluated vulnerability patterns and priority areas of action to address inequity.MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted to identify the determinants of health hazards among populations impacted by CCRHHs. Identified determinants were then grouped into categories of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity and aligned with available data. Data were aggregated to 4188 Census dissemination areas within two health authorities in British Columbia, Canada. A two-step principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to select and weight variables for each relative vulnerability score. In addition to an overall vulnerability score, exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity sub-scores were computed for each hazard. Scores were then categorised into quintiles and mapped.ResultsTwo hundred eighty-one epidemiological papers met the study criteria and were used to identify 36 determinant indicators that were operationalized across all hazards. For each hazard, 3 to 5 principal components explaining 72 to 94% of the total variance were retained. Sensitivity was weighted much higher for extreme heat, wildfire smoke and ground-level ozone, and adaptive capacity was highly weighted for flooding vulnerability. There was overall varied contribution of adaptive capacity (16–49%) across all hazards. Distinct spatial patterns were observed – for example, although patterns varied by hazard, vulnerability was generally higher in more deprived and more outlying neighbourhoods of the study region.ConclusionsThe creation of hazard and category-specific vulnerability indices (exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity sub-scores) supports evidence-based approaches to prioritize public health responses to climate-related hazards and to reduce inequity by assessing relative differences in vulnerability along with absolute impacts. Future studies can build upon this methodology to further understand the spatial variation in vulnerability and to identify and prioritise actionable areas for adaptation.","10.1186/s12940-021-00708-z","20","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136583243","31","1476069x","001-234-147-313-043","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1476069x","31","1"

The urgency to address both population ageing and climate change necessitates a rethink and assessment of the impact of climate change on older people. This includes identifying what can be done to anticipate, mitigate and adapt to climate change and engage older persons. Methods: A review of climate change and healthy ageing forms the basis of evidence in this report. We developed a comprehensive search to assess current literature, combining terms related to ageing and climate change across four major data sets and assessing articles published up to the end of 2021. Results: We summarised the current and future impact of climate change on older people and developed a framework identifying climate change impacts on older persons, recognising social and environmental determinants of healthy ageing. Major hazards and some key exposure pathways include extreme temperatures, wildfire, drought, flooding, storm and sea level rise, air quality, climate-sensitive infectious diseases, food and water insecurities, health and social care system displacement, migration, and relocation. Strategies to address climate change require interventions to improve systems and infrastructure to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience. As a heterogeneous group, older people's perceptions of climate change should be integrated into climate activism. Increasing climate change literacy among older people and enabling them to promote intergenerational dialogue will drive the development and implementation of equitable solutions. Pathways may operate via direct or indirect exposures, requiring longitudinal studies that enable assessment of exposures and outcomes at multiple time points, and analyses of cumulative impacts of hazards across the life course. Conclusions: The lack of systematic reviews and primary research on the impact of most climate hazards, except for heat, on older people is apparent. Future research should include outcomes beyond mortality and morbidity and assess how older people interact with their environment by focusing on their capacities and optimising abilities for being and doing what they value.","10.7189/jogh.14.04101","14","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172027332","04101","20472986 and 20472978","072-816-486-820-862","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","20472986 and 20472978","04101",""

Effect sizes (magnitude of response) and their 95% confidence limits (response consistency) were estimated for each species-by-treatment combination with two or more observations. We found 41 studies of 119 bird and 17 small-mammal species that examined short-term responses (< or =4 years) to thinning, low/moderate- and high-severity fire, and thinning plus prescribed fire; data on other taxa and at longer time scales were too sparse to permit quantitative assessment. At the stand scale (<50 ha), thinning and low/moderate-severity fire demonstrated similar response patterns in these forests. Combined thinning plus prescribed fire produced a higher percentage of positive responses. High-severity fire provoked stronger responses, with a majority of species possessing higher or lower effect sizes relative to fires of lower severity. In the short term and at fine spatial scales, fire surrogate forest-thinning treatments appear to effectively mimic low/moderate-severity fire, whereas low/moderate-severity fire is not a substitute for high-severity fire. The varied response of taxa to each of the four conditions considered makes it clear that the full range of fire-based disturbances (or their surrogates) is necessary to maintain a full complement of vertebrate species, including fire-sensitive taxa. This is especially true for high-severity fire, where positive responses from many avian taxa suggest that this disturbance (either as wildfire or prescribed fire) should be included in management plans where it is consistent with historic fire regimes and where maintenance of regional vertebrate biodiversity is a goal.","10.1890/12-0009.1","22","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009336513","1547","10510761 and 19395582","032-674-539-477-753","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10510761 and 19395582","1547","5"

This has resulted in the production of many research papers addressing the use of UAVs in a variety of applications, such as forest firefighting. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of UAV-based forest-fire-extinguishing activity (FFEA) operations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted to answer a specific set of questions, which were carefully formulated to address the results of research conducted between 2008 and 2021. This study aims to (i) expand our understanding of the development of UAVs and their current contributions to the FFEA; (ii) identify particularly novel or unique applications and characteristics of UAV-based fire-extinguishing systems; (iii) provide guidance for exploring and revising further ideas in this field by identifying under-researched topics and other areas in which more contributions are needed; and (iv) explore the feasibility of using UAV swarms to enable autonomous firefighting in the forest without human intervention. Of the 1353 articles systematically searched across five databases (Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Scopus, and IEEE Explore), 51 highly relevant articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria; therefore, they were analyzed and discussed. The results identified several gaps in this field of study among them the complexity of coordination in multi-robotic systems, the lack of evaluation and implementation of fire extinguishing systems, the inability of handling multiple spot fires, and poor management of time and resources. Finally, based on the conducted review, this paper provides significant research directions that require further investigations by researchers in this field including, the deployment of UAV-based Swarm Robotics, further study on the characteristics of the fire extinguishing systems; design more effective area coverage; and the propose of a self-firefighting model that enables individuals to decide on the course of events efficiently and locally for better utilization and management of time and resources.","10.3390/f13050811","13","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148102476","811","19994907","011-935-868-938-531","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","19994907","811","5"

This study aims to estimate trends in black carbon and PM<sub>2·5</sub> concentrations and their attributable mortality burden across the USA. METHODS: In this study, we derived daily concentrations of PM<sub>2·5</sub> and its highly toxic black carbon component at a 1-km resolution in the USA from 2000 to 2020 via deep learning that integrated big data from satellites, models, and surface observations. We estimated the annual PM<sub>2·5</sub>-attributable and black carbon-attributable mortality burden at each 1-km<sup>2</sup> grid using concentration-response functions collected from a national cohort study and a meta-analysis study, respectively. We investigated the spatiotemporal linear-regressed trends in PM<sub>2·5</sub> and black carbon pollution and their associated premature deaths from 2000 to 2020, and the impact of wildfires on air quality and public health. FINDINGS: Our results showed that PM<sub>2·5</sub> and black carbon estimates are reliable, with sample-based cross-validated coefficients of determination of 0·82 and 0·80, respectively, for daily estimates (0·97 and 0·95 for monthly estimates). Both PM<sub>2·5</sub> and black carbon in the USA showed significantly decreasing trends overall during 2000 to 2020 (22% decrease for PM<sub>2·5</sub> and 11% decrease for black carbon), leading to a reduction of around 4200 premature deaths per year (95% CI 2960-5050). However, since 2010, the decreasing trends of fine particles and premature deaths have reversed to increase in the western USA (55% increase in PM<sub>2·5</sub>, 86% increase in black carbon, and increase of 670 premature deaths [460-810]), while remaining mostly unchanged in the eastern USA. The western USA showed large interannual fluctuations that were attributable to the increasing incidence of wildfires. Furthermore, the black carbon-to-PM<sub>2·5</sub> mass ratio increased annually by 2·4% across the USA, mainly due to increasing wildfire emissions in the western USA and more rapid reductions of other components in the eastern USA, suggesting a potential increase in the relative toxicity of PM<sub>2·5</sub>. 100% of populated areas in the USA have experienced at least one day of PM<sub>2·5</sub> pollution exceeding the daily air quality guideline level of 15 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during 2000-2020, with 99% experiencing at least 7 days and 85% experiencing at least 30 days. The recent widespread wildfires have greatly increased the daily exposure risks in the western USA, and have also impacted the midwestern USA due to the long-range transport of smoke. INTERPRETATION: Wildfires have become increasingly intensive and frequent in the western USA, resulting in a significant increase in smoke-related emissions in populated areas. This increase is likely to have contributed to a decline in air quality and an increase in attributable mortality. Reducing fire risk via effective policies besides mitigation of climate warming, such as wildfire prevention and management, forest restoration, and new revenue generation, could substantially improve air quality and public health in the coming decades.

However, the association between wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> and mortality has not been well characterised. We aimed to comprehensively assess the association between short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> and mortality across various regions of the world. METHODS: For this time series study, data on daily counts of deaths for all causes, cardiovascular causes, and respiratory causes were collected from 749 cities in 43 countries and regions during 2000-16. Daily concentrations of wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> were estimated using the three-dimensional chemical transport model GEOS-Chem at a 0·25° × 0·25° resolution. The association between wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> exposure and mortality was examined using a quasi-Poisson time series model in each city considering both the current-day and lag effects, and the effect estimates were then pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Based on these pooled effect estimates, the population attributable fraction and relative risk (RR) of annual mortality due to acute wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> exposure was calculated. FINDINGS: 65·6 million all-cause deaths, 15·1 million cardiovascular deaths, and 6·8 million respiratory deaths were included in our analyses. The pooled RRs of mortality associated with each 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the 3-day moving average (lag 0-2 days) of wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> exposure were 1·019 (95% CI 1·016-1·022) for all-cause mortality, 1·017 (1·012-1·021) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1·019 (1·013-1·025) for respiratory mortality. Overall, 0·62% (95% CI 0·48-0·75) of all-cause deaths, 0·55% (0·43-0·67) of cardiovascular deaths, and 0·64% (0·50-0·78) of respiratory deaths were annually attributable to the acute impacts of wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> exposure during the study period.

STUDY DESIGN: Rapid review of articles published between January 2000 and May 2020. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (EBSCOhost), Health and Society Database (Informit) and Rural and Remote Health Database (Informit), and included studies undertaken in rural food environment settings in Australia and other countries. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, including five conducted in Australia. Four of the Australian studies were conducted in very remote populations and in grocery stores, and one was conducted in regional Australia. All of the overseas studies were conducted in rural North America. All of them revealed a positive influence on food environment or consumer behaviour, and all were conducted in disadvantaged, rural communities. Positive outcomes were consistently revealed by studies of initiatives that focused on promotion and awareness of healthy foods and included co-design to generate community ownership and branding. CONCLUSION: Initiatives aimed at improving rural food retail environments were effective and, when implemented in different rural settings, may encourage improvements in population diets. The paucity of studies over the past 20 years in Australia shows a need for more research into effective food retail environment initiatives, modelled on examples from overseas, with studies needed across all levels of remoteness in Australia. Several retail initiatives that were undertaken in rural North America could be replicated in rural Australia and could underpin future research. CHAPTER 2: WHICH INTERVENTIONS BEST SUPPORT THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING NEEDS OF RURAL POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING NATURAL DISASTERS?: Objective: To explore and evaluate health and social care interventions delivered to rural and remote communities experiencing natural disasters in Australia and other high income countries. STUDY DESIGN: We used systematic rapid review methods. First we identified a test set of citations and generated a frequency table of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to index articles. Then we used combinations of MeSH terms and keywords to search the MEDLINE (Ovid) database, and screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved references. DATA SOURCES: We identified 1438 articles via database searches, and a further 62 articles via hand searching of key journals and reference lists. We also found four relevant grey literature resources. After removing duplicates and undertaking two stages of screening, we included 28 studies in a synthesis of qualitative evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four of us read and assessed the full text articles. We then conducted a thematic analysis using the three phases of the natural disaster response cycle. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of robust evaluation of programs and interventions supporting the health and wellbeing of people in rural communities affected by natural disasters. To address the cumulative and long term impacts, evidence suggests that continuous support of people's health and wellbeing is needed. By using a lens of rural adversity, the complexity of the lived experience of natural disasters by rural residents can be better understood and can inform development of new models of community-based and integrated care services. CHAPTER 3: THE IMPACT OF BUSHFIRE ON THE WELLBEING OF CHILDREN LIVING IN RURAL AND REMOTE AUSTRALIA: Objective: To investigate the impact of bushfire events on the wellbeing of children living in rural and remote Australia. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review completed using rapid realist review methods, and taking into consideration the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement for systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: We sourced data from six databases: EBSCOhost (Education), EBSCOhost (Health), EBSCOhost (Psychology), Informit, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We developed search terms to identify articles that could address the research question based on the inclusion criteria of peer reviewed full text journal articles published in English between 1983 and 2020. We initially identified 60 studies and, following closer review, extracted data from eight studies that met the inclusion criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Children exposed to bushfires may be at increased risk of poorer wellbeing outcomes. Findings suggest that the impact of bushfire exposure may not be apparent in the short term but may become more pronounced later in life. Children particularly at risk are those from more vulnerable backgrounds who may have compounding factors that limit their ability to overcome bushfire trauma. CONCLUSION: We identified the short, medium and long term impacts of bushfire exposure on the wellbeing of children in Australia. We did not identify any evidence-based interventions for supporting outcomes for this population. Given the likely increase in bushfire events in Australia, research into effective interventions should be a priority. CHAPTER 4: THE ROLE OF NATIONAL POLICIES TO ADDRESS RURAL ALLIED HEALTH, NURSING AND DENTISTRY WORKFORCE MALDISTRIBUTION: Objective: Maldistribution of the health workforce between rural, remote and metropolitan communities contributes to longstanding health inequalities. Many developed countries have implemented policies to encourage health care professionals to work in rural and remote communities. This scoping review is an international synthesis of those policies, examining their effectiveness at recruiting and retaining nursing, dental and allied health professionals in rural communities. STUDY DESIGN: Using scoping review methods, we included primary research - published between 1 September 2009 and 30 June 2020 - that reported an evaluation of existing policy initiatives to address workforce maldistribution in high income countries with a land mass greater than 100 000 km<sup>2</sup> . DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Emcare, Informit, Scopus, and Web of Science. We screened 5169 articles for inclusion by title and abstract, of which we included 297 for full text screening. We then extracted data on 51 studies that had been conducted in Australia, the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Norway. DATA SYNTHESIS: We grouped the studies based on World Health Organization recommendations on recruitment and retention of health care workers: education strategies (n = 27), regulatory change (n = 11), financial incentives (n = 6), personal and professional support (n = 4), and approaches with multiple components (n = 3). CONCLUSION: Considerable work has occurred to address workforce maldistribution at a local level, underpinned by good practice guidelines, but rarely at scale or with explicit links to coherent overarching policy. To achieve policy aspirations, multiple synergistic evidence-based initiatives are needed, and implementation must be accompanied by well designed longitudinal evaluations that assess the effectiveness of policy objectives. CHAPTER 5: AVAILABILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HEALTH WORKFORCE DATA SOURCES IN AUSTRALIA: Objective: Many data sources are used in Australia to inform health workforce planning, but their characteristics in terms of relevance, accessibility and accuracy are uncertain. We aimed to identify and appraise publicly available data sources used to describe the Australian health workforce. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review in which we searched bibliographic databases, websites and grey literature. Two reviewers independently undertook title and abstract screening and full text screening using Covidence software. We then assessed the relevance, accessibility and accuracy of data sources using a customised appraisal tool. DATA SOURCES: We searched for potential workforce data sources in nine databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Informit, the JBI Evidence-based Practice Database, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library) and the grey literature, and examined several pre-defined websites. DATA SYNTHESIS: During the screening process we identified 6955 abstracts and examined 48 websites, from which we identified 12 publicly available data sources - eight primary and four secondary data sources. The primary data sources were generally of modest quality, with low scores in terms of reference period, accessibility and missing data. No single primary data source scored well across all domains of the appraisal tool. CONCLUSION: We identified several limitations of data sources used to describe the Australian health workforce. Establishment of a high quality, longitudinal, linked database that can inform all aspects of health workforce development is urgently needed, particularly for rural health workforce and services planning. CHAPTER 6: RAPID REALIST REVIEW OF OPIOID TAPERING IN THE CONTEXT OF LONG TERM OPIOID USE FOR NON-CANCER PAIN IN RURAL AREAS: Objective: To describe interventions, barriers and enablers associated with opioid tapering for patients with chronic non-cancer pain in rural primary care settings. STUDY DESIGN: Rapid realist review registered on the international register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) and conducted in accordance with RAMESES standards. DATA SOURCES: English language, peer-reviewed articles reporting qualitative, quantitative and mixed method studies, published between January 2016 and July 2020, and accessed via MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, Informit or the Cochrane Library during June and July 2020. Grey literature relating to prescribing, deprescribing or tapering of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain, published between January 2016 and July 2020, was identified by searching national and international government, health service and peek organisation websites using Google Scholar. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our analysis of reported approaches to tapering conducted across rural and non-rural contexts showed that tapering opioids is complex and challenging, and identified several barriers and enablers. Successful outcomes in rural areas appear likely through therapeutic relationships, coordination and support, by using modalities and models of care that are appropriate in rural settings and by paying attention to harm minimisation. CONCLUSION: Rural primary care providers do not have access to resources available in metropolitan centres for dealing with patients who have chronic non-cancer pain and are taking opioid medications. They often operate alone or in small group practices, without peer support and access to multidisciplinary and specialist teams. Opioid tapering approaches described in the literature include regulation, multimodal and multidisciplinary approaches, primary care provider support, guidelines, and patient-centred strategies. There is little research to inform tapering in rural contexts. Our review provides a synthesis of the current evidence in the form of a conceptual model. This preliminary model could inform the development of a model of care for use in implementation research, which could test a variety of mechanisms for supporting decision making, reducing primary care providers' concerns about potential harms arising from opioid tapering, and improving patient outcomes.","10.5694/mja2.50881","213","S11","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133473580","s3","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","s3","S11"

However, the coarse fraction (PM<sub>10-2.5</sub>) may have independent health impacts that support continued measurement of PM<sub>10</sub> in some areas, such as those affected by road dust. The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between different measures of daily PM exposure and two daily indicators of population health in seven communities in British Columbia, Canada, where road dust is an ongoing concern. The measures of exposure were PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10-2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> adjusted for PM<sub>10-2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10-2.5</sub> adjusted for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The indicators of population health were dispensations of the respiratory reliever medication salbutamol sulfate and nonaccidental mortality. This study followed a time-series design using Poisson regression over a 2003-2015 study period, with analyses stratified by three seasons: residential woodsmoke in winter; road dust in spring; and wildfire smoke in summer. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to establish a pooled estimate. Overall, an interquartile range increase in daily PM<sub>10-2.5</sub> was associated with a 3.6% [1.6, 5.6] increase in nonaccidental mortality during the road dust season, which was reduced to 3.1% [0.8, 5.4] after adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The adjusted coarse fraction had no effect on salbutamol dispensations in any season. However, an interquartile range increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with a 2.7% [2.0, 3.4] increase in dispensations during the wildfire season. These analyses suggest different impacts of different PM fractions by season, with a robust association between the coarse fraction and nonaccidental mortality in communities and periods affected by road dust. We recommend that PM<sub>10</sub> monitoring networks be maintained in these communities to provide feedback for future dust mitigation programs. IMPLICATIONS: There was a significant association between daily concentrations of the coarse fraction and nonaccidental mortality during the road dust season, even after adjustment for the fine fraction. The acute and chronic health effects associated with exposure to the coarse fraction remain unclear, which supports the maintenance of PM<sub>10</sub> monitoring networks to allow for further research in communities affected by sources such as road dust.","10.1080/10962247.2017.1315348","67","9","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085457104","986","10962247","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10962247","986","9"

Previous risk assessments have examined the health response to total PM<sub>2.5</sub>, not just PM<sub>2.5</sub> from fossil fuel combustion, and have used a concentration-response function with limited support from the literature and data at both high and low concentrations. This assessment examines mortality associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> from only fossil fuel combustion, making use of a recent meta-analysis of newer studies with a wider range of exposure. We also estimated mortality due to lower respiratory infections (LRI) among children under the age of five in the Americas and Europe, regions for which we have reliable data on the relative risk of this health outcome from PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure. We used the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to estimate global exposure levels to fossil-fuel related PM<sub>2.5</sub> in 2012. Relative risks of mortality were modeled using functions that link long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and mortality, incorporating nonlinearity in the concentration response. We estimate a global total of 10.2 (95% CI: -47.1 to 17.0) million premature deaths annually attributable to the fossil-fuel component of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The greatest mortality impact is estimated over regions with substantial fossil fuel related PM<sub>2.5</sub>, notably China (3.9 million), India (2.5 million) and parts of eastern US, Europe and Southeast Asia. The estimate for China predates substantial decline in fossil fuel emissions and decreases to 2.4 million premature deaths due to 43.7% reduction in fossil fuel PM<sub>2.5</sub> from 2012 to 2018 bringing the global total to 8.7 (95% CI: -1.8 to 14.0) million premature deaths. We also estimated excess annual deaths due to LRI in children (0-4 years old) of 876 in North America, 747 in South America, and 605 in Europe. This study demonstrates that the fossil fuel component of PM<sub>2.5</sub> contributes a large mortality burden. The steeper concentration-response function slope at lower concentrations leads to larger estimates than previously found in Europe and North America, and the slower drop-off in slope at higher concentrations results in larger estimates in Asia. Fossil fuel combustion can be more readily controlled than other sources and precursors of PM<sub>2.5</sub> such as dust or wildfire smoke, so this is a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders to further incentivize a shift to clean sources of energy.","10.1016/j.envres.2021.110754","195","ei2, 0147621","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135303310","110754","00139351","053-816-003-969-066","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00139351","110754","ei2, 0147621"

Numerous studies have proven the validity of the socioecological system (SES) approach in addressing this kind of interdisciplinary issue. Therefore, a systematic review of the existing literature on the application of SES frameworks to forest ecosystems is carried out, with a specific focus on wildfire risk management.

The strengths and limitations of the approaches are discussed, with a specific reference to the geographical setting of the works.

OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to characterize excess mortality and morbidity events, and the economic value of these impacts, from wildland fire smoke exposure in the U.S. over a multi-year period; to date no other burden assessment has done this. METHODS: We first completed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature and then performed photochemical air quality modeling for the years 2008 to 2012 in the continental U.S. Finally, we estimated the morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of wildland fires. RESULTS: Our models suggest that areas including northern California, Oregon and Idaho in the West, and Florida, Louisiana and Georgia in the East were most affected by wildland fire events in the form of additional premature deaths and respiratory hospital admissions. We estimated the economic value of these cases due to short term exposures as being between $11 and $20B (2010$) per year, with a net present value of $63B (95% confidence intervals $6-$170); we estimate the value of long-term exposures as being between $76 and $130B (2010$) per year, with a net present value of $450B (95% confidence intervals $42-$1200).

Wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes; however, the magnitude of these associations in the Brazilian context is unclear. We aimed to estimate the association between daily exposure to wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> and cause-specific hospital admission and attributable health burden in the Brazilian population using a nationwide dataset from 2000 to 2015. METHODS: In this nationwide time-series analysis, data for daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospital admissions were collected through the Brazilian Unified Health System from 1814 municipalities in Brazil between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2015. Daily concentrations of wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> were estimated using the 3D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem at a 2·0° latitude by 2·5° longitude resolution. A time-series analysis was fitted using quasi-Poisson regression to quantify municipality-specific effect estimates, which were then pooled at the regional and national levels using random-effects meta-analyses. Analyses were stratified by sex and ten age groups. The attributable fraction and attributable cases of hospital admissions due to wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> were also calculated. FINDINGS: At the national level, a 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> was associated with a 1·65% (95% CI 1·51-1·80) increase in all-cause hospital admissions, a 5·09% (4·73-5·44) increase in respiratory hospital admissions, and a 1·10% (0·78-1·42) increase in cardiovascular hospital admissions, over 0-1 days after the exposure. The effect estimates for all-cause hospital admission did not vary by sex, but were particularly high in children aged 4 years or younger (4·88% [95% CI 4·47-5·28]), children aged 5-9 years (2·33% [1·77-2·90]), and people aged 80 years and older (3·70% [3·20-4·20]) compared with other age groups. We estimated that 0·53% (95% CI 0·48-0·58) of all-cause hospital admissions were attributable to wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub>, corresponding to 35 cases (95% CI 32-38) per 100 000 residents annually. The attributable rate was greatest for municipalities in the north, south, and central-west regions, and lowest in the northeast region. Results were consistent for all-cause and respiratory diseases across regions, but remained inconsistent for cardiovascular diseases. INTERPRETATION: Short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM<sub>2·5</sub> was associated with increased risks of all-cause, respiratory, and cardiovascular hospital admissions, particularly among children (0-9 years) and older people (≥80 years). Greater attention should be paid to reducing exposure to wildfire smoke, particularly for the most susceptible populations.

Although end-of-life and palliative care are considered essential components of disaster planning and response, there are gaps in understandings about their real-life application, and how natural disasters impact end-of-life care. OBJECTIVE: To synthesise existing evidence of the impacts of natural disasters (eg, bushfires, communicable pandemics, etc) on end-of-life care. METHODS: A systematic review with a narrative synthesis was undertaken. The review was registered on PROSPERO (registration: CRD42020176319). PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for studies published in English between 2003 and 2020, with findings explicitly mentioning end-of-life care impacts in relation to a natural disaster. Articles were appraised for quality using a JBI-QARI tool. RESULTS: Thirty-six empirical studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment. Findings were synthesised into three key themes: impacts on service provision, impacts on service providers and impacts on service users. This review demonstrates that natural disasters impact profoundly on end-of-life care, representing a stark departure from a palliative care approach. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practitioners, policy makers and researchers must continue to collaborate for viable solutions to achieve universal access to compassionate and respectful end-of-life care, during natural disasters. Using models, policies and practices already developed in palliative care, involving those most impacted in disaster planning and anticipating barriers, such as resource shortages, enables development of end-of-life care policies and practices that can be rapidly implemented during natural disasters.","10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-002973","13","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136478866","1","20454368 and 2045435x","053-489-065-760-502","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","20454368 and 2045435x","1","1"

The associations between exposure of older adults to weather- and climate-related disasters and the primary outcomes of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were examined. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review of studies reporting on clinical outcomes of four chronic diseases after disaster exposure was performed. Under the direction of an informationist, the databases PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science (Science and Social Science Citation Index) were searched from inception to July 2019. RESULTS: Of 5,229 citations identified, 17 articles met the study criteria. Included articles were retrospective observational in nature and focused on earthquakes (24%, n = 4), hurricane (41%, n = 7), and wildfire (35%, n = 6) disasters. Outcome data by disease process included COPD (35%, n = 6), ESRD (41%, n = 7), CHF (24%, n = 4), and diabetes (29%, n = 5). Three main categories were identified: access to health care, postdisaster health care utilization, and study rigor. The age-stratified analyses reported in this review found multiple instances where disasters have limited or insignificant effects on older adults relative to younger populations. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Disaster research faces unique methodological challenges, and there remains a need for data-driven conclusions on how best to care for older adults before, during, and after disasters. To encourage consistent dialogue among studies, we advocate for the use of rigorous and standardized scientific methodology to examine the health impacts of disasters on adults with chronic disease.","10.1093/geront/gnz123","60","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120167041","e535","17585341 and 00169013","018-300-391-209-205","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","17585341 and 00169013","e535","7"

Systematic reviews conclude that a positive association exists between exposure to wildfire smoke or wildfire particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and all-cause mortality and respiratory morbidity. Respiratory morbidity includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis and pneumonia. The epidemiological data linking wildfire smoke exposure to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity is mixed, and inconclusive. More studies are needed to define the risk for common and costly clinical cardiovascular outcomes. Susceptible populations include people with respiratory and possibly cardiovascular diseases, middle-aged and older adults, children, pregnant women and the fetus. The increasing frequency of large wildland fires, the expansion of the wildland-urban interface, the area between unoccupied land and human development; and an increasing and aging U.S. population are increasing the number of people at-risk from wildfire smoke, thus highlighting the necessity for broadening stakeholder cooperation to address the health effects of wildfire. While much is known, many questions remain and require further population-based, clinical and occupational health research. Health effects measured over much wider geographical areas and for longer periods time will better define the risk for adverse health outcomes, identify the sensitive populations and assess the influence of social factors on the relationship between exposure and health outcomes. Improving exposure models and access to large clinical databases foreshadow improved risk analysis facilitating more effective risk management. Fuel and smoke management remains an important component for protecting population health. Improved smoke forecasting and translation of environmental health science into communication of actionable information for use by public health officials, healthcare professionals and the public is needed to motivate behaviors that lower exposure and protect public health, particularly among those at high risk.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.086","624","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100077395","586","18791026 and 00489697","043-205-620-415-32X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","18791026 and 00489697","586",""

As a result, those responsible for managing wildland fires face increasing pressure to address this challenge strategically. Over the past 20 years, these managers have turned to decision support tools (DSTs) to help guide their actions. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore the landscape of decision support tools (DSTs) for wildfire management, focusing on their functionalities. We additionally examined potential gaps in their design and implementation. The systematic review led us to group decision support tools into categories for all DSTs, such as, Fire Behavior Models or Post Fire Models. These categories are not discrete and can be nested to address land management and fire response questions. Moreover, our findings highlighted a significant gap in tools that effectively integrate ease of use with collaborative capabilities, underscoring the urgency for developing more user-friendly and collaborative decision-making tools. Our research also revealed a disconnect between the academic literature's focus and the tools' actual field usage, emphasizing the need for more accurate documentation and a streamlined approach to wildfire management tool selection. We proposed further social science research to understand the real-world use and preferences of DSTs, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical robustness and practical utility.

In response, we reviewed scientific literature for the US West and completed a meta-analysis that answered three questions: (1) How much do treatments reduce wildfire severity within treated areas? (2) How do the effects vary with treatment type, treatment age, and forest type? (3) How does fire weather moderate the effects of treatments? We found overwhelming evidence that mechanical thinning with prescribed burning, mechanical thinning with pile burning, and prescribed burning only are effective at reducing subsequent wildfire severity, resulting in reductions in severity between 62% and 72% relative to untreated areas. In comparison, thinning only was less effective – underscoring the importance of treating surface fuels when mitigating wildfire severity is the management goal. The efficacy of these treatments did not vary among forest types assessed in this study and was high across a range of fire weather conditions. Prior wildfire had more complex impacts on subsequent wildfire severity, which varied with forest type and initial wildfire severity. Across treatment types, we found that effectiveness of treatments declined over time, with the mean reduction in wildfire severity decreasing more than twofold when wildfire occurred greater than 10 years after initial treatment.

Hyperspectral remote sensing has emerged as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring forest fire breakouts due to its ability to capture detailed spectral information across a wide range of wavelengths. However, despite its potential, several challenges hinder its widespread application in this domain. Challenges include the complexity of spectral data analysis, limited spatial resolution, and the need for robust algorithms for fire detection and monitoring. Existing works in hyperspectral remote sensing of forest fires have made strides in addressing these challenges but are often limited in scope or lack comprehensive analyses. Thus, there is a pressing need for a systematic review that consolidates existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and proposes avenues for future research. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of hyperspectral remote sensing techniques for forest fire breakout detection and monitoring.

A mini-review","2016","Applied Soil Ecology","Climate change, unpredictable dry spells and human population growth are expected to increase the frequency of forest fires. Forest fires induce damage on soil ecosystems and seriously compromise their functionality and provision of ecosystem services. They reduce diversity in many soil organism groups, although they also support flora and fauna dependent on fires. Fires disrupt in the cycling of nutrients, and have been argued to threaten the sustainability of forest biomes. However, despite these potentially large effects on soil ecosystems, a literature survey on the forest fire effects on soil fauna demonstrated that the number of publications on this topic between 1979 and 2013 has been surprisingly low compared with studies of other kinds of disturbances. A poll conducted among soil ecologists who actually studied forest fires revealed that more than 50% of the findings about fire effects on soil ecosystems are unlikely to ever be published. The aim of this review was to discover and structure the reasons why forest fires are often neglected by soil zoologists and ecologists and to identify the major problems which deter soil zoologists from this area of research and from publishing obtained results. We show that forest fires are harder to study than many other types of disturbances. Fires are largely unpredictable and are often unique, which makes it difficult to apply statistically robust sampling plans and select proper controls. Spatial heterogeneity of fire intensity and soil fauna distribution complicate the resulting picture. Moreover, high variability of soil biota in time and space, and complicating effects of multiple fires make the results of such studies hard to interpret. We propose several approaches, which may help to document biodiversity and functional changes in soil communities affected by fire more effectively. These include prescribed burnings, indoor and outdoor experiments and meta-analyses of large datasets, including unpublished ones. We further justify the need for closer coordination of researchers to solve the “file drawer problem” for the unpublished data on soil biota shifts in response to forest fires.","10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.10.012","98","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010455266","261","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","261",""

While decision support systems help decision-makers, it is clear that some deficiencies still persist. In this context, it is thought that the active role of local people involved in wildfire management can eliminate these deficiencies because they have experience and direct knowledge about fighting wildfires in Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) areas. Hence, their expertise can be utilized in future wildfire containment efforts. In this study, the author presents some general information about WUI, public participation, and the decision-making process and its relation to wildfires. In addition, the author will also examine previous studies on the participation of local people in wildfire management and investigate the decision-making processes regarding this issue by using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. The results of this study suggest that there should be a widespread adoption of the community-based integrated fire management (CBIFM) approach, instead of the top-down management approach commonly employed in wildfire management. The results strongly suggest that decision-makers should reach a consensus as to how the principle of participation in fire management should work by reviewing the socio-economic interests of the local community.

Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), with co-occurring species, are adapted to a disturbance regime of frequent surface fires, but extended fire exclusion and other factors have led to historically uncharacteristically dense stands and high fuel loadings, supporting high-severity fires. Treatments to begin to reverse these changes and reduce fuel hazards have been tested experimentally and observations of wildfire behavior in treated stands have also been reported. Using a systematic review methodology, we found 54 studies with quantitative data suitable for meta-analysis. Combined treatments (thinning+burning) tended to have the greatest effect on reducing surface fuels and stand density, and raising modeled crowning and torching indices, as compared to burning or thinning alone. However, changes in canopy base height and canopy bulk density were not consistently related to treatment intensity, as measured by basal area reduction. There are a number of qualifications to the findings. First, because it is not feasible to subject treated areas to severe fire experimentally, inferences about potential fire behavior rely on imperfect modeling techniques. Second, research has not been carried uniformly over the ranges of the pine forests, although we found no significant differences in treatment effects between regions or forest types. Overall, however, meta-analysis of the literature to date strongly indicates that thinning and/or burning treatments do have effects consistent with the restoration of low-severity fire behavior.","10.1016/j.foreco.2011.12.025","269","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009767845","68","03781127","052-036-622-399-978","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","68",""

Air pollution is usually the direct or indirect consequence of burning fuel for transport, industry, or domestic use, but may also come from other sources such as forest fires or volcanic eruptions. Episodes of pollution from the burning of fuel tend to occur not because of an increase in emissions, but because stagnant weather conditions impair their dispersal. In the developed world, episodes that occurred in the postwar decades are unlikely to be repeated, but there remains the risk of less severe episodes and of other disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruption. Episodes give information about the effects of pollution mixtures in different contexts. Unfortunately, this heterogeneity has not been successfully exploited for identifying the most harmful constituents of pollution or for investigating exposure-response relationships. The epidemiological principles of investigating episodes are straightforward, but in practice, there are many difficulties and assumptions that make comparison of different studies or meta-analysis very difficult.","10.1016/b978-012352335-8/50096-x","","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030133038","461","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","461",""

Due to invasion of many ecosystems by exotic species, a concern of land managers is whether wildfire and prescribed fire alter plant communities in favour of exotics. We assessed the global literature describing community‐level responses of native and exotic species groups to wildfire and prescribed fire and characterized the geographic and temporal scope of the data to inform research needs. Location Predominantly the United States of America and Australia. Methods We used meta‐analysis to (1) test whether native and exotic species composition (richness or diversity) and performance (cover, density and biomass) differ in response to wildfire and prescribed fire, and (2) assess how the composition and performance of these species groups vary with time elapsed since fire and habitat types. Results Most community‐level research on how native and exotic species respond to fire has been conducted in the US and Australia, typically over short time scales, and with a focus on temperate forest and grassland ecosystems. Prescribed fire benefited native composition over short time scales (<1 yr) but, on average, had no effect on native performance, nor on exotic composition or performance. In contrast, wildfire consistently enhanced exotic composition and performance over all time scales, while having no effect on native species composition and significantly reducing native performance. Additionally, responses varied by habitat: native species groups responded positively to prescribed fire in heathlands and to a lesser extent in temperate grasslands, while responding negatively to wildfire in arid shrublands and heathlands, and to a more modest degree in tropical savannas. Exotic species groups responded positively to wildfire in arid shrublands, temperate forests and heathlands. Conclusions This quantitative assessment of the literature revealed strong evidence for a positive response of exotics to wildfire, coupled with a striking near‐absence of negative responses. The assessment additionally suggests that while prescribed fire does benefit native composition, on average , it does not appear to greatly facilitate native performance; however site‐specific variation in how communities responded to fire was pronounced, underscoring the importance of local assessments in determining mechanistic drivers and management policy.","10.1111/jvs.12212","26","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026713048","102","11009233 and 16541103","047-672-841-567-712","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","11009233 and 16541103","102","1"

To evaluate and compare their impact on small mammals, I conducted meta-analyses on (1) the effect of stand-replacement wildfires and several types of forest harvest (clearcutting followed by burning, clearcutting, and uniform partial harvest) on the abundance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi), (2) the impact of clearcutting and partial harvest on a broader array of small mammal species, and (3) the responses of small mammals to recent and older clearcuts (i.e. less than 10 years vs. 10–20 years after harvest). In coniferous and mixed forest, all disturbances except for partial harvest triggered significant increases in the abundance of deer mice and declines in red-backed voles. The increase in deer mice after wildfire was stronger than after clearcutting and marginally stronger than after clearcutting and burning. The abundance of red-backed voles was greatest in undisturbed or partially harvested stands, intermediate after clearcutting, and lowest after wildfire or clearcutting and burning. While the positive effect of clearcutting on deer mice did not persist beyond 10 years after disturbance, the negative effect on red-backed voles was similar between recent and older clearcuts. In deciduous forest, clearcutting did not result in a consistent change in abundance of deer mice and red-backed voles. For other small mammals, recent clearcutting tended to increase the abundance of yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), and meadow and long-tailed voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus and Microtus longicaudus). Woodland jumping mouse (Neozapus insignis), masked shrew (Sorex cinereus), and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) did not show consistent response to timber harvest. Overall, the impact of different disturbances on the abundance of small mammals (i.e. positive or negative) appears to be species-specific, but disturbance type may influence the magnitude of this effect. Disturbance types can be ranked from severe to mild in terms of small mammal responses. The effects of forest harvest on small mammals are not equivalent to those of wildfire.","10.1016/j.foreco.2009.05.033","258","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042770937","539","03781127","113-351-550-729-026","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","539","5"

A Systematic Review","2023","Fire","Fire suppression has become a fundamental approach for shaping contemporary wildfire regimes. However, a growing body of research suggests that aggressive fire suppression can increase high-intensity wildfires, creating the wildfire paradox. Whether the strategy always triggers the paradox remains a topic of ongoing debate. The role of fire suppression in altering wildfire regimes in diverse socio-ecological systems and associated research designs demands a deeper understanding. To reconcile these controversies and synthesize the existing knowledge, a systematic review has been conducted to screen 974 studies on the relationship between fire suppression and wildfire regimes. The rigorous screening process led to the selection of 37 studies that met our stringent criteria for inclusion. The selected literature was quantitatively analyzed in terms of study areas, study design and methods, and the impact of fire suppression on wildfire regimes. Several critical findings were revealed: 1. Numerous studies have focused on northern mid- and high-latitude biomes, neglecting tropical savannas where wildfires are frequent and intense. Further exploration in these regions is imperative. 2. Existing studies have predominantly employed methods such as difference analysis, regression analysis, and scenario simulations. Appropriate methods could be selected based on the study area, data availability, and understanding of fire regimes. 3. Despite the consensus that fire suppression reduces the total burned area, the emergence of the wildfire paradox remains controversial, with approximately equal amounts of the literature supporting and contradicting the wildfire paradox. A noteworthy pattern was observed: the wildfire paradox is more likely to occur in fuel-limited systems, specific vegetation types, and smaller scale and longer term studies. This systematic review highlights that the occurrence of the wildfire paradox is intricately tied to ecosystem feedback mechanisms for suppression and the research scale adopted. It is necessary to incorporate a comprehensive and multi-scale assessment of how local wildlands respond to suppression into wildfire management policy-making processes. This assessment will ensure a more informed and effective wildfire management strategy adapted to local conditions.","10.3390/fire6110424","6","11","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165729829","424","25716255","148-330-558-513-534","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","25716255","424","11"

Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected.","10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.024","144","2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051645393","683","00063207","054-512-600-971-213","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00063207","683","2"

Focusing on both the preparedness and mitigation phase results in eleven articles from two literature databases. A qualitative analysis for in-depth information extraction reveals auspicious approaches regarding community engagement and data fusion, but also important research gaps. Mainly based in Europe and North America, the analysed studies deal primarily with floods and forest fires, applying geodata collected by trained citizens who are improving their knowledge and making their own interpretations. Yet, there is still a lack of common scientific terms and concepts. Future research can use these findings for the adaptation of scientific models of natural hazard analysis in order to enable the fusion of data from technical sensors and VGI. The development of such general methods shall contribute to establishing the user integration into various contexts, such as natural hazard analysis.","10.3390/ijgi5070103","5","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051432258","103","22209964","069-917-247-291-742","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","22209964","103","7"

There is overwhelming evidence that country commitments expressed in National Determined Contributions (NDCs) can contribute to stabilising or reversing the course of impacts of climate change. With the multiplicity of NDC measures, compounded by their complexities and limited resources, multi-criteria decision-making tools can be used in making informed decisions about their development. Furthermore, while many countries are blessed with an abundance of sustainable resources and technologies to feed into NDCs, a major challenge is prioritising them as part of the national and global climate change mitigation and adaptation agenda. Many multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and tools have been developed over the years. However, their implementation in practice for prioritising NDC measures is still not well-known despite their high acceptance in academic literature. This study adopts a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature from the Web of Science and grey literature from the recently launched Technology Needs Assessment database to fully understand the MCDM tools used in evaluating NDC projects from academic versus practice perspectives. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method adopted, culminated in the identification of 464 peer-reviewed journal articles and 50 TNA reports used in the analysis.

Here we present a meta-analysis of the impacts of climate fluctuation and Euro-Canadian settlement on burned areas from 1850 to 1990 in a large zone (>100 000 km2) in northern temperate and boreal forests of eastern Canada. Using Cox regression models, we tested for potential statistical relationships between historical burned areas in 12 large landscapes (reconstructed with dendrochronological data) with climate reconstructions, changes in the Euro-Canadian population, and active suppression (all reconstructed at the decadal scale). Our results revealed a dominant impact of climate fluctuations on forest burned areas, with the driest decades showing fire hazards between 5 to 15 times higher than the average decades. Comparatively, the Euro-Canadian settlement had a much weaker effect, having increased burned areas significantly only during less fire-prone climate conditions. During periods of fire-prone climate, burned areas were maximum independent of fluctuations in Euro-Canadian populations. Moreover, the development of active fire suppression did not appear to reduce burned areas. These results suggest that a potential increase in climate moisture deficit and drought may trigger unprecedented burned areas and extreme fire events no matter the effects of anthropogenic ignition or suppression.","10.1088/1748-9326/ac2ce7","16","11","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141670949","114007","1748-9326","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1748-9326","114007","11"

Therefore, a global meta-analysis of 371 cases from 81 published studies was conducted to explore the comprehensive effects of fires on soil microbial properties. The results show that fires significantly increased microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2), by 19.45% on average, and decreased soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 8.41% and fungal biomass by 27.17%. Moreover, the response of these microbial indices to fires intensified with increasing fire intensity. In addition, ecosystem types and climate zones have an impact on the response of MBC and qCO2 to fires. Among them, MBC and qCO2 in coniferous forests and continental climate zones are the most sensitive to fires. A correlation analysis displayed that the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to fires was significantly and positively correlated with the response of MBC but negatively correlated with the response of qCO2. Furthermore, fires reduced SOC in the short term, but had no significant impact in the long term.

We conducted a systematic review focusing on the short-term relationships between PM attributable to wildfires (wildfire-specific PM) and diverse respiratory endpoints, with a comparison between the effects of wildfire-specific PM vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM. Methods A comprehensive online search for the literature published from 2000 to 2022 was conducted through PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and EMBASE. We applied search terms related to wildfire smoke and respiratory health outcomes. Results In total, 3196 articles were retrieved, and 35 articles were included in this review. Most studies focused on the associations of wildfire-specific PM with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) with respiratory emergency department visits or hospitalizations, with a time-series or case-crossover study design. Studies were mostly conducted in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Positive associations of wildfire-specific PM with respiratory morbidity were observed in most studies. Studies that focused on respiratory mortality were limited. Females can be more vulnerable to the respiratory impacts of wildfire PM, while the evidence of vulnerable subpopulations among different age groups was inconclusive. Few studies compared the effects of wildfire-specific vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM, and some reported higher levels of toxicity of wildfire-specific PM, potentially due to its distinct chemical and physical compositions. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most studied diseases, and both were adversely affected by wildfire-specific PM. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first review that systematically summarized the associations of wildfire-specific PM exposure with adverse respiratory outcomes and compared associations of wildfire-specific vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM. Further investigations may add to the literature by examining the impacts on respiratory mortality and the effects of specific PM components from different types of wildfires.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168134","907","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165331563","168134","00489697","003-112-273-648-079","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00489697","168134",""

Applied research was conducted to explore the connections between forest and climate change policy and opportunities to integrate the international development agenda into sustainable forest management.","10.1007/978-981-16-6421-2_12","","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145945912","179","21977348 and 21977356","050-080-220-255-192","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","21977348 and 21977356","179",""

This is a worrying scenario, as the Amazon Rainforest plays an important role in regional and global climate regulation. This study therefore sought to identify the methodologies used to describe and predict fire events in the Brazilian Amazon. For this, a systematic literature review was carried out in the open access databases Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) using the descriptors “fire risk” and “Amazon”, and their variants in the Portuguese language and the logical operator “AND” in the search. From the resulting search materia we identified the use of predictive models based on projections for climate change developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which indicate a substantial increase in the probability of fires. Another technique used is the crossing of heat foci data with the forms of land use, evidencing the areas that burn the most and when, as well as the most susceptible areas. There were also studies analyzing the performance of fire risk indexes, demonstrating those that could be used after adaptations to local characteristics. These results allow an understanding of the behavior of fire in the Amazon, since they provide a broad view of how studies on fires have been conducted and what techniques have been used.","10.4136/ambi-agua.2706","16","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138718457","1","1980993x","052-550-746-847-48X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1980993x","1","3"

Terrorist activities have negatively affected the biodiversity management in West Africa Sahel. However, there is a paucity of information about the impacts of terrorist activities on biodiversity management in West Africa. Therefore, this study tries to close this knowledge gap by describing and highlighting the impact of terrorism on biodiversity in West Africa Sahel.

The authors also consulted videos and media reports on YouTube, France24, PBS news etc. The study highlighted the key impacts of terrorist activities on biodiversity management. Some of these include the kidnaping of foresters, hijacking and controlling the management protected area like the case of Park W, destroying forest/bush fires, the use of explosive and poaching. These activities destroy animals’ habitats and therefore causing biodiversity depletion. The authors recommend the enhancement of the framework of protect areas, enhance the management of conflicts between population around protected areas as some sustainable solutions to biodiversity management.

While disaster risk management (DRM) is a serious global challenge, governments, stakeholders, and practitioners among many other actors seek advanced solutions to reduce disaster-related costs. Recently, Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud platform used for planetary-scale geospatial analysis using big-data, has gained popularity due to its applications in various fields. While the availability of free satellite data has facilitated long-term spatial-temporal trends and patterns identification, cloud computing emerged as a reputable tool in geo-big data analyses. Yet nearly after ∼15 years of its launch, the impact of such cloud-computing platform on DRM (risk assessment, monitoring, and planning) has not been carefully explored. Hence, a systematic review regarding the current state and trends in GEE applications to DRM is needed, which could provide the community with the bigger picture of the subject matter. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the advancement in DRM with GEE being the primary platform used. For this, 547 peer-reviewed studies published in 208 different journals during 2010–2022 were assessed. The current spectrum of GEE applications is dominated by floods, drought, and wildfires. For data type, most of the studies used optical data (Landsat and Sentinel-2). In terms of geographical distribution, China, USA, and India dominate with highest articles published. Within this research domain, three emerging research themes (floods, forest fire, and classification) are observed. Our findings signify the emergence of GEE applications in DRM, which will continue making substantive progress on DRM-related multi-scale challenges.","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.104056","97","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164915180","104056","22124209","165-320-271-209-575","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","22124209","104056",""

However, no consensus has yet emerged regarding the effects of fire disturbances on tropical biogeochemical cycles. Location Tropics. Time period 1960–2018. Major taxa studied Tropical ecosystems: Above‐ and below‐ground carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. Methods We analysed the impacts of fire on C and N dynamics in tropical ecosystems through a meta‐analysis of 1,420 observations from 87 studies. Results Fire reduced both above‐ and below‐ground C and N pools, with greater reductions above‐ than below‐ground. Fire decreased soil total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate nitrogen ( ) and increased ammonium nitrogen ( ) in surface mineral soil layers but did not affect those in deep layers. Fire decreased TC and TN in savanna but did not affect those in tropical dry and moist forests. Fire did not affect and in savanna because of non‐significant responses of N mineralization rate (N min ) to fire. Conversely, fire increased and decreased in tropical dry forest, but did not affect and increased in tropical moist forest owing to thermal decomposition of soil organic N and increased soil nitrification, respectively. Moreover, declined and increased initially and then decreased with time after fire. Above‐ and below‐ground response variables to prescribed fire were mediated largely by fire frequency and experimental duration, respectively. Main conclusions Our results suggest a high vulnerability of the above‐ground C and N pools to fire, whereas the biogeochemical cycles below‐ground are of high complexity. Fire effects on below‐ground C and N pools, which are highly uncertain and vegetation specific, should be investigated further.","10.1111/geb.13422","31","2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142544384","378","1466822x and 14668238","034-710-830-855-05X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1466822x and 14668238","378","2"

In many regions of the boreal zone, remaining patches of old-growth forests left following logging are restricted to small areas exposed to edge effects. Our objectives were to evaluate, from a literature review, the distance of edge influence (DEI) induced by sharp logginginduced edges on adjacent old-growth residual forests and to compare, in order to exemplify edge effect influence, two contrasting scenarios of residual stand configurations (linear vs. agglomerated). Synthesis from studies conducted in boreal forests of Canada and Fennoscandia indicates a DEI of 50 meters for residual old-growth forests located along recently ( 20 years) cutover areas. Based on the comparison of two contrasted scenarios, we demonstrate the strong relationship between residual forest configuration and area under edge influence. For a similar area of residual old-growth forest, linear strips scenario was > 2.5 times more affected by edge compared to agglomerated scenario. We thus recommend considering various types of dispersion strategies that result in large forest residual stands interconnected with remnants > 100 m wide in order to reduce edge influence on the remnant old-growth stands, to mimic forest fire patterns, and to conserve associated biodiversity. To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis to review and assess the DEI in boreal forest of North America and Fennoscandia.

Ensuring food security against climate risks has been a growing challenge recently. Weather index insurance has been pointed out as a tool for increasing the financial resilience of food production. However, the multi-hazard insurance design needs to be better understood. This paper aims to review weather index insurance design for food security resilience, including the methodology for calculating natural hazards' indices, vulnerability assessment, and risk pricing. We searched for relevant research papers in the Scopus database using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. Initially, 364 peer-reviewed papers from 1 January 2010 to 19 February 2022 were screened for bibliometric analysis. Then, the 26 most relevant papers from the last 5 years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a significant research effort on index insurance, most papers focused on food production. However, research considering other aspects of food security, such as transportation, storage, and distribution, is lacking. Most research focuses on droughts. Other hazards, such as extreme temperature variation, excessive rainfall, and wildfires, were poorly covered. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards, neglecting the synergy hypothesis between hazards. Lastly, we proposed a conceptual framework that illustrates design paths for a generalized weather index insurance design and evaluation. Solutions for addressing multi-hazard problems are considered. An illustrative example demonstrates the importance of testing the multi-hazard risk hypothesis for weather-based index insurance design for soybean production in Brazil.","10.5194/nhess-23-1335-2023","23","4","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157095069","1335","16849981 and 15618633","075-394-931-559-597","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","16849981 and 15618633","1335","4"

A large body of local‐scale research has shown that such intensified fire regimes can greatly impact on ecosystem structure and function through altering plant communities. Here, we aim to find general patterns of plant responses to intensified fire regimes across climates, habitats and fire regimes at the global scale. Location Worldwide. Time period Studies published 1962–2023. Major taxa studied Woody plants, herbs and bryophytes. Methods We carried out a global systematic review and meta‐analysis of the response of plant abundance, diversity and fitness to increased fire frequency or severity. To assess the context dependency of those responses, we tested the effect of the following variables: fire regime component (fire frequency or severity), time since the last fire, fire type (wildfire or prescribed fire), historical fire regime type (surface or crown fire), plant life form (woody plant, herb or bryophyte), habitat type and climate. Results Intensified fire regimes reduced overall plant abundance (Hedges' d = −0.24), diversity ( d = −0.27), and fitness ( d = −0.69). Generally, adverse effects of intensified fire regimes on plants were stronger due to increased severity than frequency, in wildfires compared to prescribed fires, and at shorter times since fire. Adverse effects were also stronger for woody plants than for herbs, and in conifer and mixed forests than in open ecosystems (e.g. grasslands and shrublands). Main conclusions Intensified fire regimes can substantially alter plant communities in many ecosystems worldwide. Plant responses are influenced by the specific fire regime component that is changing and by the biotic and abiotic conditions.","10.1111/geb.13858","33","8","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171680532","1","1466822X","025-816-073-367-444","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1466822X","1","8"

Scientific understanding of the composition, chemistry and regional dynamics of biomass burning (BB) emissions is still limited, thus constraining the implementation of appropriate research and policy interventions. The broad categories, associated complex emissions and spatio-temporal variations of ABB in India are discussed here. Major types of ABB that are prevalent year-round all over India include BB for cooking, heating purposes and open waste burning. Moreover, crop residue burning (CRB) in the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) during pre- (April–May) and post-monsoon (October–November) seasons, CRB in South India during January–February, forest fires in Central India and slash-and-burn agriculture in Northeast India during March–May are the other dominant sources that are active during specific months and in specific regions. Over the IGP, CRB along with other episodic ABB events and stagnant meteorology result in severe air quality and poor visibility (<∼300 m) with reported daily mean PM2.5 concentrations shooting up to 15 times higher than Central Pollution Control Board standards. When compared with wheat residue burning, higher fire counts and emissions are reported during paddy residue burning events. During winters, BB’s contribution to 37% of the aerosol oxidative potential in Delhi indicates its health implications.

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) can contribute to stabilising or reversing the course of impacts of climate change. With the multiplicity of NDC measures, compounded by their complexities and limited resources, multi-criteria decision-making tools can be used in making informed decisions about their development. Furthermore, while many countries are blessed with abundance of sustainable resources and technologies that can feed into NDCs, a major challenge is how to prioritize them as part of the national and global climate change mitigation and adaptation agenda. While, many multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools have been developed over the years, their implementation in practice is still not well-known despite their high recommendations in academic literature. This study adopts a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature from the Web of Science and grey literature from the recently launched Technology Needs Assessment database to gain a full-understanding of MCDM tools being used in evaluating NDC projects from the academic versus practice perspectives.

A meta‐analysis with implications for restoration and management","2017","Freshwater Biology","Summary There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to explore how trout (specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer‐reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta‐analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species‐specific trout responses to eight key ‘drivers’ of change in riparian condition. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control‐impact designs. We found little evidence for species‐specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population‐ or individual‐level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (−67.4 and −88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the ‘production versus attraction’ hypothesis would be beneficial. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long‐term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones – particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management – are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less‐studied freshwater fish species.","10.1111/fwb.12888","62","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025172970","445","00465070","022-843-704-443-437","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00465070","445","3"

Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) events have different characteristics in terms of onset and duration when compared to other disasters, such as wildfires, floods, and hurricanes. It is important to have an understanding of the impact of CBRN events on EDs to inform disaster preparedness. The purpose of this paper is to identify peer-reviewed published literature that describes the impact on EDs from CBRN events. Method: An integrative literature methodology was used, guided by the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Guidelines. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Pubmed, and Scopus were searched using terms relating to CBRN events and EDs. Papers were included if they focused on the impact of real-world CBRN event(s). Information from each included paper was extracted into a table, including author(s), CBRN event characteristics, ED response characteristics, patient presentation characteristics, and outcome characteristics. Results: Of the 15,982 studies that were identified from the database searches, 4,012 were duplicates and 11,696 were irrelevant at the title and abstract screening stage. Therefore, 274 were screened at the full-text stage resulting in 44 studies for inclusion. Included papers were mostly from the United States of America (n=22/44, 50%), followed by Turkey (n=4/44, 9.1%). Most of the events were chemical (n=36/44, 81.9%), with Chlorine (n=9/36, 25%) being the most frequently reported chemical agent. Between 1 and 5,500 people [M=54, IQR: 22-253] presented to EDs because of CBRN events. Conclusion: Emergency departments assess and manage patients who present following CBRN events. Of these patients, the majority do not require hospital admission, suggesting that the ED is integral in the health response to CBRN events. As such, EDs should be adequately prepared, from a resource and process perspective to assess, manage and discharge large numbers of CBRN-related patients.","10.1017/s1049023x23000572","38","S1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159957392","s3","1049023x and 19451938","105-429-130-268-339","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1049023x and 19451938","s3","S1"

Recovery of soil‐hydraulic properties, such as field‐saturated hydraulic conductivity ( K fs ), is a key factor for assessing the duration of watershed‐scale flash flood and debris flow risks after wildfire. Despite the crucial role of K fs in parameterizing numerical hydrologic models to predict the magnitude of postwildfire run‐off and erosion, existing quantitative relations to predict K fs recovery with time since wildfire are lacking. Here, we conduct meta‐analyses of 5 datasets from the literature that measure or estimate K fs with time since wildfire for longer than 3‐year duration. The meta‐analyses focus on fitting 2 quantitative relations (linear and non‐linear logistic) to explain trends in K fs temporal recovery. The 2 relations adequately described temporal recovery except for 1 site where macropore flow dominated infiltration and K fs recovery. This work also suggests that K fs can have low hydrologic resistance (large postfire changes), and moderate to high hydrologic stability (recovery time relative to disturbance recurrence interval) and resilience (recovery of hydrologic function and provision of ecosystem services). Future K fs relations could more explicitly incorporate processes such as soil‐water repellency, ground cover and soil structure regeneration, macropore recovery, and vegetation regrowth.","10.1002/hyp.11288","31","21","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090938315","3682","08856087","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","08856087","3682","21"

However, there is no unique definition of the term and the relationship between soil burn severity and post-fire hydrological and erosion response has not yet been fully established. The objective of this work was to review the existing literature on the role of soil burn severity on post-fire runoff and erosion ratios. To this end, a meta-analysis was carried out of the runoff and inter-rill erosion data from field rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s) that compared burnt and unburnt conditions. In this study, 109 individual observations were analysed that covered a wide geographical range, various types of land cover (forest, shrubland, and grassland) and two types of fire types (wildfire and prescribed fire). The effect size of the post-fire runoff and erosion response was determined for four key factors: (i) soil burn severity; (ii) time-since-fire; (iii) rainfall intensity; and (iv) bare soil cover. Statistical meta-analysis showed that fire occurrence had a significant effect on the hydrological and erosive response. However, this effect was only significantly higher with increasing soil burn severity for inter-rill erosion, and not for runoff. This study furthermore highlighted the incoherencies between existing burn severity classifications, and proposed an unambiguous classification.","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.01.071","523","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010461079","452","00221694","075-072-709-454-303","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00221694","452",""

To fully understand the carbon (C) cycle impacts of forest fires, both C emissions during the fire and post-disturbance fluxes need to be considered. The latter are dominated by soil surface CO2 flux (Fs), which is still subject to large uncertainties. Fire is generally regarded as the most important factor influencing succession in the boreal forest biome and fire dependant species such as jack pine are widespread. In May 2007, we took concurrent Fs and soil temperature (Ts) measurements in boreal jack pine fire scars aged between 0 and 59 years since fire. To allow comparisons between scars, we adjusted Fs for Ts (FsT) using a Q10 of 2. Mean FsT ranged from 0.56 (± 0.30 sd) to 1.94 (± 0.74 sd) μmol CO2 m−2 s−1. Our results indicate a difference in mean FsT between recently burned (4 to 8 days post fire) and non-burned mature (59 years since fire) forest (P < 0.001), though no difference was detected between recently burned (4 to 8 days post fire) and non-burned young (16 years since fire) forest (P = 0.785). There was a difference in mean FsT between previously young (16 years since fire) and intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars that were both subject to fire in 2007 (P < 0.001). However, there was no difference in mean FsT between mature (59 years since fire) and intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars that were both subjected to fire in 2007 (P = 0.226). Furthermore, there was no difference in mean FsT between mature (59 years since fire) and young scars (16 years since fire) that were both subjected to fire in 2007 (P = 0.186). There was an increase in FsT with time since fire for the chronosequence 0, 16 and 59 years post fire (P < 0.001). Our results lead us to hypothesise that the autotrophic:heterotrophic soil respiration ratio increases over post-fire successional time in boreal jack pine systems, though this should be explored in future research. The results of this study contribute to a better quantitative understanding of Fs in boreal jack pine fire scars and will facilitate meta-analyses of Fs in fire scar chronosequences.","10.5194/bg-7-1375-2010","7","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032191238","1375","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","1375","5"

It is therefore vital to mitigate the increased hydrological and erosive response after wildfires to maintain the sustainability of ecosystems and protect the values at risk downstream from the fire-affected areas. Soil erosion mitigation treatments have been widely applied after wildfires but assessment of their effectiveness has been limited to local and regional-scale studies, whose conclusions may depend heavily on site-specific conditions. To overcome this limitation, a meta-analysis approach was applied to investigations of post-wildfire soil erosion mitigation treatments published in peer-reviewed journals. A meta-analysis database was compiled that consisted of 53 and 222 pairs of treated/untreated observations on post-fire runoff and erosion, respectively, extracted from 34 publications indexed in Scopus. The overall effectiveness of mitigation treatments, expressed as the quantitative metric ‘effect size’, was determined for both the runoff and erosion observations, and further analyzed for four different types of treatments (cover-based, barriers, seeding, and chemical treatments). The erosion observations involving cover-based treatments were analyzed for differences in effectiveness between 3 different types of mulch materials (straw, wood-based, and hydromulch) as well as between different application rates of straw and wood materials. Finally, the erosion observations were also analyzed for the overall effectiveness of post-fire year, burn severity, rainfall amount and erosivity, and ground cover. The meta-analysis results show that all four types of treatments significantly reduced post-fire soil erosion, but that only the cover and barrier treatments significantly reduced post-fire runoff. From the three different cover treatments, straw and wood mulches were significantly more effective in mitigating erosion than hydromulch. In addition, the effectiveness of both straw and wood mulches depended on their application rates. Straw mulching was less effective at rates below than above 200 g m−2, while mulching with wood materials at high rates (1300 to 1750 g m−2) produced more variable outcomes than lower rates. Results also suggest that the overall effectiveness of the treatments was greatest shortly after fire, in severely burned sites, providing or promoting the development of ground cover over 70%, and that it increased with increasing rainfall erosivity. It can be concluded that, in overall terms, the application of the studied post-fire erosion mitigation treatments represented a better choice than doing nothing, especially in sites where erosion is high. However, the meta-analysis highlights under-representation of studies on this topic outside of the USA, Spain and Portugal. It was also observed that most of the studies were conducted at hillslope scale and tested mulching (namely straw, wood and hydromulch) and/or barriers, while larger scales and other treatments were scarcely addressed. Further efforts need to be made in testing, from field and modeling studies, combinations of existing and/or emerging erosion mitigation treatments to ensure that the most adequate measures are applied after fires.","10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103611","217","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136750078","103611","00128252","003-888-094-962-247","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00128252","103611",""

A systematic review protocol","2014","Environmental Evidence","BackgroundThe traditional approach to limiting impacts of forestry on biodiversity is to set aside forest areas of particular conservation interest, either as formally protected reserves or on a voluntary basis. Many set-asides are left more or less untouched, but some of them have a history of disturbances such as wildfires, forest grazing, coppicing or small-scale felling. Such areas may gradually lose the qualities that were to be safeguarded unless the disturbances are re-introduced (e.g. by burning) or replaced with alternatives (e.g. gap-felling). Active management of forest set-asides may be particularly relevant in areas where the biota has been impoverished by intensive and large-scale harvesting. Here, biodiversity may not be able to recover adequately without restoration measures such as gap-felling or creation of dead wood.In recent years, interest in active management of forest set-asides has increased, but opinions differ among conservationists on how such management should be balanced against non-intervention. The topic of the proposed systematic review has therefore met approval among stakeholders in Sweden, where it is currently an issue of high concern.MethodsThe review will examine primary field studies of how various forms of active management have affected biodiversity in boreal or temperate forests set aside for conservation or restoration. The primary focus will be on forest types represented in Sweden. In some cases, useful insights about management options may also be provided by studies of interventions in commercially managed forests. Non-intervention or alternative forms of active management will be used as comparators. Relevant outcomes include assemblage diversity (species richness, diversity indices), abundance of different functional or taxonomic groups of organisms, population viability of target species, and indicators of forest biodiversity such as forest structure and amounts of dead wood.The relevant scientific literature may turn out to be very heterogeneous, however. Numerous combinations of management forms and biodiversity outcomes can be conceived, and it remains to be seen whether any such combination is covered by sufficiently many studies to allow a meaningful meta-analysis. Nonetheless, it should be feasible to achieve a useful narrative synthesis of the available evidence.","10.1186/2047-2382-3-22","3","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005630771","22","20472382","057-472-005-158-645","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","20472382","22","1"

Forests of the Rogue River Basin in Oregon, USA, are both productive and fire-prone due to ample winter precipitation and summer drought; yet management in this region is strongly influenced by forest practices that depend on fire exclusion. Regionally, climate change is increasing fire frequency, elevating the importance of understanding historically frequent-fire regimes. We use cross-dated fire-scars to characterize historical fire return intervals, seasonality, and relationships with climate beginning in 1650 CE for 13 sites representative of southwestern Oregon dry forests. Using systematic literature review, we link our local fire histories to a regional dataset and evaluate our data relative to more intensively studied conifer/hardwood forest types in California. Fire-scars show that fires in the Rogue Basin were frequent and regular until disrupted in the 1850s through 1910s, corresponding with forced displacement of Native Americans and Euro-American settlement. Median historical fire return intervals were 8 years at the stand-scale (<25 ha), with site medians ranging from five to 14 years and no significant differences between sampled vegetation types. Burn seasonality was broadly distributed with 47% of recorded fires in the latewood (midsummer), 30% at the ring boundary (late summer and fall), and 23% in the earlywood (spring and early summer). The number of sites recording fire each year was associated with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and El Niño Southern Oscillation Index (ENSO). Fires were detected in the study area every other year, and synchrony among sites was associated with stronger annual drought. The ENSO synchronization of fire suggests an herbaceous fuel signal, with warm winters/wet summers two years prior to widespread fire-years, a pattern observed globally in fuel-limited systems. Stand-scale fire histories in the Klamath, southern Cascades, and northern Sierra Nevada ecoregions resemble Rogue River Basin stand-scale fire histories. Across dry mixed conifer, yellow pine, and mixed evergreen forests, fire return intervals converged on 8 years. Moist mixed conifer and red fir forests exhibited 13-year fire return intervals. Across ecoregions, fire periodicity was weakly correlated with climatic water deficit, but well-modeled by elevation, precipitation, and temperature. These data highlight the need for decadal fire and burning outside of the contemporary fire season for forest restoration and climate adaptation in the dry forests of the Rogue Basin.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.07.010","430","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106050850","43","03781127","031-611-094-771-946","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","43",""

Contrary to bushfire policy on catastrophic fires, some householders prefer to stay and defend their properties. In addition, more frequent destructive events have been predicted because of climate change. To date, little attention has been paid to factors concerning why householders decide not to evacuate, especially for at-risk communities. Recent bushfire fatalities underscore the need to understand the factors influencing decision-making among residents in at-risk communities. This study addresses this imperative by identifying factors through a systematic literature review. Out of 142 articles extracted from the Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1999 – 2020, 32 were found relevant. Based on the rationalism classification of knowledge in psychology, these were categorized into information, social, protection, and operational factors. The factors may inform further studies involving predictors of residents’ non-evacuation from bushfire hazards. In addition, the significant factors can be leveraged towards early self-evacuation, which could reduce bushfire fatalities and mental health impacts among the residents.","10.1088/1755-1315/1101/2/022002","1101","2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153448829","022002","17551307 and 17551315","060-661-146-774-485","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","17551307 and 17551315","022002","2"

A systematic review protocol","2016","Environmental Evidence","BackgroundForests set aside from productive forestry are often considered best conserved by non-intervention. However, biodiversity is often maintained in natural forests by a background level of disturbance, which, in some forests, takes the form of forest fires. Set-aside forests may therefore benefit from continuation of such disturbances, which, in forests under protection, must be managed anthropogenically. While the effects of prescribed burning on tree regeneration and on pyrophilous and/or saproxylic species in some regions are well known, effects on other organisms are less clear and/or consistent. It would be valuable to broaden the knowledge of how prescribed burning affects forest biodiversity, particularly because this practice is increasingly considered as a conservation management intervention. The primary aim of the proposed systematic review is to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests. The ultimate purpose of the review is to investigate whether and how such prescribed burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species, in forest set-asides.MethodsThe review will examine primary field studies of how prescribed burning affects biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests. We will consider studies made in such forests anywhere in the world, and will include forests both in protected areas and under commercial management. Non-intervention will be used as a comparator. Relevant outcomes will include a range of measures of biodiversity, including abundance and diversity, but not of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies will be taken from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update will be undertaken in a subset of databases from the systematic map, using a search string targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Searches for additional literature will be made in the bibliographies of existing reviews of forest burning. Traditional academic literature and grey literature in English, French, Swedish and Finnish will be considered. Stakeholders who engage in prescribed burning will be asked to provide relevant grey literature.","10.1186/s13750-016-0076-5","5","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002893231","24","20472382","110-442-507-972-949","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","20472382","24","1"

Many plant species from fire-prone ecosystems are adapted to specific fire regimes corresponding to historical conditions and shifts beyond these bounds may have severe impacts on vegetation recovery and long-term species persistence. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of field-based studies across different vegetation types and climate regions to investigate how post-fire plant recruitment, reproduction and survival are affected by fires that occur outside of the historical fire season. We find that fires outside of the historical fire season may lead to decreased post-fire recruitment, particularly in obligate seeding species. Conversely, we find a general increase in post-fire survival in resprouting species. Our results highlight the trade-offs that exist when considering the effects of changes in the seasonal timing of fire, an already present aspect of climate-related fire regime change.","10.1038/s43247-022-00453-2","3","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148334279","126","26624435","165-198-118-293-153","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","26624435","126","1"

To reduce this threat and improve overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the remaining area. A necessary step in designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that small-diameter removal and burning treatments would have minimal effects on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies that met our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for wildlife species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments, (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact design using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis occurred ≤20 years post-treatment on sites <400ha. Small-diameter harvest and burning treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. We examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and wildfire. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife species in the studies we examined in the short-term (≤10 years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement across the landscape will result in the highest diversity and density. We recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative response variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of data.","10.1016/j.foreco.2009.10.024","259","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034598623","333","03781127","016-995-202-465-041","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","333","3"

However, forests are increasingly subject to natural disturbances such as windthrow, wildfire or disease outbreaks, which threaten the permanence of this large carbon stock. In response to increasing disturbances and ongoing climate change, forests are expected to lose their ability to return to pre-disturbance conditions involving a reorganization of tree species composition and stand structure. If tipping points are crossed, even a complete vegetation shift and conversion to non-forest ecosystems is possible. Here we aimed to assess the sensitivity of forest soil carbon to disturbance and its recovery with contrasting successional trajectories by combining two field studies on soil carbon stocks in windthrown forest stands and a global meta-analysis on the effects of different disturbance agents. Our results along an altitudinal gradient in Switzerland show that mountain forests with high carbon stocks in thick organic layers were particularly sensitive to disturbance by windthrow, losing up to 90% of their carbon stored belowground. In contrast, low-elevation forest soils with thin organic layers and smaller carbon stocks were barely affected. These results are consistent with our meta-analysis, which shows that disturbance-induced carbon losses increase with the size of initial carbon stocks. Boreal and high-elevation forests with large soil carbon stocks are highly sensitive to severe and long-lasting carbon losses due to damage from storms, wildfire, insects, and harvesting, while in most temperate and tropical forests soil carbon stocks recover more rapidly and losses are smaller. Results from a disturbance chronosequence in Austria also suggest that vegetation shifts following forest damage can strongly influence the recovery of soil carbon stocks after disturbance. Disturbed sites that remained in a non-forest, grass-dominated state for three decades accumulated about a third more soil carbon than sites that regenerated with trees. In addition to high litter inputs from herbaceous fine roots at grass-dominated sites, we relate this difference to changes in microbial community structure and function. In conclusion, our results underline that the magnitude and duration of soil carbon losses after disturbance depend on the forest type and site specific soil properties. Moreover, vegetation shifts during succession significantly modify the re-accumulation of soil carbon after disturbance.","10.5194/egusphere-egu24-19400","","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169649779","","","068-779-355-714-248","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","",""

Many studies have been published on this matter but there is no consensus in the literature on the magnitude and duration of these effects since the relevant hydrological conditions are site‐specific. Moreover, the relationship between post‐fire hydrology and its main environmental drivers has been little explored. This study has carried out a bibliographic review and a meta‐analysis of the changes resulting from prescribed fire applications (water infiltration, soil water repellency (SWR), surface runoff and soil erosion) using a database of 85 case studies from 41 academic papers that have been published over the last 23 years. The effects of annual precipitation, soil slope, burn severity, fire application season, post‐fire ground cover, and vegetation type on those changes have also been statistically explored. The bibliographic review has revealed that previous case studies have not been equally distributed across the globe but concentrated in only a few countries, mainly the United States and Spain. The meta‐analysis has revealed that (i) water infiltration generally decreases and SWR appears with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion immediately after the prescribed fire, while the pre‐fire values progressively recover over time; (ii) the window of disturbance in burned soils may last a few months (with some exceptions); (iii) annual precipitation and soil slope significantly influence water infiltration and surface runoff, but not soil erosion, in both the short‐term and medium‐term; (iv) moderate‐to‐high levels of soil burn severity severely enhance surface runoff and soil erosion, and noticeably reduce water infiltration in the short‐term; (v) the level of ground cover burning is important for reducing the runoff rates, but it plays a minor role in water infiltration and soil erosion rates;and (vi) the prescribed fire applied in spring results in lower increases in short‐term runoff and erosion, while fire applications in summer and in shrublands produce the highest increases in soil loss. The following practical recommendations arise from this study: (i) research should be better distributed across all environmental contexts on a global scale; (ii) post‐fire management actions should be immediately implemented after the prescribed fire application; (iii) prescribed fire should be carried out in spring and the soil burn severity should be kept low during burning; (iv) the monitoring studies should be prolonged at least for some years (more than two or three) after prescribed fire; (iv) the catchment‐scale investigations, although more difficult and expensive, should be encouraged (avoiding, however, areas to sparsely burnt in the context of the whole catchment); (v) the monitored variables should also include the most important physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, the cover and structure of regenerating vegetation, as well as the water quality parameters; (vi) the effects of repeated applications of prescribed fire should be experimentally assessed; and (vii) guidelines for standardized and appropriate measurements and analytical methods in experimental activities should be set up. These indications support the use of land managers in the monitoring of the hydrological impacts of the prescribed fire and in the choice of sites where post‐fire management actions must be implemented. The last recommendation of this study is the creation of an experimental database supporting the bibliographic review and the meta‐analysis, which is made available to other researchers and land managers, to create a public, easily‐accessible and comprehensive tool for future research needs and professional use.","10.1002/hyp.14957","37","9","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163720821","1","08856087","161-059-002-154-48X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","08856087","1","9"

It is estimated that the field, as of 2021, it has grown to larger than 13,000 research items, with an excess of 1,200 new articles appearing every year. It also exhibits distinct characteristics of a multidisciplinary research domain. Analyses of the underlying studies reveal that the field is made up of five major divisions. These divisions embody research activities around (i) forest ecology and climate, (ii) fire detection and mapping technologies, (iii) community risk mitigation and planning, (iv) soil and water ecology, and (v) atmospheric science. Research into the sub-topics of reciprocal effects between climate change and fire activities, fire risk modelling/mapping (including burned area modelling), wildfire impact on organic matter, biomass burning, and human health impacts currently constitute trending areas of this field. Amongst these, the climate cluster showed an explosion of activities in 2020 while the human health cluster is identified as the most recent emerging topic of this domain. On the other hand, dimensions of wildfire research related to human behaviour—particularly issues of emergency training, risk perception and wildfire hazard education—seem to be notably underdeveloped in this field, making this one of its most apparent knowledge gaps. A scoping review of all reviews and meta-analysis of this field demonstrates that this sub-topic is also virtually non-existent on the research synthesis front.

We conducted a meta‐analysis of population data for 4 populations in the southem Cascades and Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1990 to 2005 to assist a listing evaluation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study areas (from N to S) were on the Lassen National Forest (LAS), Eldorado National Forest (ELD), Sierra National Forest (SIE), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (SKC). These study areas represented a broad spectrum of habitat and management conditions in these mountain ranges. We estimated apparent survival probability, reproductive output, and rate of population change for spotted owls on individual study areas and for all study areas combined (meta‐analysis) using model selection or model‐averaging based on maximum‐likelihood estimation. We followed a formal protocol to conduct this analysis that was similar to other spotted owl meta‐analyses. Consistency of field and analytical methods among our studies reduced confounding methodological effects when evaluating results. We used 991 marked spotted owls in the analysis of apparent survival. Apparent survival probability was higher for adult than for subadult owls. There was little difference in apparent survival between male and female owls. Model‐averaged mean estimates of apparent survival probability of adult owls varied from 0.811 ± 0.021 for females at LAS to 0.890 ± 0.016 for males at SKC. Apparent survival increased over time for owls of all age classes at LAS and SIE, for adults at ELD, and for second‐year subadults and adults at SKC. The meta‐analysis of apparent survival, which included only adult owls, confirmed an increasing trend in survival over time. Survival rates were higher for owls on SKC than on the other study areas. We analyzed data from 1,865 observations of reproductive outcomes for female spotted owls. The proportion of subadult females among all territorial females of known age ranged from 0.00 to 0.25 among study areas and years. The proportion of subadults among female spotted owls was negatively related to reproductive output (no. of young fledged/territorial F owl) for ELD and SIE. Eldorado study area and LAS showed an alternate‐year trend in reproductive output, with higher output in even‐numbered years. Mean annual reproductive output was 0.988 ± 0.154 for ELD, 0.624 ± 0.140 for LAS, 0.478 ± 0.106 for SIE, and 0.555 ± 0.110 for SKC. Eldorado Study Area exhibited a declining trend and the greatest variation in reproductive output over time, whereas SIE and SKC, which had the lowest reproductive output, had the lowest temporal variation. Meta‐analysis confirmed that reproductive output varied among study areas. Reproductive output was highest for adults, followed by second‐year subadults, and then by first‐year subadults. We used 842 marked subadult and adult owls to estimate population rate of change. Modeling indicated that Λ t (Λ t is the finite rate of population change estimated using the reparameterized Jolly–Seber estimator [Pradel 1996]) was either stationary (LAS and SIE) or increasing after an initial decrease (ELD and SKC). Mean estimated Λ t for the 4 study areas was 1.007 (95% CI = 0.952–1.066) for ELD; 0.973 (95% CI = 0.946–1.001) for LAS; 0.992 (95% CI = 0.966–1.018) for SIE; and 1.006 (95% CI = 0.947–1.068) for SKC. The best meta‐analysis model of population trend indicated that Λ varied across time but was similar in trend among the study areas. Our estimates of realized population change (Δ t ; Franklin et al. 2004), which we estimated as the product 1 λ 3 , were based on estimates of Λ t from individual study areas and did not require estimating annual population size for each study area. Trends represented the proportion of the population size in the first year that remained in each subsequent year. Similar to λ 4 on which they were based, these λ k‐1 showed evidence of decline over the study period for LAS and SIE. The best model indicated recruitment of male and female adult and subadults varied from 0.10 to 0.31 new territorial individuals at time t /number of territorial individuals at time t –1 and similarly among areas. We also conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) based on results of our meta‐analysis. This PVA was of limited utility for ELD and SKC study areas because 95% confidence intervals on the probability of decline or increase spanned the interval [0, 1] within 5–10 years. When we restricted inferences to 7 years, estimated probability of a >10% decline for SIE was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.09–0.78); for LAS the probability was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.27–0.94). In contrast, estimated probability of a >10% increase in 7 years for SIE was 0.23 (95% CI = 0.01–0.55) and for LAS was 0.10 (95% CI = 0.00–0.34). For comparisons, we simulated a PVA for a hypothetical population with mean Λ = 1.0 and the same temporal variation as observed in our owl populations. Our PVA suggested that both the SIE and LAS populations had higher probabilities of declining in a 7‐year period than increasing but that it would be difficult to determine if a population was in a slight gradual decline. Our analysis and the repository of information on our 4 study populations provide a data‐rich template for managers to monitor impacts of future management actions on the owl. Specifically, our data can be used to evaluate the effect of management strategies on spotted owls that are being implemented by the United States Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildfire in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem. Our information also provides baseline information for evaluating the status of the owl for potential listing as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. RESUMEN El búho californiano manchado ( Strix occidentalis occidentalis ) es la única subespecie de búhos manchados que no está listada como amenazada o en peligro de extinción en el Acta de E.E.U.U. para las Especies en Peligro de Extinción a pesar de las peticiones para que sea incluida en la lista como una especie amenazada. Nosotros realizamos un meta‐análisis de los datos de la población de 4 poblaciones del sur de Cascades y de la Sierra Nevada, California desde 1990 hasta 2005 como ayuda a una evaluación de listado hecha por el U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. Nuestras áreas de estudio (de norte a sur) estuvieron localizadas en el Bosque Nacional Lassen (LAS), en el Bosque Nacional Eldorado (ELD), en el Bosque Nacional Sierra (SIE) y en los Parques Nacionales Sequoia y Kings Canyon (SKC). Estas áreas de estudio representaron un amplio espectro del hábitat y de las condiciones de manejo en estas cadenas de montañas. Nosotros calculamos la probabilidad de supervivencia aparente, el volumen de reproducción y el cambio en la tasa de población de los búhos manchados en áreas de estudio individuales y para todas las áreas de estudio combinadas (meta‐análisis) utilizando selección de modelos o promediando modelos basados en la estimación de máxima probabilidad. Seguimos un protocolo formal para realizar este análisis que fuera similar a otros meta‐análisis con búhos manchados. La consistencia del campo y los métodos analíiticos en nuestros estudios redujeron la confusión de efectos metodológicos al evaluar los resultados. Utilizamos 991 búhos manchados marcados en el análisis de supervivencia aparente. La probabilidad de supervivencia aparente fue más alta para búhos adultos que para subadultos. Hubo poca diferencia en la supervivencia aparente entre hembras y machos. Para los modelos promediados, los cálculos de la media de la probabilidad de supervivencia aparente para búhos adultos tuvo una variación de 0.811 ± 0.021 para hembras en LAS a 0.890 ± 0.016 para machos en SKA. La supervivencia aparente aumentó con el tiempo para los búhos de todos los grupos de edad en LAS y SIE, para adultos en ELD, y para subadultos del segundo año y para adultos en SKC. El meta‐análisis de supervivencia aparente, que incluyó únicamente a búhos adultos, confirmó una tendencia al aumento en la supervivencia con el tiempo. Las tasas de supervivencia fueron más altas para los búhos en SKC que en las otras áreas de estudio. Analizamos información de 1.865 observaciones de resultados de reproducciones para búhos manchados hembra. La proporción de hembras subadultas entre todas las hembras territoriales de edad conocida fluctuó de 0.00 a 0.25 a través de las áreas de estudio y de los años. La proporción de subadultos entre los búhos manchados hembra estuvo relacionada negativamente con el volumen de reproducción (número de pichones emplumados por búho hembra territorial) para ELD y SIE. ELD y LAS mostraron una tendencia anual alternada en el volumen de reproducción, con un volumen mayor en los años pares. La media del volumen de reproducción anual fue 0.988 ± 0.154 para ELD, 0.624 ± 0.140 para LAS, 0.478 ± 0.106 para SIE y 0.555 ± 0.154 para SKC. ELD exhibió una tendencia a disminuir y la variación más alta en el volumen de reproducción a través del tiempo; mientras que SIE y SKC, que tuvieron el más bajo volumen de reproducción, tuvieron la menor variación temporal. El meta‐análisis confirmó que el volumen de reproducción varió entre las áreas de estudio. El volumen de reproducción fue más alto para adultos, seguido por subadultos del segundo año, y luego por subadultos del primer año. Nosotros utilizamos 842 búhos marcados, adultos y subadultos, para calcular el índice de cambio de la población. La selección de modelos indicó que Λ t era, o relativamente fija (LAS y SIE) o aumentaba después de una disminución inicial (ELD y SKC). La media calculada Λ t para las cuatro áreas de estudio fue: 1.007 (95% CI = 0.952–1.066) para ELD; 0.973 (95% CI = 0.946–1.001) para LAS; 0.992 (95% CI = 0.966–1.018) para SIE; y 1.006 (95% CI = 0.947–1.068) para SKC. El mejor modelo de meta‐análisis de la tendencia de población indicó que Λ variaba con el tiempo pero que era una tendencia similar entre las áreas de estudio. Nuestros cálculos sobre el cambio de población realizado (Δ t ) se basaron en los cálculos de Λ t de las áreas de estudio individuales y no requirieron calcular el tamaño de la población anual para cada área de estudio. Las tendencias representaron la proporción del tamaño de la población en el primer año que permaneció en cada año subsiguiente. De manera similar a λ t , en la que se basaron, éstas Δ t mostraron evidencia de disminución durante el período de estudio para LAS y SIE. El mejor modelo de reclutamiento indicado, el reclutamiento de búhos machos y hembras, adultos y subadultos, varió de 0.10 a 0.31 individuos territoriales nuevos al tiempo t por el número de individuos territoriales al tiempo t –1 y de manera similar entre las otras áreas. También realizamos un análisis de viabilidad de población (PVA) basado en los resultados de nuestro meta‐análisis. Este análisis PVA fue de limitada utilidad para las áreas de estudio ELD y SKC porque el 95% de intervalos de confiabilidad en la probabilidad de disminución o aumento extendió el intervalo [0, 1] de 5–10 años. Cuando restringimos las inferencias a 7 años, la probabilidad estimada de a >10% de disminución para SIE fue 0.41 (95% CI = 0.09–0.78); para LAS la probabilidad fue 0.64 (95% CI = 0.27–0.94). En contraste, la probabilidad estimada de un >10% de aumento en 7 años para SIE fue 0.23 (95% CI = 0.01–0.55) y para LAS fue 0.10 (95% CI = 0.00–0.34). Para comparar, simulamos un PVA para una población hipotética con una media Λ = 1.0, y con la misma variación temporal observada en nuestras poblaciones de búhos. Nuestro PVA sugirió que ambas poblaciones SIE y LAS tenían, en un período de 7 años, mayores probabilidades de disminución que de aumento, pero que sería muy difícil determinar si alguna de las poblaciones estaba en una ligera disminución gradual. El depósito de información de nuestras 4 áreas de estudio provee una plantilla rica en información para que los administradores monitoreen los impactos de acciones futuras en el manejo de los búhos (por ejemplo, nuevas estrategias de manejo del Plan de Sierra Nevada Forest). También provee evidencia importante para evaluar el estatus del búho para su potencial inclusión en el listado de especies amenazadas. RÉSUMÉ Le hibou tacheté californien ( Strix occidentalis occidentalis ) est la seule sous‐espèce de hibou tacheté ne figurant pas sur la liste des animaux menacés ou vulnérables sous la Loi des Espèces en Danger des Etats‐Unis malgré des pétitions pour l'inscrire sur cette liste en tant que sous‐espèce menacée. Nous avons effectué une méta‐analyse des données de population pour 4 populations dans le sud des Cascades et dans la Sierra Nevada, en Californie de 1990 à 2005 pour aider une évaluation de leur statut établie par les Services des Eaux et Forêts des Etats‐Unis. Nos aires d'étude (du nord au sud) étaient dans la forêt nationale Lassen (LAS), la forêt nationale Eldorado (ELD), la forêt nationale Sierra (SIE), et les parcs nationaux Sequoia et Kings Canyon (SKC). Ces aires d'étude représentaient un large échantillon des conditions de l'habitat et de la gestion dans ces chaînes de montagnes. Nous avons estimé la probabilité de survie apparente, le succès de reproduction, et le taux de changement de la population pour les hiboux tachetés dans chaque aire d'étude individuelle et dans toutes les aires réunies (méta–analyse) en utilisant la sélection de modèles ou le calcul de la moyenne des modèles basé sur une estimation du maximum de vraisemblance. Pour effectuer cette analyse nous avons suivi un protocole rigoureux similaire à d'autres méta‐analyses de hiboux tachetés. La cohérence des observations de terrain et des méthodes analytiques entre ces études a réduit les effets méthodologiques confondants lors des évaluations des résultats. Nous avons utilisé 991 hiboux tachetés marqués dans l'analyse de survie apparente. La probabilité de survie apparente a été plus élevée pour les hiboux adultes que pour les sous‐adultes. Il y a eu peu de différence pour ce qui est de la survie apparente entre les hiboux mâles et femelles. La moyenne des estimations de la probabilité de survie apparente des hiboux adultes basée sur la moyenne des modèles a varié entre 0,811 ± 0,021 pour les hiboux femelles à LAS et 0,890 ± 0,016 pour les hiboux mâles à SKC. La survie apparente a augmenté avec le temps pour les hiboux de toutes les classes d'âge à LAS et SIE, pour les adultes à ELD, et pour les sous‐adultes de deux ans et les adultes à SKC. La méta‐analyse de survie apparente, qui comprenait seulement des hiboux adultes, a confirmé une tendance croissante de survie avec le temps. Les taux de survie étaient plus élevés pour les hiboux de SKC que pour ceux des autres aires d'étude. Nous avons analysé les données obtenues à partir de 1 865 observations de succès de reproduction de hiboux tachetées femelles. La proportion des hiboux femelles sous‐adultes parmi toutes les femelles territoriales d'àge connu a varié de 0,00 à 0,25 selon les aires et les années d'étude. La proportion des sousadultes parmi les hiboux tachetés femelles a été négativement corrélée avec le succès de reproduction (nombre de jeunes hiboux par femelle territoriale) pour ELD et SIE. La forêt nationale Eldorado et la forêt nationale Lassen ont montré une tendance à alterner selon un cycle biennal pour ce qui est du succès de reproduction, avec un taux plus élevé pendant les années paires. La moyenne du succès de reproduction annuel était de 0,988 ± 0,154 pour ELD, de 0,624 ± 0,140 pour LAS, de 0,478 ± 0,106 pour SIE, et de 0,555 ± 0,110 pour SKD. La forêt nationale Eldorado a montré une tendance décroissante ainsi que la plus grande variation dans le succès de reproduction avec le temps, alors que SIE et SKC, qui ont eu le succès de reproduction le plus bas, ont connu la variation temporelle la plus basse. La méta‐analyse a confirmé que le succès de reproduction variait selon les aires d'étude. Le succès de reproduction a été le plus élevé pour les adultes, puis pour les sous‐adultes de deux ans, et ensuite pour les sous‐adultes d'un an. Nous avons utilisé 842 hiboux marqués, adultes et sous‐adultes, pour estimer le taux de changement de la population. La modélisation a indiqué que Λ t était soit stationnaire (LAS et SIE), soit croissant après une baisse initiale (ELD et SKC). La moyenne estimée Λ t pour les 4 aires d'étude était: 1,007 (95% IC = 0,952–1,066) pour ELD; 0,973 (95% IC = 0,946–1,001) pour LAS; 0,992 (95% IC = 0,966–1,018) pour SIE; et 1,006 (95% IC = 0,947–1,068) pour SKC. Le meilleur modèle de méta‐analyse pour la tendance de la population a indiqué que Λ variait selon le temps mais suivait la même tendance selon les aires d'étude. Nos estimations du changement de population réalisé (Δ t ) étaient fondées sur les estimations de Λ t des aires d'étude individuelles et n'ont pas nécessité d'estimation de la taille annuelle de la population pour chaque aire d'étude. Les tendances représentaient la proportion de la taille de la population pendant la première année qui s'est maintenue chaque année subséquente. De même que λ t sur lesquels ils étaient fondés, ces δ t ont apporté des preuves de déclin pendant la période d'étude pour LAS et SIE. Le meilleur modèle a indiqué que le recrutement des hiboux adultes et sous‐adultes mâles et femelles variait de 0,10 à 0,31 nouveaux individus territoriaux à un temps t pour un nombre d'individus territoriaux à un temps t‐1 et qu'il en était de même dans chaque aire. Nous avons également procédé à une analyse de viabilité de la population (AVP) fondée sur les résultats de notre méta‐analyse. Cette AVP a été d'une utilité limitée pour les aires d'étude ELD et SKC parce que les intervalles de confiance de 95% sur la probabilité du déclin ou de la croissance couvraient l'intervalle [0, 1] sur une période de 5 à 10 ans. Lorsque nous avons réduit les inférences à 7 ans, la probabilité estimée d'un déclin >10% pour SIE était de 0,41 (95% IC = 0,09–0,78); pour LAS la probabilité était de 0,64 (95% IC = 0,27–0,94). Al'opposé, la probabilité estimée d'une croissance >10% en 7 ans pour SIE était de 0,23 (95% IC = 0,01–0,55) et pour LAS elle était de 0,10 (95% IC = 0,00–0,34). Afin de comparer, nous avons simulé une AVP pour une population hypothétique ayant une moyenne Λ = 1,0 et la même variation temporelle que celle observée dans nos populations de hiboux. Notre AVP a suggéré que les populations de SIE et de LAS avaient de plus grandes probabilités de déclin que de croissance sur une période de 7 ans, mais qu'il serait difficile de déterminer si une population présentait un léger déclin graduel. La collecte des informations pour nos 4 aires d'étude foumit aux personnes chargées de la gestion un modèle riche de données permettant de suivre l'impact sur les hiboux des actions de gestion à l'avenir (par exemple, les nouvelles stratégies de gestion du Plan pour la Forêt de Sierra Nevada). Cette collecte foumit également des preuves importantes afin d'évaluer le statut du hibou pour une classification potentielle sur la liste des espèces menacées.","10.2193/2008-475","174","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035752529","1","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","1","1"

The recovery times of microbial biomass and functional groups were shorter than those of soil C emissions and extracellular enzymes. Importantly, the postfire recovery of microbial biomass C and/or N as well as soil respiration and its components varied with mean annual temperature and precipitation, fire severity and type, and ecosystem type, with longer recovery times under high-severity fire/wildfire and in forests.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review to compile a comprehensive list of factors that affect the public's wildfire risk perception. METHOD: We performed an online search for PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases to identify research published between January 2000 and August 2022. Studies reporting factors related to risk perception based on surveys were included in the review. RESULTS: From 3,466 papers retrieved, 20 studies met our screening criteria, and 16 were conducted in the United States. Several major factors were identified as influential factors for the risk perception of wildfires: sociodemographic characteristics, property ownership, living environment, prior wildfire-related experience, and wildfire-related information resources. The most common factors studied were age, income, education, dense vegetation around the residence, and prior wildfire experience. The associations of age and prior experience with wildfire risk perception were largely inconsistent across papers, with some papers associating older age and having prior wildfire experience with lower risk perception, while others concluded the opposite or no association at all. Other factors, such as owning a property and being able to receive wildfire-related information from different resources were associated with higher risk perception in most of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first review to summarize associations of factors with wildfire-related risk perception. Future studies can provide further investigations and theories to explain inconsistent results for certain variables.","10.1289/isee.2023.ep-156","2023","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168066244","","10780475","147-500-164-906-151","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10780475","","1"

A systematic literature review facilitated the reconstruction and evaluation of giant tortoise habitat, feeding habitats, diets and Aldabrachelys tortoise impacts on disturbance regimes. In conclusion, reintroduction of mixed‐feeding Aldabrachelys  (the diets of which were often dominated by C 3 woody material, but never by C 4 grasses, across its range), will likely impact plant species composition, select a tree‐rich habitat mosaic, reduce fire frequency, re‐establish lost ecological functions and improve landscape productivity at a range of scales, including rangeland palatability, benefitting both biodiversity and human wellbeing. Summary Grasslands with little tree cover today comprise 80% of Madagascar's habitat. Determining their extent at human settlement can guide ecological restoration and enhance human well‐being, so the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop identified the role of extinct megafauna in determining habitat as a critical knowledge gap. Using a systematic literature review, combined with extracted datasets, we address this, examining anticipated habitat selection by giant tortoises following reintroduction to Madagascar (where the Aldabran giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea , provides ecological functions lost when A. abrupta and A. grandidieri went extinct). When comparing current and historical tortoise selection of habitat across the Mascarenes and Aldabra with contemporary Malagasy habitat, areas in Madagascar where giant tortoises historically ranged, today have a significantly different habitat composition to the forested habitat that supported giant tortoises on other islands. Dietary 13 C isotope ratios show that Malagasy Aldabrachelys and Mascarene tortoises were mixed feeders, with diets often dominated by C 3 woody intake, but never by C 4 grasses. Across systems, giant tortoises required and selected, tree‐rich habitat mosaics, different to current pastoralist fire‐selected Malagasy grasslands characterized by sparse tree cover. Furthermore, Aldabran Aldabrachelys tortoise turf, restricted to small areas (large tracts of unshaded vegetation present physiological challenges to Aldabrachelys' survival), is compositionally different to Malagasy and African obligate C 4 grazing lawns. Ecological, palaeoecological, geomorphological and molecular evidence support a lost Malagasy habitat mosaic where hippo and tortoise diets were C 3 ‐dominated, because they inhabited closed‐canopy systems, with abutting open‐canopy areas harbouring endemic‐rich, C 4 grassy understories and limited grasslands. The review suggests that rewilding with A. gigantea will help restore ecological functions, productivity and landscape‐scale degradation lost through cattle‐based pastoralism, re‐establish tree‐rich habitat mosaics, and mitigate against frequent bushfires, benefiting biodiversity and humans at multiple scales.","10.1002/ppp3.10474","6","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167794545","570","25722611","127-116-306-044-816","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","25722611","570","3"

However, trade‐offs between management objectives and a lack of consensus on the ecological consequences of salvage logging impair science‐based decision making on the management of forests after natural disturbances. We conducted a global meta‐analysis of the impacts of salvage logging on regulating ecosystem services and on fuel loads, as a frequent post‐disturbance objective is preventing subsequent wildfires that could be fueled by the accumulation of dead trunks and branches. Salvage logging affected ecosystem services in a moderately negative way, regardless of disturbance type and severity, time elapsed since salvage logging, intensity of salvage logging, and the group of regulating ecosystem services being considered. However, prolonging the time between natural disturbance and salvage logging mitigated negative effects on regulating ecosystem services. Salvage logging had no overall effect on surface fuels; rather, different fuel types responded differently depending on the time elapsed since salvage logging. Delaying salvage logging by ~2–4 years may reduce negative ecological impacts without affecting surface fuel loads.","10.1002/fee.2219","18","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128290997","391","15409295","002-294-289-964-555","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","15409295","391","7"

Findings indicate that burning for social and ecological resource benefits, innovative management paradigms and anticipatory governance systems offer actionable solutions to the wildfire paradox and the limits of suppression. Local adaptive institutions and a reconceptualisation of wildfire as a risk and process beyond technocratic interpretations are necessary to account for broader social conditions shaping wildfire regimes and community impact. Governance systems that accommodate collective action have proven suitable to address multiple wildfire complexities linked with different socio-economic systems and values. A systematic literature review, policy review, and qualitative data collection on wildfire management in Cyprus track back to the initial framing.

The development of the platform is based on the results of a ‘’Needs and Gaps” analysis performed as part of the preparation of the European Commission Staff Working Document – ‘’Overview of Natural and Man-made Disaster Risks the European Union may face’’<strong> </strong>(2014<sup>[3]</sup>, 2017<strong><sup>[4]</sup></strong>,2020<sup>[5]</sup>).  The overview concerned the 31 summaries of the National Risk Assessment (NRA) submitted to the European Commission by the Participant States of the Union of Civil Protection Mechanism.  For multi-hazard assessments, it concluded that a gap exists between the knowledge and data available in the scientific community and the accessibility and usability by Decision Makers and the Civil Protection community. With the DRMKC’s Risk Data Hub development, we support the integration of multi-hazard risk assessment and mapping into evidence-based decision-making, risk-reduction strategies, and adaptation plans.</p><p>Based on this context and utilizing spatial analysis of exposed elements to various hazards across Europe, we present in this study a novel methodological approach for the assessment of multi-hazard potential impact. This methodology is currently implemented on the DRMKC Risk Data Hub WebGIS platform. The methodological approach is based on a hotspot analysis applied to residential area and population exposed to single hazards such as river flood, coastal inundation, earthquakes, landslides, forest fire, and subsidence. Based on different aggregations of the exposure we identify the statistically significant hotspot for the considered hazard exposure. Using Stouffer’s method (Stouffer et al., 1949) for meta-analysis, the statistically significant exposure hotspots for single hazards are combined and subsequently, spatial extension and location of multi-hazards potential impact can be identified.  Consequently, we provide the spatial overview of regions expected to suffer significant multi-hazard potential impacts across Europe at the subnational level. Based on theoretical aspects developed in the literature, we put forward a multi-hazard interaction framework for the sub-national spatial extent across Europe. Finally, a validation of the results against the multi-hazard disaster loss data hosted on the DRMKC Risk Data Hub will be exercised.</p><p>The outcome of this study will provide valuable input for the Disaster Risk Management policy support and will assist national authorities on the implementation of a multi-hazard approach in the National Risk Assessments preparation.</p><p> </p><div> div> p>[1] https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</p> /div> div> p>[2] https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/risk-data-hub#/</p> /div> div> p>[3] EUR-Lex - 52014SC0134 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)</p> /div> div> p>[4] https://ec.europa.eu/echo/sites/echo-site/files/swd_2017_176_overview_of_risks_2.pdf</p> /div> div> p>[5] https://ec.europa.eu/echo/sites/echo-site/files/overview_of_natural_and_man-made_disaster_risks_the_european_union_may_face.pdf</p> p>Stouffer, S., DeVinney, L. & Suchman, E. 1949.

We reviewed 39 studies that reported on soil properties for sagebrush steppe with distinct microsite (undershrub and interspace) patterning that was or was not recently burned. We estimated microsite effects for 21 soil properties and examined the effect of burning on microsite effects during the first year post-fire, before the re-establishment of vegetation. Results indicated that the spatial patterning of biogeochemical resources, in which soil surfaces beneath shrubs are enriched, is resilient to burning. However, microsite effects for soil-surface hydrologic, temperature and erosion characteristics appeared to shift following burning. These shifts appear to create a negative feedback for the spatial patterning of soil properties before vegetation recovery. Relatively long (decades–centuries) historic fire intervals in sagebrush steppe ecosystems likely reinforce spatial patterning of soil resources.

Overall, results revealed that fire had a negative effect on biomass, abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity of all faunas. Similarly, when considering wildfires and prescribed fires the data revealed that both fire regimes have negative effects on fauna. Similarly, fire had negative impacts on aboveground and aboveground fauna across most biomes and continents of the world. Moreover, there was little evidence of changes in pH, moisture and soil depth on soil organisms suggesting that other factors may drive community changes following a fire disturbance. Future research in fire ecology should consider the effects of fire across several species and across larger geospatial scales.

In order to improve our understanding of how fire influences belowground communities, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 published microbial responses to fire. We hypothesized that microbial biomass as a whole, and fungal biomass specifically, would be altered following fires. Across all studies, fire reduced microbial abundance by an average of 33.2% and fungal abundance by an average of 47.6%. However, microbial responses to fire differed significantly among biomes and fire types. For example, microbial biomass declined following fires in boreal and temperate forests but not following grasslands fires. In addition, wildfires lead to a greater reduction in microbial biomass than prescribed burns. These differences are likely attributable to differences in fire severity among biomes and fire types. Changes in microbial abundance were significantly correlated with changes in soil CO2 emissions. Altogether, these results suggest that fires may significantly decrease microbial abundance, with corresponding consequences for soil CO2 emissions.","10.1007/s10533-011-9633-8","109","1-3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006389399","49","01682563","066-222-093-993-513","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","01682563","49","1-3"

Prescribed fires are one of the most effective tools to control and limit the risk of catastrophic wildfires, preserving the natural state of forests. However, indications about the correct use of prescribed fire are needed by forest managers, and the analysis of published data reported in the relevant literature may be essential. This paper presents a review of 41 papers published in international scientific journals in the last 20 years about the hydrological and erosive effects of prescribed fire on forest soils. A quantitative database of observations about water infiltration, soil water repellency, surface runoff and soil erosion has been set up, based on measurements in 85 case studies reported in those articles. The effects of annual precipitation, soil slope, burn severity, fire application season, post-fire ground cover, and vegetation type on post-fire hydrology have been statistically explored using meta-analysis techniques. The bibliographic research has revealed that the case studies are not homogeneously distributed on the global scale but concentrated in few countries. The meta-analysis has shown that water infiltration decreases and soil water repellency appears in the short-term after prescribed fire. Noticeable increases in surface runoff (up to 20-fold the values measured in the unburned soils) and mainly in soil erosion (with peaks of 700-fold the pre-fire conditions) are common in the few months after the prescribed fire. Water infiltration is significantly influenced by precipitation, soil slope, soil burn severity, and vegetation type. All these variables together with burn season and ground cover after fire application are significant factors of variability of surface runoff, while only soil slope, vegetation type and burn season are significant drivers of soil erosion. The period of soil disturbance due to fire on soils commonly last few months, but some studies show that the pre-fire hydrological and erosive response to prescribed fire does not restore after two years. The post-fire increase in soil erosion is higher compared to surface runoff, and the highest soil loss is observed when fire is applied in summer in forest covered by trees, at soil slopes higher than 40%, moderate to high severities. On a practical approach, indications about the control and mitigation of the hydrogeological hazard after prescribed fire are given to land managers as follows: (i) need for post-fire management actions and control of soil burn severity and level of post-fire ground cover burning; (ii) temporal and spatial extensions of experimental activities to multi-year monitoring, catchment-scale investigations and observations also in case of repeated applications of prescribed fire; (iii) integration of the experimental observations with measurements of soil properties, vegetation characteristics and water quality; (vii) guidelines for standardized and appropriate measurement and analytical methods in experimental activities, in order to ensure the comparability of data and consistent interpretation of results.","10.5194/egusphere-egu23-2606","","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155667081","","","099-677-834-355-85X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","",""

Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76–125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.","10.1139/x06-017","36","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036272188","1299","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","1299","5"

Here we analyse capture‐recapture data from two before/after disturbance studies to estimate the effect of fire on local bird survival. Analyses of six bird species at two Mediterranean shrubland sites were combined using a meta‐analysis approach. Two warblers, Sylvia undata and S. melanocephala , were studied at one site altered by prescribed burning, and five passerines ( Luscinia megarhynchos , Turdus merula , Parus major , P. caeruleus and S. melanocephala ) at one site disturbed by wildfire. Based on the combined analysis, annual survival probability significantly decreased from 0.49 to 0.18 (i.e. a 64% decline) after the fire. Our results further suggest a trend for a higher decrease in annual survival associated with wildfire (−72%, from 0.51 to 0.14) than with prescribed burning (−35%, from 0.41 to 0.27), although this should be properly tested with a specific experimental design. In S. undata , a decline in survival in the ‘long‐term’ cannot account for the drop in density observed the first spring after fire. We suggest that a decrease in recruitment rate and an increase in the proportion of non‐breeders immediately after the fire may contribute more strongly to the decline in the breeding population. Our results tend to support the idea that bird populations may respond to moderate disturbances with noticeable time lags, because of individual site tenacity.","10.1007/s10144-003-0155-7","45","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025575762","187","14383896","054-135-887-898-138","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","14383896","187","3"

A principal control on the magnitude of these changes is field‐saturated hydraulic conductivity ( K fs ), which dictates surface runoff generation and is a key input into numerical models. This work synthesizes 73 K fs datasets from the literature in the first year following fire at the plot scale (≤ 10 m 2 ). A meta‐analysis using a random effects analysis showed significant differences between burned and unburned K fs . The reductions in K fs after fire, expressed by the ratio of K fs Burned / K fs Unburned , were 0.46 (95% confidence interval of 0.31‐0.70) combining wildfire and prescribed fire and 0.3 (95% confidence interval of 0.13‐0.71) for wildfire. No significant differences for K fs were observed between wildfire and prescribed fire or moderate and high fire severity. Both K fs magnitude and variability depended more on measurement method than measurement support area at the plot scale, with methods applying head ≥0.5 cm producing larger estimates of K fs . It is recommended that post‐fire efforts to characterize K fs for modeling or process‐based interpretations use methods that reflect the dominant infiltration processes: tension infiltrometers and simulated rainfall methods when soil matrix flow dominates and ponded head methods when macropore flow is critical.

This has led to multiple impacts in the Arctic such as the melting of glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet, sea ice retreat, permafrost thaw, altered species distribution and abundance, changes in hydrology and snow conditions, and altered wildfire regimes. These documented and projected impacts in the region can also propagate across borders, creating risks and opportunities requiring adaptation responses well beyond the Arctic. By undertaking a systematic literature review that uses a conceptual framework for cross‐border climate change impacts, we demonstrate how local impacts of the type described above, which are often analyzed separately in the literature, may initiate knock‐on effects that can be transmitted and transformed across borders. We illustrate examples of six categories of cross‐border risks resulting from this impact transmission and potentially requiring adaptation. These concern biophysical impacts, trade, infrastructure, finance, geopolitical relationships and human security and social justice. We examine potential adaptation options for responding to such cross‐border risks that are of relevance for Europe. The systemic approach taken in this paper promotes improved understanding of trade‐offs between potential benefits and risks, assists priority‐setting for targeting adaptation interventions, and can account for the important role of non‐climatic drivers in amplifying or dampening the cross‐border risks of climate change impacts in the Arctic.

The factors that determine drip water calcium ion concentrations are the soil and vadose zone CO2 concentrations, and the hydrogeochemical evolution of the water from soil to cave. Here, we use a systematic literature review of cave drip water calcium concentrations, combined with PHREEQC equilibrium modelling, to investigate the global relationship between calcium concentration and surface climate. Our results are discussed in the context of understanding the climatic and environmental controls on drip water calcium concentration, speleothem growth rates and proxies of past climate and environmental change. We use an empirical, global soil CO2 concentration–temperature relationship to derive PHREEQC modelled cave drip water calcium concentrations. The global mean modelled drip water calcium concentration is close to that observed, but it over-predicts at high and low temperatures, and significantly under-predicts at temperate conditions. We hypothesise that closed system hydrochemical evolution due to water saturation is an important control on carbonate dissolution at colder temperatures. Under warmer conditions, for example temperate climates with a dry and hot or warm summer, seasonally-limited water availability can lead to: <100% soil cover; water-limitations on microbial and root respiration; wildfire; and prior calcite precipitation, all of which limit drip water calcium concentrations. In temperate climates with no dry season, higher CO2 concentrations than modelled from soil values are necessary to explain the observed drip water calcium values, which we propose is from an additional source of CO2 from microbial activity and root respiration in the vadose zone during open system hydrochemical evolution.","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.06.001","143","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027747155","152","09218181","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","09218181","152",""

These healthcare needs do not cease in disasters; they increase and expand. However, inclusion of GPs in disaster healthcare systems is only just beginning. Systematic review of the health effects of disasters over days, months, and years, shows the major burden of healthcare needs associated with disasters is within the realm of usual general practice. In Australia, Primary Health Networks (PHNs) represent local GPs in each region. They offer the best option for systematic linkage of GPs to the broader DHM system. Method: A systematic review of the literature on the health effects of disasters and three qualitative studies reviewing the current experiences, barriers and facilitators to GP involvement in DHM systems were undertaken through a PhD at the Australian National University in 2022. A knowledge to action framework was developed and utilized to provide a systematic strategy to guide efforts to diffuse, disseminate, and implement the research as it emerged, with a focus on sustaining those changes through integration of PHNs into Australian DHM systems. Results: Integration of GPs, through PHNs, is evolving, through systematic inclusion in planning and policy in local health districts. Over time, evidence-based knowledge of disaster healthcare needs has been incorporated into GP disaster planning and preparedness, and resource development, and utilized by GPs during the recent 2019 Black Summer Bushfires, and East coast Floods. Conclusion: As our knowledge of the healthcare needs of disasters continues to reflect our increasingly challenging and complex world, the proven benefit of active involvement in holistic, comprehensive continuity of healthcare through General Practice in DHM systems through PHN linkage becomes more urgent.","10.1017/s1049023x23003047","38","S1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159958111","s112","1049023x and 19451938","187-703-670-955-90X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1049023x and 19451938","s112","S1"

A systematic review protocol","2016","Environmental Evidence","BackgroundThe role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats has been demonstrated. Yet, the potential of habitat or corridor of their verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) for biodiversity remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the potential of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation should be considered. Moreover, how linear transportation infrastructure verges should be managed in order to favor biodiversity is a crucial question. The present work describes the protocol of the first systematic synthesis of evidence of the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat and/or corridor for biodiversity. Outcomes of the study will be useful for helping managers to improve their practices or for prioritizing actions of ecological restoration.MethodsThe subject population will include both flora and fauna of the temperate climate, either species or communities. Exposures to linear transportation infrastructure verges, interventions of verge management (mowing, pruning, etc.) and environmental disturbances (pollution, wildfires, etc.) will be included. Both temporal and spatial comparators will be considered. Relevant outcomes will include dispersal, species richness and abundance. The scientific literature on the topic of the review may turn out to be very heterogeneous. Various management types, biodiversity outcomes and study designs might be conceived.

It has focused on conservation of ecosystem function through reducing soil erosion and spread of invasive plants. Effectiveness of mitigation treatments has been debated recently. We reviewed recent literature to conduct a meta‐analysis of seeding after wildfires to determine if seedings may (1) protect ecosystems against soil erosion and (2) reduce invasion or abundance of undesirable nonnative plant species. Effectiveness of postfire seedings was examined in 8 erosion and 19 invasive species cases. Seeding has little effect on erosion during the first year after fire and is highly dependent upon initial establishment and coverage of species in successive years. Among all seeding cases, 28% reduced, 67% were neutral, and 5% increased invasive species abundance. Older seedings were more likely to show reductions in invasives than younger seedings. Seedings with high plant establishment were more likely to reduce invasives than those with low establishment. Studies are needed that examine (1) frequency of adequate establishment of postfire seedings and causal factors of success or failure, (2) long‐term impacts of seeding along a range of initial establishment and concomitant plant coverage over time as it relates to erosion and abundance of invasive plant species, and (3) auxiliary treatments designed to increase likelihood of germination and establishment given the inevitable variability of environmental conditions. These studies would aid land managers in deciding when postfire treatments are required and their likely level of success.","10.1111/rec.12021","21","4","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013599824","415","10612971","071-709-822-197-898","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","10612971","415","4"

Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 %, but had no effect on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire significantly decreased ant diversity in forests—especially in tropical forests—whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not. Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests, wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast, fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire, and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature of fire effects on ants.","10.1007/s10531-016-1234-3","26","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012792246","177","09603115","039-194-402-869-977","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","09603115","177","1"

The Mediterranean basin with its hot and dry summers is a hotspot for such devastating events. The situation has further been aggravated in recent years by climate change as well as a growing and aging population in the region. To assess the health impacts due to short-term exposure to air pollution created by the 2021 summer wildfires in the eastern and central Mediterranean basin, we used a regional-scale chemistry transport model to simulate concentrations of major air pollutants such as fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), SO2, NO2, and O3 – in a fire and a no-fire scenario. Elevated short-term exposure of the population to air pollutants are associated with excess all-cause mortality using relative risks (RRs) for individual pollutants from previously published meta-analyses. Our estimates indicate that the short-term exposure to wildfire-caused changes in O3 accounted for 289 (95 % CI: 214–364) excess deaths in total over the entire region of investigation during the wildfire season between mid-July to early October 2021. This is followed by 87 (95 % CI: 56–118) excess deaths due to elevated PM2.5 exposure, rendering the health effect of increased O3 from wildfires larger than the effect of increased PM2.5. We attributed this largely to the spatially more widespread impact of wildfires on O3.

However, global warming, land-use changes and other anthropogenic factors have strongly altered natural fire regimes worldwide. Despite the growing number of studies evaluating the effects of fire on biodiversity, little is understood about how burn affects certain groups that are particularly sensitive to climatic extremes, such as anurans. Here, we conducted a global and systematic literature review of studies assessing anurofauna responses to fire disturbances. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and theoretical information criteria to assess how fire affects anuran assemblages. We analyzed 68 studies, widely distributed in the globe, which examined the fire effects on abundance, richness and/or species behavior. In total, 191 species were considered, being Gastrophryne carolinensis and Lithobates catesbeianus the most evaluated. We reveal a lack of general anurofauna response to fire, as species and assemblages were either negatively or positively affected by burns. We observed that the fire treatments (Prescribed fire, Wildfire and without fire) and the biome where the study was conducted did not explain the variation in species abundance. Most studies were conducted in biomes classified as Temperate Forests, followed by Tropical Savannas and Tropical Forests. We highlight that future studies should consider factors associated to fire (e.g. fire treatment, fire properties), research design and species biology to explain patterns of species persistence and community structure. Although fire plays a key role in shaping several natural ecosystems, we have recently witnessed drastic changes in natural burning regimes all over the world, which imply leading to severe population reductions and even species extinctions. Given this scenario, government authorities should urgently support and invest in scientific studies that evaluate, monitor and test fire management practices in natural ecosystems and therefore establish mitigation actions to preserve the biota constantly threatened by the imbalance of this environmental disturbance.","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119338","495","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138394986","119338","03781127","073-664-707-194-057","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","119338",""

Numerous ecological disciplines use prescribed fire experiments to provide land managers with evidence-based information to support prescribed fire management. Documenting variation in the context and conditions during prescribed fire experimental treatments is critical for management inference, but inconsistencies in reporting critical experimental details can complicate interpretation. Such details are needed to provide ecological and empirical context for data, facilitate experimental replication, enable meta-analyses, and maximize utility for other scientists and practitioners. To evaluate reporting quality in the recent literature, we reviewed 219 prescribed fire experiments from 16 countries published in 11 refereed journals over the last 5 years. Our results suggest substantial shortcomings in the reporting of critical data that compromise the utility of this research. Few studies had specific information on burning conditions such as fuel moisture (22%), quantitative fuel loads (36%), fire weather (53%), and fire behavior (30%). Further, our analysis revealed that 63% of the studies provided precise coordinates for their study area, while 30% of studies indicated the prescribed fire date. Only 54% of the studies provided descriptions of the ignition characteristics. Given these common deficiencies, we suggest minimum reporting standards for future prescribed fire experiments.

Through a systematic and quantitative review of the literature, we provide the first global assessment of pollinator responses to fire. We hypothesize that pollinators increase after fire and during the early postfire succession stages; however, high fire frequency has the opposite effect, decreasing pollinators. Location Terrestrial ecosystems, excluding Antarctica. Time period Data collected from 1973 to 2017. Major taxa studied Insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) and a few bird species. Methods We first compiled available studies across the globe that assessed fire effects on pollinator communities. Then, by means of hierarchical meta‐analyses, we evaluated how different fire regime parameters (fire frequency, postfire time and fire type) and habitat characteristics affect the abundance and richness of animals that act as pollinators. We also explored to what extent the responses vary among taxa groups and life history traits of pollinators (sociality system, nest location and feeding specialization), and among biomes. Results The overall effect size of fire on pollinator abundance and richness across all studies was positive. Fire effect was especially clear and significant in early postfire communities, after wildfires, and for Hymenoptera. Taxonomic resolution influenced fire effects, where only studies at the species/genus and family levels showed significant effects. The main exceptions were recurrent fires that showed a negative effect, and especially wildfire effects on Lepidoptera abundance that showed a significant negative response. Main conclusions Pollinators tend to be promoted after a wildfire event. However, short fire intervals may threat pollinators, and especially lepidopterans. Given the current fire regime changes at the global scale, it is imperative to monitor postfire pollinators across many ecosystems, as our results suggest that fire regime is critical in determining the dynamics of pollinator communities.","10.1111/geb.12939","28","10","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117165129","1487","1466822X","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1466822X","1487","10"

A comparison of effects on selected attributes in coniferous-dominated headwater systems","2005","Forest Ecology and Management","The emulation of natural disturbances is seen by many as an important management paradigm for achieving sustainable ecosystem management. To successfully emulate natural disturbances, managers must first have an understanding of the complex interactions that occur to the biophysical and chemical attributes of an ecosystem for both the natural and the “emulating” disturbance. The management of riparian ecosystems is an important issue faced by managers since the type of harvesting treatment can have a significant influence on the aquatic component. The removal or retention of riparian forests can have a direct influence on water quality and quantity, particularly on the smaller systems that are found at the headwaters of catchments, but do these treatments invoke a similar response as wildfire? To determine if emulation occurs, the affects of forest harvesting treatments and wildfire on temperature, water chemistry, summer stream flow, and sedimentation in headwater systems were compared using a meta-analysis. A statistically significant difference was found for temperature response between partial/selective harvesting and wildfire, but not after clear-cut harvesting. Water chemistry showed statistically significant differences for 11 out of 14 tested attributes, with dissolved organic carbon exhibiting the most marked difference. A significant difference was identified between clear-cut harvesting and wildfire for summer stream flow but not between wildfire and partial/selective harvest systems. Forest harvesting operations were found to emulate sedimentation through forest roads but not harvest treatment. Partial/selective harvest systems may offer the greatest emulation congruency versus clear-cut harvest systems in terms of overall headwater response and recovery. Partial/selective harvest systems combined with prescribed burning may provide managers with the best solution when attempting to emulate wildfire in headwater systems and reduce the detrimental impact of perturbation on these systems.","10.1016/j.foreco.2005.04.015","214","1-3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042158378","305","03781127","179-842-222-634-723","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","305","1-3"

Although soil respiration (SR) is important in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations, a general pattern of the response of SR to fire in terrestrial ecosystems remains unclear. In this study, a meta-analysis of 91 studies on fires across 116 global sites was conducted to investigate the effects of fire on SR and its components. The results revealed that the responses of SR and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to fire were dependent on fire severity (low-, moderate-, and high-severity) and types (wildfire and prescribed fire). Specifically, the high- and low-severity fires reduced SR and HR, whereas moderate-severity fires had negligible effects on these parameters. On average, wildfires significantly decreased SR and HR by 13.9% and 18.6%, respectively, across all ecosystems, while prescribed fire reduced SR by 8.4% but did not change HR. In addition, the responses of SR and HR varied with the ecosystem types. Fire decreased SR in all three types of forests (boreal forests: -14.8%, temperate forests: -13.8%, and tropical forests: -28.9%), whereas decreased HR only in boreal and temperate forests (-23.8% and 20.7%, respectively) but not in tropical forests. Moreover, SR decreased directly followed by an increase, whereas HR declined with time after low- and high-severity fires. At a global scale, the responses of SR and HR to fire largely resulted from the changes in soil organic C, dissolved C, microbial biomass C, and belowground biomass, as indicated by the correlation analysis. In addition, the response of SR to fire was negatively affected by the mean annual precipitation in the forests. Overall, our study revealed the mechanisms driving the effects of fire and provided a framework for understanding soil C emissions under intensified fire regimes.","10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109496","336","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157788263","109496","01681923","164-039-818-682-227","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","01681923","109496",""

Although wildfire smoke is considered a growing risk to public health, few studies have investigated the impacts of wildfire smoke on wildlife, particularly among species that are vulnerable to smoke inhalation. In this review, we synthesized research to date on how wildfire smoke affects the health and behavior of wildlife. After executing a systematic search using Web of Science, we found only 41 relevant studies. We synthesized findings from this literature and incorporated knowledge gained from fields outside wildlife science, specifically veterinary medicine and air pollution toxicology. Although studies that directly investigated effects of smoke on wildlife were few in number, they show that wildfire smoke contributes to adverse acute and chronic health outcomes in wildlife and influences animal behavior. Our review demonstrates that smoke inhalation can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, respiratory distress, neurological impairment, respiratory and cardiovascular disease, oxidative stress, and immunosuppression in wildlife, including terrestrial and aquatic species, and these health effects can contribute to changes in movement and vocalization. Some species also use smoke as a cue to engage in fire-avoidance behaviors or to conserve energy. However, our review also highlights significant gaps in our understanding of the impacts of wildfire smoke on wildlife. Most notably, the lack of robust air pollution measurements in existing studies limits meta-analyses and hinders construction of dose-response relationships, thereby precluding predictions of health outcomes and behaviors under different air quality conditions, especially during extreme smoke events. We recommend that future studies leverage existing data sets, infrastructure, and tools to rapidly advance research on this important conservation topic and highlight the potential value of interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and atmospheric chemists.","10.1088/1748-9326/ac30f6","16","12","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142746462","123003","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","123003","12"

Traits of the dominant species influence litter flammability directly by determining how individual leaves burn and indirectly through the structure of the litter bed. However, we are yet to determine the relative importance of these different drivers across a range of plant species from different biomes. We undertook a meta‐analysis, combining leaf trait, litter structure and flammability data for 106 species from North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The dataset encompassed broad‐leaved and coniferous species from seven different experimental studies. Relationships between leaf traits, litter structure and key flammability metrics—sustainability, combustibility and consumability—were analysed using bivariate and piecewise structural equation modelling (SEM). Traits which characterise the three‐dimensional nature of the leaf and how much space a leaf occupies showed much stronger associations to litter structure and flammability than other morphological traits. Leaf curl, surface area to volume ratio (SAV) and SLA predominately influence litter flammability indirectly via litter structure with SLA being the only leaf trait which had a negative direct effect on flame duration. Packing ratio and bulk density were influenced by different combinations of leaf traits and, in turn, they aligned with different flammability metrics. Bulk density predicted flame spread rate and flame duration whereas packing ratio predicted consumption. Synthesis . We identified key leaf and litter traits which influence different components of litter bed flammability. Importantly, we show that the effects of these leaf and litter traits are consistent across a wide range of taxa and biomes. Our study represents a significant step towards developing trait‐based models for predicting surface wildfire behaviour. Such models will more flexibly accommodate future shifts in the composition of plant species triggered by altered fire regimes and climate change.","10.1111/1365-2745.13561","109","3","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133376927","1344","00220477","109-412-367-314-043","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00220477","1344","3"

In the current study, the literature on the effects of fire on soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C, and total N, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil was reviewed, and the results of a meta-analysis on literature data were reported. Overall, fire significantly increased the soil total N, microbial biomass N, dissolved organic C, and total N, but decreased soil organic C, microbial biomass C, respiration and N mineralization. Among the significant effects of different fire types, wildfire had the higher effects on the soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved total N and respiration of soil than prescribed fire. In addition, responses of soil organic C, total N and N mineralization to wildfire depended on forest type and natural zone. Positive responses of soil organic C, total N were found in broadleaved forests and Mediterranean zones, and negative responses in coniferous forests and temperate zones. Wildfire significantly decreased N mineralization in coniferous forests. The effects of fire on soil microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N mineralization generally decreased with time after the fire. In general, the effects of fire on soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and dissolved total N and N mineralization decreased with increasing soil depth.

Ash applications could be used to emulate wildfire effects on forest soil chemistry. Wildfires and ash applications increase soil phosphorus and calcium and raise pH. Guidance on ash dosage rates and pre‐treatment for emulating wildfire is required. As efforts to combat climate change intensify in Canada and around the world, the use of forest biomass to produce energy is expanding rapidly. At the same time, there is an urgent need for environmentally sustainable methods of handling the ash generated during biomass combustion. Currently, bioenergy ash is often landfilled, placing significant pressure on Canada's waste disposal infrastructure. In some countries, however, the use of bioenergy ash as a nutrient‐rich forest soil amendment is strongly encouraged. Given that forest management in Canada is often driven by the ‘emulation of natural disturbance’ paradigm, bioenergy ash could have potential as a management tool for improving wildfire emulation in harvested stands. We compared published values of wildfire ash chemistry with those for Canadian and European bioenergy ash and found that they are similar. We used meta‐analysis to examine changes in soil carbon and nitrogen pools, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable calcium and soil pH following wildfires and applications of bioenergy ash on upland forested sites. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash can reduce forest floor C and N pools: wildfires by direct combustion of organic matter, and ash applications by an apparent increase in organic matter decay. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash applications increase extractable P, exchangeable Ca and pH in surface mineral soils. Although bioenergy ash applications can trigger larger increases in available P and pH in surface mineral soils than wildfires, controlling ash dosage rates or pre‐treating the ash to slow the rate of nutrient release could attenuate some of these effects.","10.2136/sssaj2018.10.0380","83","S1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117146853","s201","03615995","147-529-071-456-074","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03615995","s201","S1"

We conducted a systematic literature review of empirically based studies that tested the influence of landscape-level fuel treatments on subsequent wildfires in North America over the past 30 years to evaluate how treatment type and configuration affect subsequent wildfire behavior or enable more effective wildfire response.ResultsWe identified 2240 papers, but only 26 met our inclusion criteria. Wildfire sizes ranged from 96 to 186,874 ha and total treated area ranged from 8 to 53,423 ha. Total treated area within a wildfire perimeter was highly correlated with wildfire area (r = 0.89, n = 93 wildfires), and the average proportion of wildfire area that was treated was 22%. All studies demonstrated wildfire behavior changes within treatment boundaries (i.e., site-level effect), but only 12 studies provided evidence that treatments influence wildfires outside of treatment boundaries (i.e., landscape-level effect). These 12 landscape-level papers showed effects on fire severity, fire progression, and fire extent, but were dissimilar in design and analysis approaches, constraining the ability to generalize about the type and configuration of fuel treatments to maximize effectiveness.ConclusionsIt is clear that the state of knowledge based on empirical evidence is at its infancy. This is likely because of the vast challenges associated with designing and implementing sampling designs that account for combinations of spatial and temporal configurations prior to wildfire occurrence. We also suspect part of the reason empirical evidence is lacking is because the distinction between site-level and landscape-level effects is not well recognized in the literature. All papers used the term landscape, but rarely defined the landscape, and some specified identifying landscape-level effects that were truly site-level effects. Future research needs to develop innovative ways to interpret the role of fuel treatments at the landscape level to provide insight on strategic designs and approaches to maximize fuel treatment effectiveness.","10.1186/s42408-022-00146-3","18","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151039493","21","19339747","010-875-832-516-830","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","19339747","21","1"

Anticipation of wildfires is very necessary, therefore a prediction model is needed that can produce predictions with a good level of accuracy. One approach to develop probabilistic prediction models is Bayesian inference. The purpose of this research is to review the methods that can be used in developing probabilistic prediction models using the Bayesian approach. The methodology used is Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which can be used to provide a comprehensive review of Bayesian inference research in developing probabilistic prediction models. The research strategy used was the Boolean Technique applied to database sources including Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ArXiv. The articles used have novelty and ease of explanation of Bayesian methods, especially predictions in the field of climate so that articles are selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that probabilistic models can provide more accurate results than deterministic models. The Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method is a widely used method because it is easy to implement and develop so that the prediction results can be more accurate. The development of probabilistic prediction models with a Bayesian approach has great potential to grow as seen from the development of the number of research publications over the past 5 years. The research position of probabilistic prediction models with Bayesian approaches in the field of climate is dominated by the research community in China with the main problems related to hydrology.

The objectives of this review are to identify the effectiveness of multidisciplinary team response on; 1) the resolution of immediate needs, and; 2) the support perceived among survivors of mass casualty disasters. Background When mass casualty disasters occur, multiple response systems are activated to mitigate the negative consequences of the disaster and to support survivors.1-5 Disaster literature includes descriptions of responses to varied events such as the 1983 Ash Wednesday Bushfires in Australia,1 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the United States,2 large-scale accidents in Norway,3 and the 2004 Asian Tsunami.4,5 In addition to their own physical and/or psychological trauma, disaster survivors are often dealing with the loss of their family members and friends. The needs of these survivors are immense, and one technique that can be used by response organizations is the formation and deployment of multidisciplinary response teams.4,5 These teams are typically composed of individuals trained to respond to and provide referrals for the physical health, mental health, and financial needs of disaster survivors.3,4 In addition, teams such as those utilized by the American Red Cross since 1995 also include individuals trained to respond to the spiritual needs of disaster survivors (S. Stanley, personal communication, May 22, 2011). The third author of this systematic review was involved in the development of the multidisciplinary response team design used by a national disaster response entity. This team format was first composed following the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, U.S.A. in April of 1995.6 The team format was formalized and became known as an Integrated Care Team (ICT) when used to respond to survivors of the World Trade Center incident in New York, New York, U.S.A. on September 11, 2001. Since that time, the ICT structure has been used for other mass casualty disaster responses, although no studies related to its effectiveness have yet been located. Although the ICT format has been viewed as a successful method of intervention, the format was less effective when used to respond to two large tornadoes which occurred in the U.S. states of Alabama and Missouri during the spring of 2011. (S. Stanley, personal communication, May 22, 2011). This review will focus on the target population of survivors of mass casualty disasters. Although each disaster is unique, there are commonalities in the needs of individuals, families, and communities surviving disasters which result in mass casualties. The effect of the type of disaster on team effectiveness, resolution of immediate needs, and support perceived has not been studied in the literature reviewed. The term “Integrated Care Team” is used by at least one International Red Cross/Red Crescent entity; however, the authors have not yet located other disaster response organization that uses this specific term. While the ICT is familiar to disaster responders within the United States, it may not be commonly used in other countries. Therefore, the term “multidisciplinary response team” has been used in the title and study objectives for this review. The term is used to indicate a team of individuals representing various disciplines who are trained to respond to disasters. Disciplines represented in a multidisciplinary response team may include physical health professionals (nurses, physicians, etc.), mental health professionals (psychologists, social workers, etc.), and individuals trained to respond to the financial needs of disaster survivors. The individuals in the latter category may or may not be credentialed professionals. Another function that is sometimes included in the multidisciplinary response to disasters is that of spiritual care. The authors have not yet located any studies in the international literature related to the ICT format, so the focus of the search for relevant literature will be on the multidisciplinary response team. It is often difficult to measure the outcomes of disaster response systems. This can be particularly true when evaluating the response to the complex emotional needs of individuals, families, and communities impacted by a mass casualty disaster. Despite the difficulties of outcome measurement, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of response modalities. Two possible measures of response effectiveness are the resolution of immediate needs and the extent to which disaster survivors perceive they have been supported by the response team.2, 7 Although careful planning, protocol and procedure writing, team member selection, training, and practice are suggested as key factors in providing effective response to disasters,8 a consistent definition of team effectiveness has not yet been located. Team effectiveness has been defined by measurement of participants' perception of received benefits, 7 and through study of efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of early intervention activities.13 Multiple articles have been published describing team response to disasters.1,9-14 While many articles focus on the broad topic of disaster response, some authors have addressed specific methods used by specific disaster response organizations.15 It is acknowledged that the quality and effectiveness of disaster response programs can be difficult to assess.16 Regardless of this difficulty, a few descriptive studies have been published assessing the effectiveness of disaster response teams.2,3,7 The reviewers have not yet located any RCTs or quasi-experimental studies, however, we believe it is important to uncover all literature on the topic. Therefore, this review includes a detailed search strategy designed to discover all relevant literature. Multidisciplinary teams are used throughout various healthcare settings, and numerous articles have discussed the functioning of these teams.4,17,18,19 It is recognized that multidisciplinary teams are impacted upon by multiple challenges including historical, political, economic, and social factors.20 Methodological challenges are also acknowledged as problematic in researching the impact of multidisciplinary teams.21 Despite the prevalence of research on the multidisciplinary healthcare teams, the functioning of multidisciplinary response teams has been less frequently evaluated. Much of the published literature related to multidisciplinary disaster response teams has focused on the training of the team members,22 variations in the team size,23 and barriers to eliciting feedback from disaster survivors.24 Additional topics found in the literature describing multidisciplinary disaster response teams include the use of support networks used to bolster multidisciplinary disaster response teams5 and the types of disasters to which teams have been deployed.25 It has also been recognized that disaster response services must be tailored to the diverse needs of each unique community.26 Very little international literature on multidisciplinary response teams has been found to date, however, the reviewers are hopeful that this systematic review will uncover additional sources. Disaster-related literature indicates the need for standardized methods for needs assessment to be developed4 and for multidisciplinary collaboration to be explored and tested.4,8 Articles describing individual studies and the experiences of teams responding to individual disasters are prominent in the literature. Less is known, however, in a synthesized format about the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary disaster response team's work. This review will therefore synthesize the literature that is available on the effectiveness of these specialized teams. This systematic review will be useful to guide future planning, deployment, and evaluation of these multidisciplinary teams which comprise an essential element of disaster response following mass casualty disasters. A preliminary search of Joanna Briggs Institute Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, DARE, PROSPERO, Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE has been performed for existing systematic reviews on this topic.

Estimates of three billion animals being affected by the fires attracted global attention, but how many of those animals succumbed to the flames? A recent systematic review of fire-induced mortality showed that a surprisingly high proportion of vertebrates typically survive fire (>90%), and a growing body of research is demonstrating behavioural adaptations that might facilitate survival during fire. Behaviours that favour survival are likely to be selected for in fire-prone landscapes and could be fine-tuned over time in relation to fire behaviour and specific fire regimes. Megafires that burn vast areas could act as mass selection events, rapidly filtering ‘fire-naive’ individuals from populations. Applying an evolutionary and behavioural lens to fire ecology will provide novel insights that help predict the ramifications of changing fire regimes on animal species.","10.7882/az.2022.022","42","2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148054529","217","00672238","176-319-234-827-332","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00672238","217","2"

However, peatlands in Southeast Asia have suffered from depletion due to economic pressure and the demand for natural resources, often caused by land use changes and fires. Usually, land preparation requires drainage and fires, resulting in major greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere. In this work, we propose a general equation to estimate GHG emissions from fires on peatlands. The contribution of each parameter to the variance of the estimated GHG emissions was also evaluated. We used Monte Carlo simulation, meta‐analyses, and an analytical expression of variance. GHG emissions of a single fire episode were estimated at 842 Mg ha −1 CO 2 eq. with a standard deviation of 466 Mg ha −1 CO 2 eq. The parameter contributing most to variance was the depth of burn, at 94.2%, followed by bulk density, at 5.5%, and emission factors, at 0.3%. Our estimated GHG emissions were close to the amount estimated from the default values provided by the IPCC, strengthening confidence in the IPCC methodology. When the depth of burn was assessed by remote sensing, the parameter that most contributed to variance became the fire‐damaged area, followed by the depth of burn. The contribution of each parameter to variance, as estimated in this study, made it possible to prioritize the effort in uncertainty reduction. Combining Monte Carlo simulation and an analytical expression of variance could be a promising way of obtaining more reliable confidence intervals. Key Points Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peat combustion due to prospective wildfires in Indonesia were estimated at 842 ± 466 Mg ha −1 CO 2 eq Uncertainties were attributed at 94.2% to depth of burn in a prospective approach, and to fire‐damaged area and bulk density in a retrospective approach Default values of the parameters to estimate GHG emissions from peat combustion were proposed to improve the accuracy of future estimates","10.1029/2019gb006218","35","2","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134139134","","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","","2"

However, there is considerable spatiotemporal variability in the directions and magnitudes of fire effects on soil respiration, and the drivers associated with these effects are not well understood. Here, we conducted a global meta‐analysis of 1327 individual observations from 170 studies to determine the extent to which fire influenced soil total respiration (R s ), heterotrophic respiration (R h ) and autotrophic respiration (R a ). We found fires reduced R s , R h and R a , with an average effect of −11.0%, −17.5% and −40.6%, compared with unburnt sites. Specifically, wildfires significantly reduced R s and R h (−20.4% and −25.0%, respectively), and prescribed fire significantly decreased R a (−74.8%). The influences of fire on R s and its components were moderated by fire severity, season, type, climate zones and biomes. After several years from the time of the fire, the negative effects of fire on R s diminished and then recovered to a state not significantly different from unburnt sites; R h exhibited a similar but decayed temporal response. Similarly, the negative effects on R a disappeared after 3 years following the latest fire. The magnitude of the effect on R s was strongly associated with soil temperature, cation exchange capacity, total nitrogen (N) content and N‐acquiring enzyme activity. In contrast, the magnitude of the effect on R h significantly changed with pH, bulk density, texture, soil C and nutrient contents, and C‐acquiring enzyme activity. Our findings advance the understanding of the inhibition and associated mechanisms of fire on R s and its components, highlighting the need for new research efforts to predict the spatial‐temporal shifts in underground C‐cycling induced by fire.

The 2019–20 bushfire season in Australia burnt 5.4 million hectares of land in New South Wales alone, with smoke so severe it affected cities in Argentina, 11,000 km away. We aimed to determine the effects of i) short-term air pollution triggered by bushfires and ii) high smoke days in increasing the daily number of hospital admissions with cerebrovascular diseases. Methods Hospitalisation data were accessed from the admitted patient dataset from seven local Government areas of Hunter New England Local Health District. The bushfire period was defined from 1 October 2019 to 10 February 2020, and a similar period from 2018-19 as the control. High bushfire smoke days were days when the average daily concentration of particulate matter was higher than the 95 th percentile of the control period. Poisson regression models and fixed effect meta-analysis were used to analyse the data. Results In total, 275 patients with cerebrovascular admissions were identified, with 147 (53.5%) during the bushfire (2019-20) and 128 (46.5%) in the control period (2018-19). There was no significant increase in daily cerebrovascular disease (Incidence Rate Ratio, IRR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.98-1.05; p-value: 0.73) or ischemic stroke (IRR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.87-1.59; p-value: 0.28) admissions over the entire bushfire period. However, the high bushfire smoke days were associated with increased ischaemic stroke-related hospital admissions with a lag of 0-1 days (IRR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.01-1.62; I 2 =18.9%). In addition, during the bushfire period, particulate matter, both PM 10 and PM 2.5 (defined as particulates that have an effective aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns, and 2.5 microns, respectively), were also associated with increased ischaemic stroke admissions with a lag of 0 to 3 days. Conclusion The results suggested an association between particulate matter and high smoke days with increased hospital admissions due to cerebrovascular diseases during the recent Australian bushfire season.","10.1101/2023.04.18.23288775","","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157521153","2023.04.18.23288775","","022-983-365-363-452","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","2023.04.18.23288775",""

Location World‐wide. Methods We calculated indices of the difference in species richness (alpha diversity) and species composition (beta diversity) between burnt and unburnt habitats from studies reporting the species richness and assemblage composition of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. We used a hierarchical approach to investigate the effects of fire on alpha and beta diversity. We tested first for the main effect of fire before investigating the potential influence of fire type (wildfire/prescribed burn), taxon, ecoregion and geographical location (hemisphere/continent). Results One hundred and four studies were evaluated: 56 studies on birds, 26 on mammals, 17 on reptiles and 5 on amphibians. The studies fell into 14 ecoregions, with the three most common being temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, temperate grasslands and savannas and shrublands, and temperate coniferous forest. The effect of fire on species richness and community assemblage composition was strongly influenced by fire type. Prescribed burns significantly increased alpha diversity, whereas wildfires had no overall effect. However, wildfire increased the alpha diversity of temperate coniferous birds in N orth A merica. The effects of fire on alpha diversity were stronger in the N orthern than the S outhern H emisphere. Turnover in species assemblages (beta diversity) was influenced primarily by fire type. Species assemblages in burnt and unburnt habitats were more similar after prescribed burns and generated lower levels of beta diversity than did wildfires. Main conclusions The divergent effects of wildfires and prescribed fires on the alpha and beta diversity of vertebrates and the disparate responses of vertebrate diversity to fires in the N orthern and S outhern H emisphere suggest that there is no general response of vertebrate diversity to fire. Our results provide little support for the patch mosaic burn theory or the intermediate disturbance hypothesis to predict post‐fire responses of vertebrate diversity.","10.1111/geb.12195","23","10","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038373569","1146","1466822X","156-532-042-420-535","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1466822X","1146","10"

The time needed for hydrologic function to return to pre-fire conditions is critical information for post-fire land and water management decisions. This is particularly true in Mediterranean climates, where water is scarce and in high demand, and the severity and area burned by wildfires are increasing. In part, uncertainty about hydrologic recovery is due to lack of a consistent definition or interpretation of what constitutes “recovery.” Here, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from Mediterranean climates with at least three years of post-fire hydrologic data with the objectives of (a) assessing the recovery period, (b) identifying a definition of post-fire hydrologic recovery, (c) demonstrating a simple analytical approach to aid in assessment of recovery, and (d) outlining research needs and opportunities to better quantify post-fire recovery. We assessed the hydrologic effects reported in 38 sites that were monitored for 3–20 years. Eighteen sites were considered recovered within seven years; however, the recovery time was inconsistent across sites and was not related to location, response variable, or study design. The likelihood of recovery within the study period also decreased with increasing proportion of the watershed area burned. Importantly, we have also proposed a standardized definition and an approach to quantifying hydrologic recovery that may facilitate cross-study comparisons and a deeper understanding of recovery. Specifically, we propose hydrologic recovery has occurred when a specific post-fire hydrologic function or condition of interest returns to the 95% confidence interval of the pre-fire condition. In support of this definition, we have demonstrated applying this simple approach to assess recovery and presented future research topics to improve our understanding of long-term post-fire catchment responses. In addition to the need for more studies that quantify hydrologic responses farther into the post-fire period, understanding post-fire changes in soil structural and hydraulic properties through time will improve our mechanistic understanding of post-fire hydrologic responses and recovery.","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126772","602","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140122029","126772","00221694","025-140-413-504-883","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","00221694","126772","7"

Examples include improved wildlife habitat, enhanced biodiversity, reduced threat of destructive wildfire, and enhanced ecosystem resilience. Prescribed fire can also come with costs, such as reduced air quality and impacts to fire sensitive species. To plan for appropriate use of prescribed fire, managers need information on the tradeoffs between prescribed fire and wildfire regimes. In this study, we argue that information on tradeoffs should be presented at spatial and temporal scales commensurate with the scales at which these processes occur and that simulation modeling exercises should include some realistic measure of wildfire probability. To that end, we synthesized available scientific literature on relationships between prescribed fire and wildfire regimes, and their associated ecological and societal effects, focusing specifically on simulation modeling studies that consider wildfire probability and empirical and modeling studies that consider prescribed fire and wildfire regimes at spatial and temporal scales beyond individual events. Both empirical and modeling studies overwhelmingly show that increasing use of prescribed fire can result in wildfire regimes of lower extent and intensity. In some studies, a consequence associated with increased use of prescribed fire is an increase in the total, cumulative amount of fire on a landscape over time. Presumably this has implications for emissions and ecosystem carbon, however, effects on ecosystem carbon dynamics are much less clear as results vary considerably across studies. Results likely vary because studies use various landscape models with different parameter settings for processes (e.g., vegetation succession) and use different methodologies, time frames, and fire management and climate change scenarios. Future syntheses and meta-analyses would benefit from researchers providing more comprehensive and transparent documentation of model parameters, assumptions, and limitations. The literature review also revealed that studies on the implications of prescribed fire and wildfire regimes with regard to values other than carbon and emissions are scant and this represents a critical research need. Empirical studies are needed to calibrate and provide magnitude of order comparisons with simulation models and address tradeoffs with respect to other values (e.g., wildland urban interface, wildlife habitat). Such studies should be conducted with consideration for our framework, which includes the implications of prescribed fire and wildfire across broad spatial and temporal scales.","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118435","475","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129602211","118435","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","118435",""

Historically, the Mediterranean Basin, characterized by hot and dry summers, has been particularly affected by wildfires, and the situation is deteriorating as climate change worsens and the regional populations grow rapidly. To assess the health impacts due to short-term exposure to air pollution caused by the 2021 summer wildfires in eastern and central Mediterranean Basin, we demonstrate a multi-pollutant approach based on the Weather Research and Forecasting online-coupled Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model. The WRF-Chem model was used to simulate concentrations of major air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>, in a fire and no-fire scenario. Elevated short-term exposure of the population to air pollutants were associated with excess all-cause mortality using relative risks (RRs) for individual pollutants based on previously published meta-analyses.</p><p>Our estimates indicate that the additional short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub>, which is predicted to increase due to the wildfires, resulted in the highest number of excess deaths of 608 (95% CI: 456-771) over the entire region of investigation during the wildfire season between mid-July to early October 2021. This is followed by 270 (95% CI: 177- 370) excess deaths due to elevated PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure, rendering the health effect of increased O<sub>3</sub> from wildfires larger than the effect of increased PM<sub>2.5</sub>. This is shown to be largely reasoned by the spatially more widespread impact of wildfires on O<sub>3</sub>. In contrast, the excess mortality caused by NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> emitted from wildfires is estimated low.

Europe and North America were the geographic foci of more research than other regions. Behavioral responses were more reported than technical and infrastructural responses and institutional responses. Within these types of responses, actors used a wide variety of practices such as replanting, altering species composition, and adopting or changing technology. Adaptation efforts in early planning and advanced implementation received some attention, but early implementation and expanding implementation were most reported. While connections between responses and risk reduction were discussed, there is limited evidence of risk reduction. Our review contributes to the scholarly and practical understanding of how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests.

We investigate the extent to which these studies explicate the frameworks, theoretical constructs or theories they rely on.Our findings indicate that about 90% of the studies under consideration do not explicitly refer to a theoretical underpinning. Overall, theories focusing on individuals' SVRA were more frequent than those focusing on systems, society, groups, and networks. Furthermore, the uptake of theories varied according to the hazard investigated and field of knowledge, being more frequent in wildfire and flood studies and articles published in social science journals.We argue that the abundance of empirical material in SVRA research that lacks explicit theoretical grounding is objectionable. As a result, SVRA research seems to spin in circles: researchers repeatedly conduct similar analyses in different geographical settings with inconsistent or incommensurable findings.

This systematic review aimed to identify the current definitions and measurements of psychological preparedness to gain a better understanding of its meaning and the quality of research measures.

The review suggests that psychological preparedness is still an under-researched area, and detailed inspection of the research would suggest there is still a long way to go to eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the psychological preparedness construct.

However, the relations of environmental and watershed variables that drive those effects are complex. We present a Driver‐Factor‐Stressor‐Effect (DFSE) conceptual framework to assess the current state of the science related to post‐wildfire water‐quality. We reviewed 64 peer‐reviewed papers using the DFSE framework to identify drivers, factors, stressors, and effects associated with each study. A total of five drivers were identified and ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in the literature: atmospheric processes > fire characteristics > ecologic processes and characteristics > land surface characteristics > soil characteristics. Commonly reported stressors include increased nutrients, runoff, and sediment transport. Furthermore, although several different factors have been used at least once to explain water‐quality effects, relatively few factors outside of precipitation and fire characteristics are frequently studied. We identified several gaps indicating the need for long‐term monitoring, multi‐factor studies, consideration of organic contaminants, consideration of groundwater, and inclusion of soil characteristics. This assessment expands on other reviews and meta‐analyses by exploring causal linkages between influential variables and overall effects in post‐wildfire watersheds. Information gathered from our assessment and the framework itself can be used to inform future monitoring plans and as a guide for modeling efforts focused on better understanding specific processes or to mitigate potential risks of post‐wildfire water quality. Plain Language Summary Wildfires impact the hydrology and water quality of surface waters that drain burned areas. However, the environmental and watershed factors that drive post‐wildfire water quality are not well understood. We conducted a scoping review of peer‐reviewed publications to assess the current state of the science and identify knowledge gaps. Using the data gathered from the review, we developed a conceptual framework to identify factors that most frequently explain post‐wildfire impacts, the resulting stressors (i.e., changes in the system), and the effects associated with the observed stressors. Precipitation and burn severity are most frequently related to post‐wildfire impacts. Factors such as soil characteristics are studied relatively infrequently. Effects include impaired water quality, increased drinking water treatment, and increased streamflow. Our analysis identified several gaps that can be filled by long‐term monitoring, conducting studies in geographic regions affected by wildfire but where little data exists, expanding current observations to better understand shifts in baseflow contributions, and expanding chemical analyses to include organic contaminants. Key Points Precipitation and burn severity are studied more often than soil and land characteristics to explain post‐wildfire water quality Increased streamflow and impaired water quality are the most documented effects of wildfire, though other effects can be important Knowledge gaps include long‐term monitoring, multi‐factor studies, and consideration of groundwater and organic contaminants","10.1029/2023wr036260","60","7","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173699662","","","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","","7"

The review following PRISMA checklist identified 64 primary studies, published between 2012 and 2022, investigating the association between natural disasters and suicidal behaviour and ideation.Results: The majority of studies related to natural disasters in Japan, China, USA, India and Australia. Over half the studies (n=39) investigated the impact of earthquakes. Other disasters included hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, droughts, wildfires, tornadoes and multiple disasters. Concerning suicide mortality (the most studied suicide-related outcome), there was variability in the suicidogenic impact of earthquakes depending on location, age, sex and time elapsed since the event. While there appeared to be an increase in suicide mortality following drought, investigations of hurricanes/tornadoes and floods found no evidence of suicidogenic impact. Findings relating to other suicide-related outcomes are more consistent, suggesting that exposure to droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, and other natural disasters is associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation and non-fatal suicidal behaviour. Limitations: Publications in languages other than English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese may have been missed.Conclusions: The considerable inconsistency in the findings reported across these studies, particularly relating to suicide mortality, is noteworthy. This may reflect substantive (‘real’) differences in the impact of natural disasters on suicidal behaviour linked to the type of disaster, the socioeconomic and sociocultural context, the type of suicidal behaviour, or other explanatory factors.</p>","10.31234/osf.io/n9eba","","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170602016","","","111-234-514-871-29X","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","",""

Biomass uses included the production of renewable fuels, electricity, biochar, compost, and other marketable products.

The review identified 13 biomass use pathways with adverse impacts on GHG emissions, criteria pollutant emissions, or both—the “bad.” Wildfires are an example of one out of eight pathways which were found to be bad for both climate and air quality, while only two biomass use pathways reduced GHG emissions relative to an identified counterfactual but had adverse air quality impacts.

However, to date, much of the focus of the research and bushfire community education is on physical preparedness, leaving much confusion about what it means to be psychologically prepared. This is in part due to the lack of a well-accepted operational definition and measure of bushfire psychological preparedness. Currently, there is one measure of psychological preparedness, based on stress inoculation theory, which shows relatively strong psychometric properties. However, findings from our systematic review suggest an alternative theoretical approach to defining psychological preparedness i.e. cognitive appraisal and psychological resources that enable people to manage their emotional responses to stress. To the authors' knowledge, no measure has been developed that operationally defines psychological preparedness using the latter theoretical approach. To fill this gap, and to extend the research on psychological preparedness for natural hazards, we have developed the Bushfire Psychological Preparedness Scale (BPPS). The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary analysis of the psychometric properties of the BPPS. Following rigorous testing, the resulting scale was a 33-item self-report tool, which meets the most important criteria for satisfactory reliability and validity. In its current format, this tool can be used by anyone with psychological knowledge seeking to understand the psychological preparedness of an individual for a bushfire.

Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance‐interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally. Insights First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications—i.e., from non‐additive effects– between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio‐ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date. Conclusions Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.","10.1111/geb.12772","27","10","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106785972","1140","1466822X","024-103-301-369-614","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","1466822X","1140","10"

Although some of the existing survey papers have explored various learning-based approaches, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and their subsequent impact on multi-stage wildfire management is notably lacking. This survey aims to bridge these gaps by offering a systematic review of the recent state-of-the-art technologies, highlighting the advancements of UAV systems and AI models from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.","10.48550/arxiv.2401.02456","","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167732696","","","160-272-782-691-505","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","","",""

Disasters such as droughts, wildfires, floods, changes in intensity and timing of temperatures often cause gendered differential impacts. Furthermore, gendered climate vulnerability increases its impacts over time, threatening rural livelihoods and global food security. Consequently, the most vulnerable sections of the society experience severe effects due to their lack of capacity and opportunities to respond to these clime shocks. PROBLEM:Available literature on climate change, agriculture and gender explore vulnerabilities in rural populations through binary gender lenses, whereby men and women are categorised distinctly in terms of needs, climate adaptation and agricultural practices. These studies utilise a narrow gender analysis. In so doing, indicators like age, household types, income and ethnicity are made analytically invisible. METHODS:This paper utilised a systematic review method. Literature from the 1991 to 2020 was utilised in a comprehensive literature review to show how the concept of gender in agriculture and climate change has evolved in the past three decades. A content thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the data. Results: Findings indicated that without considering social variances between and within genders, policy and programming lacks comprehensive insights in responding to differential climatic impacts. This leads to obscurity experienced in one-size-fits-all approaches taken to address the needs of all vulnerable members of society.

A systematic review","2016","Forest Ecology and Management","The prevailing paradigm in the western U.S. is that the increase in stand-replacing wildfires in historically frequent-fire dry forests is due to unnatural fuel loads that have resulted from management activities including fire suppression, logging, and grazing, combined with more severe drought conditions and increasing temperatures. To counteract unnaturally high fuel loads, fuel reduction treatments which are designed to reduce fire hazard and improve overall ecosystem functioning have been increasing over the last decade. However, until recently much of what we knew about treatment effectiveness was based on modeling and predictive studies. Now, there are many examples of wildfires burning through both treated and untreated areas, and the effectiveness of treatments versus no action can be evaluated empirically. We carried out a systematic review to address the question: Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social (saving human lives and property) objectives? We found 56 studies addressing fuel treatment effectiveness in 8 states in the western US. There was general agreement that thin+burn treatments had positive effects in terms of reducing fire severity, tree mortality, and crown scorch. In contrast, burning or thinning alone had either less of an effect or none at all, compared to untreated sites. Most studies focused on carbon storage agreed that treatments do not necessarily store more carbon after wildfire, but result in less post-wildfire emissions and less carbon loss in a wildfire due to tree mortality. Understory responses are mixed across all treatments, and the response of other ecological attributes (e.g., soil, wildlife, water, insects) to treatment post-wildfire represents an important data gap; we provide a detailed agenda for future research. Overall, evidence is strong that thin+burn treatments meet the goal of reducing fire severity, and more research is needed to augment the few studies that indicate treatments protect human lives and property.","10.1016/j.foreco.2016.05.021","375","375","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000724495","84","03781127","130-511-499-800-021","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","84","375"

To maintain the sustainability of ecosystems and protect the values at risk downstream from the fire-affected areas, it is vital to mitigate the increased hydrological and erosive response after fires. Despite soil erosion mitigation treatments have been widely applied after wildfires, their effectiveness has only been assessed in local and regional-scale studies, so the obtained conclusions might be heavily influenced by site-specific conditions.</p><p>To overcome this constraint, a meta-analysis was applied on the scientific literature on post-fire soil erosion mitigation treatments indexed in Scopus. The search resulted in 34 publications from which 53 and 222 pairs of treated/untreated observations on post-fire runoff and erosion, respectively, were obtained. The overall effectiveness of mitigation treatments, expressed as effect size, was determined for the runoff and erosion observations, and further analyzed for four different types of treatments (mulching, barriers, seeding, and chemical). The erosion observations concerning mulches were analyzed for differences in effect size between 3 different types of materials (straw, wood, and hydromulch) as well as between different application rates of straw and wood. The erosion observations were also analyzed for the overall effect size of post-fire year, burn severity, rainfall amount and erosivity, and ground cover.</p><p>The results showed that all four types of treatments significantly reduced post-fire soil erosion, but that only the mulch and barrier treatments significantly reduced post-fire runoff. From the 3 different mulch treatments, the straw and wood were significantly more efficient in mitigating erosion than the hydromulch. The different straw and wood mulch application rates also influenced their effectiveness. Straw mulch was less effective at rates below than above 200 g m<sup>-2</sup>, while mulching with wood at high rates (1300 to 1750 g m<sup>-2</sup>) produced more variable outcomes. Results also suggested that the overall effectiveness of the treatments was greatest shortly after fire, in severely burned sites, providing or promoting the development of ground cover over 70%, and with increasing rainfall erosivity.</p><p>It can be concluded that, in overall terms, the application of the studied post-fire erosion mitigation treatments represented a better choice than doing nothing, especially in sites where erosion is high. However, works on this topic are underrepresented outside of the USA, Spain and Portugal. Most of the studies were conducted at hillslope scale and tested mulching and/or barriers, while larger scales and other treatments were neglected.

The occurrence of wildfires is often linked to increased post-fire hydrological and erosive responses, which are hard to predict due to the complexity of factors involved [2]. Against this background, soil erosion models arise as a resourceful tool in the decision-making process for environments that are or could be affected by wildfires: from prevention to mitigation and from emergency actions to long-term planning. Nevertheless, the current soil erosion models were not originally developed for post-fire conditions, so they are not adapted to include fire-related changes into their predictions [3]. This work aimed to review the scientific advances in the last twenty years in post-fire soil erosion modelling research from a meta-analysis approach.</p><p>To this end, the Scopus database was searched using different combinations of the terms “model”, “modelling”, “fire”, “wildfire” “hydrology”, “erosion”, “runoff”, “burn”, “burnt”, “erosion”, “soil erosion”, “sediment” and “rill”. Afterwards, the following publications were excluded: a) reviews; b) journals without peer-review process; c) books or book chapters; d) reports; e) editorials; f) conference proceedings; g) works in which the modelling was conducted on individual processes; h) studies modelling debris flows and landslides; i) works that did not conduct post-fire and/or erosion modelling; j) works that are not in English. Then, it was identified whether authors included in the models important factors related to soil erosion in fire-affected environments such as changes in water infiltration, burn severity, and/or the application of post-fire mitigation treatments. The main modelling approaches used, the calibration and validation of predicted data, and the use of efficiency indexes were also evaluated. </p><p>The screening resulted in 33 works (43 cases based on the model used) that were not homogeneously distributed worldwide, neither according to the model type used, nor by regions most affected by wildfires. For the calibration process, in 70% of the cases models were adapted to burned conditions but only in 25% of them, individual input parameters were improved to accommodate processes that were not previously represented. Additionally, burn severity and changes in infiltration were considered in 77 and 65% of the cases, respectively, whereas only 26% of the cases corresponded to studies where post-fire mitigation treatments were applied. It is noteworthy that only in 19% of the cases, the predicted data were validated with independent field datasets and uncertainty was assessed in 5% of the studies.</p><p>It is highlighted that further efforts are required on the adaptation of erosion models to burned conditions, evaluating the model performance in both calibration and validation stages for a wider variety of environments and scenarios, in order to accurately predict the hydrological and erosive response after fires.</p><p>[1] Andela et al.

Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales (<25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts (>75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term (<25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire. Ecological restoration in forests across the western US has to carefully balance the budget of ecosystem carbon with competing objectives such as improved wildlife habitat, reduced risk of severe wildfire, and other ecosystem services.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.07.029","429","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106099205","625","03781127","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","625",""

We synthesized information from case studies that documented the influence of fuel treatments on wildfire events. We used a systematic review to identify relevant case studies and extracted information through a series of targeted questions to summarize experiential knowledge of landscape fuel treatment effectiveness. Within a larger literature search, we identified 18 case study reports that included (1) manager assessment of fuel treatment effectiveness during specific wildfire events; (2) fuel treatment effects on fire size, severity, and behavior outside of the treatment boundaries; and (3) the influence of fuel treatments on fire suppression tactics.ResultsSeventeen of the 18 case studies occurred in the western United States, and all were primarily focused on forested ecosystems. Surface fire behavior was more commonly observed in areas treated for fuel reduction than in untreated areas, which managers described as evidence of treatment effectiveness. Reduced fire intensity diminished fire effects and supported fire suppression efforts, while offering the potential to use wildfires as a fuel treatment surrogate.ConclusionsManagers considered treatments to be most effective at landscape scales when fuels were reduced in multiple fuel layers (crown, ladder, and surface fuels), across larger portions of the landscape. Treatment effectiveness was improved by strategic placement of treatments adjacent to prior treatments or past wildfires, in alignment with prevailing winds, and adjacent to natural fire breaks (e.g., ridgetops), efforts that effectively expanded the treatment area. Placement in relation to suppression needs to protect infrastructure also can take advantage of continuity with unvegetated land cover (e.g., parking lots, streets). Older treatments were considered less effective due to the regrowth of surface fuels. Treatment effectiveness was limited during periods of extreme fire weather, underscoring the need for treatment designs to incorporate the increasing occurrence of extreme burning conditions. Overall, fuel treatment effectiveness would be improved by the increased use of landscape-scale treatment designs that integrate fuels, topography, prevailing winds, fire or treatment history, and available infrastructure.","10.1186/s42408-022-00159-y","19","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154236246","1","19339747","190-831-820-034-466","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","19339747","1","1"

However, species dominance shifts from conifers to short-lived deciduous trees, which may negatively impact flora, fauna, and ecosystem services dependent on coniferous forests. These results were primarily driven by studies from North America, highlighting the need for more research that directly measures post-fire forest recovery in other high-latitude regions.ContextAs the size and frequency of wildfires increase across many regions, high-latitude forests may be at particular risk for decreases in regeneration and state shifts post-fire.AimsThrough this systematic review, we sought to determine the general relationship between post-fire tree regeneration densities and latitude in forests above 40° N/S. We expected regeneration densities post-fire would decrease with increasing latitude, and that forest regeneration would be negatively impacted by high burn severities, forest management, harsh site conditions, and unprotected microsites. We also anticipated that light-demanding species with adaptations to fire would replace shade-tolerant species that lack such adaptations post-fire.MethodsWe conducted a literature search that returned over 4500 articles. We selected those that directly measured post-fire regeneration at or above 40° N/S and retained 93 articles for analysis. Fire characteristics, pre- and post-fire tree species compositions and regeneration densities, and regeneration predictors were then extracted from the retained articles. We fit linear mixed models to post-fire regeneration density with latitude and species traits as explanatory variables and also explored the significance and magnitude of predictors that informed post-fire tree species response.ResultsContrary to our expectations, post-fire regeneration increased significantly with latitude. High burn severities and unprotected microsites had negative impacts on post-fire regeneration; higher elevations and more prolific pre- or post-fire reproduction were positively correlated with post-fire regeneration, while management of any type did not have an impact.ConclusionAlthough forests are regenerating after wildfires at the most extreme latitudes included in this study (above 55° N), regeneration is often limited to only a handful of genera: aspen (Populus) and birch (Betula), for example. Regeneration was less abundant at the lower range of our study area. Certain lower latitude forests that occupy marginal habitats are under increasing stress from drier, warmer conditions that are exacerbated by wildfires. Results were largely driven by studies from Canada and the USA and may not be applicable to all high-latitude forests.","10.1186/s13595-023-01213-8","80","1","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166642083","47","12864560","009-444-236-666-728","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","12864560","47","1"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the grass intake and the oxidative status of meat of geese reared in three different agroforestry systems: apple orchard (AO), olives trees (OT) and vineyard (V). Eighty one-day old Romagnola geese of both sexes were divided in four homogeneous groups: control (C), with indoor density of 5 geese/m2 and without pasture access, and the three agroforestry systems (AO, OT, V), with 1 hectare of pasture each. The geese were reared inside a poultry house until 20 days of age. At 21 days of age the animals belonging to AO, OT and V were allowed to outdoor access (pasture), whereas geese of the C group were kept indoor. At 150 days of age, the geese were slaughtered in a commercial slaughterhouse. After 24 h of storage at +4°C the breast and drumstick muscles were analysed to determine the fatty acid profile, the antioxidants content and the oxidative status. All the data were statistically analysed with ANOVA. The results showed that the grazing activity of geese improved the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids content, the n-6/n-3 ratio and the antioxidant content, especially in geese kept in the agroforestry systems enriched with trees (AO and OT). Indeed, the presence of trees make animals feel protected and stimulated them to explore the pasture and consequently to consume more grass. However, the best oxidative status was exhibited by the C geese. In the other groups the higher antioxidants intake through grass was not able to counteract the higher oxidative thrust and consequently, the meat of outdoor reared geese was characterized by a worst oxidative status. Further research is needed to identify new possible strategies to increase the antioxidant content in the muscle in order to reduce the lipid oxidation.

Complex fire histories combined with site factors and other disturbances, such insect outbreaks, led to great variation in understory plant communities, and management activities influence future dynamics of both overstory and understory communities. This variation needs to be considered as part of ecosystem-scale efforts to influence future fires and restore the composition and structure of mixed conifer forests. We undertook a systematic review of published studies evaluating effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in western North American mixed conifer forests. Forty-one studies, published in 50 articles, met inclusion criteria and encompassed projects in seven states in the USA and British Columbia in Canada. Total understory plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density) commonly declined in the short term within 4years after treatment. This may result from damage to plants during tree cutting operations or fire, heavy loadings of slash, little change or even expansion of tree canopies after low-intensity treatments, herbivory, or drought. In contrast, all 7 studies measuring understories longer than 5years since treatment reported increases in understory metrics. Treatments in these long-term studies also persistently decreased tree canopy cover. Most or all native species endured (even if reduced in abundance) through cutting operations or fire. A model of understory response has emerged that treatments generally do not eliminate species, and often benefit species absent or uncommon in untreated forest. Groups of native species (e.g., Epilobium spp.) appear fire-dependent, because they are uncommon or absent in unburned mixed conifer forests and after tree cutting alone. Cutting and prescribed fire applied together resulted in the greatest invasion of non-native plants, but non-native cover was minimal compared to native cover. Few studies examined influences of intensity of tree cutting or severity of prescribed fire, but overstory–understory relationships suggest that treatments must substantially reduce overstory density from maximum values (which can exceed 3000stemsha−1 and 80m2 ha−1 basal area) and tree canopy cover to <30–50% cover to elicit appreciable responses from the forest understory. Few studies examined understory dynamics after wildfire relative to unburned forest, and further work is warranted because wildfire is a likely eventual outcome of passive management in these forests. Across a broad region from the southwestern United States into Canada, prescribed fire and tree cutting consistently increased disturbance-promoted native species in the short term and total understory abundance in the long term. Active management using tree cutting and fire will likely benefit both biodiversity conservation and fire management in current mixed conifer forests.","10.1016/j.foreco.2014.09.009","335","","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020792604","281","03781127","","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","03781127","281",""

Picture story book is a form of disaster management learning that can help children from an early age to prepare for a natural disaster. The aims of this study to develop story books as a disaster management learning media, to improve knowledge and skills of children and teacher about the understanding, principles, and actions of rescue when facing the natural disasters, to increase the teacher’s learning quality in disaster management. Developmental research approach is used to execute the study. A total of 48 children aged 5-6 years have to carry out pre-test and post-test. Pre-test data shows that children's knowledge about disaster management with an average of 47.92% and its improved at post-test with 76,88%. Five theme of story books involves floods, landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, lands and forest fires is the product. Dissemination of five story books are proper for children and improve their understanding of disaster management.

These assessments were not merely disinterested cause-effect analyses or differing environmental interpretations: they were profoundly intertwined with political conflicts and socio-economic changes in the region that did not relate just to planned hydropower dams and the presence of extractive activities, respectively posing an immediate threat of displacement and pollution. The ensuing debates have also discussed wider implications for the future of the region and its population, especially for the Nubian majority that considers it to be their ancestral homeland. This connects an investigation about date palm fires to broader political issues, such as the resource policies of the Sudanese Ingaz regime (1989-2019).In this article, we discuss the subsequent politics of information and evidence that had an essential impact on what data were gathered and made available, and which explanations were given credence by the actors involved. We started out from a set of questions guiding the reconstruction of the preconditions for the outbreak, spread and aftermath of the fires. Why was a place vulnerable to fire? What were the conditions that allowed the fire to happen? How did it actually break out (wildfire, accident or arson)? How did it spread? What conditions facilitated (or hindered) its spread? What was the response of those with an interest in extinguishing it? To what extent was the response successful in putting it out? What was the ultimate damage it caused? What did this event mean for the perception of and/or response to potential future fires? Our subsequent investigation was not defined by the need to identify a specific perpetrator or factor, but was rather aimed at producing a genealogy of circumstances and developments that influenced the way the fires gained ground. At the same time, we had to take into account the complexities of the landscapes and the changing status of date palms both in these landscapes and in human production planning.Parallel to our own investigation, we began to observe the formation of opinions about these fire events, and to record the responses to our becoming involved in the societal debate on which interpretation was convincing. This brought in aspects of our own positionality, especially regarding the politically loaded differentiation between “wild” and “man-made” fires, and between “accidental” and “intentional” fires. Accusations that the Sudanese central government had instigated a huge proportion of these fires were prominent among Nubian anti-dam activists, and the fact that one of us—Mohamed Salah—belongs to that group had implications for how we approached and analysed our research. The fact that we both opposed the Ingaz regime was also cause for reflection.In order to deal with the ensuing methodological complications, we referred to academic debates on research approaches to and methods for the study of spatio-temporal relationships with different environments and evidence-making within the framework of these relationships. We identified walking interviews, a form of perambulatory fieldwork, as an appropriate technique for thinking through these complications, as they combine the detachment process of the interview—as a conversation intended to create a temporary reflective distance from the flow of social practices in order to look at them—with exposure to the familiar, in the sense of paths that have been taken numerous times. After reflecting on the multiple disciplinary contexts in which this technique has been discussed—such as anthropology, memory studies, environmental sociology and human geography—we present examples of fire event case studies that used it as part of the research process. In our presentation of walking interviews, we also use and reflect on different techniques of visualisation and illustration, including geotagged photos in combination with edited transcripts or self-reflective comments. We then offer more systematic reviews of the interpretations that were put forward during these and other interviews during our research.As a result, our article indicates the different ways in which the affected date palm owners considered what exactly they had lost when their palms burned, and whether this may have been intentional. The complex answers to these questions highlighted both social and political processes around the palms. The economic and socio-cultural status of date palms has changed among the resident populations, especially since the second half of the twentieth century. Being intergenerationally linked to families through property relations and shared memories, palm trees and their changing status can simultaneously represent roots and the immovability of origin, or their loss. When one looks at the socio-ecological landscape and the place of date palm fires in it, one therefore finds several layers to the amount of damage done.At the same time, the ongoing political tensions meant that many of the interpretations suggested by date palm owners, activists and government officials had a political thrust, whether accusatory or defensive, often along the lines of pre-existing hostilities. However, we found that in spite of the tense, antagonistic dynamics in the region, these interpretations could not simply be inferred from the various standpoints and interests in these dynamics. Our open-ended conversations with date palm owners, who generally shared opposition to the then ruling party (the NCP), revealed multiple and differentiated processes of interpretation. The juxtaposition of their arguments with statements from a local NCP member attested to the existence of points of convergence amidst their political antagonism around common notions, such as “negligence” and “climate change.” A careful mapping of the boundaries of these shared ideas seems to us to be a valuable mediatory and methodological principle.In conclusion, we confirm the importance of exposure as a crucial element of environmental research, especially if it relates to issues that not only our interlocutors but also we ourselves are invested in, whether emotionally, politically, or otherwise. At the same time, this also requires a highly reflective and critical analysis of subsequent research materials and their sources in order to navigate the intricate methodological complications this type of research process generates.","10.4000/11tb0","5","5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172840703","99","27087034","134-883-375-233-152","Dimensions_246.ris","657205","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/0.ris","27087034","99","5"

In view of this scenario, studies are needed to understand the impacts of catastrophes in the most varied dimensions. The tourism sector emerges as one of the most affected economic segments when disasters occur. For companies in the sector that operate globally, the consequences influence the actions of international entrepreneurs. This study aims to conduct a theoretical discussion of the relationship between catastrophe impacts in the tourism sector and international entrepreneurship. From this purpose, impacts of catastrophes on the tourism sector are identified, as well as the reactions of international entrepreneurship in this context. Therefore, from the literature, impacts of catastrophes on the tourism sector are observed, as in the case of the crisis in the hotel sector. In addition, it results in the main reactions of entrepreneurs in the face of catastrophes.

After identifying the nature of the spatial dependence, OLS estimates of the implicit price of wildfire risk are compared to implicit prices obtained using a spatial error model with three different spatial weighting matrices. Spatially corrected estimates of implicit prices are found to be nearly the same as those obtained using OLS.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recent literature on the research topics of wildland fire in Africa. For this, the Google Scholar, Web of Science and SCOPUS scientific article databases were consulted from 1960 to 2022. Satellite images of fire in Africa via ""NASA FIRMS Fire Archive"" were also downloaded. Descriptive statistics and maps were produced using Excel spreadsheet and QGIS software respectively. T-tests were performed to identify significant differences in the number of studies over the years in R software.The results show that West Africa (45.76%) and Southern Africa (38.41%) have investigated more vegetation fires. As for West Africa, Burkina-Faso (53.08%) paid more attention to this theme. Topics related to the ecology of wildfire (31.46%) and wildfire in relation to biomass (30.33%) were the most studied in Africa. One of the perspectives arising from this study is based on satellite images (remote sensing), which are underdeveloped in fire studies in Africa, despite the fact that they constitute real sources for identifying and predicting the future effects of the repetitive fires experienced by African ecosystems. So, in the future, more emphasis needs to be placed on these themes.

Les thématiques liées à l’écologie des feux de végétation (31,46 %) et les feux de végétation en lien avec la biomasse (30,33 %) sont les plus étudiées en Afrique. L’une des perspectives issues de cette étude est basée sur les images satellitaires (télédétection) qui sont très peu développées dans les études de feu en Afrique pourtant, ces dernières constituent de vraies sources pour identifier et prédire les effets futurs des feux répétitifs que subissent les écosystèmes africains. Ainsi, dans le futur, il faut plus accentuer les études sur ces thématiques.

In such circumstances, there is a need for conservation managers to respond rapidly to implement priority remedial management actions for the most-affected species to help prevent extinctions. To date, priority responses have been biased towards high-profile taxa with substantial information bases. Here, we demonstrate that sufficient data are available to model the extinction risk for many less well-known species, which could inform much broader and more effective ecological disaster responses. Using publicly available collection and GIS datasets, combined with life-history data, we modelled the extinction risk from the 2019-2020 catastrophic Australian wildfires for 553 Australian native bee species (33% of all described Australian bee taxa). We suggest that two species are now eligible for listing as Endangered and nine are eligible for listing as Vulnerable under IUCN criteria, on the basis of fire overlap, intensity, frequency, and life-history traits: this tally far exceeds the three Australian bee species listed as threatened prior to the wildfire. We demonstrate how to undertake a wide-scale assessment of wildfire impact on a poorly understood group to help to focus surveys and recovery efforts. We also provide the methods and the script required to make similar assessments for other taxa or in other regions.

Forest Service planning documents assume (paraphrasing): fire can harm owls and therefore owl territories and other owl habitat must be logged to protect owls from fire (e.g., USDA 2019). Jones et al. agreed with me that severe fire has not yet resulted in substantial declines in spotted owl populations, and fire has not been an overriding driver of recently observed long-term spotted owl population declines. In addition to finding no significant negative mean effects of fire on owls, Lee (2018) reported multiple significant effects of fire covariates on specific owl parameters.

Even though many emerging experimental and epidemiological studies have documented the plausible health effects of the predominating toxic pollutants of haze, the consistency among the reported findings by these studies is poorly understood. By addressing such gap, this review aimed to critically highlight the evidence of physical and psychological health impacts of haze from the available literature in ASEAN countries. Systematic literature survey from six electronic databases across the environmental and medical disciplines was performed, and 20 peer-reviewed studies out of 384 retrieved articles were selected. The evidence pertaining to the health impacts of haze based on field survey, laboratory tests, modelling and time-series analysis were extracted for expert judgement. In specific, no generalization can be made on the reported physical symptoms as no specific symptoms recorded in all the reviewed studies except for throat discomfort. Consistent evidence was found for the increase in respiratory morbidity, especially for asthma, whilst the children and the elderly are deemed to be the vulnerable groups of the haze-induced respiratory ailments. A consensual conclusion on the association between the cardiovascular morbidity and haze is unfeasible as the available studies are scanty and geographically limited albeit of some reported increased cases. A number of modelling and simulation studies demonstrated elevating respiratory mortality rates due to seasonal haze exposures over the years. Besides, evidence on cancer risk is inconsistent where industrial and vehicular emissions are also expected to play more notable roles than mere haze exposure. There are insufficient regional studies to examine the association between the mental health and haze. Limited toxicological studies in ASEAN countries often impede a comprehensive understanding of the biological mechanism of haze-induced toxic pollutants on human physiology. Therefore, the lack of consistent evidence among the reported haze-induced health effects as highlighted in this review calls for more intensive longitudinal and toxicological studies with greater statistical power to disseminate more reliable and congruent findings to empower the institutional health planning among the ASEAN countries.

A systematic review protocol","2015","Environmental Evidence","Background: Forest fires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are common forest disturbances that are expected to increase in importance in coming decades. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage logging, i.e. the felling and removal of the affected trees. However, harvesting these biological legacies may represent a second disturbance whose effects on ecosystem processes add on those of the initial disturbance. Many of the potentially affected processes, such as soil erosion and stream water quality, represent regulating and supporting ecosystem services important for human society. In the last 15 years, much empirical evidence has been gathered on the ecological consequences of this management practice, and it has now become necessary to synthesise this evidence in meaningful ways for managers and decision-makers. Methods: With this systematic review we aim to synthesise the literature on the effects of salvage logging on ecosystem services and determine the effects of major effect modifiers such as disturbance type and intensity, the timing and method of logging, and the type of forest. We will conduct searches of the primary scientific literature, which will be selected and categorised according to its relevance to the topic and its quality. Each relevant article will be read in full to obtain the necessary data for meta-analysis and to identify its main conclusions. Mixed-effects models will be performed to assess the effects of the identified effect modifiers on the effect sizes of the salvage intervention on ecosystem services and to account for random effects arising from studies being performed in the same area. Sensitivity analyses will test the potential effects of study quality, and publication bias will be assessed with the trim and ill method. We will present the results as a narrative review and a meta-analysis.

However, human-induced changes to fire regimes may affect at-risk species groups such as small mammals. We examine the effect of fire on small mammals and evaluate the relative sensitivity to fire among different groups using a systematic review methodology that included critiquing the literature with respect to survey design and statistical analysis. Overall, small mammal abundance is slightly higher, and demographic parameters more favourable, in unburnt sites compared to burnt sites. This was more pronounced in species with body size range of 101 -- 1000 g and with habitat requirements that are sensitive to fire (e.g. dense ground cover): in 66.6 and 69.7% of pairwise comparisons, abundance or a demographic parameter were higher in unburnt than burnt sites. This systematic review demonstrates that there remains a continued focus on simple shifts in abundance with regards to effectoffire and small mammals, which limits understanding of mechanisms responsible for change. Body size and habitat preference were most important in explaining variation in small mammal species' responses to fire.

Plant growth is frequently limited by N and P, and fire has the potential to enhance or moderate the magnitude of N and P limitation in plants with important consequences for long-term net primary productivity and global carbon cycling. We used meta-analysis to explore fire effects on N and P concentrations in aboveground plant biomass among a variety of plants and plant communities worldwide. We show that across all observations, fire enhanced N concentration in plants when N/P ratios in biomass were low, and enhanced P concentration in plants when biomass N/P ratios were high. P concentration increased particularly in woody plants. Furthermore, responses of the N/P ratio in woody plants were more flexible than in herbaceous plants so that fire eased N and P imbalances only in woody plants. Our results suggest that these changes in plant N and P in response to fire may help sustain net primary productivity and persistence of woody plants in fire-affected ecosystems worldwide.

Pre-treatment C stocks and changes in C stocks over two intervals (pre-treatment to first post-treatment year and first post-treatment to a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th post-treatment year, depending on site) were evaluated using meta-analytical methods. Total C storage across the network averaged 185±8 (standard error)MgCha−1, of which 45% was in vegetation, 38% in soil organic matter, 10% in the forest floor and 7% in dead wood. C stored in vegetation was not significantly affected by prescribed fire, but decreased ∼30Mgha−1 as the result of mechanical or mechanical+fire treatment; in contrast, forest floor C storage was reduced by ∼1–7Mgha−1 by fire or mechanical+fire treatment, but unaffected by mechanical treatment alone. Neither dead wood C nor soil organic C was significantly affected by the treatments. At the network scale, total ecosystem C was not significantly affected by fire, though four individual sites did exhibit significant C losses to fire. Mechanical treatment, with or without fire, produced significant reductions of 16–32Mgha−1 during the first post-treatment year, but this was partially balanced by enhanced net C uptake of ∼12Mgha−1 during the subsequent 1–3 years. In terms of C storage and uptake, western coniferous forests responded differently to the FFS treatments than did eastern deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests, suggesting that optimal management for fire, harvesting, and C sequestration may differ between regions.

We conducted an evidence-based review to examine the effectiveness and effects of post-wildfire seeding treatments on soil stabilization, non-native species invasion, and plant community recovery in the western U.S. We reviewed 94 scientific papers and agency monitoring reports identified using a systematic search protocol. As sampling designs have become more rigorous in recent years, evidence that seeding is effective in reducing erosion has decreased. Of highest and high quality studies evaluating soil erosion, 92% (11 of 12) were published since 2000, none of which showed an effective result. Before 2000, the majority of the studies (71%) fell into the lowest quality categories, of which 72% showed seeding to be effective. The majority of studies (20 of 27, 74%) evaluating soil erosion in seeded versus unseeded controls showed that seeding did not reduce erosion relative to unseeded controls. Even when seeding significantly increased vegetative cover, seeded sites rarely supported plant cover levels considered sufficient to stabilize soils within the first and second year post-wildfire. Of the 11 studies evaluating seeding effectiveness for curtailing invasions of non-native plant species, an almost equal percentage found seeding treatments to be either effective (54%, 6 studies) or ineffective (45%, 5 studies). However, the majority of effective and ineffective treatments (83% and 80%, respectively) used non-native species. Sixteen of 26 studies (62%) evaluating seeding effects on plant communities reported that seeding suppressed recovery of native plants, although data on long-term impacts of this reduction are limited. The literature suggests that post-wildfire seeding does little to protect soil in the short-term, has equivocal effect on invasion of non-native species, and can have negative effects on native vegetation recovery, although long-term studies are needed to assess lasting impacts of seeded species.

The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the epidemiological evidence that assesses the associations between wildfire smoke and health outcomes in the perinatal period and childhood. The primary pollutant assessed in this body of research is particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM 2.5 ) from wildfire sources. First, we focus on pregnancy and discuss the unique characteristics of the perinatal period and present a summary of studies of wildfire exposure in pregnancy and effects on maternal and newborn outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and mental health outcomes. We discuss the various methods used to access exposure and ascertain the outcomes and covariate adjustment in epidemiologic analyses. Second, we focus on exposure to wildfire smoke during childhood and review what is known on the effects of wildfire smoke on child health outcomes including health-service use, respiratory symptoms, and asthma. Our chapter concludes by highlighting the gaps in the literature and directions for future research and policy. This area of study on wildfire exposure and health effects during pregnancy and childhood is in a nascent stage and our knowledge in this is expected to change drastically over the next several years.

L.","Effects of fire on the aggregate stability of clayey soils: A meta-analysis","2021","EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","Fire is a natural phenomenon that affects the Earth's biogeochemical cycle. Wildland fires are increasing in frequency and magnitude, possibly owing to climate change. In addition, fire is applied as a tool in agroecosystem management. However, several detrimental effects on soil properties, particularly on soil aggregate stability, might occur. A general explanation is that ""the effects of fire on soil aggregate stability in soil with high clay content, calcium carbonate, and Fe and Al oxides as the principal cementing substances cause gradual improvement in aggregate stability, following fire-heating severity."" In short, the higher the fire severity, the higher is the aggregate stability. A meta-analysis was conducted for assessing the laboratory and field studies to verify this concept. The Scopus (R) platform was used to search for the literature related to ""soil aggregate stability"" AND fire OR heating AND clay OR ""clayey soil."" A total of 10 studies were selected with 16 soil types, 244 burned or heated samples, and 160 control samples. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Metaanalysis was delineated according to the following assumptions: a) field and laboratory studies were tested as two independent subgroups, and a pooled effect was subsequently calculated; b) a random-effects model was used; c) mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for continuous variables. Laboratory and field measurements showed dissimilar effects on soil aggregate stability and evidenced positive effects in the laboratory experiments compared with those in the field. Aggregate stability measured in the laboratory increased by 2.80% after heating. Fire effects measured in the field did not show a significant increase in soil aggregate stability (-0.16%). The overall effects of combined subgroups showed an aggregate stability improvement of 1.49% (confidence intervals 0.80% to 2.17%). However, the weight of the results from the laboratory studies played an important role in the overall effect. The soil clay content was found to be inversely associated with aggregate stability, i.e., the lower the clay content the higher the aggregate stability in soil subjected to fire heating. In conclusion, the aggregate stability of clayey soils rich in Al and Fe oxides does not necessarily improves following fire heating.","10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103802","221","","","","1872-6828","","final_24.ris","86010","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/3.ris","1872-6828","",""

Four of the Australian studies were conducted in very remote populations and in grocery stores, and one was conducted in regional Australia. All of the overseas studies were conducted in rural North America. All of them revealed a positive influence on food environment or consumer behaviour, and all were conducted in disadvantaged, rural communities. Positive outcomes were consistently revealed by studies of initiatives that focused on promotion and awareness of healthy foods and included co-design to generate community ownership and branding.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Initiatives aimed at improving rural food retail environments were effective and, when implemented in different rural settings, may encourage improvements in population diets. The paucity of studies over the past 20 years in Australia shows a need for more research into effective food retail environment initiatives, modelled on examples from overseas, with studies needed across all levels of remoteness in Australia. Several retail initiatives that were undertaken in rural North America could be replicated in rural Australia and could underpin future research. CHAPTER 2: WHICH INTERVENTIONS BEST SUPPORT THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING NEEDS OF RURAL POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING NATURAL DISASTERS?: Objective: To explore and evaluate health and social care interventions delivered to rural and remote communities experiencing natural disasters in Australia and other high income countries.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""STUDY DESIGN"">We used systematic rapid review methods. First we identified a test set of citations and generated a frequency table of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to index articles. Then we used combinations of MeSH terms and keywords to search the MEDLINE (Ovid) database, and screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved references.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SOURCES"">We identified 1438 articles via database searches, and a further 62 articles via hand searching of key journals and reference lists. We also found four relevant grey literature resources. After removing duplicates and undertaking two stages of screening, we included 28 studies in a synthesis of qualitative evidence.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"">Four of us read and assessed the full text articles. We then conducted a thematic analysis using the three phases of the natural disaster response cycle.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">There is a lack of robust evaluation of programs and interventions supporting the health and wellbeing of people in rural communities affected by natural disasters. To address the cumulative and long term impacts, evidence suggests that continuous support of people's health and wellbeing is needed. By using a lens of rural adversity, the complexity of the lived experience of natural disasters by rural residents can be better understood and can inform development of new models of community-based and integrated care services. CHAPTER 3: THE IMPACT OF BUSHFIRE ON THE WELLBEING OF CHILDREN LIVING IN RURAL AND REMOTE AUSTRALIA: Objective: To investigate the impact of bushfire events on the wellbeing of children living in rural and remote Australia.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""STUDY DESIGN"">Literature review completed using rapid realist review methods, and taking into consideration the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement for systematic reviews.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SOURCES"">We sourced data from six databases: EBSCOhost (Education), EBSCOhost (Health), EBSCOhost (Psychology), Informit, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We developed search terms to identify articles that could address the research question based on the inclusion criteria of peer reviewed full text journal articles published in English between 1983 and 2020. We initially identified 60 studies and, following closer review, extracted data from eight studies that met the inclusion criteria.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"">Children exposed to bushfires may be at increased risk of poorer wellbeing outcomes. Findings suggest that the impact of bushfire exposure may not be apparent in the short term but may become more pronounced later in life. Children particularly at risk are those from more vulnerable backgrounds who may have compounding factors that limit their ability to overcome bushfire trauma.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">We identified the short, medium and long term impacts of bushfire exposure on the wellbeing of children in Australia. We did not identify any evidence-based interventions for supporting outcomes for this population. Given the likely increase in bushfire events in Australia, research into effective interventions should be a priority. CHAPTER 4: THE ROLE OF NATIONAL POLICIES TO ADDRESS RURAL ALLIED HEALTH, NURSING AND DENTISTRY WORKFORCE MALDISTRIBUTION: Objective: Maldistribution of the health workforce between rural, remote and metropolitan communities contributes to longstanding health inequalities. Many developed countries have implemented policies to encourage health care professionals to work in rural and remote communities. This scoping review is an international synthesis of those policies, examining their effectiveness at recruiting and retaining nursing, dental and allied health professionals in rural communities.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""STUDY DESIGN"">Using scoping review methods, we included primary research - published between 1 September 2009 and 30 June 2020 - that reported an evaluation of existing policy initiatives to address workforce maldistribution in high income countries with a land mass greater than 100 000 km<sup>2</sup> .</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SOURCES"">We searched MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Emcare, Informit, Scopus, and Web of Science. We screened 5169 articles for inclusion by title and abstract, of which we included 297 for full text screening. We then extracted data on 51 studies that had been conducted in Australia, the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Norway.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"">We grouped the studies based on World Health Organization recommendations on recruitment and retention of health care workers: education strategies (n = 27), regulatory change (n = 11), financial incentives (n = 6), personal and professional support (n = 4), and approaches with multiple components (n = 3).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Considerable work has occurred to address workforce maldistribution at a local level, underpinned by good practice guidelines, but rarely at scale or with explicit links to coherent overarching policy. To achieve policy aspirations, multiple synergistic evidence-based initiatives are needed, and implementation must be accompanied by well designed longitudinal evaluations that assess the effectiveness of policy objectives. CHAPTER 5: AVAILABILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HEALTH WORKFORCE DATA SOURCES IN AUSTRALIA: Objective: Many data sources are used in Australia to inform health workforce planning, but their characteristics in terms of relevance, accessibility and accuracy are uncertain. We aimed to identify and appraise publicly available data sources used to describe the Australian health workforce.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""STUDY DESIGN"">We conducted a scoping review in which we searched bibliographic databases, websites and grey literature. Two reviewers independently undertook title and abstract screening and full text screening using Covidence software. We then assessed the relevance, accessibility and accuracy of data sources using a customised appraisal tool.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SOURCES"">We searched for potential workforce data sources in nine databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Informit, the JBI Evidence-based Practice Database, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library) and the grey literature, and examined several pre-defined websites.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"">During the screening process we identified 6955 abstracts and examined 48 websites, from which we identified 12 publicly available data sources - eight primary and four secondary data sources. The primary data sources were generally of modest quality, with low scores in terms of reference period, accessibility and missing data. No single primary data source scored well across all domains of the appraisal tool.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">We identified several limitations of data sources used to describe the Australian health workforce. Establishment of a high quality, longitudinal, linked database that can inform all aspects of health workforce development is urgently needed, particularly for rural health workforce and services planning. CHAPTER 6: RAPID REALIST REVIEW OF OPIOID TAPERING IN THE CONTEXT OF LONG TERM OPIOID USE FOR NON-CANCER PAIN IN RURAL AREAS: Objective: To describe interventions, barriers and enablers associated with opioid tapering for patients with chronic non-cancer pain in rural primary care settings.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""STUDY DESIGN"">Rapid realist review registered on the international register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) and conducted in accordance with RAMESES standards.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SOURCES"">English language, peer-reviewed articles reporting qualitative, quantitative and mixed method studies, published between January 2016 and July 2020, and accessed via MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, Informit or the Cochrane Library during June and July 2020. Grey literature relating to prescribing, deprescribing or tapering of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain, published between January 2016 and July 2020, was identified by searching national and international government, health service and peek organisation websites using Google Scholar.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"">Our analysis of reported approaches to tapering conducted across rural and non-rural contexts showed that tapering opioids is complex and challenging, and identified several barriers and enablers. Successful outcomes in rural areas appear likely through therapeutic relationships, coordination and support, by using modalities and models of care that are appropriate in rural settings and by paying attention to harm minimisation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Rural primary care providers do not have access to resources available in metropolitan centres for dealing with patients who have chronic non-cancer pain and are taking opioid medications. They often operate alone or in small group practices, without peer support and access to multidisciplinary and specialist teams. Opioid tapering approaches described in the literature include regulation, multimodal and multidisciplinary approaches, primary care provider support, guidelines, and patient-centred strategies. There is little research to inform tapering in rural contexts. Our review provides a synthesis of the current evidence in the form of a conceptual model. This preliminary model could inform the development of a model of care for use in implementation research, which could test a variety of mechanisms for supporting decision making, reducing primary care providers' concerns about potential harms arising from opioid tapering, and improving patient outcomes.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 AMPCo Pty Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>","10.5694/mja2.50881","213","S11","https://lens.org/006-200-233-406-939","S3","13265377 and 0025729x","006-200-233-406-939","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","13265377 and 0025729x","S3","S11"

In addition to these physiological health effects, there is also growing evidence of significant mental health impacts of living through a wildfire event.8,9A review in this issue of Environmental Health Perspectives by Evans et al.10 aimed to clarify what we know about birth outcomes and the health and health care needs of childbearing people during and after exposure to a wildfire. By framing the paper in this way, the authors synthesized understanding of the health impacts through both air pollution and mental health pathways—which are not always possible to distinguish during a wildfire event—and provided a holistic perspective of health outcomes for both the pregnant person and the birthed child.The authors conducted a comprehensive search across four databases but identified only 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These 13 included both quantitative and qualitative studies and included studies not just on the health impacts of the newborn, but also on the health impacts to pregnant people, thus broadening the scope of the findings that have been previously reported in reviews solely on birth outcomes and wildfire smoke.11The lack of studies gave the authors little basis for drawing conclusions about how wildfire smoke affects the health of pregnant people and newborns. However, they stated that the weight of the evidence indicates wildfire smoke is associated with shorter gestation. The literature also supports an association with birth weight that deviates from the standard reference range for the newborn; however, these findings are inconclusive. Six of eight studies found lower birth weight to be associated with wildfire smoke, whereas two found an association with higher birth weight. Both high and low birth weight can be detrimental to the health of the developing child.Across the quantitative studies analyzed, the authors found differences in study design, particularly in exposure assessment, which made it hard to synthesize results or determine which studies were the least biased. Other differences included contextual factors, such as access to prenatal care and health of the study population. Such factors should be further investigated, given that both studies demonstrating higher birth weight following wildfire exposure were conducted in Australia, whereas the six studies showing lower birth weight were conducted not just in Australia but also in the United States and Brazil.The authors identified 1–2 studies for each of a variety of other pregnancy-related outcomes, including birth defects, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, assisted ventilation post birth, gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, posttraumatic stress disorder–type symptoms, challenges in breastfeeding, access to health care, and changes in tobacco or alcohol use after a wildfire. Given the dearth of studies, Evans et al. highlighted the need for more research on these topics, including whether domestic violence against pregnant people increases following wildfire events.This review did document a consistent association between wildfire exposure and increased mental health morbidity among pregnant people exposed to wildfires across three studies. Very few studies on health impacts of wildfires have focused on mental health in general, and even fewer focused on the mental health impacts of pregnant people, despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression.12One key takeaway from this review is that there is an urgent need for more research into the impacts of these extreme events through both mental health and air pollution pathways. It is refreshing for researchers to consider the health of not just the baby but also the pregnant person; the literature on environmental exposures and birth outcomes tends to focus heavily on the child when the health of the pregnant person during and after birth is important in its own right but also important for the newborn to have a physically and mentally healthy parent to care for it. Given worldwide changes in the frequency and severity of wildfires, such information is essential to help inform effective interventions to protect pregnant people and their fetuses from this growing hazard.References1.

Until recently, wildland fuels and fuel consumption have been mapped using traditional methods to estimate the cover, height, and biomass (kg m –2 ). Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in describing and quantifying fuels more accurately with 3D characterization and quantification across large spatial scales. This chapter introduces wildland fuels and approaches to mapping them at scales relevant to smoke management, smoke impacts to communities, and future research needs. Topics covered include (1) an introduction to wildland fuels, (2) traditional approaches to mapping wildland fuels. (3) next-generation approaches to wildland fuel mapping, and (4) research and development needs. Because source characterization of wildland fuels is critical to predicting smoke impacts, reviewing how to measure and map wildland fuel biomass and consumption provides important context for fire and fuels managers, smoke scientists, and policy makers. Although recent developments in 3D fuel mapping are promising, there are still many challenges associated in scaling-measured values to the scale of wildland fire events and assessing wildland fuels such as coarse wood and organic soils (duff, peat lands) that can contribute to long-duration smoke events.

It has therefore been difficult to pinpoint a particular window of time during gestation when an exposed fetus might be particularly susceptible to air pollutants.3 In this issue of EHP, investigators report findings on birth weight arising from a unique research opportunity: the temporary decline in air pollution during the 47 days comprising the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.3 Because Beijing typically has some of the world’s highest levels of air pollution, China was required to reduce local air pollution for the duration of the event as a condition of hosting the Games. After temporarily implementing stricter emissions standards and shutting down nearby industrial polluters, pollutant measurements between June and October 2008 showed reductions of 18–59% compared with pre-Olympics levels. But once the Games were over, air pollution began to rise again.4,5 China launched an intensive effort to clean up Beijing’s air for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The drastic measures did achieve noticeable results. However, levels of air pollution were still high, and air quality varied widely from day to day, as ... The current study included two month-by-month analyses. The authors included only term births (37–41 weeks) and births in which the infant was neither large nor small for gestational age. In the first analysis, the researchers assessed records for 71,803 births at Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital to determine which month of each pregnancy fell during the Games (8 August–24 September 2008). They compared the birth weights with those in which the same month of pregnancy occurred in the same calendar period either one year earlier or one year later. They found the strongest association when the eighth month fell during the Games, with babies born in 2008 weighing an average of 23 g (0.8 oz) more than the babies born in 2007 or 2009.3 In the second analysis, the team used data on air pollution, temperature, and humidity gathered at a site in central Beijing to calculate average monthly concentrations of PM2.5, CO, NO2 and SO2 during each month of pregnancy. They then looked at 32,506 birth records in which women were pregnant for at least one full month during the Games. They found that interquartile increases in the pollutants during the eighth month of pregnancy were associated with reductions of 17–34 g in birth weight, depending on the pollutant. They found no such associations for increased air pollution during other months of pregnancy.3 Lead author David Rich, a public health sciences professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center, says it will take further study to figure out why the eighth month may be a critical time for pregnant women and air pollution exposure. “It could be that the early months are important—if pollution levels went down in the first or second month, it could have a beneficial effect on the baby’s growth—but then the pollution levels went back up after the Olympic Games, so any improvement in birth weight may be ‘washed away.’” He says another possibility is that since late pregnancy is when the fetus grows most rapidly, air pollutant exposure during this time period may affect some biologic mechanism—perhaps the placenta’s ability to deliver nutrients—that impedes fetal growth. A 2014 meta-analysis of previous studies showed that increased concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 across the span of a pregnancy were associated with increases in the risk of low birth weight and decreased birth weight among term births.6 However, a previous natural experiment, which used data from the closure of a large Utah Valley steel mill between August 1986 and September 1987, did not find a difference in birth weights between babies born before, during, or after the closure.7 David Savitz, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University School of Public Health, says he found the new results more persuasive than previous studies looking at the impact of air pollution in reducing birth weights. “Some people are already convinced that it’s a known fact that pollution [lowers birth weights],” he says. “I’m not among them. I’m pretty skeptical about it.” But while this study is far from the final word on the issue, he says it “really adds a significant amount of weight to the evidence in support of an effect on birth weight.” Savitz was not involved in the study. Lyndsey Darrow, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Emory University who also was not involved in the study, says she would like to see a similar study but with a longer duration of reduced air pollution. “Ideally, future complementary studies could take advantage of other natural experiments to investigate the cumulative impact of reducing air pollution over the full course of pregnancy,” she says, adding, “Of course, such natural experiments are hard to come by.”","10.1289/ehp.123-a242","123","9","https://lens.org/012-349-192-950-251","A242","15529924 and 00916765","012-349-192-950-251","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","15529924 and 00916765","A242","9"

Landscape fires include wildfires and land management fires and are associated with hundreds of thousands of deaths per year globally through the contribution to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other sources of air pollution. In this chapter, we describe different exposure assessment techniques that are used to estimate health outcomes from global to regional scales, including atmospheric models, remote sensing, and ground station observations. We then evaluate various methodological approaches used in the epidemiologic literature to assess mortality and respiratory and cardiovascular disease outcomes associated with smoke pollution exposure in adult populations, excluding occupational settings. We describe current gaps in the literature, which include understudied health outcomes, medically and socially vulnerable populations, geographic disparities in health studies, and co-occurring exposures. We conclude with a discussion of interventions to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with wildfire smoke pollution exposure, such as reducing landscape fire risk or limiting smoke exposure in indoor settings. In summation, we here present a contemporary overview of the literature regarding the complex, dynamic issue of landscape fire smoke exposure evaluation, epidemiology, and adult health outcomes.

Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.","10.1016/j.crm.2023.100481","39","","https://lens.org/013-184-707-926-407","100481","22120963","013-184-707-926-407","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","22120963","100481",""

The firefighter’s job is catalogued as a high-risk profession, with high physical requirements; over the last years the firefighter has acquired more competencies other than extinguishing fires; among them interventions in traffic accidents, incidents with hazardous materials, rescues, and forest fires, among others. The traditional image of the fire fighter has given way to new professionals, prepared to face all types of disasters; therefore it is currently referred to as the complete firefighter. The objective of this study was reviewing systematically scientific evidence on the values of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) presented by firefighters.  A total of 19 studies were included, published between the years 2002 and 2012, from the databases: EBSCOhost, SpringerLink, SPORTDiscus, Medline, Embase and Scielo; also from journals like: Journal of Sports Science & Medicine, Occupational Medicine and Psicothema. It is conclude by this review, that based on results from the studies, that in the different populations of firefighters, VO2max ranges from 39,20 to 58,21 ml/kg/min.; it varies according to the initial condition the firefighters have on the different studies proposed by the authors; in general it is determined that a firefighter should have VO2max values over 43 ml/kg/min,, which is the minimum recommended, so at least to have a good aerobic capacity, enabling him/her to perform their basic functions as firefighter.","","","","https://lens.org/013-217-792-326-315","","","013-217-792-326-315","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

The present paper systematically reviews the role of forensic odontologists in various global MDs. Method A comprehensive search of the literature databases (PubMed, Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar), along with cross-referencing published peer-reviewed articles, was conducted. The search included full texts, abstracts or titles, had no inclusion year limit (searched until September 2017) and was limited to the English language. Keywords included a combination of ‘Forensic odontology’, ‘Dental records’, ‘Victim identification’, ‘Natural mass disaster’, ‘Criminal mass disaster’, ‘Accidental mass disaster’ and ‘Victim disaster’. Results Of the included disasters (20), 12 (57.14%) were accidental, 5 (23.80%) natural and 3 (19.04%) were criminal. The maximum number of victims was associated with the Japan tsunami (15892), followed by the Thailand tsunami (4280) and the Estonia ferry disaster (852). A total of 23654 victims were reported, of which 20569 (86.96%) were positively identified. Reports from 17 MDs included the use of FO in victim identification [3025 (14.70%) cases]. In addition, 1094 victims (5.31%; from 7 papers) were identified using FO in combination with other methodologies. The highest percentage of victims was identified using FO following the Kentucky air crash (47; 100%), followed by the Newark air crash (38; 76%), the Nepal air crash (10; 71.42%), the France air crash (56; 65.88%), the Australian bushfire (14; 63.63%), and the Estonia ferry disaster (57; 60.63%). Conclusion FO has played a significant role in victim identification in several MDs around the world. The success of FO-based identification is heavily dependent on the availability of ante-mortem records from general dental practitioners. Hence, adequate knowledge about FO and appropriate dental record keeping among general dental practitioners are critical.","10.1371/journal.pone.0199791","13","6","https://lens.org/016-028-894-930-763","e0199791","19326203","016-028-894-930-763","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","19326203","e0199791","6"

This paper aims to provide a state-of-art weather index insurance design, thereby including methods for natural hazards’ indices calculation, vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) using the Scopus database. First, 364 peer-reviewed articles from 2010 to present were screened for a bibliometric analysis and then, the 34 most cited articles from the past five years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a great research effort on index insurance, the majority of them focused on food insecurity through agricultural and crop insurance. Also, climate change and basis risks were found highly relevant for weather index insurance, but weakly developed, suggesting challenges around food insecurity. Special focus was given to drought hazards, while other hazards such as temperature variation, excessive rainfall and wildfires were slightly covered. Emerging areas, namely agricultural, hydrological, and sustainable index insurance found promissory for insurance. Also, current state-of-the-art lacks methods for incorporating multi-hazard risk evaluation in vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards. Thus, we summarized the most common methods for calculating indices, estimating losses using indices, pricing risks, and evaluating insurance index policies. This review promotes a starting point in weather index insurance design towards a multi-hazard resilient society.","10.5194/egusphere-2022-498-cc1","","","https://lens.org/019-671-950-644-30X","","","019-671-950-644-30X","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Wildfires emit many air pollutants of concern for public health. In this dissertation, I systematically reviewed the scientific literature on which health effects were associated with wildfire smoke exposure, piloted the most sophisticated exposure model to date to estimate PM2.5 exposures during the 2008 northern California wildfires, and assessed the effect of these exposures on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations. The scientific literature documents clear evidence of respiratory health effects from wildfire smoke, most specifically for exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Only inconsistent evidence exists for cardiovascular effects. Several high-quality studies demonstrate significant associations between wildfire smoke exposure and all-cause mortality, but not for specific causes of mortality. To study the 2008 northern California wildfires, I created a spatiotemporal exposure model that used the latest in machine learning methods to combine information from satellites, output from a chemical transport model, and meteorological and other spatial and temporal variables to create an optimal exposure model. The best model had an out-of-sample cross-validated R2 of 0.80. Using this model, I could estimate exposures at any location on any day within the study area. To analyze the health effects of the 2008 northern California wildfires, I estimated exposure at all ZIP codes within the study region and found evidence of increased asthma, COPD, pneumonia, and all-cause respiratory hospitalizations associated with PM2.5 during the fire period. Only for asthma hospitalizations was this effect significantly different from effects for PM2.5 outside of the fire period. I also found some evidence of increased rates of hospitalization for asthma associated with PM2.5 during the wildfire period among women compared to men, and among adults compared to children and the elderly. I also found higher rates of hospitalizations for COPD and pneumonia in ZIP codes with lower levels of owner-occupied housing, but I did not find consistent differences along gradients of other measures of socio-economic status by ZIP code. My research piloted the first spatiotemporal exposure model to use machine learning methods to improve estimation of PM2.5 exposures during wildfires using a combination of satellite data, chemical transport model output, meteorological parameters, and land use information. The results from my epidemiological analysis confirm previous evidence of exacerbation of respiratory health effects from exposure to wildfire PM2.5 and highlight evidence of groups that are more vulnerable to this exposure.","","","","https://lens.org/020-971-013-324-870","","","020-971-013-324-870","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

These sagebrush rangelands comprise a unique biome spanning 11 states, support over 350 wildlife species, and provide important ecosystem services that include stabilizing the economies of western communities. Impacts to sagebrush ecosystem processes over large areas due to the annual grass-wildfire cycle necessitated the development of a coordinated, science-based strategy for improving efforts to achieve long-term protection, conservation, and restoration of sagebrush rangelands, which was framed in 2015 under the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy (IRFMS). Central to this effort was the development of an Actionable Science Plan (Plan) that identified 37 priority science needs (Needs) for informing the actions proposed under the 5 topics (Fire, Invasives, Restoration, Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse, Climate and Weather) that were part of the collective focus of the IRFMS. Notable keys to this effort were identification of the Needs co-produced by managers and researchers, and a focus on resulting science being “actionable.”Substantial investments aimed at fulfilling the Needs identified in the Plan have been made since its release in 2016. While the state of the science has advanced considerably, the extent to which knowledge gaps remain relative to identified Needs is relatively unknown. Moreover, new Needs have likely emerged since the original strategy as results from actionable science reveal new questions and possible (yet untested) solutions. A quantifiable assessment of the progress made on the original science Needs can identify unresolved gaps and new information that can help inform prioritization of future research efforts.This report details a systematic literature review that evaluated how well peer-reviewed journal articles and formal technical reports published between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, addressed nine needs (hereinafter, “Needs”) identified under the Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse topic in the Plan. The topic outlined research Needs broadly focused on understanding sagebrush rangelands and population dynamics important for the conservation and management of sage-grouse and other sagebrush-reliant wildlife species. We established the level of progress towards addressing each Need following a standardized set of criteria, and developed summaries detailing how research objectives nested within Needs identified in the Plan (‘Next Steps’) were either addressed well, partially addressed or remain outstanding (in other words, addressed poorly) in the literature through 2020. Our searches resulted in the inclusion of 333 science products that at least partially addressed a Need identified in the Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse topic. The Needs that were well and partially addressed included:development of biome-wide mapping techniques that provide regularly updated grassland and shrubland vegetation layers (Need 4);generation of spatially explicit greater sage-grouse habitat suitability and population models (Need 5);identification of greater sage-grouse seasonal habitats (Need 6);identification of thresholds for the extent of threats, especially conifer expansion, above which greater sage-grouse and other sagebrush-obligate species cannot persist (Need 8); andstudies of sagebrush community dynamics as those relate to management and restoration of sagebrush rangelands (Need 9).Needs addressed poorly included:investigations of factors conducive and restrictive to greater sage-grouse movement patterns and population connectivity (Need 1);investigations of livestock and other large ungulate (for example, feral horse) grazing effects on greater sage-grouse populations and habitats (Need 2);identification of thresholds of disturbance (especially renewable energy developments) below which greater sage-grouse and other sagebrush reliant species are not impacted (Need 3); andstudies of habitat relationships for sagebrush-reliant species other than greater sage-grouse, songbirds, and small mammals (Need 7).The information provided in this assessment will assist updating the Plan along with other science strategies.","10.3133/ofr20231010","","","https://lens.org/021-088-942-912-734","","23311258","021-088-942-912-734","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","23311258","",""

During public health crises, clear, accurate, and actionable information must be disseminated to multiple audiences swiftly, even as the science and context may be evolving quickly. The challenges for effectively reaching linguistically diverse audiences are multiplied by public health crises. In this chapter, we provide context and theory for understanding potential pitfalls in communicating during public health emergencies and review relevant theoretical frameworks and the research evidence to guide effective communication efforts to mitigate disparities in access to health information and resultant inequities in health outcomes.

The communities neighboring the prison benefited from local and federal remediation efforts. Yet, for people who were incarcerated, interventions such as free bottled water were often restricted.Black and Latinx people are arrested by law enforcement and incarcerated more often and for longer periods of time than their White counterparts.2 An important consideration is that this difference in arrest frequency and incarceration periods does not reflect disproportionate illegal activity; rather, communities of color are patrolled and punished more stringently.3 The lack of access to clean water and possible remediations for incarcerated people, based on the disproportionate targeting of certain communities, disparately impacts Black people and exacerbates racial health disparities. Therefore, we agree with Rempel et al. that more granular assessments of water composition are necessary, especially in marginalized communities, and that, in general, more data relevant to carceral populations should be available. Furthermore, the findings by Rempel et al. lend more weight to the need for decarceration: Carceral contexts make people sick.1People who are incarcerated in the United States experience conditions of confinement that exacerbate poor health outcomes. They also have a disproportionate burden of chronic illness and a high risk of mortality after release.4 A large body of literature connects incarceration and poor health outcomes. Most epidemiological studies have measured incarceration simplistically as a binary or time-varying exposure to assess its health-related effects on individuals, families, and communities.5–7 Due to a variety of barriers, public health research has insufficiently accounted for how conditions of confinement—the social and material conditions within carceral environments—contribute to health inequities. Furthermore, incarcerated people are largely excluded from national disease registries and population surveys that governments rely on to understand determinants of and mobilizing solutions to disparities.In the United States, there is a lack of external oversight bodies with the power necessary to hold carceral actors accountable for exposing incarcerated people to environmental hazards that they are powerless to avoid. As a result, litigation has been the primary tool for addressing environmental hazards in jails and prisons but is often a time- and resource-intensive endeavor that results in inadequate remedies. Indeed, ailments related to polluted drinking water in prisons are frequent topics of litigation in courtrooms across the country.8–10The findings by Rempel et al. have important implications for an emerging body of scholarship focused on intersections of environmental justice, racial justice, and prison abolition. Many prisons were built in impoverished rural communities in landscapes where abandoned coal mines and toxic waste sites had been located11,12 but have largely evaded scrutiny by environmental protection agencies and health departments. In addition, prisons are plagued by aging infrastructure that is deteriorating in the wake of more frequent hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires linked to climate change.13,14 The public health and humanitarian crisis that ravaged jails and prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic put into plain view the hazardous, inhumane, and unhealthy features of carceral environments. For example, an investigation of the 2020 outbreak at San Quentin State Prison revealed that the facility’s HVAC system was essentially pumping droplets of the coronavirus into prison cells and crowded communal spaces.15Additional research is needed to convey the scale of environmental hazards in the built environments of carceral spaces—such as exposures to lead, toxicants, and carcinogens; extreme heat or cold; water- and blood-borne pathogens—that threaten the health and violate the human rights of incarcerated people. Such empirical evidence is crucial for building the case for improving habitability of and decommissioning and closing carceral institutions as a public health imperative.References1.

The countries with the most comprehensive regulatory systems to monitor air pollution are the older industrial nations such as countries in the United Kingdom and the United States. Recent proliferation of low-cost air quality sensors (LCAQS) are making near-real-time air pollution monitoring more prevalent across the globe. While unique challenges exist between regulatory and LCAQS data access and usability, there are common challenges in using these data for decision support and research applications. This chapter discusses common statistical methods for estimating air pollution including spatial interpolation methods, statistical regression methods, machine learning, and chemical transport modeling.

"285","1444","1444","lens","search","unknown","Turner, Michelle C","What is next for occupational cancer epidemiology?","2022","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health","Research on occupational causes of cancer has identified 47 known (Group 1) agents associated with 23 types of cancer through 2017, an increase from 28 agents in 2004 (1, 2). Occupational agents include chemicals and chemical mixtures; radiation and radionuclides; airborne particles and complex mixtures; and metals and metal compounds. The global burden of cancer due to 14 of the Group 1 agents was estimated to total 349 000 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 269 000–427 000] deaths in 2016, or 3.9% (95% UI 3.2–4.6%) of all cancer deaths, including 299 998 or 17.6% (95% UI 13.8–21.3%) of lung cancer deaths (3). There are also exposures in various occupations, industries, or processes classified as Group 1 where the causal agent is not necessarily identified. In 2022, occupational exposure as a firefighter was most recently classified in Group 1, with sufficient evidence among humans for mesothelioma and bladder cancer, and limited evidence for other cancers (4). Despite achievements in identifying occupational causes of cancer, a range of research needs remain, including identifying additional cancer sites for Group 1 agents and more definitive studies for exposures where the evidence among humans remains limited or inadequate (1, 5–7). There may be outstanding methodological concerns or findings that are inconsistent or of poor quality or informativeness. Research recommendations to address classification uncertainties for 20 priority occupational agents have been detailed (8). They include conducting new epidemiological studies in highly exposed occupations or populations, improving (quantitative) exposure assessment including through biomarkers of exposure, enhancing statistical power through extended follow-up or pooled studies, and furthering human mechanistic studies. High quality human mechanistic evidence can provide valuable information when epidemiology studies are not available or feasible (5). A 2019 Advisory Group considered 170 different agents in terms of their suitability for (re-)evaluation with a range of chemical, metal, or complex exposures of relevance for occupational settings prioritized based on new human epidemiology, mechanistic and/or cancer bioassay data (9). There have been calls to update existing cohorts when valuable follow-up time has accrued allowing investigation of the full potential impact of exposures on health (10). There is a longstanding need for occupational epidemiological and exposure assessment studies in low- and middle-income countries, where there are often few or no available studies and exposure levels maybe higher (11–14). There may also be differences in working conditions, exposure patterns, and worker protections (15, 16). Research challenges include declines in participation rates, funding, and research infrastructures (1, 17–19). In parallel, epidemiological research has innovated over time to comprise increasingly larger-scale prospective cohort studies and consortia, use of electronic data linkage, causal inference methods and triangulation of evidence, reinforcing the ongoing utility of observational research methods (20). The recent COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for a global perspective in epidemiological research, multidisciplinarity, and broadening perspectives regarding fundamental underlying determinants of health (21, 22). There have also been calls for greater equity and inclusiveness in health research, both in Europe, and worldwide (23, 24). Efforts to stimulate future research and investment in occupation and cancer may benefit from the use of new rapidly evolving research methods, closer alignment with global public health priorities, and strengthening of international partnerships supporting excellence and inclusiveness in research. For example, a range of methodological advancements have emerged from application of exposome concepts in epidemiology. In Europe, birth cohort consortia seeking to characterize the early-life exposome, as well as other efforts, have driven much innovation (25, 26). The exposome concept was proposed in 2005 to stimulate investment to better characterize environmental exposures throughout the lifecourse using novel technologies, offering a complementary perspective to that of the genome (27). Although occupational exposure has previously not been emphasized, research in the internal and external occupational exposome is now beginning to emerge (28). A range of statistical methods for analysis of multiple correlated exposures have advanced (29). Extended Bayesian profile regression mixture (PRM) models have been used to examine multiple highly correlated ionizing radiation exposures for lung cancer risk among miners (30). An exposome-wide association study examined a range of personal and occupational factors in B-cell lymphoma, suggesting that single-factor research approaches maybe suboptimal for new disease insights (31). There are exposome technologies for personal monitoring of workers (28, 32) and other novel research methods including natural language processing and text mining (33, 34), automated network assembly approaches to summarizing literature (35), efforts to combine epidemiological data with those from other evidence streams (36), and new technologies to facilitate secure decentralized pooled analyses of data (37). However, there is an ongoing need for continued efforts to better characterize the occupational and corresponding non-occupational exposome over the lifecourse. Research priorities include establishing new cohort studies with appropriate biosample collection, improved questionnaire and personal monitoring data, increasing multidisciplinary collaboration to utilize innovative data and methods, and integrating genetic data in exposome studies for causal inference (38-40). At the same time, careful consideration of the policy relevance of exposome studies remains of importance (41), as are continued efforts in conventional epidemiological case–control and cohort studies in occupation and cancer (8). Occupational studies examining exposures of relevance for the general population may favor greater investment (42). There are environmental exposure routes for occupational agents, bystander or spousal exposure to occupational agents, and potential transgenerational health effects (43–45). Birth cohorts may represent a typically underused resource for research in occupation and health (46). Principles for safeguarding integrity in environmental and occupational research have also been outlined (47). Research on occupation and cancer may benefit from closer alignment with recent high-profile initiatives on related topics as well as with global public health priorities. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals note the need for decent work (48). The EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work describes the elimination of work-related deaths by 2030 and reduced illness through improved data collection, updated rules on hazardous substances, including those of relevance for renewable energy technologies (ie, lead, cobalt) or of asbestos exposure in building renovations for greening, increased health literacy at work, and adapting working conditions for patients (49). A large-scale survey of worker exposure to cancer risk factors is being implemented in Europe to collect standardized data across different European countries (50). The Health Environment Agenda for Europe project defined priority areas for research on rapidly changing work and employment conditions, climate change and worker health, working time and long working hours, ageing workers, and neglected work-related diseases (51). Rapidly changing work conditions were exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, with potential direct or indirect effects on health and cancer. Shifts in overall global cancer research focus were also described (52). Increasing unemployment and economic downturns in high- and middle-income countries have been associated with increased cancer mortality for treatable cancers, with less access to healthcare underlying findings (53). There is also increasing interest in precarious employment and potential direct or indirect impacts on health and quality of life (54). Public health efforts directed at catching-up in cancer screening and on improving health systems and public health literacy following the COVID-19 pandemic may offer opportunities to advance cancer control and improved health literacy at work (55, 56). Further, there may greater opportunities for strengthened clinical partnerships for occupational epidemiologists. For example, dramatic gains in survival due to early detection have been demonstrated for lung cancer (57). However, occupational (or environmental) exposures are not systematically incorporated into screening algorithms, and further research and collaboration with clinical partners is warranted (58–61). The potential importance of climate change in cancer, including occupation and cancer, may also not be fully understood (62, 63). Climate change may relate to increasing exposure to environmental or occupational carcinogens, including air pollution, adverse dietary exposures, changes in physical activity levels, ultraviolet radiation, water pollution, infections, and parasites due to extreme weather events, wildfires (4), heat, sea-level rise, and changes in land-use. There may also be disruptions in cancer care. Climate change may further exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequities, and social determinants of cancer. Increasing occupational heat stress is related to acute and chronic health effects as well as reduced productivity (64–66). Studies of occupational heat exposure and cancer risk are beginning to emerge (67). Interventions to jointly address climate change and disease prevention, including cancer, have been proposed (68). There are also new agents rapidly entering the workplace where little is known regarding their carcinogenicity to humans. A planetary health perspective suggests that humanity is outside the safe operating space of the planetary boundary, with increasing production and release of chemical industry production exceeding the ability to conduct safety assessments (69). Lastly, strengthened international partnerships are critical for future advances in occupational cancer research. Efforts in coordination of European birth cohort studies, and later occupational cohort studies, have led to major advancements in research and inclusiveness (25, 26, 70, 71). Network funding initiatives provide valuable support and developed out of a recognized need to increase equitable access to funding and research infrastructures (72). A recent example is the OMEGA-NET COST Action, which sought to improve coordination and harmonization of European occupational cohort studies by connecting researchers through a range of research coordination and capacity building activities, with a particular focus on connecting researchers in traditionally less research-intensive countries (71). Online inventories of occupational cohort studies and exposure assessment tools were developed (73, 74) as were advancements in theoretical frameworks, consensus definitions and recommendations for future research on emerging topics in occupational health (54, 75, 76). The need for occupational epidemiological and exposure monitoring studies in low- and middle-income countries has long been recognized. Priorities for cancer research in low- and middle-income countries have recently been described as separate to those of high-income countries, and highlighted the need to reduce the burden of patients presenting with advanced-stage disease, primary prevention and early detection, and innovative and affordable technology in cancer control (77). Documenting and minimizing exposure to established occupational carcinogens is critical to prioritize interventions and prevent future cancer burden (11, 34, 78). Generating country-specific evidence for effective prevention may be helpful in this regard (77). Research questions on cancers that are of local importance, using appropriate research methods for available infrastructure, and partnerships for mutually rewarding collaborations have been described (77, 79). However, cancer registry and infrastructure challenges have been outlined, including of poor-quality data and an absence of legal frameworks for cancer registration (19). International collaboration has had demonstrated impacts in research and capacity building, though sustained political and financial commitment is needed (16, 80, 81). The occupational epidemiology community has a great opportunity to promote new efforts in occupation and cancer while at the same time reducing inequalities in health and research.

Record temperatures in 2020, as reported in 2021 by the international collaboration, Lancet Countdown, which monitors the health consequences of a changing climate, resulted in increased person-days of heatwave exposure, with serious health consequences, compared with the annual average for the 1986–2005 baseline.1 The world temperature increased 1.2°C compared with the preindustrial period (1850–1900), and the past 7 years have been the hottest 7 years on record.1Heatwaves and rising mean temperatures present major health problems, especially for populations with limited physiological ability or socioeconomic means to respond or adapt to them. Also in 2020, 84 disasters from floods, droughts, wildfires, and storms affected more than 50 million people. Moreover, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are now 50% higher than in the preindustrial era.2 Although energy-related emissions decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, emissions have risen again in 2021.3Importantly, the effects of CECs are ubiquitous, ranging from their effects on an individual's internal biology to their effects on a society's external systems. Sexual maturation, fertility, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, lactation, and menopause (Fig. 1) are subject to short- and long-term negative effects from CECs.FIG. 1. Effects of CECs on women's reproductive health (sexual maturation, fertility, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause). CECs, climate and environmental changes; GDM, gestational diabetes; LBW, low birth weight; PTB, preterm birth.Sexual Maturation and FertilityIn recent years, the global average age for menarche has been declining.4 Importantly, CECs could alter the age of menarche by disrupting food availability, nutritional factors, or through increased toxin/pollutant release.4 Perturbations in the timing of menarche may further affect mental health, fertility-related conditions, cardiovascular disease, and bone health.5 Moreover, an inverse association between mortality and the timing of menarche has been suggested.6The significant amount of pollutants discharged into the environment due to increasing industrial and agricultural activities is a serious threat for human health. Moreover, several of these synthetic chemicals with long half-life times are classified as potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and can affect women's reproductive health.7In addition to the impact of CECs on diet and nutrition, exposure to EDCs has also been associated with early menarche.4 These reproductive toxicants in air pollution can also cause defects during gametogenesis leading to impaired fertility.4 Air pollution may further aggravate asthma,8 which is associated with difficulties in conception.9 EDCs may also adversely affect the ovarian reserve in women and high levels of EDCs have been linked to a decline in ovarian function, infertility, and earlier menopause.10Pregnancy OutcomesPregnant women have been included among the groups most vulnerable to heat stress as the physiological and anatomical changes that occur during pregnancy pose particular challenges to thermoregulation.11 A recent systematic review including a total of almost 33 million births found a significant association between heat, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and stillbirth in the United States.12 It has also been reported that pregnant women who are exposed to higher air pollution levels may be at greater risk for miscarriage, gestational diabetes, PTB, and stillbirths.12,13 Maternal metabolites and metabolic pathways, perturbed by air pollution exposures, may also lead to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes; thus, they can be considered mediators in the causal pathways.14Moreover, prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) has an impact on pregnancy outcomes and the offspring's development and lifelong health, and natural disasters contribute to PNMS.15 PTB and neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring have been associated with PNMS,15 and it is now recognized that maternal stress may be passed on, both intergenerationally and transgenerationally through epigenetic mechanisms.16CECs also affect the distribution of arthropod-borne, foodborne, and waterborne diseases. Arboviral infections transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue, chikungunya viruses, and Zika, may have detrimental effects during pregnancy and may contribute to PTB.17 Zika virus has also been associated with congenital fetal brain abnormalities, including microcephaly.17 Moreover, increased temperatures and rainfall increase the length of the transmission season for parasites with deleterious effects in pregnancy such as Plasmodium falciparum. Pregnant women infected with malaria show not only higher rates of miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death, PTB, LBW neonates, and neonatal death, but also have a higher risk for severe anemia and maternal death.18 Higher temperatures may further increase the risk of cholera and other infections caused by Vibrio bacteria as well as leptospirosis with negative clinical consequences.Lactation and BreastfeedingIn contrast with infant formula, which has a standardized composition, human milk composition changes dynamically throughout the day and throughout gestation. Importantly, human milk can contain environmental pollutants,19 and pollutants with lipophilic properties may have serious effects when absorbed in the neonate digestive track; the presence of heavy metals in human breast milk has been associated with abnormal immune function in the neonate and allergy, endocrine disorders, neurodevelopment delay, and neuropsychiatric disorders later in life.20However, it is important to note that the American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization still recommend breastfeeding for at least the first 6 months of life. Breastfeeding is not only beneficial for the mother and neonate but also for the environment, minimizing the impact on the earth's resources. Specifically, breastfeeding uses less water or land resources, produces no carbon emissions, and generates minimal or zero waste. To put things in perspective, breastfeeding for 6 months saves an estimated 95–153 kg CO2 equivalents per baby compared with infants fed with formula.21 In the United Kingdom alone, the carbon emission savings gained by supporting mothers to breastfeed has been equated to taking between 50,000 and 77,500 cars off the road each year.22MenopauseCECs increase the exposure of women to EDCs resulting in a decline in ovarian function and earlier menopause.10 Specifically, individuals with higher levels of EDCs experience menopause 1.9–3.8 years earlier than women with lower levels of these chemicals.23 EDC-exposed women are also up to six times more likely to be menopausal than nonexposed women of same age.23 Interestingly, CECs may also affect menopause by exacerbating and increasing the duration of symptoms, specifically hot flashes.24ConclusionsThe current climate crisis is threatening global health and disproportionally affects disadvantaged communities. The literature in this space is increasing and opportunities for novel research exist. Importantly, CECs not only negatively impact many stages of a woman's reproductive life but also impact the health of future generations. The impact of CECs on reproductive health can no longer be ignored. Interventions to mitigate CECs are critical to ensuring the future health of women and children worldwide.DisclaimerThe contents of this article represent the authors' views and do not constitute an official position of the National Institutes of Health or the U.S. Government.References1.

Hubbard荣誉教授 Jesse Bell如此说道。“这不是要确定死亡或患病的确切人数，而是关于更多暴露和更大风险的可能性。我们需要了解这些风险如何随未来气候的变化而变化，以便我们能够做好准备并适应变化。”Bell没有参与这项研究。在某些地区，气候变化意味着更热、更干燥—，这些是导致森林大火的首要条件。图片来源： © lstimages/Shutterstock。截至2018年9月，大气中的二氧化碳浓度略高于405 ppm。4 近年来，防止全球平均温度在本世纪超过 2°C （相对于工业化前的基线）已成为气候变化的一项基准。5,6,7 为了实现这一目标，大气中的碳浓度必须保持在550 ppm 以下。在该论文中，研究人员直接比较了两种气候条件下发生洪水和烟雾暴露的预测：“温和”预测变暖约2°C，“高”预测变暖约4°C，这相当于大气中的二氧化碳浓度约为940 ppm。他们预计，在4°与2°变暖轨迹下，2050 年和 2090 年美国将有三分之一的人口居住在受到更大和更频繁的内陆洪水影响的地区。“温暖的大气层比寒冷的大气层容纳的水分更多，” 来自研究公司 Lynker Technologies, LLC 的高级研究员Cameron Wobus说，他负责为这项研究建立未来洪水的模型。“因此，从理论上讲，在更暖的环境中各种类型的风暴系统都能带来更多的降水并产生更多洪水。”野火烟雾的暴露模型是基于预测植被覆盖与干旱程度的变化。作者估计，到2090年，在高度变暖和中度变暖的情况下，将有近1000万人受到烟雾的影响。这包括100万名4岁及以下的儿童和170万名65岁及以上的老人。这两类人群都特别容易受到烟雾的有害影响。8这些风险估计并不是平均分布在全国各地。对于野火烟雾，作者预测将主要集中在西南部，因为这里的火灾频率更高，而在东北部，事件与人口的密度有关联。在极端洪水频率方面，他们预测到2090年西部和东南部将发生重大变化，尤其是在高度变暖的情况下。数据表明，如果不减少排放，加利福尼亚州尤其可能成为受洪水影响最严重的地区，—而西北部和德克萨斯州南部的地区也有一定的影响—。作者指出，许多人可能会经历多次灾害。42项气候风险和脆弱性评估系统综述的共同作者、赫尔辛基大学的博士研究生 Alexandra Jurgilevich9 称赞作者将暴露和风险的动态性纳入人群中，而不是采用常见的方法 去预测孤立事件的危险影响。Jurgilevich 没有参与此项研究。他建议，除了中位数预测，纳入其他人口增长情况可能会增加研究结果在适应和规划方面的可靠性和可用性。Bell表示，这项研究可作为其他研究人员的一个出发点，为全国的城市、郡和州提供应急响应和卫生保健准备方面的实用资源。“他表示，全国的公共卫生部门已经在关注气候变化”。“此类的研究可以给公共卫生部门提供信息，帮助他们制定计划和了解潜在的影响。”Nate Seltenrich, 居住在旧金山港湾区，专门撰写科学和环境方面的文章。他报道的主题涉及能源、生态和环境卫生等方面，并发表在地区、国家和国际出版物上。References1.

Development of better syringes and needles produced a change of practice, instead using landmarks and fascial pops and clicks as well as searching for paresthesia to determine where to inject the local anesthetic. However, this reduced the precision and the success rate to an extent that did not impress many surgical colleagues and was often associated with prolonged paresthesia-induced nerve injury-like sequalae. Nerve stimulator guidance provided a real improvement that increased success rate and reduced the risk for nerve injury. Further, the report by Kapral in 1994 of ultrasound guided regional anesthesia represented a seminal breakthrough that allowed, not only orientation of the needle tip immediately close to the target nerve structures, but also visualization of the local spread of the injected local anesthetic.<sup>2</sup> If not optimal, then the needle tip can be re-localized and the injection repeated until a satisfactory spread is achieved. In a way this represents going full circle from Halstead, thus, allowing perfect visualization of both nerve structures and the spread of local anesthetic. In a sense peripheral regional anesthesia was perfected by ultrasound guidance, especially if occasionally used as a combined technique with nerve stimulation then visualization with ultrasound is difficult (e.g. deep blocks or obese patients). However, as peripheral regional anesthesia became ‘perfected’, a new concept was launched simultaneously in Ireland and Australia in 2007- the landmark-based fascial plane block called the TAP (Transverse Abdominis Plane) block.<sup>3,4</sup> This new concept hinges on the idea of injecting a large volume of local anesthetics in an anatomical fascial plane that contain the nerves of interest. After introducing ultrasound guidance to perform this block, the TAP and many other fascial plane blocks were invented by the dozen and has spread like wildfire. One can wonder where this popularity really come from, since replacing the high-precision techniques of ultrasound guided proper peripheral nerve blocks, with injecting a large volume of local anesthetics in a fascial plane, not seeing the actual nerve structures or adequate spread of the local anesthetic, defy logic. One cannot help wondering if this is merely because many fascial plane blocks do not require much skill or knowledge, especially regarding ultrasound visualization.<sup>5</sup> In summary, when performing the different fascial plane blocks, you will inject your LA in a defined fascial plane but not close to all the nerve structures that you would like to block and, thus, you will rely on a random but favorable spread of the LA to get a reasonable block. Are all fascial plane blocks basically the same? The answer to this is obviously no. Some fascial plane blocks have a quite clear mode of action and does anesthetize well defined nerve structures. Examples of such blocks are the rectus sheath and PECS II blocks where the injection is made close to target nerves that are well known to innervate the area of surgery. Thus, these blocks are in a sense close to the situation of the ilio-inguinal, ilio-hypogastric nerve block, where the injection is done very close to the nerves even if you cannot fully visualize both nerves (e.g. in the obese patient). The Trans-muscular Quadratus Lumborum Block (TQLB) also represents a technique where the injection is made very close to relevant nerve structures and where relatively consistent spread is also seen to the caudal parts of the thoracic paravertebral space (thereby creating a lower Thoracic ParaVetebral Block; TPVB), which partly explain its effect.<sup>6</sup> Other fascial plane blocks rely on being lucky, getting a favorable spread involving all relevant nerve structures, e.g. the TAP, QL I and II blocks. Other fascial plane block, especially the Erector Spinae Plane block (ESPB), or its close relative retrolaminar nerve block, have no defined mode of action, at least regarding how they supposedly produce any analgesic effect in front of the mid-axillary line. Furthermore, since you do not inject close to the nerve structure/structures at hand, it is not surprising that the quality of the nerve block achieved is not as dense as compared to what you achieve with an ultrasound guided proper peripheral nerve block with the injection being performed immediately close to the nerve structures. What fascial plane blocks can do: 1. Meta-analyses show that fascial plane blocks add moderately improved analgesia as compared to placebo or established clinical routine analgesic regimens.<sup>7,8</sup> 2. Provide equipotent analgesia when compared to proper regional anesthetic blocks for surgery associated with limited tissue trauma but not for more major open surgery (e.g. laparoscopic vs. open cholecystectomy).<sup>9,10</sup> 3. Produce rapid and high plasma levels, as well as prolonged elimination half-life, of local anesthetics when compared to intravenous administration.<sup>11</sup> This is caused by very rapid uptake of the local anesthetic from the site of injection by the lymphatic system.<sup>12</sup> 4. Produce local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) both in adults and children.<sup>13–16</sup> 5. Provide equipotent postoperative analgesia as compared to intravenous lidocaine in renal transplant patients.<sup>17</sup> 6. Provide worse postoperative analgesia, with a higher failure rate, when compared to proper peripheral nerve blocking techniques in association with breast surgery.<sup>18,19</sup> What fascial plane blocks cannot do: 1. Provide successful surgical anesthesia on its own, as proper regional anesthesia nerve blocking techniques can (e.g. spinal, epidural, brachial plexus, ankle blocks etc). Thus, they are best employed as part of multimodal analgesia with other systemic analgesics, rather than as sole anesthetic techniques.<sup>20</sup> 2. Spread through substantial anatomical barriers, e.g. ligament structures, in a sufficient and reliable way.<sup>12,21,22</sup> 3. Provide reliable anesthesia of the anterior part of the thorax.<sup>23,24</sup> Of cause, the above is not a fully comprehensive review of the vast literature but do provide a relevant summary of the current situation in the opinion of the author. For more in-depth critical reading, two previous communications by the author are recommended.<sup>25,26</sup> Even proponents of fascial plane blocks, in this case the ESPB, suggest that a large part of its overall moderate effect may just be due to the systemic analgesic effects of the absorbed local anesthetic (11) and this interpretation is repeated by Bryne et al.<sup>24</sup> In summary, the situation may possibly be best illustrated by a quote from a previous Editorial on fascial plane blocks: ‘…, just because fascial planes exist in most parts of the body, it does not mean that injecting local anesthetics into these fascial planes always produces relevant blockade of local nerve structures to the degree that it will produce clinically relevant intra- and postoperative analgesia.’.<sup>25</sup> <h3>References</h3> Halsted WS.

But, what selective pressures led to seed dormancy? A recent study provides a major analysis of the factors driving this trait at the global scale (Zhang et al., 2022). Using c. 12 000 species and 10 million records across the globe, they conclude that dormancy is a strategy for plants living under ‘seasonal/unpredictable’ environments; and suggest that bet-hedging could be the major mechanism behind the pattern. To reach their conclusions the authors relate the proportion of species with dormant seeds in a grid-cell global map against climate variables related to annual precipitation, temperature and seasonality. Then they showed that the most significant variables were those related to climate seasonality that they equate with unpredictable climates (although seasonal climates usually are highly predictable in their seasonal cycles). The mechanism by which an unpredictable environment selects for seed dormancy is via the bet-hedging strategy, that is, spreading germination over a number of years to reduce year-to-year variation in fitness but taking advantage of exceptionally good years for establishment (Cohen, 1966; Philippi, 1993). However, actual unpredictability (i.e. interannual variability; Cowling et al., 2005) was not tested by Zhang et al. (2022). Furthermore, it is difficult to think of a mechanism for the selection of dormancy as an adaptive response to seasonality as such (i.e. predictable intra-annual variation); here nondormancy would appear to be equally adaptive if the same seasonal conditions suitable for germination are repeated every year. There may be some correlation between seasonality and unpredictability but, from a biological point of view, they are quite different constraints and select for different plant strategies. Note that in all of these studies (and here as well, unless otherwise stated), seed dormancy refers to inherent (also called primary or organic) dormancy, which is dormancy driven by seed characteristics, and includes physical, physiological and morphological dormancy (Baskin & Baskin, 2014). Once this dormancy is broken (or if the seeds produced are nondormant), seeds still do not germinate until the hydrothermal conditions are suitable. Overcoming this additional, environmentally imposed dormancy is controlled by when the wet season actually starts or local temperatures reaching certain thresholds, but this imposed dormancy is not considered in current broad-scale studies. The importance of climatic variables, including seasonality, as correlates of (inherent) dormancy aligns well with other recent global studies focused on Fabaceae (Rubio de Casas et al., 2017; Wyse & Dickie, 2018) and on germination responses at the European scale (Carta et al., 2022). Another recent analysis of seedbank data for 2000 species across the globe (Gioria et al., 2020) considered binary variables related to habitat type, habitat openness (yes/no) and disturbance (yes/no) in addition to climate, and came up with a different conclusion. They concluded that habitat-related variables (disturbance and canopy openness), but not climate, affected the ability of seed plants to form persistent seed banks, and concluded that dormancy, the prerequisite for seedbanks, is a bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments. Overall, these studies suggest that the mechanism selecting for seed dormancy is the bet-hedging strategy for dealing with unpredictable environments. Although this is notable in some ecosystems (especially arid regions; Cohen, 1966, Philippi, 1993, Venable, 2007), here we draw attention to the fact that there are other selective pressures unrelated to climate-associated bet-hedging that have shaped seed dormancy in many species across the globe but are not recognized in these recent studies. Our own contributions have been centred on seed germination in fire-prone environments, and hence have an emphasis on fire vs climate. The best-bet strategy A large part of the world has a seasonal climate with a dry season during which the vegetation is highly flammable (mediterranean, savanna, warm temperate, and dry boreal ecosystems). In these ecosystems, wildfires are frequent. Fire intervals are usually shorter than lifespan of the dominant species; thus, they act as a selective force shaping survival and reproductive traits of plants (Keeley et al., 2012). Among the adaptive traits is fire-released seed dormancy (see reviews in Keeley, 1991, Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Fires provide both a mechanism for dormancy release (proximate cause) and conditions (postfire) optimal for germination and establishment (low competition, high resource availability, low predation, low pathogen load) that increase fitness and allow maintenance of the population (ultimate cause). Thus, fires create a unique window of opportunity for recruitment, especially among weakly competitive, shade-intolerant plants. That is, fire is worth waiting for! In order to benefit from postfire conditions, seeds of many species have acquired the ability to survive the passage of fire and detect presence of the fire gap to initiate germination. Seeds possess two means of detecting a fire event in order to break dormancy and prime the seeds for germination: they are sensitive either to heat or chemicals produced during the combustion of organic matter (collectively called ‘smoke’, although it may include ash and charcoal). Species with these mechanisms exhibit two syndromes: heat-released dormancy and smoke-released dormancy (Pausas & Lamont, 2022). The first is associated mainly with physical dormancy and the latter with physiological dormancy, although some seeds may respond to both fire cues (heat may increase permeability to by-products of combustion). There are 100s of articles that provide experimental evidence among many species of the fitness benefits (enhanced germination and seedling establishment) when their seeds are subjected to smoke or heat intensities compatible with fire (reviewed in Pausas & Lamont, 2022). In most cases, these species accumulate seeds in the soil during their entire lifespan, and recruitment occurs in a single cohort after fire (postfire seeder species; Figs 1, 2, Supporting Information Fig. S1). That is, postfire recruitment occurs in a single pulse after fire. Here selection does not favour spreading the risk of recruitment failure over many years (bet-hedging) but, instead, maximizes germination in a single year when conditions are optimal, thus following the first substantial rains after fire. We call this strategy the best-bet strategy (Table 1) or environmental matching (sensu Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Although this strategy entails risks, it has adaptive advantages when fires are sufficiently frequent and predictable to occur within the interval between plant maturation and senescence (Pausas & Keeley, 2014). In these ecosystems, seed-dormancy release is not just a fail-safe response to unpredictable seasonal climates but also a routine response following a stochastic disturbance expected within the lifespan of most species in the plant community.

The first two are recruitment from the soil seed bank, the third from a canopy seed bank (serotinous pine). Photos: J. G. Pausas (top and middle) and S. Greenler (bottom).

Fig. 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Schematic representation of the dynamics of seed recruitment for plants lacking seed dormancy (nondormant; top panel), and for plants with dormant seeds following the bet-hedging strategy (middle panel) and the best-bet strategy (bottom panel). The figure shows the moment of flowering (red asterisk; spring), the germination (black bars; autumn), the seed bank in autumn (empty bars), the recruitment 2 months later (green bars) and the fire (flame; summer). As an example, the seasons are considered as in the Northern Hemisphere, and vertical dotted lines are the end of the year. Under the bet-hedging strategy plants germinate every year, but only produce a significant recruitment in the years with the appropriated conditions (here indicated as wet year). Plants under the best-bet strategy do not germinate until a fire (the heat or the smoke) release their dormancy and then most of the seedbank germinates – thus, they maximize the germination in a single (optimal) year.

Main characteristics of the evolutionary strategies that select for seed dormancy and seed banks (bet-hedging, best-bet) and a strategy that selects for seed dormancy unrelated to seed bank (spatial bet-hedging), together with the nondormant strategy.

Fire-released dormancy is prominent in ecosystems that are seasonal and have dense, woody vegetation that limits recruitment of nondormant seeds. Under such conditions, fires are intense (crown-fire ecosystems) and create extensive gaps for recruitment. Prime examples include mediterranean, warm temperate and subtropical shrublands distributed all over the world (Menges & Kohfeldt, 1995; Bradstock et al., 2012; Keeley et al., 2012; Pausas et al., 2021). Fire-released dormancy also is present, but less important, in grassy ecosystems with scattered woody shrubs and trees (surface-fire regimes) such as Brazilian savannas (Zirondi et al., 2019). Fire-released dormancy is almost absent in deserts, extremely cold environments and rainforests; in some of these ecosystems, seed dormancy may be common but unlinked to fire (nonfire-released dormancy), and thus is more aligned to the bet-hedging strategy. For Helianthemum, a large genus in Cistaceae, loss of hard-seededness and heat-released dormancy are notable only among a few recently evolved species that now occupy fire-free habitats, such as gypsum outcrops, deserts and saline wetlands (Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Serotiny (delayed seed release and dispersal) also is a strategy to accumulate seeds over the years, in this case held in closed cones or fruits stored in the plant crown (Lamont et al., 2020). It occurs mainly among conifers (in the Northern Hemisphere), and in a range of families in the Southern Hemisphere (Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, Casuarinaceae, Bruniaceae, and more rarely among Asteraceae, Anacardiaceae and Ericaceae). Fire again is the mechanism for cone/fruit opening and for creating the appropriate environment for dispersal and for suitable recruitment conditions of the dispersed seeds. Consequently, serotinous species recruit mostly after fire and not during the interfire period. Thus, serotiny (via pyriscence, fire-induced seed release) may also be viewed as an example of accumulating a seed bank as best-bet strategy. The importance of fire does not mean that climate is unimportant in shaping seed dormancy in fire-prone ecosystems. For instance, summer temperatures determine the heat thresholds for dormancy release to ensure seed bank persistence – by avoiding germination before a fire (Zomer et al., 2022). Under a warming climate, summer temperatures may cross thresholds for dormancy release and stimulate germination under suboptimal conditions, thus depleting the seedbank and jeopardizing the postfire recruitment. In that sense, species with heat-released dormancy may be more sensitive to climate change than species with smoke-released dormancy. In addition, final germination not only depends on (inherent) dormancy release, but also on the hydrothermal conditions for germination (imposed-dormancy release), and this makes seed-bank species sensitive to climatic change. For instance, higher temperatures may maintain imposed dormancy for longer, resulting in reduced postfire germination, despite receiving the appropriate stimulus for dormancy release (e.g. fire; Arnolds et al., 2015). Furthermore, many species with seed dormancy that form the seed bank have dry fruits that are dispersed at relatively short distances (myrmecochory, autochory) and thus their potential migration in a rapidly warming planet is limited. Long-distance seed dispersal ‘Bet-hedging’ and ‘best-bet’ are two strategies that select for seed dormancy in order to accumulate a seed bank and thus delay germination until conditions become more suitable. There is a further driver that selects for seed dormancy that does not imply the formation of seed banks. Many seeds have acquired seed dormancy to facilitate long-distance dispersal and thus spread germination across the landscape. The clearest example is dispersal by vertebrate frugivores (endozoochory by birds, bats, mammals and reptiles; Levey et al., 2002, Traveset et al., 2007). Frugivores consume the fruit pulp and defaecate or regurgitate the seeds far from the mother plant. This means that seeds need to resist passage through the gut and remain intact until arriving at a new microsite for germination. In such a way, plants benefit from long-distance dispersal to a potentially optimal microsite, often including the faecal material acting as fertilizer (Dinerstein & Wemmer, 1988; Traveset et al., 2007). Thus, seeds of fleshy fruited species typically are dormant, and scarification through the gut releases their dormancy (chemical and/or mechanical scarification, and more rarely removal of inhibitors in the pulp; Traveset et al., 2007). Although bet-hedging spreads germination of seeds accumulated in the seed bank over time, this strategy spreads the annual seed crop across space and thus it could be viewed as a spatial bet-hedging strategy (Table 1). Concluding remarks Climate is by no means the only driver of seed dormancy, nor is bet-hedging the only mechanism that shapes dormancy. Correlative studies based on climate datasets are unlikely to capture the diversity of adaptive strategies plants acquired to maximize their fitness; disturbances and species interactions also need to be considered. Despite the ubiquitous presence of fire across the globe (Archibald et al., 2013) and through geological time (Scott, 2018), recent seed dormancy reviews (noted above) fail to consider fire as drivers for the evolution of seed dormancy. However, fire-prone ecosystems are hotspots of seed dormancy that allow seed banks to accumulate in both the soil and the canopy (Keeley, 1991; Lamont et al., 2020; Pausas & Lamont, 2022). We need to overcome the ‘fire blindness’ syndrome (sensu Pausas & Lamont, 2018) that still seems to prevail in much ecological research. Further studies are needed to understand and quantify the relative importance of the different strategies in various ecosystems across the globe. An interesting test of climate vs disturbance as selective factors would be to compare dormancy in closed forests that seldom burn with species in adjacent regularly burnt shrublands under the same climate. We predict that dormancy and seedbanks would be largely restricted to the fire-prone ecosystems. More research also is needed to understand the environmental conditions that maintain and release imposed dormancy (once inherent dormancy is released or does not apply) as changes in climate cues could be the key to plant success under a changing climate.

Impacts to sagebrush ecosystem processes over large areas due to the annual grass-wildfire cycle necessitated the development of a coordinated, science-based strategy for improving efforts to achieve long-term protection, conservation, and restoration of sagebrush rangelands, which was framed in 2015 under the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy (IRFMS). Central to this effort was the development of an Actionable Science Plan (Plan) that identified 37 priority science needs (hereinafter, “Needs”) for informing the actions proposed under the five topics (Fire, Invasives, Restoration, Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), Climate and Weather) that were part of the collective focus of the IRFMS. Notable keys to this effort were identification of the Needs co-produced by managers and researchers, and a focus on resulting science being “actionable.”Substantial investments aimed at fulfilling the Needs identified in the Plan have been made since its release in 2016. While the state of the science has advanced considerably, the extent to which knowledge gaps remain relative to identified Needs is relatively unknown. Moreover, new Needs have likely emerged since the original strategy as results from actionable science reveal new questions and possible (yet untested) solutions. A quantifiable assessment of the progress made on the original science Needs can identify unresolved gaps and new information that can help inform prioritization of future research efforts.This report details a systematic literature review that evaluated how well peer-reviewed journal articles and formal technical reports published between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, addressed four Needs identified under the Climate and Weather topic in the Plan. The topic outlined research Needs broadly focused on understanding the potential effects of climate change on vegetative resilience to inform restoration of sagebrush rangelands. We established the level of progress towards addressing each Need following a standardized set of criteria, and developed summaries detailing how research objectives nested within Needs identified in the Plan (hereinafter, “Next Steps”) were either addressed well, partially addressed or remain outstanding (that is, addressed poorly) in the literature through 2020. Our searches resulted in the inclusion of 92 science products that at least partially addressed a Need identified in the Climate and Weather topic. The Needs that were well and partially addressed included:studies of the complex set of climatic relationships that influence sagebrush rangeland restoration and seeding success;the identification of seed collection areas across the range of environmental variability inhabited by target restoration species; anddevelop predictive models to assess targeted restoration species’ responses to mid-century climatic conditions.The Need addressed poorly was the identification of native plant species, genotypes and ecotypes, and seed mixes that may be resilient to a changing climate. The information provided in this assessment will assist updating the Plan, and can inform updates of other relevant science planning documents as needed.","10.3133/ofr20231035","","","https://lens.org/037-647-797-793-52X","","23311258","037-647-797-793-52X","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","23311258","",""

Climate change affects the risks of natural disasters such as bushfire, drought and energy security. Research has already shown that Tasmania has already been affected by climate change and has economic impacts. Relative to Australia and many other areas of the world, climate change impacts are likely to be milder in Tasmania and could present both adverse and beneficial economic outcomes. There has been a broad range of climate related projects carried out for the state of Tasmania. Along with the relatively well known Climate Futures for Tasmania Project, this review has identified 27 major projects and a further 50 complementary projects related to climate change in Tasmania. These projects include studies of general changes to climate, climate extremes, water supply and resources, agriculture, biosecurity, effects of fire, and the incidence of Ross river virus. These research activities have resulted in a suite of comprehensive reports that have informed Tasmanian communities, industry, and state government. Economic analysis, due to be released in early 2018, shows that the state has already benefited from this information. There are 12 climate change research projects currently underway that are using the latest generation of climate models, which will be completed in the next 12 months. These are significant investments that can be used as the basis of the new research and information on climate change in Tasmania. Tasmania experienced an extra-ordinary dry spring in 2015 and wet autumn in 2016. The dry spring directly led to significant bushfires and low water-yields. Emergency service responses to the bushfires cost $55m. The dry spring had a significant impact on Hydro Tasmania. The wet autumn of 2016 resulted in extensive, devastating flooding that cost 3 lives and $180m in damages. Together these three events (i.e. bushfire, drought and flood) cost the state about $300 million, or 1% of gross state product. Evidence shows that the dry spring was more intense through rising greenhouses gases in the atmosphere and indicates that climate change is already adding to the costs of natural disasters in Tasmania. Over the last ten years there have been a significant number of developments in the analysis of climate model simulations and also in the availability of new simulations for Tasmania. There is a new recognition that natural disasters magnify the consequences of climate change. There are also new methods and approaches for examining various questions, including climate impacts on human health (e.g. heat stress, mortality), agricultural supply chains and the financial costs of climate change impacts. The gaps identified in this review are derived from: recent consulting reports to Hydro Tasmania; stakeholder engagements; surveys carried out by the Department of Premier and Cabinet’s Tasmanian Climate Change Office; Tasmanian State Natural Disaster Risk Assessment workshops; and a meta-analysis of the climate change reports, research papers already completed and listed in Tables A1 to A5 in Appendix A. Water underpins many of the activities in the state and is critical to energy security and the future of agriculture. Tasmania is still vulnerable to seasonal variations, with significant interannual variability in rainfall and temperature. Due to the topographic relief, floods can (and do) cause major damage to private and public infrastructure. Since the last climate impacts assessments, new water infrastructure (namely the Tasmanian Irrigation scheme) has been put in place. The sensitivity of this infrastructure to certain types of climate extremes could be assessed. Coincident and compounding extreme events have not been considered in any of the earlier work. How the frequency of coincidence will be affected by climate change has led to new questions about their relationships and impacts. Questions arising around the coincidence of bushfire with either flood, drought, or heatwave are a few examples. Agriculture is currently growing at 8% per annum, faster than the other sectors of the state economy. The Climate Futures for Tasmania Project only covered dairy and wine grapes in detail (about $415 million of the state farm gate value for 2015-2016 year), thus the remaining 80% of this sector is effectively un-assessed and could be expanded. Biosecurity and invasive pests are a concern for Tasmanian agriculture and also the state’s natural assets. The potential for damaging agriculture pests to establish in Tasmania as a result of climate change has not been adequately assessed. New analytical methods for pest detection, a better understanding of pest life cycles and new, more reliable projections could all be combined to estimate the emergence of viable populations in the different regions of the state. Such information is crucial for policy development in this space. Currently tourism to Tasmania directly and indirectly generates $2-3 billion, about 10% of the state’s gross state product. Tourism is known to be negatively influenced by natural hazards such as bushfires and floods. The change in bushfire risk across the state has already been assessed, with an extended, more detailed study of the Tasmanian World Heritage Area. However, there is a need to assess more broadly how natural hazards of all kinds (heat waves, storms, floods) will affect Tasmania’s unique and highly valued biodiversity, and if this is likely to impact on tourism opportunities in the long term. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recently identified the projected changes in climate as being ""overwhelmingly negative"" (World Health Organization, 2017). The research community has also recognised climate change as ""the biggest global health threat of the 21st Century"" putting the ""lives and wellbeing of billions of people at increased risk"" representing ""an unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health"" . While broad risk areas have been identified, the health impacts of a changing climate have not been fully assessed, and thus specific issues affecting Tasmania have not been fully identified or researched. Tasmania is surrounded by ocean. Aquaculture and wild fisheries are about half of the agriculture sector. These areas are likely to grow and increasingly a critical element of the state economy. Climate change (and its extremes) pose a potential risk to food security through increased risks. A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on potential risk to the marine environment has yet to be undertaken. Assessments of climate change and its consequences need to be translated into decisions. At present, the pathway between climate change research outputs and decision making is unclear. Tools that can help decision makers utilise the outputs of research are critical to uptake and impact. Decision making by government and businesses is important from a climate change liability and financial risk perspective. Efforts to develop these tools need to be supported to leverage the enormous amount of work that has already been done, and maximise the benefits of any future work. It is timely to undertake an update of the future climate assessments to increase the understanding of the risks and consequences for the Tasmanian economy. There is a whole suite of new approaches to climate extremes research, new infrastructure and key sectors of the state economy and natural environment that have yet to be assessed, and taken together make a compelling case for a new statewide climate assessment. A key success of the Climate Futures for Tasmania Program was the extensive outreach and public engagement that was incorporated into the work plan. Sustained, frequent and broad engagement within both the public and private sectors of the economy resulted in awareness and uptake of relevant climate information by decision makers in Tasmania. Since the Climate Future for Tasmania program was initiated some ten years ago, there have been changes to staff in many of the organisations involved, and it would be timely to review this engagement. Engaging dedicated experts to facilitate the interface between science and the stakeholders would be one example of improving on the past. Leverage through other schemes is required to achieve scale to create a program with an enduring impact.","","","","https://lens.org/039-209-420-739-323","","","039-209-420-739-323","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Wildfires induce changes in ecohydrological processes, including reduced infiltration from increased soil hydrophobicity (DeBano, 2000), and reduced canopy cover that diminishes evapotranspiration and interception of precipitation (Guo et al., 2023; Wine et al., 2018). The resulting changes in streamflow and terrestrial-aquatic connectivity from these shifts in ecohydrological processes influence the composition and fluxes of materials to stream networks, with the potential to degrade downstream water quality (Ball et al., 2021; Dahm et al., 2015; Hohner et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2022; Paul et al., 2022; Rust et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2019). Thus, it is important to improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal drivers of water quality responses to wildfires (Raoelison et al., 2023).Across spatial scales, wildfire has been documented to increase solute concentrations by orders of magnitude in some receiving streams (Hickenbottom et al., 2023; Murphy et al., 2018), but lead to little response or decline in others (Abbott et al., 2021; Oliver et al., 2012). This may be due to differences in wildfire and/or watershed characteristics. For example, previous literature has identified a threshold of ~20% burn extent needed to trigger a hydrologic response across different ecoregions (Hallema et al., 2018), yet identification of such responses for water quality parameters is nascent (Richardson et al., 2024). While several previous studies have documented the effect of wildfire on water quality parameters and biogeochemical processes across broad spatial scales (e.g., Hampton et al., 2022; Raoelison et al., 2023; Rust et al., 2018), few have sought to link observed responses across time, climate, burn, and watershed characteristics.In particular, nitrate (NO3_) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are key nutrients that underpin global biogeochemical cycles and have the potential to degrade water quality with increasing wildfire activity. For example, excess nitrate can lead to downstream eutrophication (Mast et al., 2016), while DOC compositional shifts may influence water treatment processes (Hohner et al., 2019). Relationships with burn severity and extent have been observed in some systems for nitrate (Bladon et al., 2008; Rhoades, Chow, et al., 2019), however, for DOC, little to no relationships have been consistently observed across studies and systems (Santos et al., 2019a; Wei et al., 2021).Observed differences in nitrate and DOC concentrations pre- and post-fire were most pronounced in the first five years following wildfire (Rust et al., 2018). However, the persistence of fire effects on hydrologic and biogeochemical processes are moderated by the rate of post-wildfire vegetation recovery which can vary by ecosystem (Guo et al., 2023; Wine et al., 2018). Nitrate responses, for example, may lag due to the shift in nitrogen speciation during combustion creating conditions that increase nitrification post-fire (Gustine et al., 2022; Hanan, Schimel, et al., 2016). The magnitude and length of DOC responses are likely a result of heterogeneous burn conditions that can decrease and alter the chemistry of source pools (Santín et al., 2016).Responses may be linked to changes in streamflow (Richardson et al., 2024), which is highly variable across climates post-fire (Hallema et al., 2017). This variability may co-vary with additional drivers, such as drought (Murphy et al., 2018; Newcomer et al., 2023) resulting in shifts in nitrate and DOC export. For example, while the directionality of the relationship between concentration and discharge may not be altered with wildfire, the strength of that relationship has been shown to change for both nitrate and DOC (Murphy et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2024). While trends are emerging for streamflow across time since fire, climate, and burn characteristics (Hallema et al., 2017), such trends have not yet emerged for nitrate and DOC.Discerning biogeochemical responses post-fire are further complicated by heterogeneous watershed characteristics (Agbeshie et al., 2022; Hallema et al., 2018). For example, catchment slope has a dominant influence on biogeochemical linkages between terrestrial and aquatic systems, primarily due to longer residence times of water and constituents in lower-gradient catchments (Lintern et al., 2018). The biogeochemical signatures in steeper catchments typically reflect that of surficial pathways, especially during periods of enhanced hydrologic connectivity where a large proportion of material is mobilized from the terrestrial landscape into receiving streams (Laudon & Sponseller, 2018). Conversely, lower-gradient catchments are less responsive to periods of enhanced hydrologic connectivity due to the greater proportion of groundwater contributions (Laudon & Sponseller, 2018). Lower-gradient catchments also promote longer residence times that allow for transformations and provide a source of DOC available to leach into receiving streams (Tank et al., 2020). Additionally, topography heavily influences terrestrial species composition which influences carbon and nitrogen cycling, thus affecting solutes available for export (Weintraub et al., 2017).The objectives of this meta-analysis were to better constrain the controls on stream water chemistry across broad spatial scales post-fire. In this study, we synthesize biogeochemical responses of nitrate and DOC to wildfires using meta-analytical techniques to evaluate the effect sizes and the percent differences across reference and fire-impacted sites spanning 3 biomes and 62 watersheds. We chose to leverage reference-burn study designs to minimize the confounding influence of interannual climate variability on our results (Clausen & Spooner, 1993). We focused specifically on the importance of time-since-fire, climate, and burn extent as factors of interest to assess post-fire shifts in solute concentrations through space and time. Through time as ecosystems recover, we hypothesize that there will be a decrease in the effect size of wildfire impacts on nitrate and DOC, as concentrations begin to reflect those in non-fire impacted systems. Furthermore, we anticipate that there will be a systematic shift in nitrate and DOC post-fire related to ranges in aridity and mean annual precipitation with climate, which will be modulated by in-stream hydrologic responses to local catchment characteristics. Lastly, we hypothesized that the area of watershed burned will impact the relationships between watershed characteristics and nitrate and DOC responses, influencing the magnitude of wildfire effects on water quality.","10.22541/essoar.171052482.22663736/v1","","","https://lens.org/042-416-499-340-074","","","042-416-499-340-074","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Here, I describe this phenomenon, investigate its causes, and explore the consequences of the postfire increase in mice for conifer recruitment in burned forest. I documented a shift in small mammal communities away from more specialized species such as red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) and shrews (Sorex spp.) and towards greater abundance of generalist deer mice after a wildfire in montane forest. I conducted a meta-analysis of published studies on the abundance of small mammals in disturbed versus undisturbed forests and established that the pattern of increased deer mouse abundance holds for both natural (wildfire) and anthropogenic (different forms of forest harvest) disturbances. However, the postfire increase is significantly stronger than the increase after logging. In another forest wildfire, I tested the four most commonly proposed explanations of this increase: (1) greater abundance of food resources in burned areas, (2) increased foraging efficiency of deer mice, (3), predatory release, and (4) source - sink dynamics, with burned areas acting as high abundance dispersal sink. However, none were supported by data. Thus, I concluded that the existing explanations of postfire increase in deer mouse abundance are unsatisfactory. Finally, I investigated the magnitude and impact of seed predation by deer mice in burned and unburned forest. In seed offerings experiments, overnight conifer seed removal associated with deer mice was more intense in burned than in unburned stands. In germination experiments, emergence of seedlings in cages with openings that allowed access by deer mice was extremely rare in burned and unburned forest. However, in closed cages (deer mice excluded), seedling emergence was low in unburned forest, but considerably higher in burned forest. Wildfire created favorable conditions for seedling recruitment but seed predation by deer mice appeared to remove this advantage.","","","","https://lens.org/044-819-140-345-142","","","044-819-140-345-142","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Post-disturbance management often involves salvage logging, i.e. the felling and removal of the affected trees. However, harvesting these biological legacies may represent a second disturbance whose effects on ecosystem processes add on those of the initial disturbance. Many of the potentially affected processes, such as soil erosion and stream water quality, represent regulating and supporting ecosystem services important for human society. In the last 15years, much empirical evidence has been gathered on the ecological consequences of this management practice, and it has now become necessary to synthesise this evidence in meaningful ways for managers and decision-makers. Methods: With this systematic review we aim to synthesise the literature on the effects of salvage logging on ecosystem services and determine the effects of major effect modifiers such as disturbance type and intensity, the timing and method of logging, and the type of forest. We will conduct searches of the primary scientific literature, which will be selected and categorised according to its relevance to the topic and its quality. Each relevant article will be read in full to obtain the necessary data for meta-analysis and to identify its main conclusions. Mixed-effects models will be performed to assess the effects of the identified effect modifiers on the effect sizes of the salvage intervention on ecosystem services and to account for random effects arising from studies being performed in the same area. Sensitivity analyses will test the potential effects of study quality, and publication bias will be assessed with the trim and fill method. We will present the results as a narrative review and a meta-analysis.","","","","https://lens.org/048-646-202-782-034","","","048-646-202-782-034","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Learn more.Copy URL For decades, large portions of the semi-arid sagebrush ecosystem have been experiencing increased frequency and extent of wildfire, even though small, infrequent fire is a natural disturbance in this ecosystem (Baker, 2006). Increased wildfire is threatening the existence of sagebrush ecosystems and the wildlife species that depend upon them (Baker, 2006; Coates et al., 2016). Increased wildfire in sagebrush ecosystems is often driven by invasive annual grasses, especially cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum (L.). Invasion can initiate a trajectory toward a ""grass-fire cycle"", in which cheatgrass increases fine fuel loadings that promote fire, and native plant species do not recover quickly after fire, leading frequently burned sites to transition to monocultures of cheatgrass (Brooks et al., 2004). Although cheatgrass has been extensively studied in the sagebrush steppe, less attention has been given to the organisms that would have filled the interspaces that cheatgrass replaces, namely, biological soil crusts (""biocrusts""). Semi-arid environments are characterized by sparse cover of vascular plants and substantial cover of biocrusts (Belnap & Lange, 2001). Biocrusts contain organisms that live on the soil surface and include lichens, mosses, and light algal crusts (including cyanobacteria). Although biocrusts were included in some of the first descriptions of the vegetation in the region (Flowers, 1934), biocrusts are rarely included in contemporary studies of sagebrush ecosystems. Comprehensive community studies have concluded consistent negative relationships between abundance of biocrusts and annual invasive grasses, specifically cheatgrass (Condon & Pyke, 2018a,b; Daubenmire, 1970). We postulate that biocrusts, and particularly lichens, facilitate a pattern of small, infrequent, low intensity fire given their association with reduced fine fuels (cheatgrass). Observations of the response of biocrusts to fire as a sole disturbance are rare. For example, grazing by livestock is the primary land use in sagebrush ecosystems and biocrusts are lost to the compound disturbances of grazing and fire (Condon & Pyke, 2018a). Researchers face great challenges in identifying sites for study where fire is not coupled with grazing, perhaps because cattle preferentially use burned areas (Clark et al., 2014). Conversations in the literature speak to the difficulty in separating the effects of these disturbances on biocrusts (O'Connor & Germino, 2020; Root et al., 2020). We surveyed a wildfire in October of 2021 outside of Boise, Idaho, that burned 15–20 acres of intact biocrusts the previous month (personal communications Rosentreter, October 20, 2021; Condon & Coates, 2022). This small fire occurred on private land and was not named. The area had not experienced grazing by livestock since 1984 and prior to the fire, it was free of other anthropogenic disturbances. Herbivores found onsite, which may cause ground disturbance, include Paiute ground squirrel (Urocitellus mollis), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus leporid), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and American badger (Taxidea taxus) (personal communications Mason, October 20, 2021). The dominant shrub onsite is Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and Young, and the occurrence of shrubs was patchy. We sampled 20, randomly placed, 0.25 m2 quadrats within the burn perimeter to estimate the susceptibility of biocrusts by morphogroup to fire (sensu Eldridge & Rosentreter, 1999). Percent char (organic material visibly browned/blackened by fire) was estimated ocularly within each quadrat as a representation of fire intensity. Quadrats were physically tossed into the burned area but tossed again if they fell upon areas with vehicle tracks from fire-fighting efforts. We avoided areas where burning shrubs sterilized the soil, which was a rare condition. Biocrusts and vascular plants were surveyed via point-vertex intercept at 40 points per quadrat. Vascular plants were split into categories of annual forbs and perennial grasses. Other functional groups of vascular plants were not detected within the fire perimeter at the time of sampling, although cheatgrass occurs onsite. Pictures from the site show intact biocrusts and no evidence that the lichens had burned (Figure 1). Char was restricted to mosses and perennial grasses, primarily Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl.), a shallow-rooted native that is typically dormant by early summer. Sandberg's bluegrass was already showing evidence of resprouting at the time of our survey (Figure 1). FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Intact biocrusts within the burn perimeter.

The green and reddish-brown patches are mosses. Patches with the most char are primarily the perennial grass, Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl.) and some of the mosses. Perennial grasses were already resprouting at the time of the photograph (October 20, 2021). All photographs by L.A. Condon. Surveyed quadrats were representative of the burned area and were divided into categories of fire intensity: low (5% percent char or less, 13 quadrats), moderate (12%–20% percent char, 4 quadrats), and high (95%–98% percent char, 3 quadrats). From our char estimates, we believe that most of the fire burned at low intensity. We did not have any quadrats with char values between 21% and 94%. Across the site, light algal crusts, vascular plants, lichens, and mosses were observed with increasing abundance (cover), in that order (Figure 2). Considering lichens specifically, crustose lichens were found in the greatest abundance followed by cup lichens (Figure 2). Crustose lichens are completely appressed to the soil surface and provide continuous cover. Cup lichens have thalli of scales (squamules) and are frequently found with mosses. Abundance of morphogroups was analyzed with non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination using a Sørenson distance measure. Final stress for the ordination was low, 7.06 for a three-dimensional solution (Figure 3). The ordination was rotated to align with our explanatory variable of interest, percent char, which was used to represent fire intensity. We do not interpret Axis 2 because it did not include any additional information that is not included in our discussion of Axis 1 or 3. Char was significantly correlated with Axis 1 (r = 0.468, r2 = 0.219) and directly opposed cover of crustose lichens (r = −0.832, r2 = 0.692). Axis 3 was significantly correlated with tall mosses (r = 0.770, r2 = 0.592) and perennial grasses (r = 0.513, r2 = 0.263). On this axis, cover of these groups directly opposed cover of more ruderal groups: short mosses (r = −0.777, r2 = 0.604) and light algal crusts (LAC, r = −0.636, r2 = 0.404). Cover of bare ground was also significantly negatively correlated with this axis (Bare ground, r = −0.460, r2 = 0.212). While Axis 1 appeared to represent a gradient of fire intensity, Axis 3 represented a gradient of biocrust succession from more ruderal groups to later successional groups as one moves up the axis. These ruderal groups are described in greater detail in Rosentreter (2020) and may be the result of small-scale ground disturbances caused by squirrels or badgers. FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Boxplots show median values, 1st and 3rd quartiles and whiskers extending out to the largest values within 1.5 times the distance between the 1st and 3rd quartiles. (a) low intensity fire (5% percent char or less, 13 quadrats) (b) moderate intensity fire (12%–20% percent char, 4 quadrats) (c) high intensity fire (95%–98% percent char, 3 quadrats). Lichens include the following groups: Crustose, Cup Lichen, Fruticose and Gelatinous. Mosses include StMoss (short moss) and TlMoss (tall moss). Other abbreviations are as follows: AnnForb (annual forb), LAC (light algal crust), and PerGra (perennial grass). FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of the abundance of biocrust morphogroups after fire. Increment R2 for Axis 1 = 0.266, Axis 2 = 0.068, and Axis 3 = 0.601, for a cumulative R2 of 0.935. Blue dots represent the centroids of biocrust morphogroups. We observed that the lichen components of biocrusts, particularly crustose lichens (at this site Diplochistes muscorum (Scop.) R. Sant), were largely unaffected by fire alone, corroborating other work in the region. Warren et al. (2015) found that the overall impact of fire on biocrusts in an early seral juniper woodland was minimal, even though trees were killed by fire and cover of mosses was reduced. Mosses, specifically tall mosses are often susceptible to fire in the sagebrush steppe (Condon & Gray, 2020; Condon & Pyke 2018a,b), and early successional, short mosses can be stimulated by fire and other disturbances (Condon & Pyke, 2018b). Although the cover of lichens appeared to be lower in the quadrats with the highest fire intensity (Figure 2c), this is likely due to quadrats with relatively high cover of lichens not having enough char to be classified as burning at high intensity (Figure 2a–c). This suggests there was little lichen cover in the high-intensity quadrats before fire, unlike the quadrats with high moss cover, which did show char on the mosses. This further suggests that where lichens are abundant, fire severity may be lower relative to sites with higher moss or grass cover, as fire intensity and residence time are reduced (sensu Brooks, 2008, Figure 3). These findings highlight the need to identify and conserve biocrusts where they are intact, especially where reducing the impacts of fire is of interest. In the Great Basin, USA, understanding the responses of biocrusts to fire, especially by morphogroup, is timely. Increasing loss of sagebrush habitat from fire throughout the region has led to a plan by the Bureau of Land Management to construct an extensive network of fuel breaks, with over 17,000 km of linear fuel breaks planned for the Great Basin region (BLM, 2020). Suggestions for preserving intact sagebrush habitats and sagebrush obligate wildlife species include prioritizing fire suppression efforts (Baker, 2006). This highlights the question of how to best configure and implement fuel breaks in a way that minimizes negative impacts on habitat, including the potential to facilitate cheatgrass invasion, while maximizing their capacity to reduce fire spread (Shinneman et al., 2019). Some fuel reduction treatments have been shown to minimize damage to biocrusts, which is useful given known negative relationships between biocrusts and cheatgrass (Condon & Gray, 2020; Condon & Pyke, 2018a). The information presented here suggests that sites with higher lichen cover could help reduce fire intensity, making fuel breaks more effective under certain conditions. Moreover, other research has shown that similar environments with higher pre-fire cover of biocrusts were more likely to have lower post-fire cover of cheatgrass (Shinneman & Baker, 2009), another desirable attribute to enhance fuel break functionality. We demonstrate that fire had differing effects on morphogroups of biocrusts, as crustose lichens were observed to be free of char. Mosses demonstrated char, suggesting that they may have experienced a reduction in cover, but they were not lost from the site, following fire. This finding could benefit studies on the restoration of biocrusts, because biocrusts may not need to be reintroduced to a site following fire. Studies related to the physiology of morphogroups and their susceptibility to fire would add to our understanding of this phenomena. Studies on the effects of fire on biocrusts could benefit from the inclusion of disturbance history and plant community identity, as the composition of biocrusts differs amongst plant communities (Condon & Pyke, 2020c). Although it has been asserted that biocrusts are highly susceptible to wildfire in a recent meta-analysis (Palmer et al., 2020), the current study (where fire is the sole disturbance, albeit some inferred disturbance by small rodents) and those cited here examining compound disturbances with fire, suggest that disturbances that are compounding with fire have a greater effect on cover of morphogroups compared with fire alone. The study presented here demonstrates the complex nature of this topic, necessitating more research. Such research would be timely considering the potential benefits to land management efforts to minimize the spread of wildfire and reduce the loss of sagebrush habitat and dependent wildlife (Coates et al., 2016).

Tasmania and Queensland were subject to unprecedented summer temperatures and suffered damaging bushfires in ecologies that were thought to be permanently safe from fire damage. Queensland then underwent a cascading series of bushfires, cyclones and floods, that saw the media team activated for three solid months. Agencies are actively accounting for climate change in their planning and successful preparedness programs are now more important than ever. This project was designed to map the community engagement for preparedness approaches Australian agencies are currently using and to use this picture to develop closer linkages from frameworks to practice. It was a six-stage project: a literature review, interviews with agency community engagement practitioners and managers, design of a framework that accounted for their approach and then presentation of a toolkit that allowed implementation at grass roots level of the framework, and evaluation of this work. The literature review confirmed that getting people to prepare for a natural hazard is difficult, even in places where hazards are regular and expected. People living in cyclone-prone areas tended to be better prepared and preparation was considered a social norm in these areas, but still there were large segments of the community who did not register risk or act on a threat. People in bushfire prone areas tended to be the worst prepared, and in particular, people in urban areas, and wildland/urban interfaces. A number of obstacles to preparing emerged from the literature. Key was failure to fully personalise a risk, even when the risk is accepted as likely. The business of day to day lives, cost, fear of being seen to over-react, weighing up likelihood against effort, optimism bias and being overwhelmed by the volume of tasks involved in preparing all have an influence, along with situational factors such demographics and life stage, on hazard preparation. The literature also showed that community engagement in emergency management covers the whole spectrum of communication, engagement and participation, and that interpretation was used by practitioners used to cover all of these methods of interaction with the community. Therefore the term ‘community engagement’ was used to refer to work by engagement and communication teams concerned with preparedness for natural hazards. Our interviews with practitioners explored what preparedness looks like, barriers and enablers of preparedness, what competencies exist in a prepared community and how they and their agency ‘do’ community engagement. We also touched on what they thought was best practice in the field and what framework/s they use to guide their practice. Practitioners told us that most of them work to the IAP2-based Australian Institute of Disaster Resilience Handbook 6 framework, usually with additions and alterations. Co-design and community development approaches emerged as a goal for many practitioners. We found a wide range of approaches, usually driven by resourcing and skills. Some smaller states with very small teams undertake information delivery engagement practices, while other small teams have highly organised community capacity-building programs embedded in their organisation’s strategic planning. Several larger organisations are doing community engagement in a measurably successful way. They show that it is possible to get year on year improvements to preparedness levels, as well as illustrating programmed methods of achieving this. Our interviews gave us rich information from which we were able to build the following model containing five steps, and with three additional different layers. The first overlay features the aims of each step; the second explains the tactics associated with each step; and the third explains and guides the research, monitoring, evaluation and learning that permeates every aspect of the model. The fifth dimension of the model, and a key deliverable of this project, is a competency index, which connects the characteristics of the community with the different stages of the model. We’ve called the model the Australian generative model of community engagement for preparedness – the diagram below shows the basic framework. Following development of the model, we undertook a systematic literature review to determine the effect of checklist preparedness activities for personal safety and coping during a hazard’s impact and recovery phases. We used accepted systematic literature review standards and checked these against the Campbell Collaboration’s method of systematic literature reviews, and in our first round of searching found 1,451 articles. These were sorted on title, and a further 1,328 excluded. After abstract and full text screening, not one article remained that attempted to examine the effect of discrete or groups of preparedness activities. What we did find from the systematic literature review was a series of community engagement interventions that had been tested in an academic setting and published in both peer reviewed and grey literature. From this data we were able to compile a toolkit of community engagement techniques that had been tested in an emergency management preparedness setting. At this point we were able to take the model to workshops of agency, local government and not for profit practitioners in the preparedness space. With their guidance, we were able to simplify the presentation of the model and consider aspects of the model that would or wouldn’t work in practice. The workshops provided an iterative platform, with the model and the workshop materials evolving from the first workshop to the second. We expect the framework to evolve as practitioners mould it to suit and explain their approaches to community engagement for preparedness. Evaluation was an important concept that emerged from the literature review, the interviews with practitioners and the systematic literature review, and has been identified as problematic by respected researchers Gilbert, Elsworth and Rhodes and their colleagues since 2007 (Gilbert, 2007; Elsworth, Gilbert & Rhodes, 2009; Gilbert, Elsworth, Stevens, Rowe & Robinson, 2010; Rhodes, Gilbert, Nelson and Preece, 2011). From these information sources and from community engagement evaluation literature, we also developed a Monitoring and Evaluation Toolkit as a companion to the Community Engagement Toolkit. Both of these toolkits are separate documents within the project. Both are documents are designed to cater for entry level practitioners upward. This project has provided a platform for advancement of Australian practice in community engagement for preparedness. It has allowed us to map approaches and competencies that have potential to clarify the community engagement planning process. It supports the matching of CE approaches and techniques to community competencies and characteristics, and provides guidance on evaluation. We have also provided a series of recommendations on community engagement practice and further research ideas that we think will further advance efforts to get Australians ready for natural hazards.","","","","https://lens.org/052-788-352-849-239","","","052-788-352-849-239","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Human health is reliant on planetary health. In Australia, the Black Summer bushfires (2019–2020) burned more than 24 million hectares of Australian bushland. Recent datasets of satellite imagery of burned areas, observations of climate and weather, and simulated fuel loads have since been confirmed to be part of a clear trend of worsening fire weather and ever-larger forest areas burned by bushfires [[2]Canadell J.G.

Intense fires in the Amazon also captured global attention in 2019 for the destruction of natural ecosystems and smoke production in the region. Both bushfires raged through the colloquial ‘lungs of the world’ in 2020, with widespread regional public health consequences, including premature death related to smoke pollution [[3]Marlier M.E. Bonilla E.X. Mickley L.J. How do Brazilian fires affect air pollution and public health?.Geohealth. 2020; 4e2020GH000331Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar]. When the Call for Papers for this Special Edition on Environment, Climate and Cardiovascular Health went out in 2021, we could not know what the next disaster in our region would be. Then, in Australia in 2022, we experienced severe and widespread flooding. These and other extreme weather events are anticipated to continue and indeed increase in response to climate change [[4]Magdy J.S. Adikari D.H. Gray R.C. Alexopoulos C. Jepson N.S. Fire and flood: the cardiovascular impact of natural disasters — A regional New South Wales experience.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 8-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. As 2023 begins, the contributions in this Special Edition of Heart Lung and Circulation share a common message—we know a lot, we need to learn a lot more, and there is lot (more) we can all do to prevent, ameliorate, and manage the cardiovascular effects of these environmental and climate disasters. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally [[5]World Health Organization. 2021Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) Key Facts.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)Google Scholar]. Importantly, clinicians, policy makers, and stakeholders need to be cognisant that vulnerable populations are at greater risk from sudden or extreme changes in environmental conditions. As an example, Magdy and colleagues highlight the cardiovascular consequences of extreme weather conditions in Port Macquarie, NSW, Australia [[4]Magdy J.S. Adikari D.H. Gray R.C. Alexopoulos C. Jepson N.S. Fire and flood: the cardiovascular impact of natural disasters — A regional New South Wales experience.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 8-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. They point out that natural disasters have a disproportionately greater impact on individuals living in regional and remote areas, not only in terms of property damage but also in effects on public infrastructure and access to services, which exacerbated existing health disadvantages. In a Call to Action from the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) Nursing Council, Inglis and colleagues also identify groups who may be unable to safeguard against the shock of climate events or to engage in critical actions that reduce impact on their cardiovascular health, including First Nations peoples, people who are elderly and frail and those from low-socioeconomic status households [[6]Inglis S.C. Ferguson C. Eddington R. McDonagh J. Aldridge C.J.

The Call states that such groups need targeted preventive actions and support so that they can be protected from potentially avoidable harm. This Special Edition highlights the importance of health professionals working in cardiovascular health taking leadership and in understanding how their care of patients can be part of the problem. Specifically, Szirt and colleagues write that the healthcare sector contributes to nearly 5% of global carbon emissions [[7]Szirt R. Monjur M.R. McGovern L. Charlesworth K. O'Connor S. Weaver J.C. Coughlan J.J. Environmental sustainability in the cardiac catheter laboratory.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar], and that the exponential growth of medical waste poses a significant challenge to environmental sustainability. Szirt et al. outline how healthcare workers in cardiac catheter labs can make a meaningful change to their practice and contribute towards a more sustainable future by taking advantage of opportunities to reduce waste [[7]Szirt R.

These include adopting a “lean” mentality, “The Five R-Concept”—to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rethink and Research, and avoiding the use of unnecessary equipment and material [[8]Kagoma Y.K. Stall N. Rubinstein E. Naudie D. People, planet and profits: the case for greening operative rooms.CMAJ. 2012; 184: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar]. This approach may well conflict with single-use device policy and practice but nevertheless represents a challenge that we need to confront. Ambient air pollution is recognised to be a significant contributor to the burden of CVD and mortality. However, there is much yet to be understood about the connection between air pollution and CVD [[9]Franklin B.A. Brook R. Arden Pope 3rd, C. Air pollution and cardiovascular disease.Curr Probl Cardiol. 2015 May; 40: 207-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar], and several reports in this Special Edition help further our understanding. A systematic review of more than three decades of research reported in multiple databases by Fathieh and colleagues found that particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) was the most studied pollutant, followed by particulate matter between 2.5 μm–10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) [[10]Fathieh S. Grieve S.M. Negishi K. Figtree G.A. Potential biological mediators of myocardial and vascular complications of air pollution—A state-of-the-art review.Heart Lung Circ. 2022; 32: 26-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. The researchers identified key activated pathophysiological pathways that lead to myocardial and vascular injury in response to air pollutants—activation of systemic and local inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction. In an original research article, Lankaputhra and colleagues suggest that an imbalance in cardiac autonomic function is a key mechanism of the adverse cardiovascular effects of bushfire smoke [[11]Lankaputhra M. Johnston F.H. Otahal P. Jalil E. Dennekamp M. Negishi K. Cardiac autonomic impacts of bushfire smoke — A prospective panel study.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 52-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. They found that exposure to bushfire smoke (planned burning) in two rural towns in Victoria, Australia, was associated with reduced overall and long-term heart-rate variability (measured with repeat 24-hour Holter electrocardiography). In a Japanese case-crossover study, Zhao and colleagues aimed to determine the associations between the incidence of acute cardiac events and both gaseous (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, photochemical oxidants and sulfur dioxide) and particulate matter [[12]Zhao B. Johnston F.H. Salimi F. Oshima K. Kurabayashi M. Negishi K. Short-term exposure to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen monoxide and risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 59-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. They found that short-term exposures to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are associated with an increased risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In an Iranian ecological study, Mohammadian-Khoshnoud et al. found that responses to air pollutants differed between men and women in terms of hospitalisation for acute myocardial infarction, indicating that gender-stratified analysis is important [[13]Mohammadian-Khoshnoud M. Habibi H. Manafi B. Safarpour G. Soltanian A.R. Effects of air pollutant exposure on acute myocardial infarction.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. In India, seeking to detect regional vulnerabilities and provide forewarnings, Sajith Kumar et al. observed that economically developed states may be contributing a greater share of air pollution-attributed CVD [[14]Sajith Kumar S. Sasidharan A. Bagepally B.S. Air pollution and cardiovascular disease burden: changing patterns and implications for public health in India.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 90-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. On a reassuring note, it is hoped this Special Edition will deepen awareness and understanding and subsequently assist in promoting effective actions that combat the causes and effects of adverse cardiovascular health outcomes related to the environment and climate. In a prospective randomised crossover trial protocol, Barbhaya and colleagues hypothesise that the use of personal protective aids (such as home indoor air purifiers and N95 masks) could decrease blood pressure in people with hypertension and fasting blood glucose levels in those with diabetes [[15]Barbhaya D. Tran J. Khetan A. Hejjaji V. Jain S. Chan C. Goel A.

These authors hypothesise their study will ultimately demonstrate whether personal protective aids can be a viable adaptation measure for people living with hypertension and diabetes in areas with a high burden of air pollution. The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused unparalleled disruption and seems ubiquitous in its presence [[16]World Health OrganizationCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. 2022.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019Google Scholar]. In this edition, Cowie and colleagues remind us that the particles dispersed in our environment also include the spread of aerosolised respiratory particles that can lead to the transmission of diseases such as COVID-19 [[17]Cowie B.

The results of their prospective, observational cohort study provide a caution for readers: wearing a surgical face mask while exercising indoors at high intensity on a cycle ergometer may only have a limited effect on reducing the spread of such particles. Measures for safer indoor exercise need to emphasise distance and airflow and not rely solely on mask-wearing. Looking forward, Poon and colleagues aim to assist in developing a nationwide climate-health projection model to improve health care resource allocation for the combined effects of temperature and humidity [[18]Poon E.K.W.

Their modelling, based on multiple datasets, demonstrated that different carbon emission climate scenarios would lead to very different projected demands for respiratory disease-related lengths-of-stay in intensive care units. In brief, the highest carbon emission climate scenario led to an almost two-fold higher demand for intensive care. At the population-level, Chaseling and colleagues write of the importance for heat–health advice to be evidence-based [[19]Chaseling G.K. Morris N.B. Ravanelli N.

They call for the development and dissemination of scientifically supported public policy advice to mitigate the adverse health outcomes of extreme heat for vulnerable populations. Feng and colleagues advise that ‘urban reforestation’, including an increase in tree canopy cover, may protect cardiovascular health, particularly for people living in houses [[20]Feng X.

Astell-Burt and colleagues also report that Australians are ready to receive “nature prescriptions”—that is, prescribing time in nature—as an adjunct to standard care [[22]Astell-Burt T. Hipp A.

As a preliminary exercise to assist in developing future trials, they surveyed levels of need and interest in nature prescriptions in adults with cardiovascular diseases, psychological distress, and concomitants, such as obesity, loneliness and burn-out. Most participants were interested in a nature prescription—a pro-environmental, pro-social, low-cost, and highly scalable intervention. We hope our readers will be inspired to join the Special Issue: Environment, Climate and Cardiovascular Health authors in seeking to understand the causes and effects of environmental and climate change on our cardiovascular health and to learn how to better respond to, and, preferably, prevent the adverse impact of environmental factors on health outcomes.

This is a worrying scenario, as the Amazon Rainforest plays an important role in regional and global climate regulation. This study therefore sought to identify the methodologies used to describe and predict fire events in the Brazilian Amazon. For this, a systematic literature review was carried out in the open access databases Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) using the descriptors “fire risk” and “Amazon”, and their variants in the Portuguese language and the logical operator “AND” in the search. From the resulting search materia we identified the use of predictive models based on projections for climate change developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which indicate a substantial increase in the probability of fires. Another technique used is the crossing of heat foci data with the forms of land use, evidencing the areas that burn the most and when, as well as the most susceptible areas. There were also studies analyzing the performance of fire risk indexes, demonstrating those that could be used after adaptations to local characteristics. These results allow an understanding of the behavior of fire in the Amazon, since they provide a broad view of how studies on fires have been conducted and what techniques have been used.","10.6084/m9.figshare.20032718","","","https://lens.org/059-650-592-016-431","","","059-650-592-016-431","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

In the developing world, access to electricity remains a challenge in the most interior rural areas, where incomes are low and grid connection costs are prohibitive. In both developing and developed economies, the rise of extreme weather events has made the resilience of power systems a concern. Wildfires, for example, are becoming widespread. The United States saw over 71,000 wildfires burn 10 million acres and more than 12,000 buildings in 2017 alone. This specific economic burden—in terms of the impact of wildfires on the U.S. economy—is estimated to be between $71.1 billion and $347.8 billion annually. In addition, there is a social cost incurred by vulnerable populations who (i) may be unable to evacuate from the location of a disaster or (ii) may not have access to mitigating strategies for failed power systems. In this tutorial, we examine the role of microgrids in electricity access and resilience through a systematic review. With respect to electricity access, we investigate the impact of electricity provision through microgrids on outcomes in rural areas of developing countries. For electricity resilience, we assess the effectiveness of microgrids in providing support to power grids in the aftermath of a disaster. We find that microgrids can provide significant benefits in both settings.Funding: This work is funded by the National Science Foundation [Grant CMMI-2053856].

People tend to think that it is simply passive wishful thinking: I hope something will happen but I'm not going to do anything about it. This is indeed the opposite of real hope, which requires action and engagement.”― Jane Goodall, The Book of Hope (2021) With the release of The Lancet’s Countdown on Health and Climate Change in October, 2021, and the coincident UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), sobering statistics across 44 indicators have made it clear that climate change is increasingly affecting our health—and that the situation is dire indeed. As Dr Goodall describes in her new book, in order to have real hope in the midst of climate change, we have some work to do. As a translational research journal the overarching goal of our daily work is, simply put, to publish science that improves human health. What this means vis-à-vis climate health research is that we aim to better understand how climate and changing environments interface with our physiologies, and to identify therapies and interventions to counter negative effects due to our changing planet. As outlined in “Hot weather and heat extremes: health risks” from The Lancet’s Heat and Health series published on Aug 21, 2021, one way in which our bodies deal with heat stress is by vasodilation, which helps transfer internal body heat to the external environment by increasing blood flow to the skin. This process requires increased cardiac output and oxygen demand. If prolonged and intense, the process can sometimes lead to serious cardiovascular events. As evidenced in a 2016 systematic review and meta-analyses published in EBioMedicine, the elderly face particularly high risk not only for heat-induced cardiovascular effects, but also negative cerebrovascular and respiratory outcomes. Another way the body responds to heat is by sweating, whereby thermosensitive neurons in the hypothalamus instruct the sweat glands to release stored fluids and salts. This process, in turn, transfers heat energy away from the body via evaporation, resulting in a cooling of core body temperature. However, loss of fluid and subsequent dehydration can lead to further strain on the heart, as well as increase acute kidney injury and kidney failure in some vulnerable individuals. After prolonged heat exposure or exertion in hot temperatures, the body can lose its ability to thermoregulate and heatstroke can ensue. Heatstroke is a very serious condition that can lead to permanent damage to the brain, heart, and kidney, and even death. As with many health conditions, awareness of the dangers of heat exposure and the implementation of behavioural guidelines (such as taking breaks from exertion and staying hydrated during heatwaves) are effective methods for modifying some of these risks. However, research is urgently needed to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of heat dysregulation and its effects on the body, and to identify novel therapeutic targets and optimal cooling methods for patients in acute heat crisis. Increased environmental heat causes plants to release more allergy-inducing pollen, and can create conditions that lead to unhealthy ozone levels. Dust and wildfires, brought on by intensified droughts due to climate change, can also release fine, inhalable particulate matter (PM2•5) that can infiltrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. Fossil fuel combustion itself can directly contribute to fine particulate matter pollution and is attributable to an estimated 10•2 million premature deaths annually, according to a recent study in Environmental Research. These increases in allergens and pollutants intensify lung irritation, asthma-related symptoms, and have been linked to higher risk of lung cancer and death from cardiovascular complications. PM2•5 exposure has long been linked to severe outcomes during infectious disease outbreaks, and evidence is emerging that this association could also hold true for air pollution and COVID-19 disease severity. The developing fetus is also susceptible to both excess heat exposure and air pollution, with each factor contributing to an increased risk for adverse outcomes, including preterm birth and low birthweight, as outlined in a systematic review published in JAMA Network Open. The effects of heat and pollutants on pregnancy are likely to involve complex and multifactorial mechanisms that are not yet well understood. However, some studies have suggested decreased uterine blood flow and increased proinflammatory cytokine release as possible contributing factors from heat stress, and direct fetal toxicity and inflammation among other factors mediating air pollutant effects. A recent study in Molecular Psychiatry, for example, found that prenatal exposure to PM2•5 might affect neurodevelopment and behaviour in autistic children via long-term effects on mitochondrial respiration. Changes in temperature and environmental conditions can also contribute to increased incidence of infectious diseases by expanding the seasonal and geographic range of insect-vectored pathogens and by affecting migratory patterns of both people and insects. Research studies aimed at predicting spread of vector-borne illnesses, such as this 2016 EBioMedicine paper modelling Zika virus outbreak potential in Europe, are needed to inform public health risks of new climate-related epidemics. At EBioMedicine, we put our hope in science to help us navigate a changing climate. We aim to publish work that helps us understand mechanisms of climate-related and environment-related health outcomes, and that provides new insights for climate-adaptive therapies or novel mitigations. We will consider research, review articles, and commentary all along the intersection of climate and human health, and encourage a cross-disciplinary collaborative research approach to help achieve our common goals.","10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103782","74","","https://lens.org/061-119-848-864-414","103782","23523964","061-119-848-864-414","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","23523964","103782",""

By integrating microbial processes into current ecological paradigms, we have the opportunity to enhance the resilience of the biosphere to environmental change (Averill et al., 2022). A joint conference between the Ecological Society of Australia (ESA) and the Society of Conservation Biology Oceania (SCBO) in Wollongong, Australia, provided an excellent platform to hold a plant–soil ecology symposium that focussed on three key issues. First, to summarise the latest advances in documenting the microbial diversity from Australian ecosystems; second, to establish the ecological interactions that influence microbial diversity and functioning; and third, to harness soil microbial communities to inform fundamental plant ecology, as well as conservation and restoration practices. The field of soil microbial ecology has grown exponentially since the early 2000s, particularly with the onset of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies (Zimmerman et al., 2014). These tools have allowed ecologists to explore microbial diversity across the globe (Tedersoo et al., 2014), to predict the effects of global change factors such as drought and warming on soil microbial communities (Tedersoo et al., 2022), and to address challenges in ecosystem restoration by harnessing beneficial plant–microbe interactions (Averill et al., 2022). Despite such progress, significant gaps in knowledge persist across different geographic regions and biomes. For instance, only 5% of fungal HTS samples in the GlobalFungi Database currently originate from Australia. The majority of samples come from Asia (34%), Europe (31%), and North America (21%; Větrovský et al., 2020). Australia is considered a global centre of diversity for multifunctional root types, such as dual mycorrhizas (roots that associate with both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi; Teste et al., 2020). Multifunctional root types have allowed members of Acacia (Fabaceae) and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) to thrive in the shallow, nutrient-poor soils of Australia (Brundrett, 2017). Additionally, Australia has globally distinct geographic patterns of mycorrhizal type dominance (AM or EM) in forests (Steidinger et al., 2019) and is also a diversity hub for ectomycorrhizal plants (Brundrett & Tedersoo, 2018). The harsh climatic conditions of Australia, including scarce water and extreme events such as fire and drought, play a central role in shaping the composition of both plants and microbial communities above and belowground (Eldridge et al., 2018; Egidi et al., 2019; Legge et al., 2023). These peculiar features make comparison with ecosystems from other ecoregions of the world difficult, highlighting the need for studies addressing challenges specific to the Australian continent. A recent review on the loss of terrestrial biodiversity in Australia found that species extinction rates are predicted to escalate across all taxa assessed (Legge et al., 2023); however, similar assessments are lacking for soil microbial diversity (Birnbaum & Dearnaley, 2023). ESA is the main body for ecologists in Australia and has hosted plant–soil ecology symposia at its annual conference since 2016 (Birnbaum, 2022). These symposia provide a platform to showcase the latest advancements in plant–soil ecology, with a focus on the unique plant–microbial diversity and environmental conditions of Australia. The 2022 ESA plant–soil ecology symposium brought together the largest meeting of plant–soil ecologists in ESA history and was well attended by leading experts in the field and next-generation early career ecologists interested in soil microbial ecology (Fig. 1). Here, we highlight the latest research from the 2022 ESA plant–soil ecology symposium as it pertains to native Australian mycorrhizal fungi; ecological interactions that influence plant–microbial diversity and functioning; and state-of-the-art approaches for utilising soil microbes in ecosystem conservation and restoration (Fig. 2). Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are a widespread group of symbiotic microbes that play a critical role in fostering plant growth and success (Brundrett, 2017). By forming associations with most terrestrial plants, AM fungi can boost plant uptake of key nutrients and water while the plants provide carbon (Smith & Read, 2008). These fungi also have the capacity to offer various other benefits to their host plants such as improved resistance to disease, herbivory, and various abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, and heavy metals (Norman et al., 1996; Hajiboland et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2020; Riaz et al., 2021). The use of mycorrhizal fungi in agriculture holds enormous promise for promoting sustainable agriculture as these microbes can help to reduce the need for environmentally detrimental fertilisers and pesticides and can also help to protect crops from the effects of climate change (Heuck et al., 2023). While there have been ongoing efforts to explore the diversity and ecological roles of AM fungi in an Australian context, there remains a paucity of knowledge on the drivers of AM fungal community assembly in both natural and agricultural environments of Australia (Fig. 2a). Additionally, the impacts of agricultural practices on resident AM fungal populations have been seldom explored (but see Albornoz et al., 2022). A new initiative at the Western Sydney University led by Adam Frew is seeking to address these issues. 'Dig Up Dirt' (https://www.digupdirt.net/) is a national research project that aims to survey AM fungal communities in agroecosystems via DNA metabarcoding of soil samples to assess how agricultural practices impact soil AM fungal communities and how this varies across Australian climates and soils (Fig. 2b). The project will expand understanding of Australian AM fungal diversity and facilitate more effective management of these key biota to the benefit of sustainable agriculture. Another avenue for explorative research is cataloguing the diversity of rainforest soil fungi in Australia (Fig. 2c). Extensive areas of rainforest were burnt within the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia during catastrophic wildfires in 2019–2020 (Nolan et al., 2020; Baker et al., 2022). Large parts of the rainforest were damaged as part of the 3.8 million ha of forest burnt in the state of New South Wales (Nolan et al., 2020). Having no previous fire history, these ecosystems were severely impacted (Nolan et al., 2020). A recent study assessed fire resilience traits of 228 taxa that were affected by this unprecedented fire event and found over 63% of taxa resprouting and recruitment occurring in 62% of taxa postfire (Baker et al., 2022). However, how the fires may have affected resident mycoflora is unclear, as there is a paucity of knowledge about the diversity of Australian rainforest fungi. Luke Florence (Latrobe University) is seeking to analyse the diversity of rainforest soil fungi in a meta-analysis using HTS data collected from Australian Microbiome (www.australianmicrobiome.com/) and Global Soil Mycobiome (doi: 10.15156/BIO/2263453) datasets (Fig. 2c). Differential abundance analysis has indicated key fungal genera from tropical, subtropical, and temperate rainforests. This research will establish an important baseline understanding of Australian rainforest fungi and elucidate the effects of climate on fungal community composition. This information will be crucial to the future conservation and restoration of these unique ecosystems, especially with changing climate and fire frequencies (Baker et al., 2022). Australia appears to be a global hotspot of Serendipita mycorrhizal fungi with nine new species (of 22 species known world-wide) recently described from the continent (Crous et al., 2020, 2022; Oktalira et al., 2021). These culturable basidiomycetes occur in the underground tissues of a range of plant species, including orchids, grasses, ericads, and liverworts (Weiss et al., 2016). The Dearnaley research group (University of Southern Queensland) is focussed on the discovery of novel Australian Serendipita species and testing these fungi for the capacity to improve agricultural plant growth and disease resistance (Fig. 2b). A recently described species, Serendipita whamiae has been grown in flasks with tomato seedlings (John Dearnaley, University of Southern Queensland). The symbiont increased the growth of plants and protected them against disease caused by powdery mildew fungi. These results show that Australian Serendipita fungi may be of value to sustainable agricultural approaches in future. This clearly warrants more research. We are only beginning to understand how multiple interacting soil organisms impact the associations of mycorrhizal fungi with native plant roots (Frew, 2022; Frew et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2023). Most terrestrial plants are AM, and almost all of these will deal with insect herbivory in one form or another (Frew et al., 2022). Despite the ubiquity of these tripartite interactions, the data on how herbivory can shape communities of AM fungi in plant roots is scant. Using a factorial pot experiment, Adam Frew (Western Sydney University) explored how insect root herbivory impacted the diversity and community structure of AM fungi in the roots of Dicanthium sericium (Frew, 2022). Root herbivory caused reduction in fungal species richness and a shift in community structure, characterised by an increase in certain taxa (e.g. Paraglomus) and a decrease in others (e.g. Archaeospora). Additionally, root herbivory was associated with a decline in plant phosphorus levels, suggesting a potential link between changes in AM fungal communities and plant nutrient status. These findings highlight the critical role that belowground insect herbivory can play in shaping root fungal communities and its potential implications for plant productivity in agricultural settings. Tom Mansfield (Murdoch University) has investigated the effects of Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback on resident fungal communities (Fig. 2c). Phytophthora cinnamomi is an invasive soilborne plant pathogen threatening the persistence of native Australian plant communities, a considerable ecological issue in the Southwest Botanical Province of Western Australia (Shearer et al., 2004, 2007). Seedlings of an ectomycorrhizal tree and AM clover were cultivated in P. cinnamomi-infested and -noninfested soil in a glasshouse. HTS of associated root fungi showed that the host plants maintained their respective mycorrhizal fungal associations in the presence of P. cinnamomi. These findings are significant from a restoration perspective because native fungal communities could improve seedling survival in the presence of the Phytophthora pathogen. Carlos Aguilar-Trigueros (Western Sydney University/University of Jyväskylä) discussed the traits of fungal spores and the importance of a trait-based approach in fungal ecology (Aguilar-Trigueros et al., 2023). These authors found that spore size variation among sexual and asexual spores was strongly linked to species' evolutionary history. This work advances life-history theory by highlighting that the evolution of plant–fungal symbiosis has been the key driver in influencing fungal spore morphology (Aguilar-Trigueros et al., 2023). This work has the potential to provide information about fungal traits in Australia (Fig. 2b). More is being learnt about the impacts of anthropogenic ecosystem degradation on Australian soil microbial communities. In a study conducted by Kumari Rajapaksha (Western Sydney University) looking at three threatened plant community types near Sydney, it was shown that richness and cover of exotic plant species were associated with increased nutrient availability and an abundance of gram-negative bacteria, protozoa, and specific fungal taxa, including AM fungi (Fig. 2c). These relationships differed between the plant community types highlighting the importance of having appropriate plans for monitoring and rehabilitating specific plant community types. Felipe Albornoz (CSIRO) has also recently shown that AM fungal richness was generally higher in degraded sites than in reference native eucalypt woodland sites. Degradation of eucalypt woodlands was associated with the introduction of 'weedy' AM fungi, which might promote or maintain disturbed ecosystems (Fig. 2e). Removing soil nutrients (N and P) and exotic plants may shift AM fungal communities towards reference native eucalypt woodland sites. This poses the question of how do we best manage 'weedy' AM fungi. In a separate study, Pankaj Singh (Western Sydney University) showed that land management practices, irrigation and fertilisation, had contrasting effects on the microbiome assembly of Eucalyptus saligna. Irrigation increased microbial alpha diversity while fertilisation had the opposite effect. Irrigation and fertilisation affected soil edaphic properties, bulk soil, and rhizosphere microbiome significantly. Though there was some effect on the root microbiome, the leaf traits and leaf microbiome assembly were not affected significantly by irrigation or fertilisation. A host's selection and filtering mechanism was the main driver of leaf microbiome assembly, while land management practices were pivotal in bulk soil and rhizosphere microbiome assembly. Digging animals, for example echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), quenda (Isoodon fusciventer) and woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi), are important ecosystem engineers, turning over soil and facilitating the spread of soil fungi, especially mycorrhizal fungi in Australia (Dundas et al., 2018; Tay et al., 2018; Decker et al., 2023). In undisturbed Australian ecosystems, aridity decreases the diversity of microbial carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZYmes). Little is known about how aridity and digging mammals interact to affect the microbial genetic potential for C cycling. Eleonora Egidi from Western Sydney University found that the effects of mammal digging on microbial C cycling were most pronounced under xeric conditions, and that aridity shaped the diversity and structure of CAZYmes, while also driving the effect of mammal bioturbation on the microbial potential for C cycling across Australia. In another study, Anna Hopkins (Edith Cowan University) analysed mammal diggings in Western Australia and found that fungal composition was affected by urban remnant size, type and condition of vegetation, and soil type. These results indicated that digging mammal populations within urban landscapes perform important ecosystem functions by dispersing fungi that facilitate fungal–plant interactions, contributing to ecosystem health (Hopkins et al., 2021). Taken together, these findings highlight the important roles digging animals play in soil fungal ecology and dispersal in both arid and urban ecosystems in Australia and the need for further research. The United Nations Decade of Ecosystem Restoration was announced in 2021 with the goal of highlighting the need for collective efforts to revive degraded ecosystems. Above- and belowground plant microbiomes are fundamental to plant health and ecosystem functioning (Averill et al., 2022). Plant aboveground microbiomes have received considerably more attention; thus, there is considerable research required in the belowground space. Australia provides an opportunity for such investigations, particularly given the extensive vegetation clearing that has occurred over the past two centuries since European colonisation (Legge et al., 2023). Australian trees and shrubs are unusual in that they can often associate with both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular fungi. In a study of the fungal communities of restored montane forests and former open-cut coal mines (Jeff Powell, Western Sydney University), ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi were underrepresented while AM fungi were overrepresented, compared with reference sites. The degree of under/overrepresentation was associated with vegetation and soil attributes that are important for the recovery of ecosystem structure and function. This suggests that the occurrence of AM and EM fungi is driven more by the health of the broader ecosystem than by the functional requirements of woody plants. It also implies that AM fungi are an indicator of processes that may negatively affect the recovery of EM fungi. Significantly, patterns were observed suggesting that AM fungi may prevent the recovery of EM fungi and serve as a barrier to restoration; thus, management practices that suppress AM fungi may be required to support ecosystem recovery and restoration. Soil microbiota are fundamentally linked to the restoration of degraded ecosystems; therefore, DNA-based methods to characterise shifts in soil bacterial community composition have been developed to track restoration progress. Successful restoration of postagricultural landscapes back to biodiverse, functional, and self-sustaining ecosystems is often hampered by legacies that linger from decades of unsustainable land use (Lem et al., 2022; Peddle et al., 2023). Developed from restoration chronosequence study datasets, a new 'rehabilitation trajectory assessment' (Liddicoat et al., 2022) offers promise to help monitor and inform adaptive management practices and predict the ecological progress of restoration sites towards reference states (Craig Liddicoat, Flinders University). While our understanding of how plant communities recover is improving, we still lack a sound understanding of how soil microbiota respond postagricultural restoration. Shawn Peddle from Flinders University used an amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16s DNA extracted from soil to examine how bacterial communities differ between different types of land conditions postrestoration in southwest Western Australia. They used four spatially paired land conditions, degraded, passively restored, actively revegetated, and remnant bushland, either with or without a history of intensive agricultural use. His results show an absence of recovery in soil bacterial communities in postagricultural sites, with degraded and revegetated sites comparable to each other but dissimilar to remnant sites without any history of agricultural land use. These results indicate that revegetation up to 17 yr earlier has not initiated a clear recovery of soil microbiota and a legacy of altered soil nutrient levels is likely impeding recovery. This study highlights the challenges facing the restoration of soil microbiota in postagricultural settings and the implications for whole ecosystem recovery. Although drylands support 40% of the earth's population, with naturally low and infrequent rainfall these systems are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change over longer and more severe droughts (James et al., 2013). This is of concern for Australia where drylands support most grazing, and sustain unique and diverse flora and fauna, which have already suffered great biodiversity loss (Zika & Erb, 2009). Research has been conducted to identify key microbes influencing seedling establishment of native plants in grazed drylands under drought scenarios (Jana Stewart, University of New South Wales). Soil-associated microbes were examined in three functionally different key dryland plant species, Acacia aneura, Atriplex nummularia, and Astrebla lappacea, to understand compositional or functional changes that may occur in soil biota under drought stress. Microbes were examined at germination and again after a drought simulation to assess key microbial communities for seedling establishment and resilience to drought. This research indicated the microbial functional groups that are most vulnerable to drought and also those most resilient and resistant to changes in climate. The results of this study offer powerful baseline information to understand ecosystem responses to changes in climate and assist in establishing priorities in land management strategies. The use of microbial inoculants as an ecologically friendly approach to enhance plant growth and establishment in dryland ecosystems has been recommended (Frederick Dadzie, University of New South Wales; Dadzie et al., 2022, Machado-de-Lima et al., 2023). To address these knowledge gaps, a meta-analysis of 62 globally distributed dryland studies, including from Australia, was conducted to test the effect sizes of microbial origin and species type on plant growth. Results presented at the conference showed that microbial inoculation generally increased plant growth in dryland ecosystems compared with their uninoculated counterparts. However, there was no significant difference in plant growth between native microbial inoculants and commercial microbial inoculants (Dadzie et al., 2023). Therefore, inoculation of beneficial microorganisms may yield a positive outcome on plant growth, and factors such as microbial origin and microbial species type might play a limited role in influencing plant performance in dryland ecosystems. Plant–microorganism interactions (i.e. plant–soil feedbacks (PSF)) have been used in soil ecology to study soil and plant reciprocal interactions and inform plant invasions. However, how specific PSF are within and among species has been less studied. Paola Rallo from the Netherlands Institute of Ecology presented her latest research on the specificity of PSF within and among widely distributed grass species (Lolium perenne, Poa pratensis, and Schedonorus arundinaceus), of which all are naturalised in Australia. The results from this work showed differences in PSF effects on plant growth between the three species but not between cultivars within species (Rallo et al., 2023). Furthermore, microbial fungal and bacterial taxa were identified as potential candidates responsible for these effects (Rallo et al., 2023). Giancarlo M. Chiarenza (UNSW Sydney) used the PSF approach with the study species Plantago lanceolata, a cosmopolitan introduced herb (Kloot, 1980). In this unpublished study, seeds from two native (Europe) and two introduced (Australia) populations were planted in a glasshouse in sterile and live inoculated soils coming from 30 Australian sites. There was no evidence of a relationship between seed germination percentage and soil treatment, suggesting that plant–soil feedbacks are not enough to control the seed stage in Plantago lanceolata. As a consequence, biocontrol strategies should focus on a different plant life stage to reduce the risk of plant invasions (Chiarenza, pers. comm). Australia has the second largest area of mangroves and saltmarshes in the world due to its extensive coastline (Giri et al., 2011; Mcowen et al., 2017). These vegetated coastal ecosystems provide critical ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and storm surge protection (Farrer et al., 2022). However, we know surprisingly little about the role of soil and root microbial communities in these ecosystems (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the role belowground microbiomes play in restoration success in saltmarsh and mangrove ecosystems. Potential pathways and challenges associated with including the belowground microbiome in mangrove and saltmarsh restoration via a conceptual framework, with a focus on Australia were presented (Christina Birnbaum, University of Southern Queensland). There is a large gap of knowledge that exists in plant–microbe literature as it pertains to coastal restoration warranting future research (Birnbaum & Trevathan-Tackett, 2022). More research is needed to significantly advance both fundamental and applied knowledge through better understanding of the importance of coastal microbiomes to restoration success by stakeholders and funding bodies. Australia's soils are characterised as old, highly weathered, and stripped of nutrients (Fig. 2). At the same time, Australia has high endemism of native plants that rely on belowground fungal and bacterial communities to acquire nutrients and water they need. Australia's native plant diversity is rapidly decreasing due to competition with invasive plants and global climate change (Legge et al., 2023). Our ability to translate fundamental ecological plant–soil research into applied solutions for conservation, restoration, and management of Australia's unique ecosystems as well as agroecosystems has never been more urgent. As we are learning more about plant-associated microbial diversity, we need to work collaboratively to develop cost-effective approaches that best harness soil microbial communities and inform conservation and restoration practices in a changing climate. In summary, we need more targeted inventories to describe soil microbial diversity and function in Australia (similar to Bissett et al., 2016) if we are to tap into its full potential to restore and conserve ecosystems (Fig. 2b,d,f). The crucial next step is to start including soil biota in policy frameworks similar to plants and wildlife (Birnbaum & Dearnaley, 2023). This would ensure more investment into soil research and provide accountability in soil conservation. The authors are grateful to the organisers of the ESA 2022 conference in Wollongong, Australia.

PyOM wird entweder durch nat¨ rliche Br¨ nde (Holzkoh- o u a le) oder durch k¨ nstliche Pyrolyse landwirtschaftlicher Nebenprodukte (Biokohle) erzeugt. u Ergebnisse von Abbaustudien (Inkubationsexperimente) sowie alte Radiokarbonalter von PyOM weisen darauf hin, dass PyOM eine relativ lange Umsatzzeit besitzt. Es bestehen jedoch grosse Unsicherheiten bez¨ glich der Bedeutung der verschiedenen Verlustprozes- u se von PyOM aus B¨ den (Mineralisierung, Auswaschung), dessen Raten, sowie bez¨ glich o u m¨ glichen Wechselwirkungen mit der restlichen (nativen) organischen Bodensubstanz. Um o den Einﬂuss von PyOM auf den globalen Kohlenstoffkreislauf zu verstehen, ist es von ent- scheidender Bedeutung, die Umsatzzeiten von PyOM zu bestimmen, sowie dessen Einﬂuss auf die Mineralisierung nativer organischer Bodensubstanz zu erfassen. Die vorliegende Ar- beit untersucht den Einﬂuss von PyOM auf den Bodenkohlenstoffhaushalt, unter spezieller Betrachtung der Auswirkungen von mineralischen Stickstoffeintr¨ gen auf die Mineralisie- a rung von PyOM. Die vorliegende Doktorarbeit besteht aus drei unabh¨ ngigen Studien: (i) a eine Feldstudie um die relative Bedeutung der PyOM Verlustprozesse zu bestimmen, (ii) ein Inkubationsexperiment um die Kohlenstoff- und Stickstoffdynamik in B¨ den nach der Zu- o gabe von PyOM zu untersuchen und (iii) eine Metaanalyse des Primingeffekts, einer Wech- selwirkung zwischen PyOM und der nativen organischen Bodensubstanz.. Im Feld- sowie im Inkubationsexperiment wurde mit stabilen Isotopen markierte organische Substanz ver- wendet um dessen Mineralisierung zu untersuchen. Im Feldexperiment wurde beobach- tet, dass (1) der Abbau von Pinienholz durch Pyrolyse um einen Faktor von 60 abnahm, dass (2) erh¨ hter Stickstoffeintrag die Mineralisierungsrate von PyOM herabsetzt und dass o (3) Verluste durch Verlagerung von frischem PyOM entlang des Bodenproﬁls (Auswa- schung) vernachl¨ ssigbar sind im Vergleich zu Verlusten durch Mineralisierung zu CO2. a Im Inkubationsexperiment wurde der Einﬂuss von Weidelgras-PyOM auf die Mineralisie- rung der organischen Bodensubstanz (Primingeffekt) in Abh¨ ngigkeit der Stickstoffein- a tr¨ ge erfasst. Der Abbau von Weidelgras-PyOM wurde nicht von Stickstoffzugaben beein- a ﬂusst. F¨ r Pinienholz-PyOM wurden allerdings unterschiedliche Effekte beobachtet, was u m¨ glicherweise auf den h¨ heren Stickstoffgehalt in Weidelgrass-PyOM zur¨ ckzuf¨ hren o o u u ist. Weidelgrass-PyOM wies h¨ here Wasserstoff zu Kohlenstoff Verh¨ ltnisse (H/C) auf o a und hatte eine h¨ here Abbaurate als Pinienholz-PyOM, was die Anwendbarkeit des H/C- o Verh¨ ltnisses (ein Indikator f¨ r PyOM Aromatizit¨ t) zur Vorhersage der PyOM Stabilit¨ t a u a a best¨ tigt. Des Weiteren ein zwei-Phasen-Primingeffekt von PyOM auf den Abbau der nati- a ven organischen Bodensubstanz beobachtet: in kurzen Zeitr¨ umen verursacht PyOM einen a a ¨ positiven Primingeffekt, w¨ hrend sie uber l¨ ngere Zeitr¨ ume einen negativen Primingeffekt a a verursacht. Das zeitliche Muster des von PyOM verursachten Primingeffekts konnte in der Metaanalyse best¨ tigt werden. Die Metaanalyse zeigte, dass positives Priming meistens in a kurzen Zeitr¨ umen stattﬁndet und von PyOM mit niedrigen Kohlenstoffgehalten verursacht a wird. Eine m¨ gliche Erkl¨ rung ist, dass die Pr¨ senz einer labilen Fraktion in PyOM die o a a Aktivit¨ t von Mikroorganismen beeinﬂusst und dadurch die Mineralisierung von organi- a schem Bodenkohlenstoff erh¨ ht. Zusammenfassend konnte mit dieser Doktorarbeit gezeigt o werden, dass die chemische Zusammensetzung und das Ausgangsmaterial von PyOM eine wichtige Rolle zur Vorhersage der PyOM-Stabilit¨ t spielen und dass anf¨ nglich positives a a Priming m¨ glicherweise die Efﬁzienz von PyOM als Kohlenstoffsenke mindert.

In fact PyOM is produced either by wildﬁres (charcoal) or by pyrolysis of agricultural residues (biochar). PyOM has a very low decomposition rate and determining its turnover time and the interaction with the surrounding soil organic matter are key issues to understand the C cycle. The present work investigates the impact of PyOM on soil C budget, with a special regard to the impact of mineral N deposition on PyOM mineralization. The present thesis is com- posed of three independent studies: a ﬁeld study to investigate the pathway loss for PyOM, an incubation experiment to elucidate C and N dynamics in PyOM amended soil, and a meta-analysis of the priming effect induced by PyOM on soil organic carbon. Both in the ﬁeld and in the incubation experiment the stable isotopes of C and N were used to estimate organic matter dynamics. In the ﬁeld experiment it was observed that pyrolysis decreased by a factor of 60 the de- composability of pinewood, that N depressed the mineralization of PyOM and that losses and translocation along the soil proﬁle from fresh PyOM are negligible compared to losses as CO2 . In the incubation experiment the inﬂuence of ryegrass-derived PyOM on soil organic matter mineralization (priming effect) were investigated together with the effect of N addition on PyOM mineralization. We observed that ryegrass-derived PyOM decomposition was not sensitive to N addition, probably due its richness in N content, and had a higher decom- position rate than pinewood-derived PyOM, conﬁrming the goodness of the H:C ratio (an indicator for PyOM aromaticity) as a predictor of PyOM stability. Moreover we observed that PyOM induced a two-phase priming effect on native soil organic matter decomposi- tion: on the short term it induced positive priming while it induced negative priming in a second stage. PyOM induced priming effect was further investigated in a meta-analysis that conﬁrmed this temporal pattern. We found that positive priming effect was induced mostly on the short term and by PyOM characterised by a low C content. I believe that the presence of a labile fraction in PyOM may trigger the activity of soil microorganisms and increase soil organic matter mineralization. I conclude that PyOM chemistry and feedstock play an important role in predicting PyOM stability, and that priming effect may decrease the efﬁciency of PyOM as a C-sink. Furthermore in the future the increase in N deposition may affect the stability of PyOM, probably depending on the availability of PyOM-N.","10.5167/uzh-105307","","","https://lens.org/066-661-116-713-161","","","066-661-116-713-161","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Learn more.Copy URL Share a linkShare onFacebookTwitterLinked InRedditWechat Medical educators and representatives of medical student associations in Australia and New Zealand are collaborating on an initiative on climate change and health in medical education Climate change and environmental degradation are harming the health of Australians and New Zealanders and pose a serious challenge to our health care systems.1, 2 The World Health Organization in 2019 identified climate change and air pollution as the top threat to human health globally;3 a threat clearly visible in the sustained air pollution over south-eastern Australia from bushfire smoke during the 2019–20 bushfire season. The health consequences of the bushfires and the associated prolonged, hazardous air quality prompted the Australian Medical Association and three medical colleges to declare climate change a public health emergency.4 Health care systems also contribute to climate change and environmental degradation. In Australia, health care contributes 7% of the country’s total carbon emissions and produces considerable waste which is either incinerated or sent to landfill.5 Despite these environmental challenges, there has been little response by medical programs to prepare medical graduates to manage the health impacts of climate change, and to practise environmentally sustainable health care. In 2018, we described an initiative to support medical educators and medical student organisations to work collaboratively to develop proposed learning objectives, curricula and learning resources addressing the health effects of climate change.6 This article describes the development of the model graduate outcome statements and learning objectives which have been shared with all medical schools in Australasia. Background to development Australia and New Zealand have accreditation standards for the education of the regulated health professions. For the medical profession in Australia and New Zealand, standards are maintained by the Australian Medical Council (AMC), including for the 23 university medical schools offering medical programs.7 The standards for medical programs include graduate outcome statements, which describe what medical students should be able to do at graduation. Forty statements are grouped into four domains of practice (science and scholarship, clinical practice, health and society, professionalism and leadership) and these inform the development of medical curricula. Accreditation standards are used to ensure quality and drive change in practice. The current accreditation standards and graduate outcome statements do not mention climate change or environmentally sustainable health care. Consequently, developing suitable amendments to these standards and statements, with which medical educators are already familiar, can help frame curriculum change. A Working Group on Climate Change and Health was formed when medical educators from several Australian medical schools submitted a proposal to the Medical Deans Australia and New Zealand Medical Education Collaborative Committee that it explore the development of model learning objectives and learning resources regarding the impact of climate change on health. To examine current environmentally sustainable health care education, the Working Group searched the literature, reviewed teaching experience, and benchmarked against relevant courses developed for medical students, including those developed by students for their peers.8-13 Through this process, the Working Group identified five broad areas of learning to guide the development of curriculum resources including proposed graduate outcome statements and learning objectives: ▪ the evidence for anthropogenic climate change and how this relates to the environmental determinants of health; ▪ the impact of climate change on health; ▪ the impact of climate change on the health system; ▪ the environmental impact of the health sector and the elements of environmentally sustainable health care; and ▪ creating change, both intra- and inter-sectorally, through practice, advocacy and leadership. The current 2012 AMC graduate outcome statements were mapped against these five areas to determine whether they were sufficient or whether amendments or new statements were required. A minimal change approach was adopted, mirroring changes to the accreditation standards adopted in 2018 by the United Kingdom General Medical Council.14 Rather than referring specifically to climate change, the General Medical Council focuses on the environment as a determinant of health. By 2020, all UK medical schools were required to ensure that graduating doctors were able to apply the knowledge and principles of environmentally sustainable health care to their practice (graduate outcome 25). The Working Group considered that, by focusing on the environment as a determinant of health, climate change would be addressed. As sustainable health care in Australia usually refers to financial sustainability, to avoid confusion, the term environmental sustainability is used. The amendments proposed by the Working Group also introduce the concept that decisions taken today in the care of patients and populations should not compromise the health of future generations. Graduate outcome statements: proposed amendments The proposed amendments to the graduate outcome statements represent modest changes to the existing statements. Fourteen statements were identified: ten were modified to be aligned and four did not require amendment. Statements have been identified in all four AMC domains of practice. The Box presents the statements with the suggested amendments. Box 1.

Communicate effectively about ethical issues with patients, family and other health care professionals. ▪ Discuss ethical tensions between allocating resources to individual patients and protecting the environment upon which the health of the wider community depends10 (this objective also aligns with 3.1). * Source: Climate Change and Health Working Group of Medical Deans Australia and New Zealand. Learning objectives regarding climate change and health in medical and health professional education that support each statement have been identified from recently published literature.8-13 Many of these learning objectives have been through a process of validation. In some instances, a learning objective can be aligned with more than one statement. In 2018, when the Working Group was examining this literature, the literature was restricted, reflecting the lack of activity in health professions education to prepare the health workforce for climate change. The sources were therefore supplemented by the Core Climate and Health Competencies for Health Professionals developed by a global consortium convened through Columbia University.15 In some instances, it was necessary for the Working Group to develop new learning objectives. The Box also presents these learning objectives and indicates the statements they support. Distribution and next steps The proposed graduate outcome statements and learning objectives were circulated to the Deans of all medical schools in August 2018 for further consideration and as a potential curriculum resource when considering curriculum review. Resourcing changes to curricula is a major hurdle to the successful implementation of change. However, the suggested amendments will only be sustained and embedded into practice across Australia and New Zealand if they are adopted by the AMC and become part of the Standards for Assessment and Accreditation of Primary Medical Programs. A review by the AMC of the accreditation standards for primary medical programs opened in 2021 and the consultation process for this review continues in 2022 (https://www.amc.org.au/review-of-accreditation-standards-for-primary-medical-programs-medical-schools/). A submission has been provided to the consultation by the authors. Measuring and monitoring From 2023, the annual MJA–Lancet Countdown report aims to report an indicator describing progress on the inclusion of environmental sustainability and the health impacts of climate change in medical curricula in Australia.2 The authors are looking to establish a research agenda to determine how this indicator could be introduced. Its purpose, who will use it, and what data will be collected and how, will be established with stakeholder involvement. Medical educators internationally and other health professions in Australia have shown strong interest in this collaborative approach to aligning the education of health professional graduates with environmentally sustainable health care. Conclusion Through this initiative, the collaboration of medical educators and medical student associations in Australasia has shared with all medical schools an approach to incorporating the health effects of climate change and the environmental impact of health care within medical curricula. The work is stimulating a dialogue within faculties and among medical students. The process recognises the essential contribution of the AMC Standards to secure and drive these changes to prepare medical graduates to practise environmentally sustainable health care. Amending the AMC graduate outcome statements to frame curricula change, and working through the network of medical schools, enables system level change in medical curricula. New patterns of disease are already emerging and medical practice is evolving as health care systems are challenged to become more environmentally sustainable; doctors and other health professionals are increasingly using their influence to help society transition to an environmentally sustainable future. Health educators have an essential part to play in preparing future doctors for these roles.

This paper aims to provide a state-of-art weather index insurance design, thereby including methods for natural hazards’ indices calculation, vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) using the Scopus database. First, 364 peer-reviewed articles from 2010 to present were screened for a bibliometric analysis and then, the 34 most cited articles from the past five years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a great research effort on index insurance, the majority of them focused on food insecurity through agricultural and crop insurance. Also, climate change and basis risks were found highly relevant for weather index insurance, but weakly developed, suggesting challenges around food insecurity. Special focus was given to drought hazards, while other hazards such as temperature variation, excessive rainfall and wildfires were slightly covered. Emerging areas, namely agricultural, hydrological, and sustainable index insurance found promissory for insurance. Also, current state-of-the-art lacks methods for incorporating multi-hazard risk evaluation in vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards. Thus, we summarized the most common methods for calculating indices, estimating losses using indices, pricing risks, and evaluating insurance index policies. This review promotes a starting point in weather index insurance design towards a multi-hazard resilient society.","10.5194/egusphere-2022-498-rc2","","","https://lens.org/069-488-240-792-795","","","069-488-240-792-795","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

In the past few months, major reviews have appeared in Science, Genetics, and Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. In April, Nature profiled the growing job prospects in lncRNA research, noting, “Enthusiasm for lncRNA has replaced much of the science community's scepticism” (1).A decade ago, things looked very different. Although researchers were aware of a few biologically important long noncoding RNAs, such as Xist and H19, these were largely discounted as special cases. In fact, so ingrained was this opinion that John Mattick, an lncRNA pioneer then at the University of Queensland, was pretty much flying solo in 2001 when he proposed that regulatory RNAs, not proteins, “form the primary control architecture that underpins eukaryotic differentiation and development” (2).“It seemed to me, and it still does, that people have missed the point,” says Mattick, who is now the Executive Director of the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, Australia. “Most of the assumptions that we operate on in molecular biology derive from the initial assumption that most genetic information is transacted by proteins. And while that's largely true in bacteria, it's not true for humans.”In bacteria, RNA largely exits in its most well-known, well-characterized forms: tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA. But according to Mattick, in humans and other higher eukaryotes, most RNAs orchestrate very specific epigenetic hierarchies that control gene expression in four dimensions. “They're actually the computational engine of multicellular development.”And a very malleable, robust engine at that. A single segment of the genome may contain layer upon layer of control sequences, thanks to a combination of epigenetic signals, sense and antisense transcription, and alternative splicing. “Each locus, each region of the genome is unzipped—transcribed, that is—in wildly different patterns. It's just extraordinary how densely packed our genome is with information,” explains Mattick.Today, the broader research community seems finally to have caught on, awarding more research dollars than ever before to efforts focused on characterizing key players within the RNA world.Still, it's no surprise that the researchers who choose to pursue these curious molecular RNA creatures seem to consider themselves explorers within a strange new world—a world Harvard University geneticist John Rinn calls “Noncodarnia.”Through the wardrobeAlthough Rinn (whose Twitter handle is @noncodarnia) has been pursing noncoding RNAs since graduate school, that's not what he wanted to do when he first enrolled at Yale. “I was certain to be a crystallographer,” he recalls. But during an “amazing rotation” through Michael Snyder's lab, he discovered microarrays and was hooked, studying the transcriptional output first of chromosome 22 and, eventually, the entire genome.That output included noncoding RNAs, a topic Rinn wanted to pursue as a postdoc. Most potential advisors he approached, though, were unconvinced. Then he met dermatology researcher Howard Chang at Stanford University, who was just setting up his own lab and was willing to take on an unconventional project.“A lot of people at the time didn't want a postdoc to study a lot of bogus hocus-pocus,” says Rinn. However, the gamble paid off. In 2007, Rinn and Chang discovered HOTAIR, an lncRNA from the human HOX locus that also binds the epigenetic regulator Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Researchers had previously suspected that noncoding RNAs could play a role in epigenetics, but HOTAIR was the first RNA molecule shown to actually carry out such a function.“RNA has always been the deviant molecule,” notes the 37-year-old Rinn. “It always will do something you think something couldn't do.”RNA enzymes? Check. Telomere maintenance? Check. RNA interference? Check, again.Courtesy of John Rinn, Mitch Guttman, Sigrid Hart.But unlike those other RNAs, lncRNAs don't have a single, defined function. “We're calling long noncoding RNAs a class, when actually the only definition is that they are longer than 200 bp,” says Ana Marques, a Research Fellow at the University of Oxford who uses evolutionary approaches to understand lncRNA function. As a consequence, working out the function of novel lncRNAs is very difficult.“You may have to clone 15 lncRNAs before you're going to find one that has an effect that you might have been hypothesizing,” says Rinn.Homing in on functionResearchers have managed to decode the functions of a few lncRNAs—perhaps 1% of all human noncoding transcripts, Marques estimates. Some, like Xist and the newly discovered Braveheart, which are implicated in X-inactivation and cardiac development, respectively, are nuclear transcripts that, like HOTAIR, bind Polycomb-group proteins. Another class of lncRNAs, called 1/2-sbsRNAs, are cytoplasmic molecules that mediate RNA decay. And still others, like lincRNA-RoR, act as molecular sponges, soaking up and neutralizing microRNAs.“There is no unifying umbrella like for microRNAs,” says Leonard Lipovich, a lncRNA expert at Wayne State University. In a recent review on lncRNAs, Jeannie Lee, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Harvard Medical School who studies X-inactivation, includes a figure illustrating some 16 distinct functions for lncRNAs (3).“It's like you're going through the wardrobe into this crazy, mysterious land, and it's both exciting and scary at the same time,” says Rinn. “You're seeing all these mysterious creatures you've never seen before and yet, you don't know how to navigate it, you don't know what to do.”Rinn's lab focuses on RNA mapping and functional analysis of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). They use next-gen DNA sequencing to chart the former; for the latter, it's guilt-by-association: watching for coding transcripts whose abundance rises and falls with that of a specific lincRNA. A match provides evidence that the lncRNA and protein might function in the same pathway, a hypothesis that then must be tested.The process is high-tech, but crude. “It's almost like looking at Noncodarnia thru an Atari rather than an Xbox,” says Rinn, who tends to pepper his conversation with pop-culture references. Unlike protein researchers, “We're in a low-res form of the field.”That's in part because there are so few tools available specifically for studying lncRNA. Rinn says the one constant in his career has been the need to use what he calls the “the MacGyver approach,” creating solutions from tools that weren't necessarily designed to address the problem at hand.In 2008, for instance, his team was having trouble seeing low-abundance lncRNAs against a background of more abundant protein-coding transcripts. So, they used DNA microarrays to enrich noncoding transcripts first, gaining three orders of magnitude in sequencing depth. More recently, his team has focused on informatics, working out methods to filter, analyze, assemble, and disseminate lncRNA data to the broader scientific community.“What do you do when you're flying blind? You try and make a flashlight,” he says.John Rinn, aka @noncodarnia.A pitch for staying old-schoolBuilding flashlights is a common task in Noncodarnia. Jeannie Lee has had to do that in her lab as well, developing a method to survey the landscape of protein-complexed RNAs called RIP-seq, which she used in 2010 to identify more than 9,000 PRC2-associated transcripts.Yet like Rinn, Lee wasn't looking to study lncRNAs when she entered the field in the early 1990s. She was studying X-inactivation as a postdoc with Rudolf Jaenisch at MIT around the time that Xist was identified.“I remember very clearly going to a national conference at which the discovery was presented. And I was blown away by the fact that a long noncoding RNA that's coating the X chromosomes could somehow be involved.”Once she established her own lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, Lee continued to focus on X-inactivation and very quickly identified an lncRNA antisense to Xist. Called Tsix, the newly identified molecule regulates Xist and together with other lncRNAs enables dosage compensation in XX females.Nearly a decade later, Lee's lab found a binding site within Xist for the Polycomb complex PRC2, directing PRC2 to the soon-to-be-inactive X chromosome, an observation that ties lncRNAs to X-inactivation and provides a possible solution to an epigenetic riddle.Epigenetic regulation is locus-specific— some genes are turned on while others are turned off. Yet epigenetic factors show little if any sequence-specificity. Lee suggests that lncRNAs can bridge that gap, because they can fold up to bind proteins but are also inherently sequence-targeted.“When you're studying epigenetics and you need locus specificity,” she says, “you have to look to long noncoding RNAs.”Today's researchers have RNA-seq and RNAi to tackle that job, not to mention databases overflowing with lncRNA sequence data they can search at the click of a mouse. But when Lee started her lab in 1997, there was practically nothing upon which to build. “Imagine to yourself, you've set out on a career to figure out how X-inactivation works, and there's only one molecule,” she says, laughing.Lee had to make do with good old-fashioned genetics, making knockouts in embryonic stem cells and looking for changes in phenotype. As a postdoc, she used random deletions to identify a 450 kb sequence of the X-inactivation center that is both necessary and sufficient for X-inactivation, and it was in this sequence that her lab found Tsix.Today, a popular choice for querying lncRNA function is genetic knockdown, using either siRNAs or shRNAs. Lee's lab uses these approaches, too, but also remains true to the technique that served her so well in the past. “I want to make a pitch here for the importance of making traditional knockouts to demonstrate function,” she says. “A lot of these knockdown approaches to lncRNA biology yield phenotypes that do not ultimately agree with the knockout,” though both approaches have their place in functional studies, she emphasizes.“Hardcore RNA chemist” Saba Valadkhan in the lab.Countering resistanceTo get a sense of the difficulties researchers face in Noncodarnia, look no further than Case Western University biochemist Saba Valadkhan.When Valadkhan started her lncRNA project in 2006, there were no deep sequencing or large-scale transcriptomic data available. “We had to rely on a very small number of accidentally discovered long noncoding RNAs to choose one for our studies.”Not wanting to step on anybody's toes, Valadkhan searched the literature for interesting but “abandoned” lncRNAs. She settled on a bone morphogenic protein-induced transcript first described in 1998.But working with that transcript, she says, has been a challenge. “We really didn't even know what to worry about and what would be okay.” For instance, when cloning the transcript, what would happen if extra sequences were tacked onto the 5′ or 3′ ends? “They can potentially change the secondary structure of the RNA in these regions... or they can be binding sites for proteins that shouldn't be bound to this RNA.” Knockdowns weren't obvious, either. Where, for instance, should she target the interfering RNAs?Function was a problem, as was the dearth of knowledgeable colleagues. And so, when the data started rolling in, Valadkhan's team wasn't sure how to deal with it. They didn't know, for instance, how much of a phenotypic response was real as opposed to noise. The only thing they knew for sure was that their RNA seemed to be doing something amazing.When overexpressed in myoblasts, the transcript caused the cells to “change shape strongly and [start] to grow little processes.” The team had no idea what that meant, but the postdoc doing this work thought the cells kind of looked like neurons. “Lo and behold they were screaming with neuronal marker expression,” Valadkhan says.This was in 2007, she says, shortly after Shinya Yamanaka introduced the world to induced pluripotent stem cells. Nobody doubts the power of transcription factors to alter cell fate, yet Valadkhan's discovery that noncoding RNAs evidently do the same, remains unpublished.“The reviewers hated it,” she says. “They said this must be an artifact.”Reviewers asked for control after control. They demanded knockout mice. They even questioned Valadkhan, whose background is in “hardcore RNA chemistry,” on her ability to culture cells.Six years later the paper is once again under review. “Again they have asked for quite a number of things,” she says, “but at least the tone of the reviewers has become more and more positive with every submission. I think it's partly because we are adding a lot more controls and data,” she allows. “But partly also because people are appreciating that these RNAs can really do these kinds of things.”For too long, Mattick says, the broad molecular biology community has acted as if it had the conceptual framework of cellular genetic regulation more or less figured out, thanks to promoters, enhancers, and transcription factors. “They decided they understood the system 50 years ago, after just a decade or so of initial work, and haven't really changed their minds since.”That view seems finally to be changing, Mattick says.It looks to be a fine day in Noncodarnia.References1.

This paper aims to provide a state-of-art weather index insurance design, thereby including methods for natural hazards’ indices calculation, vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) using the Scopus database. First, 364 peer-reviewed articles from 2010 to present were screened for a bibliometric analysis and then, the 34 most cited articles from the past five years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a great research effort on index insurance, the majority of them focused on food insecurity through agricultural and crop insurance. Also, climate change and basis risks were found highly relevant for weather index insurance, but weakly developed, suggesting challenges around food insecurity. Special focus was given to drought hazards, while other hazards such as temperature variation, excessive rainfall and wildfires were slightly covered. Emerging areas, namely agricultural, hydrological, and sustainable index insurance found promissory for insurance. Also, current state-of-the-art lacks methods for incorporating multi-hazard risk evaluation in vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards. Thus, we summarized the most common methods for calculating indices, estimating losses using indices, pricing risks, and evaluating insurance index policies. This review promotes a starting point in weather index insurance design towards a multi-hazard resilient society.","10.5194/egusphere-2022-498-ac1","","","https://lens.org/082-793-231-918-044","","","082-793-231-918-044","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

The hypothesis that the severity of surgically related pain measures would be lower on postoperative day 2 with the addition of cryoanalgesia to standard-of-care treatment than with standard-of-care treatment alone was tested in a randomized controlled study of 60 patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with single-injection and continuous paravertebral nerve block for postoperative analgesia. On postoperative day 2, patients who had received active cryoneurolysis had a median [interquartile range] average level of pain, measured using the 11-point numeric rating scale, of 0 [0 to 1.4] while that in patients receiving sham treatment was 3.0 [2.0 to 5.0]; the difference (97.5% CI) was –2.5 (–3.5 to –1.5). Worst and average pain scores were lower for the active treatment group from days 1 to 21. Cryoneurolysis lowered cumulative opioid use during the first 3 weeks by 98%. No cryoneurolysis-related systemic side effects or complications were identified. See the accompanying Editorial on page 521.The hypothesis that an unhealthy air quality index (greater than 100) due to wildfire smoke would increase the risk of an adverse respiratory event under general anesthesia in the pediatric population was tested in a retrospective double-cohort study of 625 pediatric patients aged 0 to 18 yr who presented for elective surgery before and after two wildfire events. An adverse respiratory event was defined as a composite of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, desaturation, and reintubation. In children without a history of reactive airway disease, the risk of adverse respiratory events was 40.3% (102 of 253) during periods with unhealthy air and 42.0% (95 of 226) during periods with healthy air; the relative risk (95% CI) was 0.96 (0.77 to 1.19). In children with a history of reactive airway disease, the risk of adverse respiratory events was 55.1% (43 of 78) during periods with unhealthy air and 36.8% (25 of 68) during periods of healthy air; the relative risk was 1.50 (1.04 to 2.17). The effect of air quality on adverse respiratory events was modified by reactive airway disease status with a relative risk of 1.56 (1.02 to 2.40). See the accompanying Editorial on page 524.Risk prediction models can facilitate patient evaluation. This systematic review described and evaluated studies in which patient-specific multispecialty risk prediction scores for perioperative (up to 30 days postoperatively) mortality in pediatric populations were developed, modified, or externally validated. Ten studies were included; nine reported the development and validation of models while one focused on the external validation of an existing model. The unadjusted rate of mortality in the included studies ranged from 0.3 to 1.5% in development datasets using the full pediatric population and 3.6% in a population of neonates. An ideal model would present data on both calibration and discrimination in model development, be validated in a sample with a sufficiently high incidence of the outcome, be easily calculated, and have undergone comprehensive external validation in diverse patient populations. Comparing the risk prediction models using a variety of metrics, no model emerged as qualitatively better than any other. Although all models had good discrimination upon validation, none was recommended for use at this time due to a lack of external validations. See the accompanying Editorial on page 526.The hypothesis that performance of models using both electronic health record and physiologic waveform data to predict postoperative deterioration 8 h before the event is superior to that of models using either modality alone was tested using intensive care unit (ICU) data collected after elective cardiac surgical procedures. A postoperative deterioration event was defined as a composite of cardiac index less than 2.0 ml · min–1 · m–2, mean arterial pressure less than 55 mmHg for at least 120 min, new or increased inotrope/vasopressor infusion, epinephrine bolus greater than or equal to 1 mg, or ICU mortality. All patients with at least one postoperative deterioration event were compared to a random sample of control patients not experiencing such events. Among 1,555 cases meeting inclusion criteria, 185 (12%) patients experienced 276 deterioration events between 24 h after postoperative ICU admission and discharge from the ICU. The positive predictive value of the best performing combined model in the 2013–2017 training/validation set was 63.6% but decreased to 33.9% in the 2017–2020 temporal holdout test set. The positive predictive values of models limited to either electronic health record or waveform data were 32.2% and 32.9%, respectively.Etomidate, barbiturates, alphaxalone, and propofol allosterically potentiate receptor activation by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and at high concentrations activate receptors without GABA. The hypothesis, based on two-state allosteric coagonist models, that pairs of four anesthetics (etomidate, the potent barbiturate R-mTFD-MPAB, alphaxalone, and propofol) acting through distinct sets of GABA type A (GABAA) receptor sites would interact synergistically was tested in both zebrafish larvae hypnosis assays and electrophysiologic measures of activation of human α1β3γ2L GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Anesthetic interactions in GABAA receptors were not consistently explained by two-state allosteric coagonism. These models qualitatively predicted synergistic interactions in both zebrafish and synaptic GABAA receptors for four hypnotic drug pairs, propofol plus R-mTFD-MPAB and the three pairs containing alphaxalone, at low concentrations. However, this mechanism quantitatively approximated only the interaction of alphaxalone plus etomidate at higher concentrations. These findings suggest that allosteric coagonist models best describe interactions of agonists and coagonists that selectively bind in β+/α– subunit interfaces: GABA, etomidate, and alphaxalone.Perioperative erythrocyte transfusions in pediatric patients are indicated for various reasons but can put patients at risk for transfusion-related adverse outcomes. Adoption of restrictive transfusion strategies in adult surgical patients has reduced allogeneic erythrocyte transfusions, adverse events, and hospital costs. This Clinical Focus Review begins by summarizing the evidence or expert consensus guidelines addressing use of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies in pediatric patients with massive hemorrhage or critical bleeding and in those undergoing noncardiac or cardiac surgery as well as in term and preterm neonates. Despite a lack of robust outcome data, several trials and expert guidelines recommend using a restrictive transfusion strategy in many pediatric populations and consensus statements recommend not using a single hemoglobin concentration transfusion trigger. This review then considers the rationale for incorporating physiologic parameters with hemoglobin concentration thresholds to guide transfusion management decisions. Such physiologic parameters could include hemodynamics, serial measurements of biochemical markers indicative of adequacy of tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery and consumption quantified by novel technologies such as cerebral and somatic dynamic near infrared spectroscopy.The anesthesia provider is likely to encounter patients with existing vision impairment given the increasingly aging population and rising prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases including cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. Existing ophthalmic disease may affect the perioperative care of the patient undergoing nonocular surgery. In addition, perioperative injuries to the eye can occur, ranging from corneal injuries producing pain and reversible blurred vision, to serious disorders of the retina or optic nerve causing permanent blindness.

This paper aims to provide a state-of-art weather index insurance design, thereby including methods for natural hazards&rsquo; indices calculation, vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) using the Scopus database. First, 364 peer-reviewed articles from 2010 to present were screened for a bibliometric analysis and then, the 34 most cited articles from the past five years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a great research effort on index insurance, the majority of them focused on food insecurity through agricultural and crop insurance. Also, climate change and basis risks were found highly relevant for weather index insurance, but weakly developed, suggesting challenges around food insecurity. Special focus was given to drought hazards, while other hazards such as temperature variation, excessive rainfall and wildfires were slightly covered. Emerging areas, namely agricultural, hydrological, and sustainable index insurance found promissory for insurance. Also, current state-of-the-art lacks methods for incorporating multi-hazard risk evaluation in vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards. Thus, we summarized the most common methods for calculating indices, estimating losses using indices, pricing risks, and evaluating insurance index policies. This review promotes a starting point in weather index insurance design towards a multi-hazard resilient society.","10.5194/egusphere-2022-498-ac3","","","https://lens.org/084-500-411-732-352","","","084-500-411-732-352","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""
"319","1553","1553","lens","search","unknown","eBioMedicine, null","Climate change and health: translating the call of the hummingbird","2023","EBioMedicine","“We are hurtling towards disaster, eyes wide open. It is time to wake up and step up.”António Guterres, UN Secretary General, June, 2023In this address to journalists, Guterres was mainly calling out the fossil fuel industry and its enablers, but we can and should all feel concerned and compelled to act. During the past few years, no one has been spared the striking manifestations of climate change across the world, including extreme heat waves, historic droughts, floodings, landslides, or substantial forest fires and their far-reaching smoke clouds. The effects of these manifestations on human health are well documented and the statistics shared every year by organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or The Lancet's Countdown on Health and Climate Change reveal the sobering and dire truth of our world. To feel overwhelmed is a natural reaction, but we need to remember that we have the power to act. We should all be like the hummingbird in the famous folktale who, instead of being transfixed by the fire devastating his forest as the rest of the animals are, decides to do what he can and starts carrying drops of water in his small beak to the fire, despite his efforts potentially appearing small and in vain. We should all be thinking about what we can do to limit the climate change crisis. At eBioMedicine, we started to think about how to act against climate change, as editors, about 2 years ago. At that time, several groups of researchers and funding agencies (eg, the HERA group in Europe, the US National Science Foundation, and the US National Institutes of Health) shared their suggested agendas for future research into the ways in which climate change affects human health. They highlighted gaps in the understanding of the biological mechanisms of these interactions. Therefore, use of our translational science journal to help identify and fill these knowledge gaps seemed like a natural process. We have gathered a collection of Reviews, Articles, Correspondences, and Personal Views that we proudly present as a Series for the July, 2023, issue. The effect of air quality on human health is one of the most studied effects of climate change. However, Li-Zi Lin and colleagues from Sun Yat-sen University in China noticed that its influence on infants younger than 12 months was less documented. Therefore, in a narrative review, they presented the associations between air pollutants and various infant outcomes, such as adverse birth outcomes, infant morbidity and mortality, respiratory health, early neurodevelopment, and early growth. Several associations were identified; some were indirect, through the health of the birthing parent or the exposure period during pregnancy, and some were direct, through effects on developing organs. The patterns of the associations varied by type of pollutants, exposure periods, and lengths of exposure. Although these associations are clear and support a call for action to further reduce ambient air pollution, the authors recommended broadening research to study the effects of ambient air pollutants other than the commonly investigated particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide. In a personal view, Ruzmyn Vilcassim and George D Thurston from the University of Alabama and New York University in the USA highlighted additional methodological issues hampering the proper assessment of air-pollution exposure in research studies. They recommended, in particular, considering not only particle mass concentrations but characteristics and deploying low-cost sensors for extensive and personalised monitoring especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Carbon monoxide and PM are the main constituents of air pollution that comes to mind, but Chris C Lim and colleagues from the University of Arizona in the USA reminded us that harmful algal blooms can release toxins that can be incorporated into aerosols and transported inland, representing another source of pollution. Although aerosols from a few species were associated with respiratory outcomes, substantial uncertainties remain regarding the effects of long-term exposure, the effects on susceptible subpopulations, and the effects of concurrent exposures with other toxins or aerosol sources. We have also published a few original research articles furthering our understanding of the health effects of air pollution. For example, Lisa Miyashita and colleagues from Queen Mary University of London, UK, studied the effects of PM10 (ie, PM smaller than 10 μm) from the London Underground transport system in vitro, in human cells, and in mice. They observed that PM10 increased the susceptibility to pneumococcal infection by increasing bacterial adhesion and entry in airway epithelial cells. Jonathan Allouche and colleagues from Université Côte d'Azur in France, took advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to study the large-scale effects of variations in air pollutants in a real-world setting. In their single-centre, matched-cohort study, they observed a weakening of the antiviral cellular response (represented by IFNγ production) correlated with an increase in pollutant exposures. If the immune response to infectious diseases could be altered by air pollution, the dynamics of these infections are themselves affected by climate change. For example, global warming has been identified as a risk factor for increased dengue virus transmission in various studies. To provide public health policy makers with more locally useful evidence, Yohannes Tefera Damtew and colleagues from the University of Adelaide in Australia, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 studies to assess the effects of high temperatures and heat waves on dengue incidence across different climate zones. Their review substantiated that high temperatures increase the risk of infection, but this risk varies across climate zones. Although heat-wave events were also associated with increased risk of infection, the strength of evidence was considered limited by the authors. Future studies should focus on further exploring these associations at a regional level. Another category of climate-sensitive diseases are viral respiratory infections. To prevent future crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the mechanisms underlying the emergence and transmission of such infections is key. However, as highlighted in the Review by Yucong He and colleagues from Tsinghua University in China, epidemiological studies have not yet been able to provide real-life support of the biological mechanisms identified in vitro or in animal models. This lack of support can be explained partly by the complexity of the associations and the interplay between biological, socioeconomic, and ecological factors and evolving human–animal–environmental interfaces in real life. Transdisciplinary research involving epidemiologists, biologists, and climate scientists is therefore essential. This conclusion can be generalised beyond infectious diseases to all areas affected by climate change and influencing health. How climate change will affect crop yields and nutrients in these crops and how these crops will modify health of the population is another example of the importance of collaborative research efforts. Multidisciplinary research is also needed to understand how climate change leads to increases in allergic respiratory diseases. As increased temperatures and air pollutants modify the sources of airborne allergens (ie, in terms of seasonality, nature, and amounts), which affect the health of people who are allergic, experts in epidemiology, aerobiology, meteorology, and immunology can provide further understanding into this interaction. Paul J Beggs and colleagues are such experts, who teamed up to write a Review describing current knowledge on airborne allergens and explored three translational mitigation approaches to improve the health outcomes of affected populations. The proposed approaches rely on technological advances to reduce exposure to allergens by ensuring automated, real-time monitoring of allergens; creating reliable allergen-forecasting models; and sharing their results and additional information to the population. As well as these promising approaches, the Review also clarified that further research is needed; current studies have been mostly conducted in high-income countries and on a few key species. Furthermore, literature on the effects of climate change on respiratory diseases due to allergies is scarce. As the effects of climate change are becoming more noticeable, investigating adaptation and mitigation strategies is of the utmost importance. Shehla Zaidi from Aga Khan University in Pakistan proposed an application of this message to overcome increasing health shocks due to floods in her country. On a global scale, Hayon Michelle Choi and colleagues from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network explored how green space modifies the relationship between heat and mortality. Via data from 452 locations across 24 countries, cities with more green spaces had lower heat-mortality risk than cities with fewer green spaces, supporting findings from smaller studies. Although this large-scale study provides clear evidence of the benefits of green spaces, the authors emphasise the importance of further research at a much smaller scale (eg, at the neighbourhood level) to identify susceptible populations and inform policy makers on the most effective interventions to reduce health inequalities. Climate and human health are clearly linked, but climate is only one aspect of planetary systems that affect our wellbeing. In a Nature article published in May 2023, Johan Rockström and colleagues proposed a model of eight safe and just Earth-system boundaries that quantify the state of climate, the biosphere (ie, the natural ecosystem area and the functional integrity of all ecosystems), water (ie, surface and groundwater) and nutrient cycles (nitrogen and phosphorus), and aerosols. They observed that seven of these boundaries were already exceeded. Furthermore, Linn Persson and colleagues from Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden, quantified the planetary boundary for novel chemical entities and concluded that this boundary was exceeded as annual production and releases increase at a faster rate than the global capacity for assessment and monitoring. Production and releases should urgently be reduced and research into existing entities is needed to anticipate and, hopefully, mitigate their risks. In an attempt to fill existing knowledge gaps, eBioMedicine published some Articles on this topic. In all samples of a population-based cohort study of 738 people who were pregnant and their children, Astrid Sevelsted and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, detected perfluoroalkyl substances (ie, PFOS and PFOA, which are persistent and bio-accumulative chemicals). Higher concentrations of these substances were associated with reduced intrauterine growth. Interestingly, the two substances had opposite effects on height and concentration of PFOS interacted with the sex of the child (ie, 6-year BMI was lower in female children but higher in male children with increasing concentrations), suggesting a potential mechanism of action. In a proof-of-concept case series, Thomas Horvatits and colleagues from the University of Hamburg, Germany, observed an accumulation of microplastics in the livers of people with cirrhosis but not in the livers of healthy people. Further research is needed to understand this observation and understand whether this accumulation is a cause or a consequence of tissue fibrosis. To prepare our Series, we had the opportunity to meet and discuss with researchers and clinicians. One thing we noticed was that, for individuals interested in topics related to climate change and health, research often represents only a part of their efforts. Thus, we proposed sharing inspirational examples in a group of Correspondences. Four contributions from medical students from Medical Students for a Sustainable Future inaugurate the Series. Their lived experiences, the actions they took to try to reform the systems that are responsible for the degradation of the environment, the effects on the health of their patients, and the results they have already achieved (eg, the integration of climate health into the medical curriculum in their universities) should be a reflection point and call for action. For example, an individual could organise a panel session on their specialty at a conference and invite their community to reflect on how climate change affects their field, conduct an audit in their laboratory or department to reduce waste and energy consumption, or get involved in advocating at agencies for specific funding for multidisciplinary research that has been historically underfunded. Our aim for the Series on climate change and health is to encourage hope in the definition of Jane Goodall, not “passive wishful thinking” but “real hope, which requires action and engagement”. This quote opened our December, 2021, Editorial. Although meaningful research has been published since, the Reviews presented in our Series clarify that research is still needed, especially multidisciplinary research investigating mechanisms and mitigation approaches applied in low-income and middle-income countries or in susceptible populations. eBioMedicine is committed to publishing such research and welcomes research Articles, Reviews, Comments, and Correspondences on this incredibly important topic.","10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104718","93","","https://lens.org/084-692-103-844-028","104718","23523964","084-692-103-844-028","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","23523964","104718",""

This study was done for assessing the biodiversity of the moist deciduous forest in Uttarakhand which had forest fire. The quadrat method based approach was used for ecological analysis. The various analysis methods namely physico-chemical soil analysis, tree and shrub phyto-sociological parameter analysis, and biodiversity indices (namely Shannon-Weaver Index, Simpson index, Species Evenness and Species Richness) were used. The soil quality and ecological indices were compared with data from other Indian Moist deciduous forest, which was collected using the systematic review approach. The results showed better soil nitrogen and organic carbon content as compared to other forest soil indicating faster regeneration potential of the forest. In Mohan MPCA, shrub biodiversity was better as compared to the tree biodiversity. Further, the tree biodiversity indices of Mohan MPCA were relatively poorer and shrub biodiversity indices were relatively better than other Indian moist deciduous forest. The study indicated the relatively poor ecological health of the forest as compared to the other moist deciduous forest. However, existence of good soil fertility and special conservation measures can help in rapidly improving the health of the forest.","","143","4","https://lens.org/087-384-585-159-22X","321","00194816","087-384-585-159-22X","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","00194816","321","4"

Population densities may reflect environmental variables that affect the competitive advantage of woody legumes. My research investigated soil, landscape and climate factors that predict densities of woody legumes after bushfire. Underlying plant traits that might facilitate recruitment and competitiveness were then studied. Six species of woody legumes were identified growing at two to three stand densities that recurred in patchy distribution patterns across forests in Victoria, Australia that had burned in a 2009 bushfire. Fifty potential factors including soil properties, topographical, and climate variables were analysed, and the most accurate model contained slope, solar incidence, soil pH and electrical conductivity and phosphorus (P) availability. A meta-analysis and subsequent germination study tested the hypothesis that optimum temperature thresholds to break the dormancy of woody legume seed varies between species according to climate zone. Species from arid climates responded to significantly lower temperatures than what species from temperate or tropical regions required to germinate. The final studies investigated if fine roots from woody legumes expressed genes for enzymes that would enhance P acquisition. A novel sequence homologous to known phosphatases was isolated. Different amounts and forms of P were then supplied to woody legumes grown in a glasshouse. One species expressed two putative phosphatases, but the expression appeared to be constitutive rather than induced by P deficiency. The research presented in this thesis demonstrates that woody legumes exhibit traits that interact with fire severity and P availability to facilitate establishing high-density populations. The importance of woody legumes to aid regeneration of forested ecosystems impacted by bushfire is discussed.","","","","https://lens.org/087-905-804-846-160","","","087-905-804-846-160","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Due to climate change, more intense and frequent extreme weather events are happening globally (Longman et al., 2023). Recently in Australia, we have experienced extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, bushfires, storms, cyclones and tornadoes, at an unprecedented rate (Ghosh et al., 2022), and similar experiences have occurred globally (Fatema et al., 2021). The outcomes of these extreme weather events have had significant consequences for human health and well-being, with the degree of emotional distress and anxiety experienced related to how these events have altered or threatened an individual's environment and way of life (Ingle & Mikulewicz, 2020). Extreme weather event experiences are associated with recognized mental and physical health impacts (e.g., Fatema et al., 2023), and they are likely to provoke eco-anxiety. Eco-anxiety occurs when people experience negative emotional responses such as distress and a sense of despair related to climate change (Coffey et al., 2021). Climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable and marginalized people in society (Hayes et al., 2018). People from more disadvantaged regions have reported experiencing higher levels of eco-anxiety, or anxiety related to climate change, whether they have had direct experience of extreme weather events or not (Patrick et al., 2022). These findings collectively highlight the importance of the consideration of eco-anxiety by practitioners and researchers within mental health assessments, over and above traditionally recognized mental health disorders. This may be particularly important for people from disadvantaged regions, vulnerable groups or those who have experienced extreme weather events. This paper addresses these issues and provides an overview of the related evidence. Finally, it makes recommendations for health service change. Climate variability can have disastrous effects on human societies causing an increasing burden on health and mental health, contributing to an already strained health care system. Climate change increases the magnitude of extreme weather-related events and the increased frequency of events offers little time for recovery (Crandon et al., 2022). It has been argued that natural disasters and extreme weather events (such as ongoing droughts, unprecedented rainfall and severe storms, acid rain, large-scale fires, glacier melting, heatwaves and ocean acidification) has an increased impact on mental health, beyond the psychosocial impact of the normal seasonal weather variations (Patrick et al., 2022). Mental health effects of extreme weather events include mood disturbances such as depression, irritability, anxiety, substance use, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), increased aggression and increased suicide rates (Fatema et al., 2021). As a result of the increasing awareness of climate-related mental health, the term eco-anxiety has been adopted to describe the anxiety associated with the changing climate, increased by the lived experience of extreme weather events. Eco-anxiety is characterized by ‘…severe and debilitating worry about climate and environmental risks…’ (Ingle & Mikulewicz, 2020, p. e128) and can result in negative emotional responses such as distress and a sense of despair (Coffey et al., 2021). It is important to distinguish eco-anxiety from other emerging psychoterratic terminologies, such as eco-grief, which refers to bereavement and yearning related to losses from the destruction of the natural environment, such as ecosystems, landscapes, livelihood and way of life (Comtesse et al., 2021). As stated by Patrick et al. (2022), ‘eco-anxiety, in contrast to other eco emotions such as eco-grief and eco-despair, highlights the mental health impacts of future-orientated worry about the potential impacts of climate change’ (p. 7). As such, eco-anxiety is a future-focused reaction to anticipated threats of climate change, that includes an emotional response (e.g., fear, distress), cognitive components (e.g., worry) and physiological arousal (Comtesse et al., 2021). Lower levels of eco-anxiety may be a fundamentally adaptive response to ecological loss or future-focused impending threats, resulting in the facilitation of positive behavioural change. Higher levels of eco-anxiety can be maladaptive and debilitating and can be associated with a broad spectrum of health concerns (Boluda-Verdú et al., 2022). Similarly, Ingle and Mikulewicz (2020) affirm that emotional distress and mental health issues related to climate change are less visible than physical impacts. Hence the importance of ensuring that eco-anxiety and other climate change-related mental health issues are recognized. Studies on the impacts of disasters and extreme weather events have revealed that vulnerable populations are at a disproportionately greater risk compared with other groups (Benevolenza & DeRigne, 2019). Particularly, these people are at an increased risk of displacement (homelessness), increased negative health outcomes (both physical and mental health) and decreased economic stability (Fatema et al., 2021). Some of the more vulnerable groups at risk include people with lower socio-economic status, children, older people and some minority groups (Benevolenza & DeRigne, 2019; Fatema et al., 2021), and those who depend on the land for survival are also susceptible (Patrick et al., 2022). Women are considerably more vulnerable to the impact of disasters (Fatema et al., 2023) and a recent systematic review revealed that many women are prone to physical and emotional issues after disasters, especially those from lower socio-economic locations, especially in rural and remote areas (Fatema et al., 2021). Farmers in rural and remote areas are also especially vulnerable and disadvantaged by the impacts of extreme weather-related events (Comtesse et al., 2021); these events can result in serious mental health issues and adverse effects for farmers, as their livelihoods depend on the ecosystem (Patrick et al., 2022). Indigenous Peoples are also at increased risk from extreme weather events. For Indigenous Peoples, the emotional experience may be more intense due to their connection to Country and exacerbated by the environmental damaged caused by the changing climate. These experiences can impact Cultural practices, Cultural connections and social, emotional and physical well-being, as the land for many Indigenous Peoples is necessary for survival (Standen et al., 2022). It is essential to recognize the differential impacts of climate change for these vulnerable groups and communities, in terms of both impacts and ability to respond. Within the response to extreme weather events that is developing around the world, climate justice highlights the inequities in climate change; identifying how higher income countries historically have increased responsibility yet may face the least adverse events from climate change (Ingle & Mikulewicz, 2020). Furthermore, many of these vulnerable communities and groups may have less potential to effectively respond or adapt to the impacts of extreme weather events, due to factors such as socio-economic disadvantage, health sensitivities and political determinants (Standen et al., 2022). Therefore, climate justice highlights that vulnerability, impact, responsibility and ability to respond are all differentially distributed between individuals and communities (Ingle & Mikulewicz, 2020). Recognition of these inherent differences needs to guide response to individual and community needs. Practitioners and mental health systems need to be oriented towards the identification, assessment and treatment of climate-related mental health symptoms (Patrick et al., 2022). In addition to extreme weather event experiences being associated with recognized mental and physical health impacts (e.g., Fatema et al., 2023), they are likely to also be eco-anxiety provoking. Specifically identifying eco-anxiety that develops post-disaster and persists long term, may be an essential clinical feature for assessment and treatment, in addition to currently recognized post-disaster negative effects on mental health. Furthermore, people from more disadvantaged regions have been found to experience higher levels of eco-anxiety, whether they have had direct experience of extreme weather events or not (Patrick et al., 2022). Thus, ‘people aware of current and future threats from climate change may feel fear and anxiety about potential negative outcomes for their future and the planet’ (Boluda-Verdú et al., 2022, p. 2). These findings collectively highlight the importance of the consideration of eco-anxiety by practitioners and researchers within mental health assessments, over and above traditionally recognized mental health disorders. This may be particularly important for people from disadvantaged regions, vulnerable groups or those who have experienced extreme weather events. Given that eco-anxiety may also be a manifestation of underlying mental health issues and has been associated with other health concerns (Boluda-Verdú et al., 2022), eco-anxiety could potentially present as a primary or secondary symptom, which may serve to precipitate, maintain or exacerbate other mental and physical health symptoms. Thus, accurate case conceptualisation is essential to understand the idiographic presentation of eco-anxiety and its interaction with other mental health concerns in clinical practice. Attention should be given to clinically relevant eco-anxiety symptoms such as maladaptive worry, cognitive impairment and/or functional impairment in one or more domains (Patrick et al., 2022). To facilitate the integration of eco-anxiety within mental health assessment and screening, valid measurement tools with normative data on eco-anxiety levels and clinical cut-off scores are needed, for application in both practice and research. It is essential that these tools are developed with and validated for use in disadvantaged regions and with vulnerable subpopulations. In view of climate injustice, particular attention needs to be on equity of mental health services for disadvantaged regions, vulnerable individuals and communities (Ingle & Mikulewicz, 2020). Given the shortage of mental health services in rural and remote areas (Fatema et al., 2021), and the grave consequences of climate change for rural community members and their livelihoods, innovative approaches are required to mitigate adverse outcomes and to ensure that all people impacted by these events can access required services as needed. In addition to improving equity and access to mental health services for those most disadvantaged, service provision should encompass attention to the recognition and alleviation of eco-anxiety and climate change-related mental health issues. Mental health professionals, including nurses, have an important role to play in managing the impact of climate change on mental health. Nurses are in the frontline of healthcare services and will likely carry a large share of the increased mental health burden of climate change. On a clinical level, nurses have a crucial role in the identification and treatment of mental health impacts of climate change and as first responders to increased presentations from extreme weather events. On a community level, healthcare services need to prepare for climate change-related increased demand through training, workforce capacity, education, and community-level intervention (Crandon et al., 2022). Nurses are crucial in all of these aspects and will be increasingly called upon to respond to these service priorities, and to the increased community need. On a systemic level, all health practitioners need to facilitate and advocate for sustainable practices, service readiness and climate action (Crandon et al., 2022).

This is because there is often a disconnect between the producers of air pollution and the people who are most impacted in our communities, particularly those who are already physiologically vulnerable or are in marginalized populations. So, for the more than 6 million people who die as a result of exposure to air pollution every year,1 there is little that can be done unless someone intervenes on their behalf. Air pollution is bad for health—this is an indisputable fact. Air pollution is made up of a complex mixture of gases and liquid/solid particles. Nitrogen dioxide can cause direct impairments on respiratory health2 and readily permeates the respiratory membrane with effects on cardiovascular physiology and inflammation.3 Particulate air pollution (particulate matter [PM]), especially fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm (PM2.5), is one of the key drivers of the detrimental health effects of air pollution.4 PM2.5 is small enough to traverse the upper airway defences and reach the gas exchange regions of the lung. Through interactions with the epithelial cells lining the airway and alveoli, resident macrophages and other immune cells, PM2.5 can generate oxidative stress, induce inflammation, modify immune function and promote/cause tissue injury.5 Some PM2.5 particles are internalized by lung cells, can be trafficked to other sites in the body or traverse the respiratory membrane leading to interstitial responses and, in some cases, enter the circulation. In line with this, exposure to air pollution has been shown to impact almost every organ system in the body. In some ways we already know what the problem is and the battle is more about implementing a solution—reducing air pollution to improve health. We already have a detailed understanding of the exposure–response relationship for air pollution. These relationships point to one thing—there is no safe level of air pollution.6 Health effects for many of the key components of air pollution, particularly NO2 and PM2.5, can be demonstrated at the lowest measurable point on the exposure–response curve.7 Interestingly, the exposure–response relationship is steepest at low exposure concentrations6 meaning that there is still much to gain from a community health point of view by reducing air pollution in areas that are considered to have relatively good air quality. There are many sources of air pollution. Unfortunately, the individuals who are impacted by poor air quality are often not directly responsible for the air pollution they are exposed to; and, in some cases, such as the use of biomass for the purposes of heating and cooking, individuals who are indeed contributing to the problem often lack the means or resources to reduce their individual contribution to poor air quality.8 It is incumbent on governments to act on behalf of their citizens to promote activities and behaviours that improve air quality. The starting point for this is a legislative framework that promotes continual reductions in air pollution.9 Many global jurisdictions lack an appropriate air quality framework or, where one does exist, it relies on reporting thresholds which imply that some levels of air pollution are safe—which we know is not the case. In order for an emission reduction framework to be effective, an appropriate system for air quality monitoring needs to be in place to track change. As modelling and satellite imaging improves, estimation of air pollution levels on a national, and indeed a global scale,10 at very high resolution are becoming increasingly viable. Of course, all of this needs to be underpinned by effective local policies and incentives that support transitions to cleaner air practices for those who are the most vulnerable or lack the necessary resources. So, what is left to do? There is a cogent argument that more research demonstrating that air pollution impacts on health is unnecessary. It would certainly be hard to argue that more is required to influence policy change given that a Pubmed search of ""air pollution AND health"" lists ~5000 publications for 2022 alone. Where we do lack evidence is in the area of the most effective interventions to minimize the health effects of exposure to air pollution for individuals.11 The includes identification of the most effective approaches to reduce exposure, strategies to manage existing conditions and the most effective means to signal to individuals when an intervention or behaviour modification should be enacted that suits their situation. For people with an existing respiratory condition who are at higher risk, there is almost no empirical evidence to support how their condition should be managed if it deteriorates. Most advice that is provided to people with existing respiratory conditions focusses on managing symptoms according to their current medical plan—but this assumes that the underlying pathophysiological response to air pollution that drives symptom deterioration is the same for other triggers. For example, are the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms driving a deterioration in lung function in an asthmatic due to exposure to air pollution the same as those during a virus-induced exacerbation?—probably not. Does this then impact on how that person should manage their symptoms or be treated at the point of hospitalization?—we simply do not know. It is clear that exposure to air pollution impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide every year. It is imperative that we act to address this problem. In addition to advocating for policy change using our network, researchers should focus on identifying the most effective harm reduction strategies for public health messaging and interventions, and the treatment of individuals who are experiencing an air pollution related deterioration in health. By focussing our energy where the gaps are, rather than continuing to describe the problem, we will have the greatest impact on those who are most vulnerable to the effects of poor air quality.

Health journals around the world recently published a joint call for immediate action by governments and health professionals.[1] Researchers and methodologists also have an important contribution to make, by producing and synthesizing evidence relevant to climate‐health impacts. In particular, we argue that Cochrane needs to mobilize its expertise in high‐quality evidence syntheses to prioritize the production of reviews needed by global decision makers. This will involve working closely with stakeholders to ensure that both topics and methods are aligned to the task of strengthening health resilience to oncoming climate shocks. Health‐system decision makers need to be ready to monitor, anticipate, manage and adapt to a wide range of climate‐related health risks.[2] The increasing frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires, have extensive effects on both physical and mental health.[3, 4, 5] Other impacts include alterations to patterns of food‐, water‐ and vector‐borne diseases; changes to food production that increase risks of malnutrition; emergence of multi‐drug‐resistant infectious diseases and acceleration of drug resistance in existing infectious diseases; breakdown of ecosystem services; and the mental health impacts of climate‐related disasters and disruptions to traditional ways of life.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] Climate‐health issues are multi‐system problems, with complex outcomes stemming from the interaction of hazards, exposures, pre‐existing vulnerabilities, and capacity.[13, 14] Targeted responses must be focused on improving methods for risk quantification, especially cascading and overlapping exposures, and strengthening climate resilience and environmental sustainability of health systems. This can be accomplished by understanding the magnitude and pattern of climate‐related health risks, at various spatio‐temporal scales; identifying adaptation strategies that will ameliorate impacts;[2, 15] and establishing mitigation strategies that will reduce the environmental impacts of health systems themselves.[16, 17] Although the climate‐health research base is growing rapidly, the current literature is dominated by impact studies, with relatively few studies focusing on human response to climate change, climate adaptation and climate mitigation for human health.[18, 19] Synthesizing this research, to identify what works, why, for whom and in what circumstances, will be vital for guiding policy and practice decisions.[20, 21] Syntheses can also help identify what doesn't work and the associated harms of interventions that may also provide some benefits, thereby attenuating the risks of unintended consequences and locking in effects of maladaptation; increasing efficiency of healthcare spending; and helping to identify gaps in current knowledge.[22] This is no small challenge. The body of relevant evidence – both published research and grey literature – is extensive and multidisciplinary, transcending the traditional boundaries of health research.[20] Cochrane has already identified climate change as a key issue in its strategic plans in the coming years. It is now time to translate that high‐level awareness into action. Internally, it is our responsibility to maintain an understanding of the organization's carbon footprint and to develop a plan to reach net zero.[23] It must also be an organizational priority to contribute research efforts towards understanding the health effects of adaptation and climate mitigation interventions. Specifically, Cochrane can help meet decision makers’ needs in the following ways: supporting the identification and prioritization of important and unaddressed research questions for evidence syntheses; producing, in conjunction with stakeholders, new living reviews that address key questions; evaluating new methods and supporting the development and implementation of these where appropriate; supporting the engagement of diverse and vulnerable communities at all levels; working with other organizations to improve the efficiency of knowledge production and usage, and reducing research waste.[24] To accomplish these goals, some foundational work must occur. In order to produce the actionable, policy‐relevant syntheses that decision makers will need, the health evidence synthesis community must broaden its definition of evidence to include mechanistic understanding, theory, data, projections of how risks could evolve over spatial and temporal scales, and expert judgement.[20] The nature of climate change as a multi‐disciplinary topic with hard‐to‐define system boundaries means that search strategies will yield very large numbers of hits with low precision, making the tasks of screening, data extraction and analysis highly resource‐intensive. Technologies like machine learning and linked evidence ecosystems could be a vital means of dealing with these broader evidence bases.[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] For effective syntheses, we need to improve existing methods, while repurposing some from other fields and sometimes developing new ones. Improving evidence synthesis for public health interventions, such as considering effectiveness from a population perspective and incorporating non‐randomized, economic and qualitative evidence, as well as equity considerations, can be relevant to work on complex climate‐health topics.[26, 27, 28] This includes innovation of methods to incorporate modelling studies into synthesis where direct evidence is not available.[29] As well, review authors should be encouraged to conduct analyses that incorporate not just changing exposures, but also changing contexts, such as demographics, economic growth, urbanization, etc, and consequently author teams will need to encompass the range of disciplines that bring the competency to do this kind of work.[14, 15] Those producing health‐related evidence syntheses have much to learn from other synthesis traditions, such as those in the environmental science community. This will help to avoid duplication and waste; to explore questions that intersect across health, the environment and other sectors of policy; and to learn from their work in novel methods not yet considered in Cochrane Reviews, such as synthesis across multiple lines and types of evidence relevant to the health impacts of environmental risks and exposure.[20, 30] It will be important to establish and strengthen relationships with other climate‐orientated evidence synthesis organizations, such as the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence and the Campbell Collaboration's Climate Solutions Coordinating Group. It is worth noting that synthesis that supports decision making can be facilitated by enhancing the research base of primary studies. Designing and implementing climate‐resilient health policies and programmes will involve evaluation of a range of potential future scenarios in a range of geographic settings.[13, 31] This work would be facilitated by researchers developing consensus guidelines around the design, conduct and reporting of climate health‐impact projections.[28] Such guidelines, particularly if incorporated into editorial standards, should support higher‐quality research, and should facilitate synthesis by leading to less heterogeneity between studies, which can increase possibilities for meta‐analysis.[28, 32] It would also be valuable to have more studies on how climate‐relevant interventions are implemented, as success of an intervention is affected by the strategies for addressing aspects of the context into which it is introduced and (ideally) sustained.[14, 33, 34, 35] Cochrane could also support decision makers by identifying existing Cochrane Reviews that address climate‐sensitive health impacts, but are not necessarily explicitly stated by authors to be relevant to climate change.[36, 37] When the COVID‐19 pandemic hit, Cochrane mobilized to produce syntheses needed for global decision making in an unprecedented and rapidly evolving health emergency. Climate change is also a health crisis, and the evidence synthesis community must respond to decision‐making needs with equivalent vigour. We must optimize, and where appropriate, repurpose methods to synthesize available evidence and speed the generation of relevant new evidence to support decision making. Throughout, ongoing engagement with stakeholders and decision makers will be important to ensure that Cochrane is focusing its resources where they are most needed. As we witness changes to the climate now, we do so knowing that the future will likely look nothing like the present. It is time for Cochrane to bring our expertise to the work of informing the decision making needed to avert or mitigate the ongoing health effects of global climate change.","10.1002/14651858.ed000156","2022","3","https://lens.org/094-535-286-129-812","","14651858","094-535-286-129-812","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","14651858","","3"

Exacerbations of allergic, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, including atopic dermatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis and pemphigus, have all been associated with exposure to small particulate matter and the poor air quality that occurs secondary to the combustion of carbon sources.2 As such, it is important to recognize that air pollution is not a separate health issue distinct from climate change, but rather the opposite side of the same proverbial coin that occurs as a result of burning fossil fuels. With this in mind, Fadadu and colleagues' systematic review of air pollution and healthcare utilization for atopic dermatitis in this issue of The Journal is an important addition to a growing body of literature that clearly demonstrates the detrimental impact of fossil fuel combustion, air pollution and climate change on allergic disease.3 Building on their work showing an association between air pollution from the 2018 California Camp Fire and increased health care utilization for atopic dermatitis and itch,4 the authors reviewed 18 available global studies to more rigorously assess this association. Specifically, they found that across a majority of studies, increases in the concentration of small particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were associated with increased healthcare utilization for atopic dermatitis. Moreover, these effects may be modulated by other climatic variables including temperature, humidity and ultraviolet light exposure.3 What do we, as dermatologists, do with this important information? Practically speaking, it is unclear how to best minimize the effects of air pollution on atopic dermatitis, as this question has not been thoroughly studied. Common sense interventions include remaining indoors when air quality indexes are poor, use of indoor air filtration systems (if available and affordable) and daily bathing to remove as much particulate matter from the skin as possible. Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding these practices, including if frequent bathing disrupts protection afforded by the epidermis, exacerbating atopic symptoms upon continued exposure to air pollution. The authors themselves posit an interesting query: does the use of an emollient serve as a protective barrier against air pollution or might it serve as a depot for substances that in turn flare atopic dermatitis following prolonged exposure?3 As the nascent field of climate change dermatology continues to grow, these are the types of clinical questions that must be addressed in order to best prepare our patients and ourselves for the cutaneous impacts of air quality and temperature changes that will occur in an ever-warming world. Make no mistake—climate change is an existential threat that will not affect individual and public health in a distant future; it is a crisis that is affecting our well-being today. In recent years, wildfires across Australia and Europe, and now raging through much of Canada, have resulted in ever-worsening measures of air quality in cities as disparate as Sydney, Madrid, Chicago and Washington DC, with implications for dermatologic and overall health in locales that are unaccustomed to such conditions. We, therefore, must be prepared to help our patients navigate a new climate reality. Beyond providing skin care recommendations, dermatologists can leverage their expertise and longitudinal relationships with patients to help make connections between global warming, air pollution and dermatologic disease. Though this may feel like a daunting task due to rampant disinformation and political denial regarding the effects of climate change, different tactics including targeted risk communication, motivational interviewing and storytelling may make communicating these associations less fraught for providers, while increasing patient receptiveness to these facts.5 This in turn may help empower patients and mitigate climate change-related anxiety. Ultimately it is our ethical imperative as healthcare providers to clearly and effectively educate our communities about the indisputable facts of human-induced global warming and to advocate for measures (reductions in fossil fuel use, higher air quality standards, healthcare system preparedness and resiliency, etc.) that will reduce the negative impacts of climate change and air pollution on dermatologic health.1, 6 There's no time like the present.

"329","1571","1571","lens","search","unknown","The Lancet, null","Clearing the air for a sustainable future","2023","Lancet (London, England)","The latest WHO European Region report, published on July 5, estimates that 97% of the region's population is exposed to air pollution levels exceeding WHO guideline limits. Ambient and household air pollutions were linked to 723 000 premature deaths in 2019 in the European region alone, among the total 6·7 million pollution-related deaths worldwide, with eastern European, Asian, and sub-Saharan African countries more severely affected than other regions. Air pollution is insidious and pervasive—individuals have no control over the air they breathe. The gravity of air pollution exposure demands careful and balanced policies with the ultimate goal to protect human health, wellbeing, and livelihoods. The extensive negative effects of air pollution on conditions such as lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes are well established. However, a growing body of evidence shows that exposure to air pollution is also associated with other diverse conditions such as dementia and depression. The latest State of Global Air report found that nearly 20% of neonatal deaths worldwide were attributable to indoor air pollution. Curbing air pollution is therefore increasingly important for human health, not only for its direct effects but also for environmental reasons to create a cleaner and more sustainable future. The introduction of policies to do so is often framed as a trade-off between protecting health and safeguarding economies, creating a tension that appears hard to resolve, but this dichotomy can be false. However, a report by the World Bank, published on June 27, outlines notable inefficiencies in how air pollution is tackled, with countries often focused on the wrong sources, the wrong pollutants, or the wrong policies. For example, many middle-income countries often target tractable, cost-effective measures such as restriction of car emissions, but often overlook other important sources of pollution such as burning of agricultural and municipal waste, or the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating. High-income countries should be more ambitious with firmer political commitment and stronger regional and global collaborations. Because many air pollutants are highly mobile, regionally coordinated air quality control strategies can be mutually beneficial and cost-effective. There are strong examples of where international agreement has yielded progress on air pollution. For instance, the Helsinki Protocol on reduction of sulphur emissions, agreed in 1985 by 25 European countries, targeted a 30% reduction in sulphur emissions by 1993, and most countries met that target. Under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, 51 signatory states have agreed to join forces on a set of protocols. As events such as the wildfires in north America this year have shown, air pollution is not just a national issue, and domestic policy alone may be insufficient to address air pollution at source. In sum, the 63 countries included in the World Bank report spend a total of US$220 billion annually—0·6% of their collective gross domestic product—on air pollution controls, preventing 1·9 million premature deaths. But with more efficient policies, the World Bank says, an extra 366 000 premature deaths per year could be prevented at no extra cost. A recent systematic review, published in The Lancet Public Health, shows that the implementation of low-emission zones in populous cities in Germany, the UK, and Japan, have resulted in observable health benefits, particularly in the reduction of cardiovascular diseases. From Aug 29, the ultra-low emission zone in London will be expanded to bring cleaner air to an additional 5 million individuals. However, the plan faces legal opposition from local councils and communities who raise concerns about the insufficiency of consultations and solutions. Millions of people will be charged a daily fee to go about their usual business. In many boroughs, alternative means of transport, such as public transportation, biking, and walking infrastructure are lacking. Subsidies for electric vehicles and availability of charging points are inadequate to incentivise a switch from fossil-fuel vehicles. Radical improvements in air quality are possible but need to avoid inadvertently impacting the poorest and most vulnerable people, and implementation without ensuring practical alternatives should be avoided. Considerate reforms can help garner support from a broader alliance of stakeholders. Only by putting the needs of communities at the centre of policy can policy makers ensure that the strategies implemented to reduce air pollution are inclusive, sustainable, and prioritise the lives and livelihood of every person. Effective policies are those that not only reduce air pollution, but also support and uplift affected communities. Health effects of low emission and congestion charging zones: a systematic reviewLow emission zones (LEZs) and congestion charging zones (CCZs) have been implemented in several cities globally. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the effects of these air pollution and congestion reduction schemes on a range of physical health outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IDEAS, Greenfile, and Transport Research International Documentation databases from database inception to Jan 4, 2023. We included studies that evaluated the effect of implementation of a LEZ or CCZ on air pollution-related health outcomes (cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, birth outcomes, dementia, lung cancer, diabetes, and all-cause) or road traffic injuries (RTIs) using longitudinal study designs and empirical health data.

This paper aims to provide a state-of-art weather index insurance design, thereby including methods for natural hazards&rsquo; indices calculation, vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) using the Scopus database. First, 364 peer-reviewed articles from 2010 to present were screened for a bibliometric analysis and then, the 34 most cited articles from the past five years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a great research effort on index insurance, the majority of them focused on food insecurity through agricultural and crop insurance. Also, climate change and basis risks were found highly relevant for weather index insurance, but weakly developed, suggesting challenges around food insecurity. Special focus was given to drought hazards, while other hazards such as temperature variation, excessive rainfall and wildfires were slightly covered. Emerging areas, namely agricultural, hydrological, and sustainable index insurance found promissory for insurance. Also, current state-of-the-art lacks methods for incorporating multi-hazard risk evaluation in vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards. Thus, we summarized the most common methods for calculating indices, estimating losses using indices, pricing risks, and evaluating insurance index policies. This review promotes a starting point in weather index insurance design towards a multi-hazard resilient society.","10.5194/egusphere-2022-498-ac2","","","https://lens.org/099-278-832-932-942","","","099-278-832-932-942","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Salvage and sanitation loggings (hereafter salvage logging) are usually practiced following such disturbance events and the generated deadwood is then extracted from the forest. Those practices affect a broad array of species, including fungi, lichens, invertebrates, and vertebrates that make use of deadwood either as habitat, food resource, foraging substrate, or as shelter. Woodpeckers, being a key group of forest birds dependent on deadwood, can be affected by salvage logging in two ways: (1) a reduction in the availability of food (i.e. removal of deadwood along with the saproxylic and predatory invertebrates that usually colonize dead or dying trees following forest disturbances) and (2) a decrease in potential nest sites due to the removal of dead trees. Therefore, we assessed the global effects of salvage logging on woodpecker abundance and reproduction by conducting a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data. We focused on comparing woodpeckers’ responses to forest disturbance in salvage-logged and unlogged sites. We considered different types of responses found in the literature, including abundance, occurrence, nest density, and breeding success. When analyzing the responses of woodpeckers, we also accounted for the potential effects of tree density, time since logging, elevation, latitude, and the continent.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Recent Findings</jats:title> <jats:p>We found that both numbers and reproduction of woodpeckers were affected by salvage logging following a disturbance event.

Oncology","In this issue of The Lancet Oncology, Ole Raaschou-Nielsen and colleagues report data from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), a collaboration of more than 30 European cohort studies including almost 1 million participants, which aims to quantify the health risks of air pollution. The current report examined the link between ambient air pollution and lung cancer incidence in Europe. The researchers noted a higher risk of lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, with increasing exposure to coarse particulate matter (less than 10 μm in diameter; PM10), and evidence of a raised risk with increasing exposure to fine particulate matter (less than 2·5 μm in diameter; PM2·5). However, perhaps most alarmingly, their data suggest that the risk of lung cancer remains increased even at particulate matter concentrations below current European Union (EU) limits, challenging existing regulations on air quality. Air pollution is a major environmental problem that affects everyone, with health effects reaching far beyond lung cancer alone; indeed, the ESCAPE project is also examining the effects of air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and also on all-cause mortality. Of the six most common pollutants—particulate matter, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead—particulate matter and ozone represent the greatest risk to health, particularly fine particulate matter, which can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream. A great deal of air pollution results from anthropogenic activity, with the burning of various fuels high on the list of culprits—in industry (eg, power plants, factories, waste incinerators), generated by furnaces and stoves (ie, use of traditional biomass), from motor vehicles, and from agricultural practices (eg, controlled burns). Although the 2005 WHO air quality guidelines were designed to establish global criteria for reducing the health effects of air pollution, there is wide variation in uptake and adherence. At present EU standards, for instance, are more stringent than WHO guidelines for both fine and coarse particulate matter; by contrast, concentrations in the US Environmental Protection Agency's December, 2012, revision of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are more liberal than those recommended by WHO. Nevertheless, legislation to limit emissions from industry and transport is in place in both regions, and measures to reduce long-range pollution across country borders have been adopted. The situation elsewhere is decidedly murkier. For instance, China only began to monitor PM2·5 concentrations in Beijing in October, 2012—2 years after the US Embassy in Beijing reported air quality index levels of 755, a figure more than 20 times higher than safe limits according to WHO criteria. Furthermore, it took until June this year for the Chinese Government to announce ten new measures to improve air quality, including plans to reduce emissions from key industries by 30% by 2017 and to monitor pollution levels in 116 other cities. Given that recent data suggest that pollution has reduced life expectancy in northern China by as much as 5·5 years, these initiatives—although conceived a little too late—must not be allowed to fail. Elsewhere, political lobbying stands in the way of progress. For instance, burning of the rainforest by farmers to clear land in Indonesia for production of palm oil resulted in concentrations of air pollutants in Singapore, Malaysia, and southern Thailand climbing to record levels in June, 2013. Although Indonesia has a no-burn policy, it is rarely enforced, and the country remains the only member state of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations not to have signed up to the group's agreement on transboundary haze pollution. This, in part, is indicative of the lobbying power of the palm oil industry, which has close links to members of the Indonesian parliament. Despite measures and recommendations currently in place, ESCAPE shows that the risk of lung cancer remains increased even at particulate matter concentrations below levels that are currently deemed to be safe. Ambient air pollution remains a major public health issue, and further efforts are needed to reduce pollution to a greater degree. Existing efforts, including new energy sources, increased legislation for industry and farming, carbon caps and offsetting, and encouraging the use of greener transport and efforts to reduce the need to travel, are undoubtedly part of the solution. However, new solutions are needed that are both pragmatic and effective, and free from the influence of competing interests—an ambition that unfortunately still eludes even the most creative ideas to date.

Increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance events are one element of global change in terrestrial ecosystems. The goal of this dissertation was to measure the response of soil microbial communities and decomposition to disturbance events and to examine the mechanisms underlying post-disturbance changes in decomposition. In the first part of my dissertation work I explored these questions within the context of wildfires in boreal forests. Chapter 1 characterized soil microbial communities and the rate of decomposition across a fire chronosequence in interior Alaska. I found that boreal forest fires reduced soil microbial abundance, altered fungal community composition, and suppressed litter decomposition. Chapter 2 investigated whether soil microbial responses to boreal forest fires differ as a function of fire severity. I demonstrated that higher severity fires elicited greater reductions in soil microbial biomass and larger shifts in fungal community composition than lower severity fires. Chapter 3 tested the mechanisms through which boreal forest fires alter decomposition processes. I discovered that decomposition rates were slower in recently burned forests because of post-fire reductions in soil moisture and C substrate quality. In the second part of my dissertation I expanded my findings to other types of disturbance events using meta-analysis. Chapter 4 reviewed the response of soil microbial biomass to fires. I found that soil microbial biomass was significantly lower in recently burned ecosystems, but the response of microbial biomass to fire differed by fire type and biome. Chapter 5 examined soil microbial responses to abiotic (fire, harvesting, storms) and biotic (insect infestation, pathogen outbreaks) disturbances in forests. I observed that abiotic disturbances significantly reduced soil microbial biomass, while changes in microbial biomass were non-significant following biotic disturbance events. Collectively, these findings suggest that reductions in soil microbial biomass and decomposition rates following abiotic disturbances are likely to slow the transfer of C from soils to the atmosphere and provide a negative feedback to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global change.","","","","https://lens.org/102-609-515-672-139","","","102-609-515-672-139","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

It now smells like rotten eggs.”2 Although the gas responsible for that smell, hydrogen sulfide, is not regulated in South Africa, its noxious odor was a reminder that levels of other pollutants might also be high.3Smog blankets Johannesburg on a sunny day in 2019. The capital city is located in South Africa’s Highveld—a high-altitude inland area that is the country’s industrial heartland.3 Image: © iStock.com/Rich Townsend.It is hard to capture the spatial and temporal variations in air pollution at specific spots in Johannesburg. The region’s sparse monitoring system measures the total mass of particulate matter in the air but not the composition or size of specific particles. “We really don’t know exactly what’s in it,” says Kristy Langerman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Johannesburg. “But I can speculate and say it’s from traffic as well as some domestic burning and dust.”In the coming years, Langerman and other air pollution experts may get some answers, thanks to an upcoming U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite mission, which has become a collaboration with the Italian Space Agency (ASI). The mission will deploy the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument to capture information about the size and composition of particulates in the atmosphere. MAIA is anticipated to launch in late 2024, according to sources interviewed for this story.Nothing Straightforward about Data CollectionOne of those sources, David Diner, is a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and principal investigator on the MAIA project. As NASA’s first competitively selected Earth-observing mission to include epidemiologists on the scientific team, Diner says the project will help support studies of health effects from short-term, long-term, and gestational exposures to various air pollutants.For some localities, the information MAIA will provide could be revolutionary. Studies are showing that fine particulate matter (particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5) may cause detrimental health effects at levels lower than originally thought.4,5 The World Health Organization (WHO) has dropped its annual average particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 exposure guideline from 10 micrograms per meter cubed10 μg/m3 to 5 micrograms per meter cubed5 μg/m3.6 In the United States, the Biden administration convened a scientific panel in 2022 to discuss lowering the U.S. annual average exposure standard for particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 from 12 micrograms per meter cubed12 μg/m3 to as low as 8 micrograms per meter cubed8 μg/m3.7According to several epidemiologists working with MAIA—such as Beate Ritz from the University of California, Los Angeles—public health officials in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) might not have as much influence as those who advise the U.S. president or the WHO. “Many government leaders will say, ‘What you see in the West does not apply to us; our situation is different,’” says Ritz. “But with MAIA’s data, hopefully, health researchers in those countries will be able to finally pressure their governments into action.”Pros and Cons of Satellite DataMore than two decades ago, Diner helped design the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), which monitors how aerosols and clouds affect climate.8 MISR was designed to view Earth from nine fixed angles and in four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared), with a spatial resolution of a few hundred meters. Its data offer a detailed picture of how the abundance of atmospheric particulate matter varies in space and time, among other outputs.9 MAIA will add to that by using a specialized digital camera that can be pointed at selected view angles and record light in 14 spectral bands.MISR images over India in 2016. Left, the vertical viewing camera captured the Himalayas, which tend to concentrate pollution to the south. New Delhi was under such thick haze that aerosol optical depths, right, were not calculated because the algorithm classified the haze as a cloud.33 Image: Courtesy of MISR Team, NASA/GSFC/LaRC/JPL.Diner explains that the additional spectral bands will yield greater insight into particle composition. For instance, the shortest (ultraviolet) bands are sensitive to particles containing certain types of minerals and organic matter; the visible and near-infrared spectra are primarily sensitive to fine particles. Shortwave infrared bands will provide information about coarser particles, such as dust grains and volcanic ash. Additional bands measure polarization, providing another means of understanding particle properties.“We’re basically looking at scattered sunlight and using the characteristics of that sunlight—its variation with wavelength and angle—to infer the physical and optical properties of the particles that are scattering the light,” says Diner. The shape of particles—whether spherical, like liquid droplets, or irregular, like dust grains—affects how they scatter sunlight, he explains. “All of these factors together make this multi-angle method, in conjunction with the multispectral and polarimetric measurements, pretty powerful for helping to identify specific pollutants.”Nevertheless, it is tricky to translate satellite data into accurate estimates of what humans breathe at ground level. “Satellite-based particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 data are not direct measurements,” explains Meredith Fowlie, an energy economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “They are noisy estimates, and it requires a lot of scientific modeling, assumptions, and statistical modeling to construct the [ground-level] PM measures.”Joel D. Kaufman, a professor of environmental health at the University of Washington and editor-in-chief of Environmental Health Perspectives, takes it a step further. “Even when the satellite estimates can get pollution concentrations correct at a 1 by 1 kilometer1×1km resolution—which is much better than no data at all—they are missing the finer scale of important pollutant gradients that exist over tens of meters from important sources,” he says. “Sources like roadways and waste incineration can be important at this scale.”MAIA will acquire multiple-angle imagery of selected target areas both along the orbit path as well as across it. Image: Courtesy of NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.Diner and the MAIA team acknowledge the trade-offs between satellite and surface-based approaches. “With certain pollutants, the spatial variability is quite significant, and so a straight interpolation could, itself, lead to substantial errors,” he says. But there are simply not enough ground-based monitors in many parts of the world—especially in LMICs—to determine what residents are exposed to on a daily basis, he explains.Target AreasThe mission will target 11 primary areas—regions surrounding Los Angeles, Atlanta, Boston, Barcelona, Rome/Bologna, Addis Ababa, Johannesburg/Pretoria, Tel Aviv/Haifa, Delhi, Beijing, and Taipei/Kaohsiung—and approximately two dozen secondary sites.10 The group will use data from both satellite- and ground-based instruments to generate pollution maps. But not every target city has a network of speciation monitors for determining chemical species and amounts of collected particles.MAIA researchers will use the speciation monitors already in place in the primary target areas in the United States, Spain, and Italy, Diner says. And thanks to a grassroots program called the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN), which works to put air pollution monitors in international locations, three other cities (Pretoria, Tel Aviv, and Beijing) received speciation monitors before the MAIA project started.11 Additional monitors are now sited in Johannesburg, Addis Ababa, Haifa, Delhi, Taipei, and Kaohsiung. The MAIA team is putting aerosol mass and optical depth monitors (another type of filter-based sampler) in several other primary target cities.“The result will be that each primary target area will have at least two speciation monitors capable of collecting particulate matter on filters, which are then analyzed in the lab for sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, and dust,” Diner says. Aethalometers, which measure airborne black carbon concentrations in real time, have been placed in Addis Ababa, Delhi, and Beijing. Such ground-based measurements are essential to MAIA’s approach for converting the satellite measurements into reliable estimates of pollution concentrations. The U.S. Department of State has assisted with the shipment and operation of many of these sensors, and the U.S. Agency for International Development is supporting the ground-based measurements and chemical analyses in MAIA’s primary target areas in Africa.The MAIA team is supporting other creative solutions to the scarcity of monitors. For instance, Addis Ababa is the primary target area with the fewest air quality monitors, so MAIA researchers have installed a network of PurpleAir monitors—low-cost sensors that measure total particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 and provide citizen scientist and community groups with measures of local air quality.12Amid visible smog, children play in the street in Addis Ababa on 3 February 2019, a car-free day promoted to help reduce air pollution. MAIA will bring new ground-based monitors to the city to complement satellite data. Image: © Eduardo Soteras/AFP via Getty Images.Chemical transport modeling for each target area will factor in emissions from both anthropogenic and natural sources, the temporal and spatial distribution of those emissions, and their chemical reactions. Such modeling can account for wind movement, trapping by cold air, and other local weather phenomena.13 The resulting estimates will help fill in spatial and temporal gaps in the satellite coverage.14 “It’s really three points on the triangle,” Diner says. “The satellite, the surface monitors, and the model [are] all working together.”The newly minted NASA-ASI collaboration means that more of Italy will potentially be studied than had been proposed in the original MAIA mission. Massimo Stafoggia, an epidemiologist with the Lazio Regional Health Service in Rome and long-time MAIA team member, says the central part of the country, including Rome and the Po Valley—which, due to traffic, industry, and geography, has the highest levels of particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 in all of Europe—will remain one of the mission’s target areas. But, he says, ASI researchers now hope to study some secondary target areas in the north and in the south—including Taranto, home to one of Europe’s largest steel factories.“There is a large population living very, very close to that plant,” Stafoggia says, “and because of that, it’s a very hot topic in that area.” He is involved in several longitudinal population-based air pollution studies, including some where investigators have tried to estimate the components of particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 that residents are breathing in certain cities.15 “But,” he says, “I am pretty sure that the data made available [from] MAIA will be much more accurate.”Collaborating with EpidemiologistsDiner says he has learned a great deal from working with the team’s epidemiologists to design the mission so its data will best support research on health effects. “When we were choosing our target areas, I would have thought to look only at the most polluted places,” he says. “But the epidemiologists said, ‘No, we want to look at clean places, too, because when you look at a 10 micrograms per meter cubed10-μg/m3 change in an aerosol or particulate matter concentration where it’s relatively clean, it’s a much bigger change than in a place that’s very polluted.’ So they want to see the whole range.” Diner says MAIA will fly over each area at least three times per week.MAIA team members who specialize in remote sensing helped Diner select the spectral bands. The team epidemiologists weighed in on other constraints. For instance, if there are two targets that could be observed in one area as the satellite passes overhead, which one would they prioritize?Yang Liu, who studies air pollution at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, leads the group that is integrating instrument data with atmospheric chemistry and spatial statistical models. The operational algorithm they create will translate the satellite signals into concentrations of the same pollutants collected by the speciation monitors, at a resolution of 1 kilometer squared1 km2.16,17Epidemiologists will compare those maps with local records to study health effects associated with particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 exposure in the short and long terms, as well as during pregnancy.18 An estimated 4.1 million4.1 million deaths globally are attributed to particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5,19 and investigators have shown links between exposure to fine particles and “everything from simple asthma exacerbation20 to heart attacks21 to cancer,22” says Liu. “In recent years, it has been linked to cognitive changes23 and birth defects.24 It has such a broad spectrum of impacts.”Birth outcomes are among the health effects that MAIA researchers will study. Preeclampsia and low birthweight are some of the pregnancy and childbirth concerns already linked to air pollution.27 Image: © iStock.com/FatCamera.Short-term exposures (daily to monthly) are perhaps the easiest to study. Liu says investigators in the Atlanta region will use MAIA data to generate pollution estimates, then compare those to emergency department visits for problems such as asthma attacks and cardiovascular disease. Long-term (multiyear) exposures will be compared with hospital or physician office visits for cardiovascular disease. Pregnancy-related exposures will be studied by comparing hospital or physician office visits for preeclampsia, low-birthweight infants, and other pregnancy and childbirth concerns with particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 levels in the preceding 12 months. Given that adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, and birth outcomes have already been linked to air pollution,25–27 these studies can confirm whether MAIA findings regarding particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 constituents are indeed valid for health effects studies in places without ground-based monitors.Electronic medical records simplify health studies, and Liu will have little trouble getting digital emergency department records in Georgia. However, not all hospitals in LMICs are set up to keep digital records.28 In South Africa, for instance, public hospitals have struggled to adopt them,29 so MAIA researcher Janine Wichmann, an epidemiologist at the University of Pretoria, will use records from private hospitals. This will skew the cohort toward more affluent patients, she says, “but at least, perhaps, one can then compare it to, say, European or U.S. studies.”For pregnancy studies, MAIA researchers will need access to birth certificates. Ritz says MAIA-affiliated researchers in countries without electronic recordkeeping, such as India and Ethiopia, will have to gather paper birth certificates. “You have to have special outreach efforts,” she says.Keeping It LocalWichmann and her colleagues are pleased that the MAIA team has made partnering with local researchers a priority. “Parachute science is my pet peeve,” says Rebecca Garland, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Pretoria, referring to studies conducted by outside researchers without involving local expertise or sharing findings. “Parachute scientists don’t engage with local researchers or stakeholders, so their work, and thus their results, aren’t always relevant or needed. Even if it is cool science, if it is not a priority of the local stakeholders it won’t have any impact. As these [parachute] researchers are working alone, they don’t know the actual gaps or priorities.”Once the MAIA data are available, Garland, Langerman, and Wichmann hope to see a more complete picture of how different pollutants move through the province at different times of the year. This will be important for establishing policies that protect health, Garland says. Many countries around the world have no air quality standards at all.30 South Africa adopted air quality limits for eight priority pollutants in 2004 and began setting up a network of air monitors.31 That was a good start, says Wichmann, but more still needs to be done—South Africa’s air quality standards are less stringent than WHO guidelines. For instance, the WHO guideline for sulfur dioxide is an average of 40 micrograms per meter cubed40 μg/m3 over 24 hours, compared with the South African standard of 125 micrograms per meter cubed125 μg/m3. “On the vast majority of days, the WHO standard is being exceeded [in the province],” says Wichmann. “But according to South African officials, there’s no pollution problem.”SPARTAN monitors are improving ground-based air monitor coverage in the MAIA primary target areas. Here, Siyabonga Simelane, a PhD student at the University of Johannesburg, stands with a new monitor installed by SPARTAN in the capital city (visible in the background). Image: Courtesy Kristy Langerman/University of Johannesburg.Wichmann is dubious that any amount of data will trigger South African regulatory agencies to rethink the nation’s air quality standards. The country’s economy is struggling, she says, and politicians tend to think that the economy should take precedence over environmental standards.Another epidemiologist on the MAIA project, Bart Ostro, from the University of California, Davis, offers a more optimistic view. He has seen officials change their outlook on air pollution once they are presented with analysis of local data. For example, in the 1990s, Ostro helped health researchers in Chile and Thailand determine that the particulate matter they were measuring was associated with a multitude of health effects.32“I was told later that [this research] had had a very important role in awakening scientists and politicians to the air pollution issue in these countries,” Ostro says. “Conducting studies in people’s own countries can really be a wake-up call.”Nancy Averett writes about science and the environment from Cincinnati, OH.

Coro-naviruses are positive sense–enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. Serotypes from a- and b-coronavirus genera can cause human disease. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is a b-coronavirus. Pregnant women and neonates are particularly vulnerable to SARSCoV-2 infection compared with older children and healthy young adults, with unique challenges in their management. In comparison to SARSCoV-2 positive non pregnant women, SARSCoV-2 positive pregnant women are significantly more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit, receive invasive ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and have higher risk of death.1 The transmission of SARSCoV-2 from mother to foetus, during pregnancy or delivery and afterwards during postnatal care of new born baby, has always been a serious concern for families as well as perinatal practitioners. There were no clear answers due to lack of enough data. Three potential modes of Perinatal transmission of SARSCoV-2 have been proposed; intrauterine transplacental/trans amniotic fluid transmission, intrapartum transmission due to infected secretions/body fluids and immediate postnatal transmission from mother, health care workers and other adults involved in the care of the baby.1 Immediate postnatal transmission is the most common mode responsible for neonatal SARSCoV-2. A recent meta-analysis of 31016 SARSCoV-2 positive Pregnant women (from 62 observational studies) has shown that 50% were asymptomatic while 7% required ICU admission and 2% died.2 48.8% delivered by C Section and 49.8% C Sections were due to SARSCoV-2 related reasons. 23.4% babies were born preterm (&lt;37 weeks), 16.6% were low birth weight, 23.7% required NICU admission and 1.6% neonates died. Only 3.5% babies born to Covid-Positive mothers were Covid-positive. As compared to Covid negative mothers, Covid positive mothers had a higher risk of Preterm (&lt;37 weeks) birth (RR = 4.91; 95% CI = 3.97 to 60.8), much higher risk of very preterm (&lt;32 weeks) birth (RR = 8.47; 95% CI = 4.02 to 17.85) and higher risk of NICU admissions (RR = 2.01; 95% CI = 1.50 to 2.69).2 SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from person to person by droplet, airborne and contact routes. Hence, like any other situation, face masking, hand washing and physical distancing (equal to or more than 6 ft) remain the main stay of prevention during perinatal period. In addition, the delivery of SARSCoV-2 positive pregnant women requires special arrangements to prevent the spread of infection to other patients, staff and babies. Pregnant women should be given priority for Covid-19 testing. The timing and mode of delivery should follow the standard obstetric protocols. For preterm delivery of Covid positive mothers, the antenatal steroids should be given as a standard. The delivery should be conducted in a negative pressure room if possible. Only essential staff wearing standard PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) should stay inside delivery room. Strict Isolation and infection control protocols (including N-95 masking) should be followed. Mother should wear surgical mask during delivery and afterwards.1 The newborn resuscitation area should be separated from delivery room by a physical partition. Maternal COVID-19 alone is not a specific indication for attending a delivery by NICU Team. The attending pediatric/neonatal team should strictly follow the standard precautions of donning and doffing, N-95 masks, face shields etc. During neonatal resuscitation, two-person technique should be used during mask/T-piece ventilation. The endotracheal intubation should be carried out under head box or by using video laryngoscopy if available. The baby should be transported to NICU through a predetermined specified pathway. Infant’s cot should be six meters away behind a barrier, in case the baby is rooming in with the mother. Covid-19 Vaccination is safe and effective during pregnancy and lactation. The risk of transmission of vaccine (i.e., COVID-19 messenger RNA [mRNA]) across placenta is unlikely. On the other hand, maternal Ig G antibodies in response to the vaccine are likely to be transmitted across the placenta. Antibodies to COVID-19 are found in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 and in the breast milk of mothers with COVID-19. Hence, the benefits of Covid vaccination, both for mother and fetus, out weight any potential risks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend Covid-19 vaccination as a shared decision between pregnant woman and her obstetrician/pediatrician. There is no contraindication to breast feeding by a Covid-19 positive mother provided she strictly follows face masking, hand washing and breast washing with soap and water during breast feeding. There is no evidence of Covid-19 transmission through breast milk. Anti-Covid medications and vaccines do not constitute a contraindication to breast feeding. Instead, breast milk is known to provide protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The nutritional, immunologic, and developmental benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential transmission risk of viral transmission. In case the mother is unable to directly breast feed, she can use Expressed Breast Milk (EBM) if required. Management of Perinatal Covid-19 follows the general guidelines issued by regulatory authorities.3 Asymptomatic mothers and babies only need isolation till they become Covid-19 negative. An infected mother who has been afebrile for 24 hours without antipyretics and is improving, is not likely to be contagious 10 days after the onset of symptoms and can safely care for her infant. Therefore, asymptomatic Covid Positive neonates can be discharged with close follow up. Symptomatic mothers and neonates are managed according to the severity of the disease.3 Treatment protocols include non-specific supportive treatment to specific treatment. SARSCoV-2 infection is a biphasic disease. The early phase is due to direct viral infection. The later phase is due to immune mediated response “cytokine storm”. In addition, SARSCoV-2 causes widespread microvascular coagulopathy which can lead to multiorgan failure. Hence, early aggressive treatment including ICU admission, management of hypoxia and specific treatment have become the rule. The specific treatment includes antiviral agents (Favipiravir, Remdesivir), Systemic and inhaled corticosteroids, Immunomodulators (Tocilizumab, Baricitinib and IV immunoglobulin) and thrombopro-phylaxis (Enoxaparin/Heparin). Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome due to Covid-19 is the most serious and lethal form of disease which in addition to full intensive care and symptomatic treatment, may need use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and hemodialysis. There has been an exponential increase in the knowledge of pathophysiology and management of SARSCoV-2 since the pandemic started in December 2019. With the widespread availability and implementation of Corona Virus vaccine, the severity and number of hospitalizations due to of SARSCoV-2 disease are decreasing worldwide.","10.54079/jpmi.35.2.2995","","","https://lens.org/107-841-723-975-925","","18119387 and 10135472","107-841-723-975-925","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","18119387 and 10135472","",""

This paper aims to provide a state-of-art weather index insurance design, thereby including methods for natural hazards’ indices calculation, vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) using the Scopus database. First, 364 peer-reviewed articles from 2010 to present were screened for a bibliometric analysis and then, the 34 most cited articles from the past five years were systematically analyzed. Our results demonstrate that despite a great research effort on index insurance, the majority of them focused on food insecurity through agricultural and crop insurance. Also, climate change and basis risks were found highly relevant for weather index insurance, but weakly developed, suggesting challenges around food insecurity. Special focus was given to drought hazards, while other hazards such as temperature variation, excessive rainfall and wildfires were slightly covered. Emerging areas, namely agricultural, hydrological, and sustainable index insurance found promissory for insurance. Also, current state-of-the-art lacks methods for incorporating multi-hazard risk evaluation in vulnerability assessment and risk pricing. Most studies considered only single-hazard risk, and the multi-hazard risk studies assumed independence between hazards. Thus, we summarized the most common methods for calculating indices, estimating losses using indices, pricing risks, and evaluating insurance index policies. This review promotes a starting point in weather index insurance design towards a multi-hazard resilient society.","10.5194/egusphere-2022-498-rc1","","","https://lens.org/109-268-616-227-474","","","109-268-616-227-474","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

This human feedback, obtained from geo-tagged big textual data on the X (formerly known as Twitter) platform, is used to explore the effects of stay-at-home orders on indoor air quality ( IAQ ) perceptions globally. This analysis covers the first year of the pandemic and juxtaposes these insights with the baseline data from 2019. In this pilot study, we utilized transformer models, specifically the robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach ( RoBERTa ) algorithm, a pre-trained model based on the X data, for sentiment analysis. Results indicate an increase in negative perceptions of IAQ among occupants in 2020 compared to the 2019 baseline. The research emphasizes the untapped potential of social media analytics in shaping and refining environmental health strategies, particularly in the context of indoor environments. Findings underscore a pressing need for architects, planners, and policy-makers to prioritize IAQ in design considerations, especially in light of changing global dynamics like pandemics.

Clinicians, educators, and policymakers need implementable evidence-based strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of health care. For decades, experts have tried to warn us of the challenges of global warming and climate change. The influential Lancet Rockefeller Report heralded the Anthropocene Era where the impact of humans on the planet has left an indelible footprint on the planet [[1]Davidson P.M. Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission report: a call to action for human health.Int J Nurs Stud. Jan. 2016; 53: 1-2Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. Unfortunately, until recent times, much of the discussion of climate change has been in lofty, academic, nebulous and esoteric terms, leaving gaps for sceptics, propaganda and misinformation. Recent bushfires, floods and a global pandemic have lifted words off the page and created a burning platform for climate action. Current geopolitical instability and the devastating impact of a global pandemic have accentuated the urgency for focus and action. There is a growing awareness that human and planetary health are intricately interconnected, and that human health is reliant on the health of our planet. Consequently, each one-degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a 6% increase in cardiovascular disease and we are also aware of the impact of air pollution and the associated risks of hospitalisation, myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality [[2]Kang Y. Tang H. Zhang L. Wang S. Wang X.

Bushfires cause smoke pollutants and impact air quality, contributing to premature death and increased cardiovascular and respiratory-related hospitalisations, whilst also destroying ecosystems [[4]Nguyen H.D.

Moreover, major environmental disasters such as earthquakes and floods are stressor events that can adversely contribute to cardiovascular disease [[5]Aoki T. Fukumoto Y. Yasuda S. Sakata Y. Ito K. Takahashi J. et al.The great East Japan earthquake disaster and cardiovascular diseases.Eur Heart J. 2012; 33: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar]. The impact of climate change on human health is illustrated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Figure 1 [[6]Centers for Disease Control and PreventionClimate Effects on Health. 2022.https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/default.htmGoogle Scholar]. Increasingly, it is also recognised that social determinants of health contribute to climate change impacts, and it is often those who are most vulnerable that are most impacted by environmental factors. In light of increasing temperatures, at-risk populations, individuals older than 65 years, and those younger than one year of age, have been exposed to many more heat waves and suffered adverse health outcomes [[7]Romanello M. Di Napoli C. Drummond P. Green C. Kennard H.

Moreover, changes in our ecosystem are affecting the spread of infectious diseases, and the risk of emerging threats. As Redfern and colleagues recommend in their editorial, a “whole-of-planet effort” is needed to make significant reductions to meet the challenges of climate change and decades of inaction [[8]Redfern J. Gregory A.T. Raman J. Figtree G.A. Singleton A. Denniss A.R. Ferguson C.

The reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have made for some sobering headlines, increasing focus on decreasing carbon emissions; this has gained attention from both the public and private sectors [[9]Khan N. Our final warning: Intergovernmental panel on climate change and primary care.Br J Gen Pract. 2022; 72: 271Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar]. Decreasing carbon emissions will require a multifaceted, multi-sectoral strategy addressing not just policy but organisational cultures and individual behaviours. Health care contributes significantly to carbon emissions, yet this is not commonly recognised or discussed by health care professions, let alone addressed, in their undergraduate and postgraduate curriculae [[10]Quitmann C. Sauerborn R. Danquah I. Herrmann A. ‘Climate change mitigation is a hot topic, but not when it comes to hospitals’: a qualitative study on hospital stakeholders’ perception and sense of responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions.J Med Ethics. 2022; (medethics-2021-107971)Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar,[11]Leffers J.

Mandate for the nursing profession to address climate change through nursing education.J Nurs Scholarsh. 2017; 49: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar]. Research by Malik and colleagues demonstrates that 7% of Australia’s carbon footprint is attributed to health care and that nearly half of this contribution (approximately 3% of this total) can be attributed to hospitals [[12]Malik A. Lenzen M. McAlister S. McGain F. The carbon footprint of Australian health care.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e27-e35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar].

Climate adaptive hospital: a systematic review of determinants and actions.J Environ Health Sci Engin. 2022; 20: 983-1013Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar]. Nurses comprise the single largest health workforce in our health system. We are in a unique position to help address reducing carbon emissions and achieve the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals that lie at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—a shared blueprint, adopted in 2015, “for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future” (www.sdgs.un.org/goals) [[14]Rosa W.E.

Inglis and colleagues have provided eight priorities for action in their call to action published on behalf of the Cardiovascular Nursing Council of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, in this issue [[16]Inglis S.C.

Bardsley K. et al.Cardiovascular nursing and climate change: a call to action from the CSANZ Cardiovascular Nursing Council.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 16-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. These priorities are 1) individual counselling to empower self-care in climate-related disasters and highlight the need for an ‘emergency action plan’; 2) case management for those experiencing environmental disasters with access to specialist social work and psychology services; 3) improving educational resources; 4) increasing partnerships to improve understanding of the health impacts of climate change; 5) First Nations peoples’ leadership; 6) maximising the potential of telehealth; 7) responsible and sustainable logistics; and, 8) policy and advocacy [[16]Inglis S.C. Ferguson C. Eddington R. McDonagh J. Aldridge C.J. Bardsley K. et al.Cardiovascular nursing and climate change: a call to action from the CSANZ Cardiovascular Nursing Council.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 16-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. To date, many of our attempts to address climate change have been reactive and not focussed on prevention. We must plan, organise, and adapt health care delivery to reduce the environmental impact through the implementation of environmentally sustainable health systems. This includes rapidly implementing what works, and de-implementing or reducing what causes harm to the environment. Further, in designing new health care interventions we must increasingly consider the environmental impact of interventions and the carbon cost. So how can cardiovascular health professionals reduce their carbon footprint? This is more than reducing the number of single-use coffee cups. There is an urgency about this; however, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are actionable steps we can all take to reduce carbon emissions and help to achieve Paris Agreement goals—the legally binding international treaty of climate change adopted in late 2015 (unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement). Achieving these targets will require both collaboration and political will, particularly given the complexity of the health care system. Firstly, hospitals consume a large amount of energy and emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Hospitals should consider switching to renewable energy, although this may only be achievable through intersectoral partnerships. In Australia, there is significant state and federal investment in the bricks and mortar of hospitals; it is critical that these are designed to be carbon-neutral and sustainable. This should be part of strategic planning, with governing boards bearing the responsibility for monitoring and accountability. Another important contributor is the use of medical equipment and devices in health care. Imaging machinery, for example, requires high amounts of energy. It is therefore critical that energy requirements play a role in decision-making when designing and planning new health care facilities to ensure efficient and effective use and sustainable operating models. Reducing the environmental impact of diagnosis and treatment is an important, key challenge—particularly in the context of increasing multi-morbidity. This may mean more judicious use of medical imaging and diagnostic procedures, increased virtual care, and models that address multi-morbidity and assess health care within a values-based framework [[17]Wise S. Hall J. Haywood P. Khana N. Hossain L. van Gool K. Paying for value: options for value-based payment reform in Australia.Aust Health Rev. 2022; 46: 129-133Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. Recycling and minimising single-use items or unnecessary waste is not straightforward. For example, many single-use items are often used in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory or operating room. Szirt and colleagues provide some practical strategies in this issue to help address environmental sustainability in this setting [[18]Szirt R. Monjur M.R. McGovern L. Charlesworth K. O’Connor S. Weaver J.C. et al.Environmental sustainability in the cardiac catheter laboratory.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. There is a need to reconsider the single-use nature of many items in health care, currently required for safety (to minimise transmission of infectious disease) and by regulation. Whilst sterilisation procedures have advanced, sterilisation itself uses energy and is a contributor to carbon emissions. On average, each health worker contributes 13 kg of waste (per staffed bed, per day), with non-sustainable items ending up in landfill or being incinerated [[19]Cook C. Demorest S.L. Schenk E. Nurses and climate action.Am J Nurs. Apr. 2019; 119: 54-60Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar]. We can do better. Personal responsibility is vital, although we need to collaborate to achieve policy and system change. Virtual care or telehealth offers promise through the transformation of high-resource clinical facilities to lower-resource home-based care. Although the carbon footprint of data storage is an important factor to consider, cloud-based data storage can help reduce overall power use. There should also be closer examination of the environmental impacts of routine health care activities, such as laundry and travel. There is a fine balance to strike between the benefits of hygiene maintenance and infection prevention achieved by changing all patients’ bedsheets on a daily basis and the considerable costs of the associated power-consumption. Travel comes in many forms—patients travelling to hospital or clinic appointments, transportation of health care consumables, and domestic and international air travel to-and-from scientific meetings. The global COVID-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for virtual working and virtual care, and it is important to consider sustainability as a factor in decision making in these new models of care provision. There is an increase in specialisation in health care, and this is juxtaposed with the increase in complex multimorbidity. As the population ages, and multimorbidity becomes an increasingly defining feature of general health status, we may need to question the sustainability of super-specialised clinics for single conditions when this can often result in multiple hospital visits for those patients with more than one (potentially related) condition, such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure and diabetes mellitus. Peak bodies, such as the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, need to consider the sustainability of in-person meetings and the viability of hybrid meetings for those individuals wishing to minimise their carbon footprint. No single discipline or institution holds the panacea for reducing the carbon footprint of health care. There is need for cross-disciplinary collaboration and partnership in developing carbon emission reduction strategies and sustainable interventions. This means health professionals sharing their expertise and working together with designers, architects, procurement and waste personnel, infectious diseases experts, logistics officers, and health service planners. We must all recognise our critical contributions to health care sustainability at all levels: our society, our health care organisations, and by our own individual actions. There is much we can do as individuals, and this comes down to factors such as our personal choices in food consumption, travel and energy use. Engaging in political advocacy around issues of climate change and advocating for those individuals and communities at highest risk is also important. These strategies will all help to shift us from mere rhetoric to action and these choices, although they seem small, can be cumulative and impactful. Addressing climate change also means looking beyond our shores and considering health within a global ecosystem [[20]Patz J.A. Frumkin H. Holloway T. Vimont D.J. Haines A. Climate change: challenges and opportunities for global health.JAMA. 2014; 312: 1565-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar]. While the contribution of low-income countries to carbon emissions is relatively low, the economic and associated health impacts of increasing temperatures are considerable for them [[21]Acevedo S. Mrkaic M. Pugacheva E. Topalova P. The unequal burden of rising temperatures: how can low-income countries cope? International Monetary Fund Blog. 2022.https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2017/09/27/the-unequal-burden-of-rising-temperatures-how-can-low-income-countries-copeGoogle Scholar]. For many of Australia and New Zealand’s global neighbours in the Pacific, the threats of climate change are very real, and they need our help and assistance. This special issue has cast an important spotlight on the relationship between environment and climate and health, which not only affects planetary health but also, more specifically, impacts our cardiovascular health. Fostering a focus on research and collaboration that not only prevents but also mitigates the impact of climate change on health will be critical in preparing health professionals of the future. The cataclysmic impacts of recent years, including bushfires and floods in the context of a global pandemic, have forced us to refocus and recalibrate our efforts. Experts tried to warn us of these looming threats for decades but, for the most part, we have been caught by surprise and, consequently, there has been death and suffering which will likely be evident for many years to come. Sometimes, when viewing the magnitude of the problem, it is hard to see a path forward, but we can draw on successful programs, such as decreasing tobacco usage, to see how we can change and make a difference. This special issue provides a path forward and a platform for action—it is now up to us all, individually and collectively, to act.

The conference marked a shift in the focus of climate negotiations, with greater emphasis placed on adaptation and resilience strategies rather than on mitigation. The outcome of COP27 was the creation of a loss-and-damage fund to support countries most affected by the climate crisis. The message from the conference was clear, which was as follows: it is no longer possible to focus only on preventing serious consequences of climate change, and it is therefore necessary to invest in adaptation efforts, with special attention to the needs of the most vulnerable people. Anthropogenic climate change is altering the pattern, severity, and frequency of diseases that we see as frontline clinicians. It is increasingly contributing to heat-related illnesses, water- and vector-borne diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, accidental and nonaccidental trauma, and mental health disorders.1Sorensen C.J.

Taking advantage of targeted quality patient education in the emergency department (ED) is a low-cost and high-yield way for emergency physicians to improve climate-related health outcomes. In 2018, ACEP released a policy statement emphasizing the important role of emergency medicine in addressing climate crisis. Among 6 action items, ACEP highlighted our role in “educat(ing) patients on appropriate precautions in extreme weather, avoidance of exacerbation triggers, early identification of exacerbations, and temporizing measures when needed.”6American College of Emergency PhysiciansImpact of climate change on public health and implications for emergency medicine.Ann Emerg Med. 2018; 72: e49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar Oftentimes, encounters in the ED are the only contact that at-risk populations have with the health care system. Therefore, these brief encounters are invaluable opportunities to provide high-quality education relevant to the acute patient presentation and prevent mild climate-related illnesses from turning into life-threatening disease exacerbations, infections, or injuries. Within this framework, emergency physicians ought to adhere to the following aspects: (1) understand how the communities they serve are being affected by climate change, (2) identify climate-related ED presentations and patients most at risk from severe health effects of climate change,7Balbus J.M.

Emergency medicine has long capitalized on opportunities to deliver preventive services to reduce the burden of disease and injury in populations at risk.

In 2019, the American Medical Association passed a resolution supporting teaching on climate change in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education settings.12American Medical AssociationResolution #A19-302: Climate Change Education Across the Medical Education Continuum.

Within the Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) statements proposed by the American Board of Emergency Medicine, KSAs PE0 (“Prevention and Education”) states that emergency physicians should be able to “lead or participate in programs that educate patients and the community about injury and illness prevention; identify preventive measures to avoid/delay illness or prevent trauma; (and) educate patients regarding preventive measures to improve lifestyle, avoid/delay illness, or prevent trauma, and to optimize patient outcomes.”15American Board of Emergency MedicineKnowledge Skills and Abilities.

Consider the following cases. Both are clinical presentations that are being amplified by climate change. Both are also scenarios in which taking advantage of a teachable moment may improve patient health resilience and prevent climate-related life-threatening illnesses. Although not comprehensive, our goal is to enhance patient care, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. A 76-year-old woman presented to the ED in July with dizziness. The patient had a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. She lived by herself in an apartment with no air conditioning in the suburbs of Chicago. The workup was reassuring and symptoms improved after rehydration and cooling. The patient was discharged home with a diagnosis of heat exhaustion. Heat illness ranges from mild disorders such as heat exhaustion to life-threatening conditions such as heat stroke. Providers and patients should be aware that there is no specific environmental temperature at which heat stroke tends to occur and precautions should be taken even with temperatures as low as 86 °F (30 °C) especially in areas with high relative humidity.16People’s Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care MedicineExpert consensus on standardized diagnosis and treatment for heat stroke.Mil Med Res. 2016; 3: 1PubMed Google Scholar People who are most at risk for heat stroke and who should be considered for patient education include those with chronic diseases, housing insecurity, substance abuse, psychiatric disease, at extremes of ages, and outdoor workers.

Samples of patient education can be found in Appendix E1 (English language) and Appendix E2 (Spanish language) (available at http://www.annemergmed.com). A 14-year-old boy with type I diabetes mellitus presented to the ED with abdominal pain and fatigue. A couple of weeks ago, his home in Virginia lost power after a hurricane made landfall in the United States. The patient was diagnosed with severe hyperglycemia without diabetic ketoacidosis as a result of expired insulin and inability to obtain a new prescription in a timely manner. After receiving intravenous fluids and subcutaneous insulin, he was discharged with a refill of his medications. Morbidity and mortality after extreme weather events amplified by climate change such as hurricanes and floods are complex and oftentimes difficult to quantify. Short-term health effects of extreme weather events include unintentional blunt and thermal injuries, drownings, and exposure to carbon monoxide and accidental chemical releases. These typically account for the majority of deaths reported after weather events. However, this can represent a gross underestimation,19Santos-Lozada A.R. Howard J.T.

Crowding and time constraints of a busy ED often make spending additional time at the patient’s bedside challenging. Additionally, the spectrum of languages and reading comprehension experienced across EDs as well as competing priorities can make it difficult to find a one-size-fits-all patient education model. Better evidence is needed to optimize the organization and delivery of patient education,25Pétré B. Margat A.

Yet, there is much we already know that can be better disseminated and acted upon to reduce the demand for care and potentially improve outcomes that matter most to patients. Given the scale in which climate change is already affecting human health and the need for rapid adaptation and improved resilience, considering all manners of patient counseling seems prudent. In addition to provider-patient conversations and traditional written discharge instructions, EDs may consider alternative forms of educating their patients on how climate is affecting their health, such as pictographic illustration26Hill B. Perri-Moore S. Kuang J. et al.Automated pictographic illustration of discharge instructions with glyph: impact on patient recall and satisfaction.J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2016; 23: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and short videos. In conclusion, in emergency medicine, we have the unique privilege of interfacing with patients who often have limited means of accessing medical care and face multiple barriers to achieving optimal health. It, therefore, falls under our purview to share the evidence and individualized education to address gaps in awareness and understanding. The potential to reduce adverse clinical outcomes far outweighs our small effort. It is a service to our patients and each other as we attempt to reduce acute care demands and keep our communities healthy. As stakeholders across disciplines and sectors work to limit the adverse effects of global warming, we as clinicians and educators can adapt and promote climate resilient development right in our EDs. Discharge instructions that link climate hazards to health is just one example by which planetary health is integrated with bedside education.

Wildfires emit many air pollutants of concern for public health. In this dissertation, I systematically reviewed the scientific literature on which health effects were associated with wildfire smoke exposure, piloted the most sophisticated exposure model to date to estimate PM2.5 exposures during the 2008 northern California wildfires, and assessed the effect of these exposures on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations. The scientific literature documents clear evidence of respiratory health effects from wildfire smoke, most specifically for exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Only inconsistent evidence exists for cardiovascular effects. Several high-quality studies demonstrate significant associations between wildfire smoke exposure and all-cause mortality, but not for specific causes of mortality. To study the 2008 northern California wildfires, I created a spatiotemporal exposure model that used the latest in machine learning methods to combine information from satellites, output from a chemical transport model, and meteorological and other spatial and temporal variables to create an optimal exposure model. The best model had an out-of-sample cross-validated R2 of 0.80. Using this model, I could estimate exposures at any location on any day within the study area. To analyze the health effects of the 2008 northern California wildfires, I estimated exposure at all ZIP codes within the study region and found evidence of increased asthma, COPD, pneumonia, and all-cause respiratory hospitalizations associated with PM2.5 during the fire period. Only for asthma hospitalizations was this effect significantly different from effects for PM2.5 outside of the fire period. I also found some evidence of increased rates of hospitalization for asthma associated with PM2.5 during the wildfire period among women compared to men, and among adults compared to children and the elderly. I also found higher rates of hospitalizations for COPD and pneumonia in ZIP codes with lower levels of owner-occupied housing, but I did not find consistent differences along gradients of other measures of socio-economic status by ZIP code. My research piloted the first spatiotemporal exposure model to use machine learning methods to improve estimation of PM2.5 exposures during wildfires using a combination of satellite data, chemical transport model output, meteorological parameters, and land use information. The results from my epidemiological analysis confirm previous evidence of exacerbation of respiratory health effects from exposure to wildfire PM2.5 and highlight evidence of groups that are more vulnerable to this exposure.","","","","https://lens.org/116-217-735-965-318","","","116-217-735-965-318","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Pairing this alongside the negative and vicarious impacts of secondary traumatic stress on teachers and school leaders, efforts towards whole school change are complex endeavours. The extant literature from trauma-informed practice for school leadership provides useful frameworks for leaders to understand their guiding roles within trauma-affected communities. However, trauma-informed practices require further enquiry and better integration with systems-aware perspectives. A systems-aware approach to school leadership positions leaders within the dynamic systems in which their schools are embedded. It helps leaders to navigate the networked patterns of relationships within their communities. Given impacts of intergenerational poverty, racism, childhood trauma and long-standing educational inequity, community devastation from natural events such as droughts and bushfires, plus the world-wide uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many complex factors that now require systems-aware perspectives to address compounding systemic concerns. In order to contribute to the advancement of both trauma-informed leadership and systems-aware leadership, this paper makes the case for integrating these fields within school contexts. Predicated on a systematic literature review and novel theorising, this paper explores how a new practice framework for a trauma-informed integral response to bolster school leaders can be used to benefit whole communities.","","17","1","https://lens.org/120-627-460-931-085","62","","120-627-460-931-085","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","62","1"

Tasmania and Queensland were subject to unprecedented summer temperatures and suffered damaging bushfires in ecologies that were thought to be permanently safe from fire damage. Queensland then underwent a cascading series of bushfires, cyclones and floods, that saw the media team activated for three solid months. Agencies are actively accounting for climate change in their planning and successful preparedness programs are now more important than ever. This project was designed to map the community engagement for preparedness approaches Australian agencies are currently using and to use this picture to develop closer linkages from frameworks to practice. It was a six-stage project: a literature review, interviews with agency community engagement practitioners and managers, design of a framework that accounted for their approach and then presentation of a toolkit that allowed implementation at grass roots level of the framework, and evaluation of this work. The literature review confirmed that getting people to prepare for a natural hazard is difficult, even in places where hazards are regular and expected. People living in cyclone-prone areas tended to be better prepared and preparation was considered a social norm in these areas, but still there were large segments of the community who did not register risk or act on a threat. People in bushfire prone areas tended to be the worst prepared, and in particular, people in urban areas, and wildland/urban interfaces. A number of obstacles to preparing emerged from the literature. Key was failure to fully personalise a risk, even when the risk is accepted as likely. The business of day to day lives, cost, fear of being seen to over-react, weighing up likelihood against effort, optimism bias and being overwhelmed by the volume of tasks involved in preparing all have an influence, along with situational factors such demographics and life stage, on hazard preparation. The literature also showed that community engagement in emergency management covers the whole spectrum of communication, engagement and participation, and that interpretation was used by practitioners used to cover all of these methods of interaction with the community. Therefore the term ‘community engagement’ was used to refer to work by engagement and communication teams concerned with preparedness for natural hazards. Our interviews with practitioners explored what preparedness looks like, barriers and enablers of preparedness, what competencies exist in a prepared community and how they and their agency ‘do’ community engagement. We also touched on what they thought was best practice in the field and what framework/s they use to guide their practice. Practitioners told us that most of them work to the IAP2-based Australian Institute of Disaster Resilience Handbook 6 framework, usually with additions and alterations. Co-design and community development approaches emerged as a goal for many practitioners. We found a wide range of approaches, usually driven by resourcing and skills. Some smaller states with very small teams undertake information delivery engagement practices, while other small teams have highly organised community capacity-building programs embedded in their organisation’s strategic planning. Several larger organisations are doing community engagement in a measurably successful way. They show that it is possible to get year on year improvements to preparedness levels, as well as illustrating programmed methods of achieving this. Our interviews gave us rich information from which we were able to build the following model containing five steps, and with three additional different layers. The first overlay features the aims of each step; the second explains the tactics associated with each step; and the third explains and guides the research, monitoring, evaluation and learning that permeates every aspect of the model. The fifth dimension of the model, and a key deliverable of this project, is a competency index, which connects the characteristics of the community with the different stages of the model. We’ve called the model the Australian generative model of community engagement for preparedness – the diagram below shows the basic framework. Following development of the model, we undertook a systematic literature review to determine the effect of checklist preparedness activities for personal safety and coping during a hazard’s impact and recovery phases. We used accepted systematic literature review standards and checked these against the Campbell Collaboration’s method of systematic literature reviews, and in our first round of searching found 1,451 articles. These were sorted on title, and a further 1,328 excluded. After abstract and full text screening, not one article remained that attempted to examine the effect of discrete or groups of preparedness activities. What we did find from the systematic literature review was a series of community engagement interventions that had been tested in an academic setting and published in both peer reviewed and grey literature. From this data we were able to compile a toolkit of community engagement techniques that had been tested in an emergency management preparedness setting. At this point we were able to take the model to workshops of agency, local government and not for profit practitioners in the preparedness space. With their guidance, we were able to simplify the presentation of the model and consider aspects of the model that would or wouldn’t work in practice. The workshops provided an iterative platform, with the model and the workshop materials evolving from the first workshop to the second. We expect the framework to evolve as practitioners mould it to suit and explain their approaches to community engagement for preparedness. Evaluation was an important concept that emerged from the literature review, the interviews with practitioners and the systematic literature review, and has been identified as problematic by respected researchers Gilbert, Elsworth and Rhodes and their colleagues since 2007 (Gilbert, 2007; Elsworth, Gilbert & Rhodes, 2009; Gilbert, Elsworth, Stevens, Rowe & Robinson, 2010; Rhodes, Gilbert, Nelson and Preece, 2011). From these information sources and from community engagement evaluation literature, we also developed a Monitoring and Evaluation Toolkit as a companion to the Community Engagement Toolkit. Both of these toolkits are separate documents within the project. Both are documents are designed to cater for entry level practitioners upward. This project has provided a platform for advancement of Australian practice in community engagement for preparedness. It has allowed us to map approaches and competencies that have potential to clarify the community engagement planning process. It supports the matching of CE approaches and techniques to community competencies and characteristics, and provides guidance on evaluation. We have also provided a series of recommendations on community engagement practice and further research ideas that we think will further advance efforts to get Australians ready for natural hazards.","","","","https://lens.org/122-440-359-222-922","","","122-440-359-222-922","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

These infrastructures are vital for supporting and facilitating urban life, but they face unprecedented challenges from climate change, political tensions, and increasing complexity. To address these challenges, resilience has become a crucial consideration in urban development plans. This chapter delves into the assessment of resilience for three critical infrastructures: transportation, water, and electricity. It emphasizes the need to understand the interdependencies between these infrastructures, as disruptions in one can have cascading effects on others, impacting overall urban resilience. The chapter includes two case studies to illustrate the differences between assessing individual infrastructures and evaluating a system of interrelated infrastructures. These case studies underscore the complexities involved in resilience assessments and highlight the importance of taking a holistic approach that considers interdependencies and interactions. By providing guidance on assessing the resilience of individual and interdependent infrastructures, the chapter aims to enhance understanding of urban resilience and support decision-making processes to improve the robustness and adaptability of critical urban systems. It underscores the integration of resilience into urban planning and development, contributing to the creation of more sustainable and resilient cities. References Takano , T. ( 2005 ).

Key international framework agreements, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the 2021 Glasgow Pact, noted the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems in addressing climate change and disaster risk. For example, vegetation can stabilize slopes to reduce mountain hazards and sand dunes, mangroves, and/or seagrasses can reduce the impacts of coastal storms. &amp;amp;#160;However, there are gaps in the scientific evidence on this topic with few comprehensive, peer-reviewed studies to support decision-making on green infrastructure for disaster risk reduction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study systematically reviews 529 English-language articles published between 2000 and 2019. The objective was to catalogue the extent of knowledge and confidence in the role of ecosystems in reducing disaster risk. The main question this review addresses is: What is the evidence of the role that ecosystem services and/or functions contribute to disaster risk reduction? We modified the review methodology established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to identify the robustness of evidence and level of agreement on the role of ecosystems in attenuating most common types of hazards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The data demonstrate very robust links on the role of ecosystems in forest fire management, urban flooding and slope stabilization to reduce mountain hazards in a cost-effective manner. The study also highlights how ecosystems provide multiple services and functions in addition to regulating hazards, e.g., provisioning services for reducing vulnerability. The review highlights several research gaps, notably a geographic concentration of studies on urban areas of Europe and North America, and insufficient policy-relevant research on coastal, dryland, and watershed areas, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America. To conclude, more attention should be paid to filling these research gaps and developing performance standards, which would provide policy-makers with increased confidence in investing in green infrastructure for disaster risk reduction and climate governance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>","10.5194/egusphere-egu22-9109","","","https://lens.org/123-686-533-152-365","","","123-686-533-152-365","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

By providing detailed risk assessments, it contributes to the reduction of fire frequency and severity, safeguards forest resources, supports ecological stability, and ensures human safety. This study systematically reviews wildfire prediction literature from 2003 to 2023, emphasizing research trends and collaborative trends. Our findings reveal a significant increase in research activity between 2019 and 2023, primarily driven by the United States Forest Service and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The majority of this research was published in prominent journals such as the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Forest Ecology and Management, Remote Sensing, and Forests. These publications predominantly originate from Europe, the United States, and China. Since 2020, there has been substantial growth in the application of machine learning techniques in predicting forest fires, particularly in estimating fire occurrence probabilities, simulating fire spread, and projecting post-fire environmental impacts. Advanced algorithms, including deep learning and ensemble learning, have shown superior accuracy, suggesting promising directions for future research. Additionally, the integration of machine learning with cellular automata has markedly improved the simulation of fire behavior, enhancing both efficiency and precision. The profound impact of climate change on wildfire prediction also necessitates the inclusion of extensive climate data in predictive models. Beyond conventional studies focusing on fire behavior and occurrence probabilities, forecasting the environmental and ecological consequences of fires has become integral to forest fire management and vital for formulating more effective wildfire strategies. The study concludes that significant regional disparities in knowledge exist, underscoring the need for improved research capabilities in underrepresented areas. Moreover, there is an urgent requirement to enhance the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, such as machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning, and to intensify efforts in identifying and leveraging various wildfire drivers to refine prediction accuracy. The insights generated from this field will profoundly augment our understanding of wildfire prediction, assisting policymakers and practitioners in managing forest resources more sustainably and averting future wildfire calamities.</jats:p>","10.3390/f15071197","15","7","https://lens.org/124-581-913-957-312","1197","19994907","124-581-913-957-312","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","19994907","1197","7"

Open Landscapes - Ecology, Management and Nature conservation. Hildesheim, Germany, 29 Sept - 03 Oct 2013). Some conservationists highly welcome prescribed fires, while others are against it. These contrasting attitudes are because we (i) lack of proper scientific information on both short- and long-term effects of fires on grassland biodiversity, (ii) because of the generally negative attitude generated also by the international and national media reporting catastrophic damages in nature, human life and property caused by wildfires and arson, and because of (iii) the confusion of wildfires and arson with controlled and carefully designed prescribed fires. With the following forum paper we would like to stimulate discussion and generate further research activity in this topic, strongly referring to our recent paper published in Basic and Applied Ecology (Valko et al. 2013) indicating the most important conclusions based on this carefully conducted systematic review.","","","","https://lens.org/128-895-561-673-531","","","128-895-561-673-531","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, home insurance has been identified by governments as a critical tool for climate adaptation and disaster resilience. However, the growing research literature on the interactions between household insurance and extreme climatic events has not previously been systematically reviewed. In this paper, we analyse 175 original peer-reviewed empirical research papers on this subject, published between 2009 and 2018. We identify areas of research focus, themes, spatial and temporal patterns, and knowledge gaps, and examine policy implications of these findings. We find that an overall focus on flood insurance leaves unanswered questions about the different insurantial challenges posed by storms and wildfire. We suggest existing technocratic and calculative insurance narratives obscure the political and moral assumptions embedded within them, and that these assumptions warrant further investigation in the context of socially legitimate insurance against the impact of extreme weather events.","10.1007/s10584-021-03093-1","165","3","https://lens.org/131-500-549-179-732","1","01650009 and 15731480","131-500-549-179-732","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","01650009 and 15731480","1","3"

Broadcast seeding is one of the most widely used post-wildfire emergency response treatments to minimize soil erosion, promote plant community recovery, and reduce non-native species invasions. However, these treatments can have negative ecological effects, due in part to the continued use of non-native species, although the use of native species has increased. We undertook an evidence-based systematic review to examine post-fire seeding treatments� effectiveness and effects on soils and plant communities in forests of the western U.S. Out of the 27 studies providing evidence regarding post-fire seeding effects on soil erosion, 33% of the studies showed seeding to be effective, an equal percentage of studies (26% each) showed minimal effectiveness or ineffectiveness, and 15% showed no difference in effectiveness of seeding in minimizing soil erosion. However, based on quality of evidence criteria, only one of 12 studies reported in the two highest quality categories qualified seeding effectiveness for soil erosion. Seventy-eight percent of study sites in publications evaluating soil erosion showed that seeding provides no additional benefit in reducing erosion relative to unseeded controls. Studies consistently showed that seeding reduced native species cover (62%) and/or suppressed recovery of native plants (60%), although long-term data on these effects are limited. Seeding was effective 3 in reducing non-native species invasions 54% of the time; however, of those treatments, 83% introduced additional negative impacts on native communities by seeding with non-native species. Post-fire seeding is costly and the scientific literature and management documentation show that it does little to protect soil and promote plant recovery in the short-term and may introduce potentially negative effects with long-term ecological consequences. Through a literature search, interviews and site visits, we identified existing native plant markets to use as models to assess the feasibility of a native plant market in the southern Colorado Plateau. We used web-based surveys to identify critical native plant material needs and concerns. Survey results indicate that management policy strongly drives decisions regarding the use and purchase of native plant materials. From a demand perspective, lack of availability and high cost of native plant materials has kept purchasing minimal, despite policy changes favoring the use of natives. For suppliers, further development of native plant materials is limited by inconsistent and unreliable demand and lack of production knowledge. The knowledge and tools necessary to initiate a native plant materials market are available. However, communication among producers, land managers, buyers, and researchers, as well as partnerships with local growers, appear to be vital to initiating a functional market.","","","","https://lens.org/135-039-789-517-65X","","","135-039-789-517-65X","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Natural disasters, especially bushfires, have provided evidence showing that there is a pervasive lack of preparation (King & Goudie 2006; Martins, Nigg, Louis-Charles & Kendra, 2019; McLennan 2014; McLennan et al. 2011; Pinock, 2007; Teague, McLeod & Pascoe 2010) even in communities with previous disaster experience (Mackie, McLennan & Wright 2013; McLennan, Paton & Wright 2015). Agencies and researchers have also reported the struggle to get people motivated to prepare (McLennan, Elliott & Omodei 2012), and to understand what needs to be done as part of that preparation. A number of community engagement programs have been successful and have been estimated to save lives and reduce the cost of property damage and destruction (Gilbert, 2007). At a higher level, community engagement is also considered central to development of community resilience in disaster (Council of Australian Governments 2011). Consultation with agencies regarding this BNHCRC project application revealed gaps in emergency agency community engagement knowledge and practice. Specifically: - Research does not easily translate to practice - Previous research has not suggested ways to adopt the new knowledge - There is little transfer of knowledge between researchers and practitioners - Evaluation has been overlooked in previous research - Evaluation conducted by agencies is not systematic, making benchmarking difficult Therefore, these needs frame both the priority and urgency of this project and the potential to contribute to agency and local council action. Agencies have also articulated community engagement as a priority and, in many states in Australia, are making efforts to systemise community engagement and evaluation of its effect (such as Elsworth et al. 2010; Emergency Management Victoria 2017; Inspector-General of Emergency Management 2014). This project addresses this need by developing an empirical framework - built from a systematic literature review of effective preparedness actions, a systematic literature review of community engagement for preparedness, and a synthesis of agency best practices - that offers a systematic and evidence-based standard for agency implementation for community disaster preparation. The framework, and the associated index of core competencies and relationship indices, could also contribute to informing a more sustainable community engagement policy. This project will consider the more immediate need for community engagement by emergency end-user/agencies for preparedness, which occurs annually, rather than for resilience, which is longer term and involves cross-government involvement including from outside the emergency management sphere.","","","","https://lens.org/144-461-484-481-510","","","144-461-484-481-510","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

There is now broad consensus that exposure to air pollution causes an array of adverse health effects based on evidence from a large scientific literature that has grown exponentially since the mid-1990s.1–4 Air pollution damages most organ systems and is linked to many debilitating diseases, such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, stroke, diabetes, lung cancer, and dementia.5 The Global Burden of Disease study estimated that in 2019 air pollution ranked as the fourth global risk factor for mortality, surpassed only by high blood pressure, tobacco use, and poor diet.6 The European Environment Agency estimated 300,000 premature deaths due to air pollution in the EU-27 in 2020—an unacceptable high air pollution burden.7 Air pollution levels have generally declined over the last several decades in Europe, due largely to successful air quality regulation and subsequent improvements in technology and industry. The current air quality legislation in Europe—the Ambient Air Quality Directive (AAQD) from 2008—set limit values for the annual mean of the air pollutants PM2.5 and NO2 to 25 and 40 µg/m3, respectively.8 These limit values are criticized for being insufficient to protect the health of EU citizens.9,10 The World Health Organization (WHO) released new Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) in September 2021, based on a comprehensive synthesis of the scientific evidence on health effects of air pollution.4 They recommended that annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 should not exceed 5 and 10 μg/m3, respectively, demonstrating that serious health effects occur above these values. The health community supports full alignment of EU legislation with the 2021 WHO AQG, indicated by a joint statement which was endorsed by more than 140 medical, public health, and scientific societies and patient organizations.11 The European Commission (EC) published a proposal to revise the AAQD on October 26, 2022.12 The EC also published an accompanying impact assessment, quantifying the expected air pollution concentrations and resulting health- and implementation costs for various policy options.13 The European Parliament and the Council are currently considering the proposal. The proposal includes important steps to achieve cleaner air but falls short of what is ultimately needed to maximize public health benefits, for the reasons explained below. A clear path toward complete alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG is missing The proposed new annual limit values are 10 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and 20 µg/m3 for NO2 to be met across the EU by 2030. While these proposed limit values are stricter than the current ones, they are still twice as high as the 2021 WHO AQG. Other high-income countries are moving toward more stringent standards. The US Environmental Protection Agency, for example, is considering various alternatives for the current annual PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 12 µg/m3 all the way down to 8 µg/m3.14 The EU may miss the chance to be a role model and a global leader in clean air legislation, if settling for less than full alignment. We call for limit values of 5 and 10 µg/m3 for annual PM2.5 and NO2 by 2030, respectively. The EC proposal fails to outline a clear pathway toward full alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG even after 2030; instead, it proposes a “regular review mechanism to assure that the latest scientific understanding of air quality guides future decisions.” We underscore that the latest scientific understanding supports full alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG. In addition, multiple options for delaying compliance with limit values will lead to a continued unacceptable high air pollution disease burden in Europe. Limit values are needed for ozone The proposal only provides target values and long-term objectives for ozone, instead of legally binding limit values because of the “complex characteristics of its formation in the atmosphere, which complicate the task of assessing the feasibility of complying with strict limit values.” We disagree with this rationale. Ozone is an important air pollutant, with well-established health effects of short-term (“summer smog”) and long-term exposure and therefore commonly used in air pollution burden assessments.15 Ozone levels have decreased much less in the past decades compared to PM2.5 and NO2, and without reduced emissions of precursors, climate change will increase the concentrations of ozone.16 Ozone (as well as other pollutants including PM2.5) also increases the heatwave effect on mortality in Europe.17,18 We further note that the complexities of ozone formation in the atmosphere are present across the world. Other places, including the United States, do have legally binding air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. If the United States can do it, the EU should be able to as well. Limit values are key to ensure enforceability of the AAQD, as clearly documented by the 2019 Fitness Check conducted by the EC.19 We propose the use of binding limit values instead of ineffective target values for ozone, and full alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG, including a long-term (warm season) average of 60 µg/m3. Adverse health effects of air pollution are underestimated The systematic reviews underpinning the 2021 WHO AQG were published in 2020 and included health studies available until September 2018.20,21 The summary estimates from these global systematic reviews are used in the European impact assessment to calculate the air pollution mortality burden to inform the various policy options and the proposal. Notably, three very large general population studies funded by the Health Effects Institute were recently published. Those studies examined millions of study participants in the United States, Canada, and Europe and were specifically designed to examine adverse health effects of long-term exposure to low levels of air pollution.22–24 All three studies documented associations between mortality and PM2.5 concentrations below the current and proposed EU limit values and the US NAAQS. Furthermore, the studies documented either a linear (United States), or a supra-linear (Canada and Europe) exposure-response function between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality (supra-linear means a higher effect per additional exposure at low pollutant concentrations than at high concentrations). The European ELAPSE results are particularly relevant for Europe.24 Hence, the EC conducted additional analyses using ELAPSE to estimate the influence of the choice of the exposure-response function on mortality in the impact assessment, partly in response to our suggestions.25 The attributable mortality estimates were 40% higher for PM2.5 and more than double for NO2 using the ELAPSE exposure-response function compared with the estimates from the WHO systematic reviews, all other things kept equal.13 Furthermore, only a limited set of morbidity outcomes were included in the impact assessment, and for PM2.5 only. Hence, we conclude that the EC impact assessment substantially underestimates the burden of disease due to air pollution. This is especially concerning, as the choice of policy options and the proposed new limit values depended on the net benefit of mitigation actions (benefits from health gains versus costs for implementation of measures). Many potential policy options and actions are missing from the feasibility scenario The maximum technically feasible reduction scenario for projecting future air pollution concentrations considers all available technical measures, irrespective of costs. This assessment shows that, by the year 2030, reaching air pollutant concentration levels that fully align with the 2021 WHO AQG may not be possible for large parts of sampling points in the EU (71% for PM2.5).13 We note, however, that feasibility is very much related to political will. While technical measures play an important role, other potential realistic abatement options are largely ignored. These include, for example, low or zero emission zones, low-traffic neighborhoods, improving public transportation, promoting active transportation, and incentivizing healthy dietary choices through political action at the production, transport and consumer level. Moreover, accelerated shifts to cleaner fuels and electrification, effective local measures such as coal and biomass combustion bans, and other local or national measures are missing from the feasibility scenario. The EC conducted a conservative impact assessment that underestimates the health benefits, and one that is based on an incomplete picture of what is possible, leading to a rather unambitious proposal. Despite these shortcomings, the main message of the impact assessment is clear: the health benefits outweigh by far (a factor 6–18) the implementation costs of air quality actions with the largest net benefit (EUR 38 billion) for the policy option of complete alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG by 2030.13 More effort needed to decrease inequalities in health burdens from air pollution Although air pollution affects all people, certain groups are especially vulnerable and more likely to experience adverse health effects, including pregnant women, children, elderly, chronic disease patients, and those with lower socioeconomic status.26 Furthermore, marginalized groups are more likely to live in air pollution hotspot areas, resulting in environmental injustice and additional health disparities.27,28 The United States has begun to address the challenges of addressing air pollution-health inequalities through the NAAQS process, where they required additional monitors to be placed in marginalized communities.14 We urge the EC to put more emphasis on considering inequalities and recommend using monitoring or modeling to assess whether disparities in exposure are reduced in the future. We note that the current proposed complementary average exposure reduction obligations for long-term PM2.5 and NO2 will not adequately protect marginalized groups because only urban background monitors are proposed for the calculations. Furthermore, the average exposure is calculated at the regional level (NUTS1 areas), which is too coarse to pick up relevant exposure disparities. We propose that the average exposure reduction obligations should be population-weighted and include hotspot monitor data (e.g., busy roads), ideally augmented with additional monitors to be placed specifically in hotspot areas and in marginalized communities. We recommend using smaller geographical areas (e.g., NUTS2) with clear assignments as to which authorities are responsible for meeting the average exposure reduction obligations, and we emphasize that those obligations should only be complementary to limit values. Be wary of the deduction of “natural” source contributions Similar to the current AAQD, the proposal allows for deductions of “natural” source contributions to exceedances of limit values or exposure reduction obligations. This includes deductions due to wildfires and long-range transported particles from sand and dust storms. Scientific evidence demonstrates that air pollution from those “natural” sources is also harmful to human health, and the vast majority of the health studies underpinning the 2021 WHO AQG do not distinguish between air pollution from “natural” sources versus anthropogenic sources.4,29,30 Furthermore, the contribution of “natural” sources is expected to increase due to climate change. We propose to limit the possibility of deduction of “natural” sources. Conclusions We call for more ambition and a clear path in the AAQD toward complete alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG for PM2.5, NO2 and ozone by 2030. Specifically, we call for limit values of 5 and 10 µg/m3 for annual PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, with the addition of a limit value of 60 µg/m3 for long-term (warm season) ozone. More effort is needed to decrease inequalities in health burdens from air pollution since the current proposed average exposure reduction obligations will not adequately protect marginalized communities. We further caution to be wary of delays in complying with limit values and of the deduction of “natural” source contributions, which are only expected to increase due to climate change. The robust and stronger associations with mortality and morbidity at very low levels of air pollution underscore the large untapped potential for additional health benefits in Europe and should provide impetus for the European Commission, European Parliament, and the Council to be bold in its ambitions. Moreover, we encourage governments, local authorities and other bodies to continue to exert effort to improve air quality, even if the current and proposed EU limit values have been met.

Environmentally responsible practices in perioperative services should align with the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) #3 Good Health and Well-Being; #6 Clean Water and Sanitation; #7 Affordable and Clean Energy; #9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; #11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; #12 Responsible Consumption and Production; and #13 Climate Action7-9 and be consistent with action to combat climate change and its effects. Education for health care professionals on environmental sustainability should include ○ general knowledge about the climate crisis effects on population health, including10, 11 ▪ air pollution, ▪ exposure to toxins, ▪ heat-related illnesses,10, 11 ▪ extreme weather events,10, 11 ▪ physical and mental health effects of natural disasters,12 ▪ need for reliable access to clean food and water, and ▪ modification of vector-borne, zoonotic, and waterborne diseases13; disaster preparedness10; health system infrastructure resilience14-17; supply chain engagement18; financial, social, and environmental benefits of environmental best practices19; and real-world examples of environmental best practices in health care services. Environmentally responsible decision-making in health care delivery should align with local, state and federal regulations and support patient safety and optimal clinical outcomes. AORN endorses the ANA's Principles of Environmental Health for Nursing Practice with Implementation Strategies4 and the International Council of Nurses Code of Ethics for Nurses,6 which states, “The nurse practices to sustain and protect the natural environment and is aware of its consequences on health.”6(p4) AORN supports environmental responsibility in the perioperative setting and provides guidance for incorporation of environmentally responsible practices, where applicable, in the AORN Guidelines for Perioperative Practice.20-22 ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PRACTICES Environmentally responsible practices must adhere to local, state, and federal regulations and should align with guidelines and priorities from professional organizations. Environmental best practices can be implemented in perioperative settings through perioperative team education, interdisciplinary collaboration, and advocacy. Conserve natural resources by using life-cycle assessment (LCA) data when evaluating products for purchase and use13, 23, 24; selecting reusable equipment, supplies, and materials when they are equivalent in performance and safety; reprocessing equipment, supplies, and materials; advocating for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification,25 Green Globes certification, WELL building certification, or other green building codes during facility construction and renovation; considering telehealth/telemedicine23 for preoperative and preanesthesia visits when no other testing is needed, to reduce unnecessary patient travel; establishing diversified facility energy portfolios that prioritize renewable energy sources23; installing motion-activated fixtures on lighting systems; replacing incandescent light fixtures with energy-efficient light bulbs and lamps; implementing procedures to power down lights, equipment including sterilizers,21 and computers when they are not in use; programming heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and evacuation systems to save energy when ORs are unoccupied; and acquiring and retrofitting energy and water-efficient durable medical equipment and supplies (eg, washers, sterilizers, LED light sources). Reduce waste by adopting environmentally preferable purchasing policies and practices; using LCA data when evaluating products for purchase and use13, 23, 24; opening only necessary sterile supplies, medical devices, medications, and implants upon surgeon confirmation; regularly reviewing procedural packs, instrument sets, and preference cards to remove unused items that result in waste26; avoiding supply overages by reducing supply purchases and maintaining an accurate inventory to reduce the number of expired supplies; avoiding supply shortages that require extra or expedited supply shipments; installing closed fluid management systems with reusable canisters that eliminate unnecessary exposure to bloodborne pathogens and chemical solidifiers and reduce regulated medical waste; selecting environmentally preferable reusable products, supplies, instrumentation, materials and equipment that meet environmental criteria over other options when they are equivalent in performance27, 28; reprocessing single-use devices29, 30 according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines31; refurbishing instruments and equipment with proactive maintenance and repairs; donating expired or obsolete, clean, unused materials and equipment to those in need; standardizing appropriate waste receptacle placement and sizing; recycling and exploring revenue potential32 for clean, noninfectious quality material (eg, medical plastics, packaging material, paper); and educating personnel about properly segregating waste (ie, landfill waste, recycling, regulated medical waste). Reduce hazardous material exposure by participating in procurement of supplies, furnishings, and equipment that do not contain ○ mercury, lead, cadmium or heavy metal toxicants; and ○ chemicals of concern,28, 33 such as ▪ di[2-ethylhexyl]phthalate [DEHP] and polyvinylchloride [PVC]), which may be found in some enteral nutrition products and tubes, general urological supplies, gloves, parenteral infusion devices and sets, respiratory therapy products, and vascular catheters; ▪ triclosan/triclocarban, which may be found in some hand soaps and sanitizers; and ▪ flame retardants, per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances,34 and volatile organic compounds, which may be found in furnishings and building interiors; selecting surgical instruments and other medical devices that can be sterilized using the least-toxic methods; purchasing and using the least-toxic cleaning agents, sterilization and disinfection processes, and equipment21, 35; implementing surgical smoke evacuation (ie, plume from electrosurgical units, lasers, and powered equipment)36; providing education on the global warming potential (GWP) of anesthetic gases and referring anesthesia professionals to the American Society of Anesthesiologists37, 38 and American Association of Nurse Anesthetists39 recommendations for environmental practices in the perioperative environment; evaluating anesthesia equipment for energy efficiency, fresh gas flow alerts, and sequestration of waste anesthesia gases to prevent their release to outside air; complying with local, state, and federal regulations; manufacturers’ instructions; and health care organization policy when disposing of pharmaceuticals20; using reusable batteries where approved by biomedical engineering personnel and complying with safe disposal or recycling practices for batteries; and ensuring electronic equipment (eg, monitors) and related supplies (eg, printer ink and cartridges) are energy-efficient and managed in an environmentally responsible and regulatory-compliant manner or are recycled at end-of-life. RATIONALE Climate change has been called the “greatest global health threat”40 and addressing climate change the “greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century.”41 The health care sector plays a significant role in the global climate crisis in the following ways: The health care industry's climate footprint represents 4.4% of global net emissions.42 Of health care's global climate footprint, supply chain comprises 71%.42 The US health care sector's climate footprint is equivalent to 9.8% of US net emissions and contributes to ○ acid rain (12%), ○ smog (10%), ○ air pollutants (9%), ○ stratospheric ozone depletion (1%), and ○ carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic air toxins (1%-2%).43 Perioperative practice settings ○ generate up to 70% of a facility's total waste44-46 and ○ consume three to six times more energy per square foot than the rest of the hospital.29 Supply costs can comprise up to 56% of the total OR budget.47 Anesthesia gases comprise more than 51% of the surgical procedure footprint29 and represent 5% of a facility's greenhouse gas emissions.48 The health effects of the US health care industry's greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be equivalent to 470,000 years of healthy life lost (disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) from pollution-related disease and malnutrition.43, 49 Many multidisciplinary studies exist regarding the health effects of climate change,17, 29, 49-56 as well as the economic and health co-benefits of mitigation, adaptation, and resilience.32, 54, 57 A survey of physicians in obstetrics and gynecology found that physicians were more likely than the general public (84% versus 54%) to believe that global warming is real, that portrayal in the media of its seriousness is accurate, and that it is generated by human activities.58 Two-thirds of the surveyed physicians believe the amount of surgical waste generated in the operating room is excessive and increasing,58 and the majority (95%) of the physicians supported efforts to reduce waste by opting for the use of reusable surgical tools, instruments, and equipment over disposable items where clinically equivalent.58 However, barriers to environmentally responsible practices exist and include a lack of knowledge of appropriate waste segregation practices,57 lack of leadership buy-in,59 and overall resistance to change.60 It is important, however, to balance environmental impact with patient safety concerns. For example, the FDA recommends that health care organizations use duodenoscopes with disposable components or those that are fully disposable because of documented cleaning and disinfection failures that have resulted in patient harm.61 Research on LCA of materials used in the OR demonstrates that single-use devices; anesthesia gas; and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning24 are the top emission sources in the OR. To reduce the environmental emissions of surgeries, health care providers can adopt a combination of collaborative approaches, including minimizing materials, moving away from anesthetic gases with high GWP, maximizing instrument and equipment reuse, and reducing energy use when operating rooms are unoccupied.30 One study found cost feedback to physicians, combined with a small departmental financial incentive, was associated with significantly reduced surgical supply costs without negatively affecting patient outcomes.19 In addition to supporting public health and well-being, adopting best environmental practices also can deliver triple bottom line returns,62 which reduce costs,18 optimize operational efficiency, and enhance patient and worker safety.35 The health care industry, whose mission is to protect and promote health, contributes to the climate crisis—the greatest health threat of the 21st century.41 Perioperative services contribute significantly to the health care climate footprint. Nurses, the largest group of health care professionals63 and the most trusted of health care professionals,64 have an opportunity to fulfill their ethical responsibility and help lead the way toward a healthier future for all.

This favours shade-tolerant species and outcompete deciduous pioneer species. The latter can be seen as key species in boreal forests and contribute greatly to the forests’ biodiversity. Prescribed fire is considered to serve as a management tool to mimic natural disturbance and enhance the regeneration of deciduous trees. However, the effectiveness of prescribed fires has hardly been evaluated in this regard. A systematic review (SR) was conducted in order to find evidence for the effects of fire on deciduous tree regeneration. A protocol defining all steps, from the search string and the inclusion criteria to the data synthesis in a meta-analysis, was developed. A total of 2135 articles have been consecutively screened on title, abstract and based on the full-text. Data of 37 articles that have passed the screening on full-text have been entered in a systematic map. Seventeen articles were analysed in a meta-analysis. Effect sizes (Hedges g) were calculated for each study and their heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q) was evaluated in several moderator- analyses. Most of the included studies were conducted in North America, investigating post-fire regeneration of either oak (Quercus spp.) or aspen (Populus spp.) forests. Eurasian studies are clearly underrepresented. The study revealed higher response effects of aspen and birch (Betula spp.) and a smaller but still significant effect for oak and hickory (Carya spp.). The combination of fire with a thinning-treatment showed the highest effects and was significant for aspen and birches in comparison to non-fire comparators. However, there was no evidence found that the fire effect is enduring over longer time periods or that fire actually could ensure the long term persistence of aspen in the forest.

First responders are often called to respond to situations that are high risk, traumatic and complex; these situations have the potential to endanger the personal safety of the responder and impact their mental health (Jones et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). Situations first responders are often called to can include unpredictable, violent or complex situations, situations involving biohazardous agents or contagions, responding to large scale disasters and unstable environments (e.g. hurricanes, bush fires, floods), responding to life-threatening situations, accidents involving deaths and situations that are traumatic, emotional and involve human suffering (Jones et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). It is known that health workers can experience intense emotions and ongoing distress in the aftermath of such events (Buhlmann et al., 2022). Reports have recently highlighted mental health and suicide risk of first responders (Lee et al., 2022; Szeto et al., 2019), with prevalence rates reportedly much higher compared to the general population (Jones, 2017; Szeto et al., 2019). Prevalence rates of post traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) vary with rates reported between 10% and 23.2% (Petrie et al., 2018; Szeto et al., 2019), and other mental health illnesses (depression and anxiety) reported between 16.6% and 44.5% (Roberts et al., 2021; Szeto et al., 2019). A systematic review of mental health and PTSD illness in paramedics by Petrie et al. (2018) reported PTSD as the most common disorder with average prevalence rates across included studies reported as 11% for PTSD, 27% psychological distress and 15% for both anxiety and depression. Research on the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of first responders in a rural population (along with community nurses and child protection workers) reported a 16.6% score of depression (moderate or severe), a 17.1% score for anxiety (moderate or severe), with 27.4% considering leaving their profession (Roberts et al., 2021). Roberts et al. (2021) also reported three specific domains that impact stress and well-being in workforce staff: individual factors, the nature of the work and the organization. Individual factors include previous experience with trauma, resilience skills, personality and family support (Roberts et al., 2021). The nature of the work includes day-to-day tasks such as responding to complex violent situations, traumatic events, callouts during pandemics and large-scale disasters, and dangerous violent situation that place first responder's safety at risk (Gray & Collie, 2017 Jones et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022), shift work, unpredictable hours and fatigue, all of which increase the risk of developing a mental illness and PTSD (Petrie et al., 2018). Workplace violence is a significant contributor to mental illness and PTSD for first responders. The unpredictable nature of the work of first responders means that they work in an environment where safety is uncertain, and every incident can present a threat to the safety of attending personnel. Rates of violence towards first responders varies, with between 57% and 93% of first responders reportedly experiencing physical and/or verbal violence throughout their career (Murray et al., 2020). A study conducted by Jones et al. (2022) explored paramedic and police experiences responding to methamphetamine related violence in Australia. In that study, first responders describe how they often feared for their safety and that of their co-workers, discussed how violent situations often escalated rapidly requiring vigilance and outlined how responding to patients under the influence of drugs or experiencing excited delirium increased the risk to personal safety (Jones et al., 2022). Incidence of violence reported by first responders included, verbal abuse, physical violence (with and without a weapon), sexual harassment and sexual assault, intimidation (e.g. direct and indirect threats) and property damage or theft (Jones et al., 2022; Murray et al., 2020). Physical violence or acts of violence included stabbing, shooting, punching, spitting, slapping, scratching and biting (Murray et al., 2020). The injuries sustained from violence ranged from minor injuries (facial injuries, fractures, sprains, contusions, abrasions, lacerations and dislocations) to fatalities (Murray et al., 2020). Perpetrators of violence included patients, patients' family members and bystanders (Murray et al., 2020). Dangerous situations involving violence can be traumatic resulting in psychological and emotional distress (Jones et al., 2022), and increased severity of the traumatic events are linked to increased rates of PTSD (Jones, 2017). Additionally, repeated exposure to traumatic events (medical and/or violence related) also increased the likelihood of developing PTSD (Petrie et al., 2018). First responders in rural and remote areas are likely to have different safety concerns, increased mental health impacts and may require different support needs compared to their metro counterparts. Rural and remote areas usually have limited resources, facilities and staffing which reportedly increases the safety risk to first responders (Jones et al., 2023). Additionally, reduced staffing levels and a lack of specialized staff (e.g. intensive care paramedics) impacts how first responders manage dangerous and violent situations (Jones et al., 2023), and exacerbates workloads (Roberts et al., 2021) increasing the impact on first responder's safety and their mental health (Roberts et al., 2021). Excessive workloads can result in staff burnout (Roberts et al., 2021), burn out and workloads effects staff retention, and staff retention potentially impacts workload, safety and mental health of first responders working in rural and remote areas. While there is a growing body of evidence reporting on mental health and safety of first responders, there is a lack of evidence available related to rural and remote first responders. More research in this area could help to highlight the specific needs and requirements of first responders working in rural and remote areas, improve resource allocation and staff retention. There has been a significant increase in the recognition of mental health issues with first responders and an increase in initiatives to manage their mental health (Petrie et al., 2018), to help counteract the day-to-day safety risks of being a first responder. Current initiatives include mental health screening, education, well-being checks and post-incident support/debriefing (Petrie et al., 2018). However, there are barriers to reporting mental illness (Jones, 2017) and more is needed with a focus on rural and remote first responders' mental health to make a significant change. First responders working in rural and remote areas may also be affected by limited resources including reduced staff and facilities available to respond to violent situations and to manage first responder mental health concerns once they arise. Jones (2017) suggests first responders may require regular mental health evaluation including a clinical interview and highlights the importance of using appropriate assessment measures to determine mental health impacts. Additionally, the effectiveness of post-incident debriefing is in question with literature demonstrating these sessions can actually increase PTSD in some cases (Jones, 2017). To combat workforce shortages, reduce safety risk to first responders and improve mental health support, more research on rural and remote first responders is needed focusing on mental health concerns, workloads and safety risk. Researchers need to consider methodological approaches that gather lived experience of rural and remote first responders and undertake strategic review of mental health strategies (including post-incident debriefing and clinical interviewing for identifying mental health issues) and services available in rural and remote settings to determine effectiveness for this cohort of population. Additionally, as mental health is a major concern for first responders, undergraduate training and continually professional development training needs to include preventative mental health and resilience education.

Increased anthropogenic activity, including deforestation, urbanisation, modern agricultural and animal breeding practices, overuse of fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotic, production of synthetic chemicals and plastics, and the use of fossil fuels and biomass for energy, have altered the Earth's environment.1, 2 More than 350,000 chemicals have been introduced to human lives without any concern on their health impacts and more than 120,000 of them have been even inappropriately reported.3 99% of the global population breathe polluted air that exceeds the guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Globally, 7.8% of all deaths in 2019 were attributed to outdoor air pollution, with this fraction exceeding 12% in some countries. In 2019, there were 455,000 reported deaths attributed to asthma, predominantly occurring in low- and middle-income countries due to the difficulties associated with under-diagnosis and under-treatment. These countries also have a high prevalence of exposure to outdoor and indoor pollutants, including active or passive tobacco smoke.4-6 Asthma development and evolution follow a complex interplay between the individual genetic background and environmental exposures, such as indoor and outdoor air pollutants, infectious agents, allergens, irritants, or occupational factors.7-9 As physicians and scientists, we have seen first-hand how increasing outdoor and indoor air pollution impacts respiratory health, tried to understand the molecular changes driving the environmental-driven asthma symptoms and have used this knowledge to treat patients with asthma. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is the world leader in allergy and asthma science and education. The key opinion leaders of the environmental health world gathered around the EAACI initiative to evaluate the impact of outdoor and indoor pollution on patients with asthma and to provide recommendations for prevention, patient care and mitigation of the impact of short-term exposure to outdoor and indoor pollutants, including environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and active smoking on asthma-related outcomes. The impact of extreme temperatures was also evaluated (Figure 1). Several systematic reviews (SR) were conducted.10-12 Multiple studies have shown an association between outdoor air pollutants and poor early life lung growth, development of allergic sensitization, acutely impaired lung function, respiratory tract infections, and numerous asthma-related outcomes, such as new-onset asthma, asthma exacerbations and deterioration of asthma control, lung function decline, increased use of asthma medication and of healthcare resources, including visits to emergency department and hospital admissions. However, epidemiological studies have often yielded inconsistent findings, and not all studies have found significant associations,13 which may be related to both variations in statistical, measurement, and modelling methodologies between studies as well as differences between countries and/or regions in the concentrations and composition of outdoor air pollution. The recent SR published by EAACI showed that following short-term exposure to outdoor pollutants referenced by the current WHO Air Quality Guideline as single or mixed pollutants (particulate matter [PM] 2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO, and heavy traffic) there is an increase in the risk of asthma-related adverse outcomes, especially for hospital admissions and emergency department visits.10 Unfortunately, there was low to very low certainty evidence that interventions aiming to reduce the level of outdoor pollutants may decrease asthma exacerbations. A large-scale human biomonitoring survey conducted in Europe between 2014 and 2021 identified at least 46 pesticides and their metabolites in adults and children across five European countries, with at least two pesticides detected in 84% of the samples collected. Exposure to outdoor pesticides such as fumigants may increase the risk of new-onset asthma in agricultural workers, while exposure to 1,3-dichloropropene may increase the risk of asthma-related emergency department visits.10 It has to be noted here that the focus of these EAACI guidelines was asthma-related outcomes and multiple effects of pesticides and pollution on other diseases remain to be further analysed. Global temperatures and the frequency and severity of climate change events such as heatwaves, cold spells, accompanied by wildfires, sand and dust storms, and thunderstorms have all increased over recent decades.1, 13 As per the SR conducted, heatwaves and cold spells may increase the likelihood of asthma-related emergency visits and hospital admissions, potentially contributing to higher asthma mortality rates.10 Among the environmental conditions, indoor factors are of particular interest because globally people spend more than 80% of their time indoors. Health effects following exposure to indoor air pollutants may be experienced immediately after exposure or years later. There is a clear impact of indoor air pollutants on the risk of new-onset asthma and numerous asthma-related outcomes, such as exacerbations and deterioration of asthma control, lung function decline, increased use of asthma medication and healthcare resources, including visits to emergency department and hospital admissions, and increased mortality. Ninety-four studies were included in the SRs evaluating the impact of indoor pollutants: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), cleaning agents, damp/mould and indoor pesticides. There is moderate certainty evidence that exposure to damp/mould increases the risk of new-onset wheeze.11 Exposure to cleaning agents may be associated with a higher risk of new-onset asthma and with asthma severity, while exposure to pesticides and VOCs may increase the risk of new-onset asthma.10 As the level of certainty is low or very low for most of the available evidence on the impact of indoor pollutants on asthma-related outcomes more rigorous research in the field is warranted. Tobacco consumption is the single largest avoidable health risk, and the most relevant cause of premature death in the European Union (EU), responsible for nearly 700,000 deaths every year. Around 50% of smokers die on average 14 years earlier. Despite considerable progress made in recent years with the tobacco-banning policies, the number of smokers in the EU is still high: 26% of the overall population and 29% of young Europeans aged 15–24 smoke.4-6 It has become evident that a considerable part of the increase in asthma prevalence worldwide is due to maternal smoking in pregnancy or due to early-life exposure of children to ETS acting through epigenetic transgenerational effects.14-17 The recently published SR of 67 longitudinal studies proved with moderate certainty evidence that prenatal ETS increases the risk of recurrent wheeze and may increase the risk of new-onset asthma and low lung function.12 Postnatal ETS increases the risk of new-onset asthma and recurrent wheezing and may impact lung function. Another SR of 24 longitudinal studies showed that ETS increases the risk of severe asthma exacerbations and impairs asthma control and lung function.12 Active smoking increases the risk of severe asthma exacerbations and suboptimal asthma control and may impact asthma-related quality-of-life and lung function.12 There is no high-quality evidence from the SRs on the causal relationship between exposure to pollutants and adverse asthma-related outcomes. This calls for better quality research to explore the causal association within the frame of unbiased exposomic research.2, 9, 18, 19 Increasing the quality of the evidence should involve the implementation of standardized methods for assessing and documenting both short- and long-term exposure, while distinguishing between household, occupational or environmental sources of pollutants. Nevertheless, this extensive research evidence indicates the need to avoid being exposed to severely polluted environments and to be prepared for any asthma unfavourable outcome in settings with heavy pollution. To support the healthcare professional caring for patients with asthma, EAACI prepared a Guideline on the impact of outdoor pollution exposure on asthma-related outcomes using the GRADE approach.20 Recommendations are provided in a framework supporting rational decisions for healthcare professionals and patients to individualize and improve asthma management and for policymakers and regulators as an evidence-informed reference to help setting legally binding standards and goals for outdoor air quality at international, national, and local levels. For clinicians, this evidence guides their asthma management strategies toward achieving optimal asthma control. It involves assessing exposure risks and impacts, customizing interventions based on the type of pollutant and considering co-exposures. Shared decision-making with the patient helps select the most suitable interventions. A personalized approach is also suggested when advising asthma patients about occupational exposure risks. Collaborating with patient representatives for raising awareness, educating, and advising patients—especially those belonging to the most susceptible and vulnerable groups—is also strongly recommended. Smart home or workplace-based asthma services that reduce or eliminate environmental asthma triggers, ingenious urban planning, green technology, and e-mobility incentives are all excellent tools to achieve optimal air quality. The current EAACI guidelines for asthma management are expected to significantly improve the efforts of healthcare professionals towards better asthma care. By offering patient-tailored solutions, these guidelines aim to enhance asthma-related outcomes. Multilevel, multi-sectoral adaptation, and mitigation actions are vital to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and provide safe housing. National, regional and international asthma programs should develop a strategic plan to document the outdoor and indoor pollution, implement adaptation and mitigation strategies and assess improvements. These programs must prioritize addressing environmentally-triggered asthma in underserved and disproportionately affected populations within their strategic plans and activities. Additionally, healthcare education programs at all levels should incorporate environmental health strategies. None. None. The authors declare no conflict of interest related to this manuscript.

This chapter provides a conceptual framework and vocabulary related to characterizing human exposures to smoke, focusing on inhalation exposure at individual and population levels. We briefly describe fundamental concepts of exposure assessment relevant to air pollution from biomass burning. Studying exposure requires knowledge of both the receptors (e.g., how the stressor acts on the human body, relevant periods of susceptibility) and the ways in which the stressor presents at this interface (e.g., fate and transport of chemical agents, social patterns that affect exposures and access to mitigation, time and activity patterns). We present considerations for quantifying exposure to air pollution, specifically for developing geospatial assessments of exposure, the types of exposure metrics, and associated reporting error and uncertainty. An area of active research is to what extent PM 2.5 exposure from smoke is associated with various types of health outcomes as compared with fossil fuel combustion emissions and all other sources and if similar populations are susceptible. Finally, we discuss research needs for quantifying exposure to fire pollution. REFERENCES Abdo , M. , Ward , I. , O'Dell , K. , Ford , B. , Pierce , J. R. , Fischer , E. V. , et al. ( 2019 ).

However, forest fires are still a major challenge for society, placing firefighters with greater occupational exposure. The present study has as main objective to carry out a systematic review of the literature on the main techniques and variables for assessing the occupational exposure of firefighters, during the fight against forest fires.Methodology: The systematic review utilised The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: The PRISMA Statementmethodology. This methodology was applied in the Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed and Academic Search Complete databases with different keywords. The review will include articles written in English only. Results: In the present study, 34 articles were included, in which it was found that exposure to smoking is the most studied variable, and it was in 2019 that a greater evolution of studies in this area of research was observed. Regarding the variables, the studies were organised in groups. Here it is possible to check the different variables selected by the authors and the methods and equipment applied.Discussion: The fact that firefighters carry out their tasks in diverse scenarios and extreme conditions has hindered the application of innovative equipment. It is necessary to combine different variables and equipment for the assessment of occupational exposure. However, it is not always possible to develop this type of equipment in order to be inserted from the user's perspective, from the perspective of the environment, where it will be applied, and from an economic perspective, making it difficult to effectively apply it in the field. Conclusion: As future perspectives, it is recommended that new variables are introduced together, in order to improve the assessment of occupational exposure, namely, through the use of carbon monoxide (CO) and lactate assessment.</jats:p>","10.24840/978-972-752-279-8_0021-0030","","","https://lens.org/156-522-544-668-312","","","156-522-544-668-312","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

This chapter will provide a background of toxicology and apply principal concepts such as dose, duration, and frequency to help define the potential effects of smoke exposure. Characteristics that influence toxicity will be discussed, which include particle size, source, temperature, and the mixture of chemical constituents. An overview of the routes of exposure, mechanisms of action, toxicokinetics, and the role of the immune system will all be covered. The importance and mutual benefits of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies will be discussed. Finally, the chapter concludes by outlining knowledge gaps and research needs.

Standards and guidelines may greatly help the activities of planning, prevention and protection against wildfires. Some countries/States/local communities can already rely on existing standards and guidelines, while other areas, even if potentially subject to wildfires, not. This work presents a systematic review of standards and guidelines belonging to selected countries/States/local communities in the Western world, namely: North American countries (USA, Canada), European countries (France, Italy), Oceanic countries (Australia, New Zealand), and trans-national codes. The main information reviewed includes: hazard definition and severity classes, land factors (vegetation, defensible space and topographic factors), building materials and construction requirements, utilities (resources, firefighters, planning, outreach), fire protection measures, environmental factors (weather, fire history), and access requirements. A comparative analysis regarding the main similarities/differences between all the considered standards and guidelines was performed after the review process. This comparative analysis may be useful for the further development and/or revision of (novel) standards/guidelines for planning, preventing and protecting against fires in WUI areas.","","","3213","https://lens.org/160-000-101-068-015","","","160-000-101-068-015","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","","3213"

These sagebrush rangelands comprise a unique biome spanning 11 states, support over 350 wildlife species, and provide important ecosystem services that include stabilizing the economies of western communities. Impacts to sagebrush ecosystem processes over large areas due to the annual grass-wildfire cycle necessitated the development of a coordinated, science-based strategy for improving efforts to achieve long-term protection, conservation, and restoration of sagebrush rangelands, which was framed in 2015 under the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy (IRFMS). Central to this effort was the development of an Actionable Science Plan (Plan) that identified 37 priority science needs (Needs) for informing the actions proposed under the 5 topics (Fire, Invasives, Restoration, Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse, Climate and Weather) that were part of the collective focus of the IRFMS. Notable keys to this effort were identification of the Needs co-produced by managers and researchers, and a focus on resulting science being “actionable.”Substantial investments aimed at fulfilling the Needs identified in the Plan have been made since its release in 2016. While the state of the science has advanced considerably, the extent to which knowledge gaps remain relative to identified Needs is relatively unknown. Moreover, new Needs have likely emerged since the original strategy as results from actionable science reveal new questions and possible (yet untested) solutions. A quantifiable assessment of the progress made on the original science Needs can identify unresolved gaps and new information that can help inform prioritization of future research efforts.This report details a systematic literature review that evaluated how well peer-reviewed journal articles and formal technical reports published between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, addressed six needs (hereinafter “Needs”) identified under the Invasives topic in the Plan. The topic outlined research Needs related to the control of invasive plant species in sagebrush rangelands, with a special emphasis on invasive annual grasses. We established the level of progress towards addressing each Need following a standardized set of criteria, and developed summaries detailing how research objectives nested within Needs identified in the Plan (“Next Steps”) were either addressed well, partially addressed, or remain outstanding (that is, addressed poorly) in the literature through 2020. Our searches resulted in the inclusion of 198 science products that at least partially addressed a Need identified in the Invasives topic. The Needs that were well and partially addressed included:studies of natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the distribution and spread;methods of preventing, eradicating and controlling invasive plant species;development of mapping techniques that provide regularly updated annual grass and fine fuel projections; andassessment of the efficacy of potential cheatgrass biocontrol agents.Needs that were addressed poorly included (1) investigations of livestock grazing as a tool for managing invasive plants and (2) investigations of cheatgrass die-offs and identification and subsequent study of potential biocontrol agents associated with those die-offs. The information provided in this assessment will assist updating the Plan along with other science strategies.","10.3133/ofr20231003","","","https://lens.org/165-385-973-451-240","","23311258","165-385-973-451-240","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","23311258","",""

The G20-T20India-Task Force-3 (TF-3) on LiFE, Resilience and Values for Wellbeing has addressed and developed policy briefs and statements/recommendations addressing the climate crisis with the One Health approach among other aspects of climate adaptation.1 The G20-T20India-TF3 has addressed sustainable consumption and production within the framework of circular economy and decarbonization of individual lifestyles, urban and rural infrastructure development, rural–urban balance, and nurturing traditional values and ethics. Implementation of the G20-T20India recommendations and monitoring of its progress is crucial to achieving the goals set forward. G20 India: The 18th G20 Heads of State and Government Summit in New Delhi will take place on 9–10 September 2023. There will be a culmination of all the G20 processes and meetings held throughout the year among ministers, senior officials, and civil societies. Think20 (T20): is an official Engagement Group of the G20. It serves as an “idea bank” for the G20 by bringing together think tanks and high-level experts to discuss policy issues relevant to the G20. Task Force (TF)-3: LiFE, Resilience, and Values for Wellbeing is introduced by Prime Minister Modi at COP26, “Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE)” aims to entail a change in individual and societal behavior with respect to sustainable consumption and production. The taskforce emphasizes the need to create a mass movement for sustainable consumption, in which every citizen and stakeholder contributes to the green transition effort. It explores ways to ensure that capital and capacity is available to develop a disaster resilient infrastructure in island nations, developing countries, and for developing future cities and habitats. The prevalence of allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergies, and others has reached epidemic proportions and is a major global health concern. This steep increase suggests that environmental factors are taking a toll on our immune system.2-4 Epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated the relationship between various environmental factors and climate change on allergic diseases.5-7 Early reports from the 1960s and follow up studies indicated a starting timepoint for increasing prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis in children.3, 4, 8-14 After the 2000s, a new wave of epidemics emerged starting from USA and influencing the western world, including food allergy and anaphylaxis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and drug-induced anaphylaxis.15-17 Similar to allergic diseases, the increase in autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and celiac disease, began in the 1960s, and this trend continues today in developing countries.4, 18-22 Environmental factors such as climate change including global warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases from human activities, air pollution and reduced biodiversity are major threats to human health with detrimental effects on a variety of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)/lifestyle diseases including allergic diseases, which is the most prevalent of NCDs.6, 7 During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reduced pollution from vehicle exhaust, albeit increased waste pollution from personal protective equipment.23 Climate change and global warming have contributed to rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, precipitation changes, wildfires, and desertification. These climate changes diminish the crop yields and reduce the nutritional value of the crop, thereby having a devastating toll on food security and causing, among others, zinc, iron, and protein deficiencies in the populations affected. The high atmospheric CO2 levels promote the growth of allergenic pollen like ragweed.24 Vulnerable and underserved populations such as children, pregnant women, individuals with comorbidities, the elderly, and indigenous people are particularly susceptible to diseases brought about by climate change. The term “exposome” refers to all environmental factors individuals encounter throughout their lifetime,25-28 which can be categorized into three groups: the general external environment, the specific external environment, and the host-dependent internal environment. The general external environment includes factors such as climate, urban–rural settings, and education level, while the specific external environment comprises individual factors such as lifestyle choices, exposure to pollutants, and infectious diseases. The host-dependent internal environment encompasses both the biological effects of external exposure and biological responses, such as metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The Epithelial Barrier Theory is a comprehensive explanation for the global, epidemic-level rise in chronic health conditions over the past 65 years. The theory proposes that industrialization and modernization have detrimentally impacted the human exposome enabling contact with toxic substances that disrupt the epithelial barriers of the skin, upper and lower airways, and gut mucosa. This disrupture and entrance of detrimental substances to subepithelial areas triggered microbial dysbiosis and an inflammatory immune response that can initiate or aggravate many chronic inflammatory diseases (Figure 1).2, 29, 30 The surface of our skin, respiratory tract, and gut are all lined with protective cellular layers known as epithelial barriers. Intact epithelial barriers are crucial for homeostasis, as they protect host tissues from infections, environmental toxins, pollutants, and allergens.31, 32 A recent meta-analysis of 22 chemical inventories from 19 countries revealed that more than 350,000 new substances have been introduced to human lives since the 1960s, with little control over their toxicity.33 Consequently, our human body is continuously exposed to a variety of potentially harmful substances, including particulate matter, diesel exhaust particles, cigarette smoke, nano- and microplastics, nanoparticles, ozone, NO, NO2, CO, SO2, toxic doses of surfactant containing household cleaners, laundry and dishwasher detergents, toothpastes, emulsifiers, preservatives in processed food, and pesticides.25-28, 33-47 Many of the chemical agents found in common consumer products (including toothpaste, shampoo, detergents, and processed foods), are known to damage these critical epithelial barriers in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and skin, increasing permeability to bacteria, toxins, pollutants, and allergens25, 28 (Figure 1). Particularly surfactants used in cleaning industry, such as sodium lauryl sulphate were shown to induce eosinophilic lung inflammation and eosinophilic esophagitis even when used alone in daily exposed doses in mouse models.48, 49 When epithelial barriers are disrupted (or “leaky”), substances and microbes can inadvertently pass into deeper tissues, and trigger an immune/inflammatory response that can initiate or aggravate many chronic inflammatory diseases.2, 27 A healthy microbiome on the surface of the mucosal barrier regulates numerous aspects of barrier homeostasis.50 However, reduced biodiversity and alterations in the composition of gut and skin microbiota are associated with various inflammatory conditions, including asthma, allergic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, and obesity.51 Dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the microorganisms residing in our tissues, with microbial dysbiosis and bacterial translocation being linked to the development and exacerbation of allergic and autoimmune diseases (Figure 2).51 Immediate action against climate change is warranted across all economic and societal sectors and at all levels. There is a need for governmental policies that mitigate fossil fuel usage, restore biodiversity, and reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution. Other mitigation efforts include improving the energy efficiency of buildings, creating infrastructure to allow people to use sustainable transportation, increase sustainable mobility, improving the energy efficiency of cars and buildings and reducing our exposure to toxic substances. There is a pressing need to educate the general population for climate change and environmental ques for the importance of a healthy air, water, indoor and outdoor environment and food for the prevention of allergic diseases. The One Health approach addresses these issues in a multidisciplinary manner that stresses the interconnectedness between the health of humans, animals, and the environment (Figure 3). The concept of planetary health directs attention to the extensive degradation of our planet due to anthropogenic activities. It focuses on sustainability by better balancing human needs with the preservation of the Earth's ecosystems in an effort to protect the health and well-being of future generations. To reverse planetary degradation and achieve sustainability and reduce the risk of potential disease outbreaks will call for a multidisciplinary, cross-sector, and transborder approach to change practices and policies at every level, from global to local.

The challenges that climate change pose to societies have typically been addressed by ministries of energy and environment and by environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs), who do not have sufficient knowledge to assess and tackle health aspects of climate change. Some progress can be discerned in recent years when health ministries have begun to address the issue, capitalising on the commitment of health NGOs and international organisations such as WHO, but this has often been confined to sustainable health-care systems, disregarding the wider co-benefits of action. There is a rapidly accumulating scientific evidence base on the deleterious effects of climate change on health. As a result of an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, societies around the world must cope with rising temperatures and sea levels and extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, heatwaves, and floods. These changes pose risks to human health through various exposure pathways, both direct and indirect. Often, communities that contribute least to climate change—eg, low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and vulnerable groups such as children, older people, migrants, Indigenous populations, and other marginalised groups—are affected most by these changes. The negative consequences can be difficult to quantify, and health is seen as a non-economic loss in the current UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) loss and damage and other negotiations.2The UN Framework Convention on Climate ChangeNon-economic losses.https://unfccc.int/wim-excom/areas-of-work/non-economic-lossesDate: 2022Date accessed: July 18, 2022Google Scholar Nonetheless, many of the health effects bear measurable costs—be it in terms of reduced labour productivity due to heat stress3Andrews O Le Quéré C Kjellstrom T Lemke B Haines A Implications for workability and survivability in populations exposed to extreme heat under climate change: a modelling study.Lancet Planet Health. 2018; 2: e540-e547Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar or to an increased financial burden on health systems. A better understanding of the universal value of health is required to develop an intersectoral, whole society approach that considers the links between climate and health.4The WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All.https://www.who.int/groups/who-council-on-the-economics-of-health-for-allDate: 2022Date accessed: October 19, 2022Google Scholar, 5Buse K Tomson G Kuruvilla S et al.Tackling the politics of intersectoral action for the health of people and the planet.BMJ. 2022; 376e068124Google Scholar With the evidence becoming clear as summarised in many publications (eg, the latest IPCC reports by working groups II and III, it is surprising to see how little has been done in the international political arena to address and develop solutions to combat the threats to human health posed by climate change. Two questions can be considered here. On the one hand, what is inhibiting a health framing of the climate policy discussions (ie, addressing the topic); and on the other hand, what hinders the translation of political discussions into political commitments and actions (ie, developing and implementing solutions)? The first question points to challenges in the political agenda setting, whereby health is often equated with health care. This perspective downplays the cross-sectoral relevance of health priorities, and means that the topic has to compete with the dominant discourse about the central importance of economic growth as the main priority of government policy. The second question reveals the shortcomings of the policy making organisational structures, whereby the connection between scientists providing the evidence and policy makers turning this evidence into action is often weak, fragmented, and constrained by what is perceived as acceptable and feasible. To help address this disconnect between science and policy, the scientific community must do more to communicate findings in an accessible way to policy makers, catalyse new forms of engagement at science–policy interfaces, assess implementation of solutions, and advise on accountability. One such endeavour by scientists is the recently published report of a project by the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP)6InterAcademy PartnershipHealth in the climate emergency: a global perspective.https://www.interacademies.org/publication/health-climate-emergency-global-perspectiveDate: 2022Date accessed: July 18, 2022Google Scholar—the global network of academies of science, engineering, and medicine—which aimed to succinctly summarise evidence available from diverse regions worldwide and lay out the principles, practicalities, and priorities embedded in diverse recommendations for policy makers. A particular focus was on clarifying and implementing mitigation policies with substantial health co-benefits and adaptation interventions for the most vulnerable groups. The global IAP report draws many of its recommendations from four regional reports that were published by academy networks for Europe (2019; reviewed in a previous comment7Hobbhahn N Fears R Haines A Ter Meulen V Urgent action is needed to protect human health from the increasing effects of climate change.Lancet Planet Health. 2019; 3: e333-e335Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), Asia (2021), the Americas (2022), and Africa (2022).

The panel lists some of the IAP emerging recommendations for generating and using research outputs. Although it is not possible to make detailed discussion here, one priority for transdisciplinary science is detection and attribution to quantify how climate change affects health.8Ebi KL Åström C Boyer CJ et al.Using detection and attribution to quantify how climate change is affecting health.Health Aff (Millwood). 2020; 39: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar Evidence on attribution is of utmost importance for activities pursuing climate justice and health equity; for instance as evidence to substantiate climate litigation9McCormick S Simmens SJ Glicksman R Paddock L Kim D Whited B The role of health in climate litigation.Am J Public Health. 2018; 108: S104-S108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar and to revitalise ambitions on loss and damage negotiations.PanelThe InterAcademy Partnership (IAP) recommendations on generating and using transdisciplinary science to inform innovation, policy making, and practice*1Using the evidence base already available to inform policy with greater urgency and ambitionWhen evidence exists, it must be deployed to develop health-in-all-policies: there are unprecedented threats to health but also unprecedented opportunities to use knowledge.2Filling knowledge gaps with researchThese actions must be based on commitment to develop basic biomedical and applied research and to strengthen transdisciplinary collaboration.

Moreover, there must be strengthening of monitoring and surveillance activities that link health and climate, particularly in low-income countries.

The challenge continues to translate IAP and other recommendations into the language of the international policy making community. The political fora are manifold and often follow complex processes and procedures, which make it hard for scientists to gain access and for the health argument to gain momentum. At COP26, health still only played a minor role in international climate negotiations, despite the efforts of non-governmental and international health advocates to make it more visible. Climate and health champions must redouble their efforts in future UNFCCC negotiations, by ensuring that national initiatives trigger international commitment and by bringing greater coherence and coordination into the disparate policy initiatives through shared targets and integrating the provision of evidence. For example, a compelling case can be made for better integration of health within and between the parallel UN processes of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the follow up to the Food Systems Summit, and the High-Level Political Group on Sustainable Development Goals. The time is surely overdue to seek greater collaboration with and between other inter-governmental initiatives that address similar priorities (such as the G7, G20, and G77). Such collaboration should strengthen messages while avoiding excessive duplication of effort, and facilitate continuity between the successive presidencies of these governance subsets to promote credibility and impact. The recent statement by the G7 health ministers in which they acknowledge “the importance of combating climate change to protect health: climate protection equals health protection”10G7G7 Health Ministers' Communiqué.https://www.g7germany.de/resource/blob/974430/2042058/5651daa321517b089cdccfaffd1e37a1/2022-05-20-g7-health-ministers-communique-data.pdf?download=1Date: 2022Date accessed: October 19, 2022Google Scholar is an opportunity to place the health and climate nexus at the centre of discussions—not only at G7 meetings, but also throughout the UN system and other international negotiations. IAP, its regional academy networks, and its national academy members are committed to sustaining dialogue and stimulating action on the issues for climate change and health. The preparation of our recent regional and global reports has benefitted greatly from wide-ranging discussion and advice from the scientific, health, and policy communities and from other stakeholders. We welcome further feedback on how to build on this momentum so that health becomes a central pillar of international climate policy negotiations.

Recurrent climate disasters and health emergencies Unprecedented floods in Northern Rivers, NSW, and in south-east Queensland have caused deaths and devastation and disrupted health and other services and facilities. Deaths from drowning, injuries, poisonings and infections are typically the immediate health impacts of floods.1 However, these direct impacts are only the tip of the health iceberg. Flood-affected communities in Australia and other parts of the world have experienced long-lasting mental health effects, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.2, 3 Underlying vulnerabilities, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, mental illness and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs), complicate disaster recovery efforts in communities affected by extreme events. Climate disasters interrupt treatment and overall health care, exacerbating conditions or even causing deaths.4 Interruption may be caused by loss of belongings including medication, damaged transport routes, reduced health services, disrupted telecommunications, loss of power, and evacuations, often compounded by disrupted sleep, stress and reduced access to healthy food and safe water. The Australian dilemma, praying for Lismore. Rick Cochrane, 2021. ◆ Importantly, flooding exacerbates health inequities in affected populations.2 In a previous flooding event that affected north-eastern NSW in 2017, Aboriginal communities and people from low socio-economic households were more likely to have their homes flooded and to be displaced, which exacerbated their mental health risk.5 Furthermore, people with a disability were more likely to have their homes flooded and be evacuated, still be displaced 6 months after the event, and experience disrupted access to food, support networks, health care and social services.6 Floods are generally associated with increased incidence of vector-, food- and water-borne diseases due to increased abundance of mosquitoes, water and food contamination, and compromised hygiene and sanitation services.1, 7 For example, gastrointestinal disease and leptospirosis cases were recorded after floods in England and Hawaii.1 River flow and height (which are surrogates of flooding) were positively associated with Ross River virus disease spread by mosquitoes in the Murray River in eastern Australia.8 Ongoing rain and flooding in eastern Australia provide suitable environmental conditions for the spread of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, which have recently caused several cases of acute encephalitis in animals and humans, including 42 human cases of Japanese encephalitis in NSW, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria (as at 18 May 2022).9 There has been widespread criticism of the handling of the flooding crisis in NSW after residents were left stranded on roofs in Lismore during the record floods of February 2022. An independent inquiry on the causes of, and factors contributing to, the frequency, intensity, timing and location of floods, as well as the preparation and planning for floods by the agencies and the community, has been announced by the NSW Government.10 This inquiry will scrutinise not only the emergency response, but also the transition from incident response to recovery, and consider land use planning and building standards in flood prone areas, appropriate action to adapt to future flood risks, and coordination and collaboration between all levels of government. Building resilience to converging health and climate crises Heavy rainfall, river floods, extreme heat and fire weather events are all projected to increase throughout Australia.11, 12 Although we cannot fully attribute single weather events to climate change, extreme events such as the recent floods in NSW and Queensland, or the devastating 2020 Black Summer bushfires in eastern Australia, are projected to increase in frequency, intensity and duration for global warming scenarios from 1.5°C to 4°C.11 The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability12 identified the inability of institutions and governance systems to manage climate risks, such as those posed by floods, as a key risk for Australia. In this context of intensifying and more frequent extreme events, strengthening the long term resilience of health and social services and local communities to climate disasters becomes crucial. The IPCC report also highlighted the value of diverse knowledges including scientific, local and Indigenous knowledges in understanding and responding to climate risks. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 outlines four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks: • understanding disaster risk; • strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; • investing in disaster reduction for resilience; and • enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to “build back better” in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.13 Resilience is not only the ability to maintain essential function, identity and structure but also the capacity for transformation.12 Building back better should not be interpreted as just engineering interventions of rebuilding residential areas in floodplains or bushfire prone areas with stronger flood- and fire-resistant structures, but as an opportunity for more fundamental structural changes in our health system, society and economy that will strengthen community cohesion and resilience. In Australia, effective long term disaster management and resilience across multiple sectors is strongly influenced by geography, and should be informed by meaningful engagement with rural health services and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and other local communities in rural and urban areas.14 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and underlying NCDs present a challenge for disaster and health systems, especially when public health and health care infrastructure is inaccessible or damaged. People with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, unstable diabetes, or renal and mental health diseases, and those who are undergoing cancer treatment are at greatest risk.15 Displacement and temporary relocation of families in crowded evacuation centres increase the risk of transmission of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Fundamental shifts in preparedness planning are required to ensure health, safety, and smooth operations during emergencies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.16 This includes revising evacuation plans, shelter design and staffing, health care operations for evacuees, and public health messaging. Developing effective public health messaging for floods during the pandemic is critical and requires careful planning and familiarity with the needs and characteristics of the affected communities.16 The converging impacts of climate change, extreme events, COVID-19, NCDs, socio-economic inequities, population ageing and urban growth require an integrated whole-of-system response. This should focus on flood- and fire-resilient land-use planning that will reduce community exposure to climate-related risks and systemic vulnerability in the long term,17 improved housing conditions for low socio-economic households, agile and high value health care, strengthened public health surveillance and emergency warning systems, and a net-zero carbon economy. In the broader health sector, transformative action should involve two key aspects: • increasing the resilience of health and social care services through stronger focus on NCD prevention, particularly on mental health and wellbeing, as well as on improvements in the structural and operational resilience of health care infrastructure; and • drastically reducing the carbon footprint of the health sector, which represents 7% of the national carbon emissions,18 through reduction of wasteful clinical care (low value care), health care-related transport, water and energy consumption.19 The response of health professionals to COVID-19, catastrophic bushfires and floods over the past 2 years has been heroic, but it is not sustainable in the long run. Extreme events, pandemic fatigue, overstretched clinical services, spiralling demand for mental health services, and staff burnout could drive the health care workforce to collapse.20 Beyond the health system, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the social capital (ie, community attachment, solidarity and social trust) and exposed health inequities in our communities.21 Health practitioners have the opportunity to contribute their expertise to help reduce the health consequences of climate disasters across the prevention, preparedness, response and recovery phases of disaster management.22 Disaster preparedness and recovery plans should be developed in partnership with disability organisations and community grassroots, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, to ensure that scientific knowledge is combined with local knowledge gained from experience and built from the ground up.23 Proactive adaptation through better planning in the built environment is essential. The initial focus on recovery should shift towards long term planning of more resilient urban and rural infrastructure, housing, digital communications, and health and social services. In addition, effective prevention of infectious diseases outbreaks related to extreme weather events requires strengthened public health surveillance and integrated early warning systems.24 Similarly, early detection and treatment of mental health problems triggered or exacerbated by extreme events is essential to prevent impacts that could be prolonged over years.2 Response and recovery efforts during and after climate disasters, such as the recent floods in NSW and Queensland are essential, but long term planning and public health prevention are equally or even more important in the face of converging health and climate crises. To build this urgently needed long term resilience (Box), we call for: Box 1. Framework for building resilience to climate disasters in the health sector NCD = non-communicable disease. ◆ • developing a coordinated cross-sectoral whole-of-system response (health, environment, land-use planning, social housing) to floods, strongly focusing on long term public health prevention and preparedness for more frequent and intense extreme events; this should incorporate meaningful community engagement, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, culturally and linguistically diverse, and socio-economically marginalised communities, to build social cohesion, reduce inequities and develop culturally appropriate risk communication strategies and person-centred adaptation plans; • strengthening NCD prevention, including mental health and wellbeing services, particularly for rural and remote communities disproportionally affected by environmental change and extreme events; • implementing a stronger environmental public health surveillance for infectious diseases and NCDs, and climate-informed predictive models and early warning systems linked to emergency, public and mental health services; • establishing a sustainable health unit (similar to Greener NHS in England25) that will help improve the health sector’s resilience to climate and health emergencies, and monitor and reduce the carbon footprint of health services; and • increasing research capacity and capability and identifying gaps in local service delivery, communication and coordination, with a strong focus on the evaluation of interventions aiming to increase health sector and community resilience, particularly of at-risk populations, to floods and other climate disasters.

We engage our findings with the wider governance literature to unlock new thinking on wildfires as a process and outcome. This comparative approach enables us to propose a novel framework for analyzing wildfire governance based on four pillars: (1) actor participation in decision-making and decision taking; (2) actor collaboration and coproduction across and within levels, scales, and networks; (3) path dependencies and local place-based dynamics of wildfire incidence and comprehension; and (4) actor adaptation to and anticipation of wildfire risk to fashion effective institutions that address the global wildfire challenge. We show how this framework can help specify a suite of bespoke analytical and policy practitioner approaches to facilitate preemptive and restorative wildfire strategies via new networks between communities, states, and wider society, thus providing the basis for more equitable and sustainable governance of wildfire risks and impacts.","10.5751/es-13920-280206","28","2","https://lens.org/176-493-756-855-246","","17083087","176-493-756-855-246","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","17083087","","2"

The importance of the kidney and renal physiology in the context of physical activity and exercise can be easily overlooked. However, over the past 3 decades, research has uncovered the relevance of the kidney in regulating physiological responses to exercise and has also shed light on how exercise can alter the pathophysiology associated with kidney diseases (Fig. 1). The American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology has played a sentinel role in disseminating a vast array of key studies in this field, ranging from preclinical studies that identified an altered skeletal muscle physiological response to exercise in chronic azotemia in the late 1980s (1) to more recent concepts that have used environmental and exercise physiology to better understand impairments in the oxygen cascade in patients with kidney diseases (2, 3). In support of this, we encourage submissions to the Call for Papers on “Exercise and the Kidney in Health and Disease.” Details can be found at https://journals.physiology.org/ajprenal/exercise-and-the-kidney-in-health-and-disease.Figure 1.Current and future perspectives for exercise and the kidney in health and disease.

This work has since evolved to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of acute kidney injury associated with exercising or performing physical work in the heat and participating in more extreme sporting events such as marathons (4–6). Advances in this area have a translational impact on occupational health and safety for groups such as firefighters, agricultural workers, and miners and for athlete safety with the increased uptake of extreme exercise events such as Ironman triathlons and ultramarathons. In addition, it has also provided some insight into the largely unknown pathophysiology of Mesoamerican nephropathy (6). Considering the record-breaking heat waves recorded in 2022, coupled with the increase in air pollution from more severe and frequent wildfires, there is a need for studies that ascertain the effects on renal function of performing activities of daily living and occupational and recreational activities under such conditions. Identifying renal protective interventions for activity in these environmental conditions is equally as important. This area of research is critical given that electrolyte imbalances and dehydration are leading causes of hospitalization during these events, particularly in the most vulnerable populations such as older individuals and those with cardiovascular and kidney diseases.With irrefutable evidence linking physical inactivity with noncommunicable chronic disease, an important line of research in this field has been aimed at understanding the role of exercise in preventing renal dysfunction and chronic kidney disease and to counteract the adverse effects of poor diet on renal function. In this regard, a recent review published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology proposed exercise to protect against age- and disease-related impairments in the renal molecular clock (7), which could have profound implications for the prevention and management of hypertension. In the context of diet, recent preclinical work has demonstrated the renal protective effects of exercise in the setting of a high-fructose diet (8). A novel experimental clinical trial published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology revealed the association of a high-sodium diet with tubular damage (9). It is currently unknown if physical activity or exercise may offer renal protection against sodium-induced kidney damage, making this area ripe for future research. Another area in need of future research, with significant clinical impact, includes elucidating whether exercise has a renal protective effect against the nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressant regimens and current cancer therapies.Finally, most of the research in this field has been aimed at studying exercise physiology in the context of renal disease and implementing exercise interventions to improve physiological outcomes across the spectrum of kidney diseases (10–12). In this regard, the American Journal Physiology-Renal Physiology has published leading studies that have advanced our understanding of pulmonary and cardiovascular physiological responses to exercise in patients with kidney disease (13, 14). Those studies also highlight exercise as a useful physiological stressor to uncover disease-related pathophysiology and identify new therapeutic targets (15). The American Journal Physiology-Renal Physiology has also published a wealth of preclinical and clinical studies that have identified abnormalities in skeletal muscle structure and function in the setting of kidney disease (16–18). All these studies are essential in addressing exercise intolerance, a hallmark symptom of the disease (19). The beneficial effects and mechanistic underpinnings of exercise as an adjunct therapy to improve cardiovascular and immune health have also been well documented and have helped guide clinical recommendations for exercise prescription (16–18). More recent studies have commenced investigations into mechanisms of the synergistic effects of novel diet strategies and exercise in this patient population (20, 21). There has been some controversy within the field as it pertains to the effects of exercise on renal physiology in kidney disease. Previous preclinical evidence demonstrated that voluntary wheel running exacerbated kidney injury in rats with impaired renal function, likely due to physiological shunt of blood flow away from the kidney during exercise (22). This has led to speculations regarding the safety of exercise for individuals with chronic kidney disease. However, these concerns have not translated in clinical trials where there is currently no evidence to suggest that exercise is detrimental to kidney function in chronic kidney disease. Despite the substantial scientific advancements in this field, more research is required to better understand the effects of exercise on renal physiology in kidney disease toward establishing if exercise can slow its progression. Indeed, data from the National Institutes of Health Common Fund Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC) Consortium initiative may provide some valuable contributions to this area (23).In summary, the importance of mechanistic studies at the nexus of exercise and renal physiology in health and disease should not be overlooked. Research in this area has a broad reach with the potential to significantly impact health in the setting of performance, occupational activities, climate crises, and clinical disease. We have made considerable scientific progress in this field; however, there is still potential for numerous new discoveries in this area. In a call to action for research in this field, we encourage readers to submit their science to the Call for Papers on “Exercise and the Kidney in Health and Disease” to the American Journal Physiology-Renal Physiology (submission deadline: May 31, 2023).GRANTSThis work was supported by American Heart Association Grant 19CDA3470002 (to D.L.K.) and National Institutes of Health Grants DK116196, DK096373, and HL148044 (to M.L.S.S.-L.).DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.Danielle Kirkman and Maria Luisa Sequeira-Lopez are editors of American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology and were not involved and did not have access to information regarding the peer-review process or final disposition of this article.

However, studies often focus on just some selected factor(s) and interaction(s). Such focus choices may limit and bias our understanding and predictive capability of disease sensitivity to climate and other driver-pressure changes. To assess these research choices and identify possible remaining key gaps and biases, a scoping review is applied to climate-disease related publications for Lyme disease and cryptosporidiosis. This dataset includes two excel files for Lyme disease (“literature_search_LD_raw.xls”) and cryptosporidiosis (“literature_search_CY_raw.xls”) respectively, covering all the relevant information for further analysis. Each excel file contains three sheets named “Search”, “Filter”, and “Quantitative”. Contents of each sheet is explained as follows. 1. “Search” Sheet “Search” listed all the publications found from the literature searches, including the information of publication year, title, DOI, and Authors. The searches were performed in Web of Science™ (WoS) and considered publications from 1 January 2000 to 10 February 2022. Search terms were (('borreliosis' OR 'Lyme disease') AND ('climate' OR 'climate change' OR 'climate variability')) for Lyme disease, ((‘cryptosporidiosis’ OR ‘cryptosporidium’ OR ‘crypto.’) AND (‘climate’ OR ‘climate change’ OR ‘climate variability’)) for cryptosporidiosis. The search yielded 555 publication results for Lyme disease and 185 for cryptosporidiosis. 2. “Filter” Sheet “Filter” listed the inclusions and exclusions for searched publications, and categories each included publication belonging to. Excluded articles (marked as blank in column “Included”) are ones that: (i) do not consider both climate and disease; (ii) are for Lyme disease, but not about the <em>Ixodes</em> transmission of the <em>Borrelia </em>pathogen; (iii) are not written in English; and (iv) are not full-text open access. Included articles (marked as “x” in column “Included”) are further classified into following categories based on their focus: for Lyme disease, categories of publications include reviews (mentioning), reviews (specifically discussing), public awareness, mitigation, survey (implications), investigations, projections, and others; for cryptosporidiosis, categories include reviews (mentioning), reviews (specifically discussing), survey (implications), investigations, projections, and others. Articles belonging to any categories are marked as “x”. 3. “Quantitative” Sheet “Quantitative” lists further information extracted from quantitative studies which are articles under category of investigations and projections in sheet “filter”. Further extracted information is from the methods section of each study or from the full text if necessary. The information includes transmission components, study region (if applicable), category of investigations or projections, included driver-pressure factors, and methods. Transmission components are reproduction host, transmission host, vector, and human for Lyme disease; animal reservoir, environmental reservoir, and human for cryptosporidiosis. Study region considers specific countries as the smallest scale for spatial resolution, so that smaller than whole-country study sites were counted as studies of the associated countries. Included driver-pressure factors are categorized as shown in Table 1, including main categories and their covered variables. Methods include laboratory/field experimentation/observation, statistical analysis, mechanistic modelling, and synthesis/meta-analysis. Table 1.

Both the processes of weathering and erosion occur synergistically and affect ecological factors. Different techniques are used to determine the rates of weathering and erosion. These techniques are explained at the level of rock surface, subsurface, and microscopic techniques. Under each level, various destructive and nondestructive methods are discussed in this chapter. By understanding these measuring methods, we can develop a view to understand the interconnection between rock and atmosphere, which further simplify the understanding of environmental, lithological, and climatic control. This chapter is based on several novel and advanced techniques used by geomorphologists to measure the rate of weathering. This chapter has focused on the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques and their significance. References Abu-Zeid , N. , Botteon , D. , Cocco , G. , and Santarato , G. ( 2006 ).

Martinson","Effectiveness of Fuel Treatments for Mitigating Wildfire Severity: A Manager‐Focused Review and Synthesis","2010","","The 2008 Request for Applications from the Joint Fire Science Program called for a synthesis of the extant literature that addresses the effectiveness of fuel treatments. We employed a four‐ pronged approach to address this task, including several scoping exercises with land managers, a literature review, a meta‐analysis, and development of an online pictorial database. Background and Purpose Changes in land use and management over the last century or more have increased the vertical and horizontal continuity of wildland fuels in many areas of North America (Pyne 1982, but see Keeley and Fotheringham (2001) and Johnson and others (2001) for discussion of exceptions). This increase in fuel hazard is compounding with climate change (Brown and others 2004) and ex‐urban development (Cova and others 2004) to place ever more values at risk to wildfire damages. Land managers have responded to political demands for an expansion of efforts to mitigate fuel hazards (USDA Forest Service 2000), piquing the interest for more research into the effects and effectiveness of these activities (Botti and others 1998). Consequently, the volume of fuel treatment studies has expanded greatly over the past decade (Figure 1). The 2008 Request for Applications from the Joint Fire Science Program called for a synthesis of the extant literature that addresses the effectiveness of fuel treatments. While a number of traditional literature reviews have been compiled on this topic (Keeley and others 2009; Agee and Skinner 2005; Peterson and others 2005; Graham and others 2004; Carey and Schumann 2003; Fernandez and Botelho 2003, Greenlee and Sapsis 1996), reviews such as these are inherently qualitative. They are also prone to bias in selection and interpretation of findings and tend to over‐emphasize contradictory conclusions with inadequate attention to sources of variability (Cooper and others 2009). Since 1955 the medical sciences have relied instead on an alternative approach to research synthesis using the techniques of meta‐analysis (Stroup and others 2000). Meta‐analysis is a systematic and quantitative approach to research synthesis that provides a method for the combination and comparison of results from independent trials to assess the direction, magnitude, and consistency of reported responses (Cooper and others 2009). It is now commonly applied to ecological questions (Gurevitch and others 2001) and has been recently applied to the wildland fuels treatment literature, as well (Martinson 1998, Wan and others 2001, Kopper 2002, Boerner and others 2009, Kallies and others 2010, Youngblood 2010). Kopper and others (2009) conducted a meta‐analysis on the effects of prescribed fire on fuel reduction. The focus of this project was a meta‐analysis of the literature documenting fuel treatment performance in mitigating subsequent fire intensity and severity to assess the quantitative support for the current fuel management paradigm. Meta‐analysis allowed us to test the expectation that fuel treatment effectiveness will vary predictably in different types of vegetation and by the degree to which a less hazardous condition is created through reducing surface fuels, removing ladders, opening canopies, and selecting for fire resistance (Agee and Skinner 2005).","","","","https://lens.org/189-306-883-483-030","","","189-306-883-483-030","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Today's forests are characterized by dense stands of small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires. There is now an emphasis on ecological restoration in the Southwest, whereby forests are thinned to reduce fuel content so that the natural fire regime can be reintroduced. However, given the multiple impacts humans have had on the landscape over the past 100 years, it is unclear whether thinning and burning treatments will restore all aspects of ecosystem health. Given this uncertainty, managers and stakeholders want information on the impacts of treatments on multiple ecosystem components, including wildlife. I used meta-analysis to compare effects of restoration treatments on wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. Thinning and burning treatments had positive effects on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in 25 studies suitable for meta-analysis; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. I recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species at larger spatial scales and target species for which there is a paucity of data. iii No comprehensive analysis of the small mammal community in response to restoration treatments at large scales has been conducted in ponderosa pine forests. Small mammals are important in forest ecosystems in serving as prey, recycling nutrients, dispersing fungal spores and seeds, and aerating soils. During 2006-2009, I trapped eight species of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona, and used occupancy modeling to determine wildlife responses to habitat. The most important habitat variables in predicting small mammal community occupancy were pine basal area, treatment intensity (percent of trees removed and time since treatment), the number and length of time slash piles are left on the ground, rock cover, and snags >40cm diameter. The average occupancy of all species was positively related to thinning treatment and slash. No one treatment benefitted all species, but rather an arrangement of dense and open stands across the landscape with heterogeneity in fine-scale features is likely the best management approach for restoring and maintaining a diverse small mammal community. Similarly, community composition differed in each of 6 years following treatment, but total density remained constant. Total species densities were significantly lower in stands with dense conditions than in stands with more open structural conditions similar to those of presettlement times, which had similar small mammal densities as the thinning treatments. In addition, tassel-eared squirrels (Sciurus aberti), golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and gray-collared chipmunks (Tamias cinereicollis) appeared to play a functionally redundant role in dispersing ectomycorrhizal fungi across different stand structures. These results iv suggest that restoration treatments can maintain ecosystem stability in terms of small mammal community structure and function. Finally, I found that the rapid assessment, occupancy and density modeling approach was highly effective in evaluating the response of the small mammal community to treatment and other habitat attributes. Particularly in the arid Southwest, most small mammal population studies end up primarily tracking precipitation patterns, but I showed a lack of a year effect by all species. Although this study was a big effort, it obtained more reliable, repeatable results for a greater number of species than many equally-intensive small mammal studies with similar objectives, which relied on mark-recapture methods and density estimation. I suggest this design be utilized in other studies that grapple with high variability and large spatial and temporal scales in assessing general impacts of treatments or habitat change on wildlife species.","","","","https://lens.org/189-354-063-754-858","","","189-354-063-754-858","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

The findings suggest that “neurological impacts from air pollution are a special concern to communities in wildfire-impacted regions because of their recurring exposures to smoke,” says first author Stephanie Cleland, a PhD candidate in environmental sciences and engineering at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Cleland is also an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education research fellow at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Access to anonymized data sets from online games such as Lost in Migration may present opportunities for environmental health studies of the brain. Images: man © iStock.com/tataks; inset courtesy Lumos Labs.To assess how wildfire-related PM2.5 might affect people’s ability to focus, the investigators turned to a unique digital resource: the scores racked up by players of an online game called Lost in Migration,9 which was designed to help people measure and improve their attention span.10 Players are shown pictures of five birds oriented in various directions, then must determine if the middle bird is pointing left, right, up, or down. New flocks appear in rapid succession, and players are scored based on their speed and accuracy.The investigators had access to scores from a cohort of 10,228 players aged 18 years and older in the contiguous United States. Among these were 1,809 players who lived in the western states of Oregon, Washington, California, Montana, Idaho, and Nevada. The researchers limited their analysis to the first 20 games each individual had ever played. The game’s developer, Lumos Labs, also provided anonymized data, including the first three digits of each player’s zip code (ZIP3) at the time they created a game account, as well their age, sex, and education level.The authors used ground-based monitoring data from the EPA’s Air Quality System database and the PurpleAir network to estimate ambient PM2.5 exposures for each ZIP3 location. Wildfire smoke exposures for western populations were estimated using satellite data gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Whereas the EPA and PurpleAir’s PM2.5 data are available in hour and minute intervals, respectively, wildfire smoke data are available on a daily basis only. The satellite observations of smoke were classified by density based on estimated concentration of wildfire-related PM2.5: light (0–10 μg/m3), medium (10–21 μg/m3), or heavy (>21 μg/m3). The researchers then calculated the maximum daily density in each ZIP3 to denote smoke exposure.The analysis showed an association between short-term exposures to PM2.5 and poorer cognitive performance. For example, every 10-μg/m3 increase in maximum hourly ambient PM2.5 3 hours prior to gameplay was associated with an average drop in scores of 21 points for all contiguous U.S. users and 42 points for just western users. Similarly, heavy wildfire smoke density on the day prior to gameplay was associated with an average 117-point drop in scores. Among western players, same-day PM2.5 exposure was associated with an overall average 887 fewer points over 20 plays (roughly 18 fewer correct answers). Players overall averaged 529 fewer points over 20 plays (approximately 11 fewer correct answers). The associations with poorer performance were more pronounced among males and among players aged either 18–29 or 70 and older.Senior author Ana Rappold, who is Clinical Research Branch Chief in the EPA’s Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, says residents affected by wildfire smoke often complain of “foggy brain,” difficulty concentrating, and other cognitive problems that epidemiological studies of air pollution typically do not address. Findings from the study, she says, suggest that smoke exposures trigger these effects within hours. However, she adds, wildfires are very stressful events, and it is impossible to decouple any effects of stress from the effects of exposure in an observational study.Laura McGuinn, an environmental epidemiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who was not involved in the research, applauds the study. “There’s quite a bit of temporal variation in particulate matter during the day, during which some populations might experience critical windows of vulnerability,” she says. “So subdaily exposure estimates from this research add a lot of innovation to the field.”Still, pollutant levels—and therefore individual exposures—can also vary widely within the spatial areas denoted by ZIP3 codes, McGuinn points out. The fact that the researchers were unable to account for exposure variations within ZIP3 locations, she says, is a limitation of the study.Marc Weisskopf, a professor of environmental epidemiology and director of the Harvard Chan–National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Center for Environmental Health, adds that ZIP3 sign-up locations for some people might also have differed from where they actually played the game. For instance, someone might have signed up in Colorado and then moved to Texas, says Weisskopf, who also was not involved in the research. Better accounting of individual exposures in specific locations, he says, would likely only have strengthened the associations detected in the study. Meanwhile, he says, access to large-scale data sets emerging from online games such as Lost in Migration “leads to incredibly intriguing opportunities for environmental health studies of the brain.”Charles W.

Increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance events are one element of global change in terrestrial ecosystems. The goal of this dissertation was to measure the response of soil microbial communities and decomposition to disturbance events and to examine the mechanisms underlying post-disturbance changes in decomposition. In the first part of my dissertation work I explored these questions within the context of wildfires in boreal forests. Chapter 1 characterized soil microbial communities and the rate of decomposition across a fire chronosequence in interior Alaska. I found that boreal forest fires reduced soil microbial abundance, altered fungal community composition, and suppressed litter decomposition. Chapter 2 investigated whether soil microbial responses to boreal forest fires differ as a function of fire severity. I demonstrated that higher severity fires elicited greater reductions in soil microbial biomass and larger shifts in fungal community composition than lower severity fires. Chapter 3 tested the mechanisms through which boreal forest fires alter decomposition processes. I discovered that decomposition rates were slower in recently burned forests because of post-fire reductions in soil moisture and C substrate quality. In the second part of my dissertation I expanded my findings to other types of disturbance events using meta-analysis. Chapter 4 reviewed the response of soil microbial biomass to fires. I found that soil microbial biomass was significantly lower in recently burned ecosystems, but the response of microbial biomass to fire differed by fire type and biome. Chapter 5 examined soil microbial responses to abiotic (fire, harvesting, storms) and biotic (insect infestation, pathogen outbreaks) disturbances in forests. I observed that abiotic disturbances significantly reduced soil microbial biomass, while changes in microbial biomass were non-significant following biotic disturbance events. Collectively, these findings suggest that reductions in soil microbial biomass and decomposition rates following abiotic disturbances are likely to slow the transfer of C from soils to the atmosphere and provide a negative feedback to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global change.","","","","https://lens.org/198-804-343-491-310","","","198-804-343-491-310","lens_343.ris","1650717","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/4.ris","","",""

Some regions are experiencing and will experience severe decline in their water resources due to prolonged periods of drought. Since emergency practices such as the provision of emergency drinking water and forest firefighting depend on regional surface and groundwater resources, the safety of the hydro geosphere's of a region is of fundamental importance, especially in times of crisis. The study uniquely addresses the integration of emergency water management within broader sustainable practices, particularly in the German context where such an analysis has not been previously consolidated. Using the example of emergency drinking water management, the paper elaborates the extent to which measures of emergency response are currently recognised as part of sustainable water management. In an analysis, 79 documents addressing emergency drinking water management of both water supply companies and crisis management authorities in Germany were analysed. The findings revealed a general lack of documents addressing the long-term dependencies between water resources and emergency measures currently applied. Furthermore, the documents do not elaborate on how to implement these measures in a sustainable way recognising the distinctive characteristics of a region. Since response measures can potentially intensify water stress in a region, emergency water management must be consequently included in a holistic water management process to protect landscapes and communities for the future. This paper provides a first comprehensive compilation of essential documents dealing with emergency drinking water management in Germany. It furthermore introduces a new approach to emergency water management and identifies necessary research that could serve as a baseline for future crisis decision making to strengthen national and international initiatives on water resource protection.

Initial search results revealed a lack of literature referencing solastalgia in an Aboriginal-specific context. Indigenist research methodologies such as Heuristic inquiry and Aboriginal Participatory Action Research (APAR) contributed to the identification of alternative terminologies, which led to the majority of the included publications referring to solastalgia-related concepts, with one included publication mentioning solastalgia specifically. These methods were consequently used to synthesize data, confirm results and contribute to final discussions. Lastly, our results determined that at this stage there is insufficient evidence to conclusively suggest that Aboriginal Peoples in a general sense, experience solastalgia.

We systematically searched online databases and selected 11 peer-reviewed studies published between 2012-2022 for the Northern NSW region. The most explored health outcome was mental health in the aftermath of floods and droughts, followed by increased healthcare utilisation due to respiratory, cardiovascular and mortality outcomes associated with bushfire smoke or heat waves. Future research directions were recommended to understand: the compounding impacts of extreme events on health and the health system, local data needs that can better inform models that predict future health risks and healthcare utilisation for the region, and the needs of vulnerable populations that require a whole-of-system response during the different phases of disasters.

In this study we analyzed data from 232 studies consisting of 1702 observations to investigate whether ecosystem type, climate zone, stand age, soil depth, slope, elevation, and the time since fire in influence of forest soil carbon pools to fire regime (fire type, fire season, fire intensity). Additionally, we explored the potential mechanisms of the relationships between multiple response variables to the fire using linear regression and random forest models. On aggregate, fires significantly increased the mean effect sizes of several key soil carbon cycling components-including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total carbon (TC), pyrogenic carbon (PyC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC) by 0.77, 0.89, 0.87, 1.22, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively, compared to unburned forests ecosystems. However, the fire effects on soil C pools vary widely between environmental factors and duration, and are mediated by factors such as tree species, fire type, and soil layer. A correlation analysis displayed the effects of fire on MBC and DOC were significantly and negatively correlated with elevation. Fire effects on the forest floor and mineral soil indicated significantly increased PyC. SOC and TC in coniferous tree species are the most sensitive to fires, thereby altering important feedback relationships with the fire-vegetatale-climate system. Interestingly, latitude has a stronger influence on SOC than mean annual precipitation or elevation, indicating that variations in latitude play a significant role in regulating the amount of SOC in forest ecosystems. Overall, the results illustrated geographic variation in fire effects on soil C cycling underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and help us understand the responses of soil C cycling to fire in forest ecosystems, and facilitate decision-making to forest fire management.

Although end-of-life and palliative care are considered essential components of disaster planning and response, there are gaps in understandings about their real-life application, and how natural disasters impact end-of-life care., OBJECTIVE: To synthesise existing evidence of the impacts of natural disasters (eg, bushfires, communicable pandemics, etc) on end-of-life care., METHODS: A systematic review with a narrative synthesis was undertaken. The review was registered on PROSPERO (registration: CRD42020176319). PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for studies published in English between 2003 and 2020, with findings explicitly mentioning end-of-life care impacts in relation to a natural disaster. Articles were appraised for quality using a JBI-QARI tool., RESULTS: Thirty-six empirical studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment. Findings were synthesised into three key themes: impacts on service provision, impacts on service providers and impacts on service users. This review demonstrates that natural disasters impact profoundly on end-of-life care, representing a stark departure from a palliative care approach., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practitioners, policy makers and researchers must continue to collaborate for viable solutions to achieve universal access to compassionate and respectful end-of-life care, during natural disasters. Using models, policies and practices already developed in palliative care, involving those most impacted in disaster planning and anticipating barriers, such as resource shortages, enables development of end-of-life care policies and practices that can be rapidly implemented during natural disasters.

Biomass burning accounts for about 13% of the total contribution of Hg from natural sources. The aim of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of how wildfires modify mercury compounds behaviour and the effects it has in the Hg cycle, based on a systematic bibliographic review and analysis. Systems dynamics is an adequate focus to analyze the mobilization of Hg due to wildfires, which meets all the requirements to be studied by multimedia modelling. The development and application for the first time of a dynamic multimedia model of Hg taking into account specifically the influences of wildfires is one of the novelties of this work. Different scenarios show that an increase in the number of fires will consequently increase the mercury emitted into the atmosphere, modifying its natural cycle, producing a long-term modification of Hg compositions and concentrations in the different media. Hg movement caused by wildfires can cause complications in living beings and alter the ecosystems. This study found that the Hg soil content could as well be an indicator to measure the impact of fire on the environment. This model can also be generalized to conduct additional studies under comparable conditions, helping to understand the importance of forest fires in global Hg cycles. Copyright © 2022.

This particularly applies in Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest palm oil producer in the world. The anthropogenic activities and the agroecological practices in oil palm plantation, including excessive use of fertilisers, bush fire due to land clearing, and cultivation on peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate change featuring extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as infestation of pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies. The study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm production and identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in Malaysia. This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation options were identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant and resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum tillage. The reviewed studies recommended the following to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change: sustainable national policy on climate change, conservation of the existing carbon stock, effective management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, afforestation for carbon sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.

The way a young person copes with the event plays a significant role in development of post-disaster psychopathology. Coping has been widely studied after acute onset disasters, however, difficulties conducting research in post-disaster contexts and the individualized nature of coping make accurate assessment of coping a significant challenge. A systematic literature search of multiple databases and previous reviews was conducted, exploring scholarly documentation of coping measurement and the relationship between coping and post-traumatic stress (PTSS) symptoms after acute onset disasters. A total of 384 peer-reviewed manuscripts were identified, and 18 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. The studies examined coping and post-traumatic stress in the wake of acute onset disasters such as terrorist events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires. Greater PTSS symptoms were related to internalizing, externalizing, rumination, and avoidant coping strategies. Coping measurement was constrained due to measurement variance, lack of developmentally and contextually vali-dated instruments, theoretical misalignment, and absence of comprehensive tools to assess coping. Robust and consistent measures of coping should be established to inform research and interventions to reduce the impact of disasters on children's and adolescents' well-being.","10.3390/ijerph18094865","18","9","","","1660-4601","","medline_84.ris","236491","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/5.ris","1660-4601","","9"

It has been consistently demonstrated that asthma symptoms are exacerbated by exposure to ozone. Ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant produced when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are oxidized in the atmosphere in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx). At ground level, elevated ozone is typically formed as a result of human activities. However, wildfires represent an additional source of ozone precursors. Recent evidence suggests that smoke can increase ozone concentrations. We estimated the number of excess asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits in children with asthma that may be attributed to elevated ozone associated with smoke (EOAS) in the USA. We conducted a quantitative burden assessment (BA) using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the median number of excess pediatric asthma ED visits that may be attributed to EOAS among children with asthma in the continental USA between 2005 and 2014, as well as 95% confidence bounds (95% CB). We estimated that a median of 2403 (95% CB 235-5382) pediatric asthma ED visits could be attributed to EOAS exposure between 2005 and 2014 in the continental USA. Furthermore, the impact of EOAS on estimated asthma ED visits was greatest in the eastern half of the continental USA. We found a significant increase in pediatric asthma ED visits that may be attributed to exposure to EOAS.

Climate-related exposures were distributed across four main categories, including: high ambient temperatures; flood hazards; vector-borne diseases; and wildfires. A number of different methodologies and measures were used to assess health vulnerability to climate-related hazards, including heat vulnerability indices and regression analyses. Vulnerability maps should exemplify how variables measuring the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of different populations help to determine the potential for climate-related hazards to have an effect on human health.

A search of 12 databases and grey literature yielded 1775 unique articles, of which 10 were included in this review. Principal results were: 1) Smoke-related public health messages are communicated via a variety of channels, but limited evidence is available regarding their effectiveness for the general public or at-risk groups. 2) Messages that use simple language are more commonly recalled, understood, and complied with. Compliance differs according to socio-demographic characteristics. 3) At-risk groups may be advised to stay indoors before the general population, in order to protect the most vulnerable people in a community. The research included in this review was observational and predominantly descriptive, and is therefore unable to sufficiently answer questions regarding effectiveness.

Climate change projections indicate that droughts will become more intense in the 21 century in some areas of the world. The El Nino Southern Oscillation is associated with drought in some countries, and forecasts can provide advance warning of the increased risk of adverse climate conditions. The most recent available data from EMDAT estimates that over 50 million people globally were affected by drought in 2011. Documentation of the health effects of drought is difficult, given the complexity in assigning a beginning/end and because effects tend to accumulate over time. Most health impacts are indirect because of its link to other mediating circumstances like loss of livelihoods. Methods. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Embase; PsychINFO, Cochrane Collection. Key references from extracted papers were hand-searched, and advice from experts was sought for further sources of literature. Inclusion criteria for papers summarised in tables include: explicit link made between drought as exposure and human health outcomes; all study designs/methods; all countries/contexts; any year of publication. Exclusion criteria include: drought meaning shortage unrelated to climate; papers not published in English; studies on dry/arid climates unless drought was noted as an abnormal climatological event. No formal quality evaluation was used on papers meeting inclusion criteria. Results . 87 papers meeting the inclusion criteria are summarised in tables. Additionally, 59 papers not strictly meeting the inclusion criteria are used as supporting text in relevant parts of the results section. Main categories of findings include: nutrition-related effects (including general malnutrition and mortality, micronutrient malnutrition, and anti-nutrient consumption); water-related disease (including E coli, cholera and algal bloom); airborne and dust-related disease (including silo gas exposure and coccidioidomycosis); vector borne disease (including malaria, dengue and West Nile Virus); mental health effects (including distress and other emotional consequences); and other health effects (including wildfire, effects of migration, and damage to infrastructure). Conclusions . The probability of drought-related health impacts varies widely and largely depends upon drought severity, baseline population vulnerability, existing health and sanitation infrastructure, and available resources with which to mitigate impacts as they occur. The socio-economic environment in which drought occurs influences the resilience of the affected population. Forecasting can be used to provide advance warning of the increased risk of adverse climate conditions and can support the disaster risk reduction process. Despite the complexities involved in documentation, research should continue and results should be shared widely in an effort to strengthen drought preparedness and response activities.","10.1371/currents.dis.7a2cee9e980f91ad7697b570bcc4b004","5","101515638","","","2157-3999","","medline_84.ris","236491","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/5.ris","2157-3999","","101515638"

This review synthesizes the scattered literature about burro effects on plant communities of the Mojave Desert, a center of burro management contentions. I classified 24 documents meeting selection criteria for this review into five categories of research: (i) diet analyses directly determining which plant species burros consume, (ii) utilization studies of individual species, (iii) control-impact comparisons, (iv) exclosure studies, and (v) forage analyses examining chemical characteristics of forage plants. Ten diet studies recorded 175 total species that burros consumed. However, these studies and two exclosure studies suggested that burros preferentially eat graminoid and forb groups over shrubs. One study in Death Valley National Park, for example, found that Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian ricegrass) was 11 times more abundant in burro diets than expected based on its availability. Utilization studies revealed that burros also exhibit preferences within the shrub group. Eighty-three percent of reviewed documents were produced in a 12-year period, from 1972 to 1983, with the most recent document produced in 1988. Because burros remain abundant on many federal lands and grazing may interact with other management concerns (e.g., desert wildfires fueled by exotic grasses), rejuvenating grazing research to better understand both past and present burro effects could help guide revegetation and grazing management scenarios.","10.1007/s00267-008-9105-7","41","6","","809","0364-152X","","medline_84.ris","236491","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/5.ris","0364-152X","809","6"

As an application, a primary focus is on the policy response to wildfire. The principal research is segmented into 3 related chapters. First, meta-analysis is used to statistically summarize the literature of Coasean bargaining experiments. Results from this analysis suggest that the social dimensions characterizing an experiment impact bargaining behavior on a magnitude similar to that of variables that describe transaction costs. This result suggests an increased focus in future experimental work on the impact of social dimension characteristics is warranted. Next, revealed preference analysis is applied to a unique forest management program in New Mexico. The Collaborative Forest Restoration Program includes stakeholders actively in the creation and implantation of management on federal forested lands. Statistical analysis of the funding pattern from the program reveals that developing social capital and maintaining forest health stand out among a set of potentially divergent goals, while implementing projects that span multiple land jurisdictions is argued to be a missed opportunity for developing social capital. Finally, experimental economics is used to analyze the effectiveness of a set of potential policy tools to induce private spending on wildfire risk mitigation. The policy tools considered here are shown to have the opposite impact, reducing private spending. When success is assessed alternatively by the probability of engaging in risk mitigation, these policy tools have the desired effect. Given the potential to crowd out private expenditure and the sensitivity to the specific mitigation objective, the implementation of these policy tools takes on greater significance.","","","","","","","","screened_128.ris","621568","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/6.ris","","",""

Development of better syringes and needles produced a change of practice, instead using landmarks and fascial pops and clicks as well as searching for paresthesia to determine where to inject the local anesthetic. However, this reduced the precision and the success rate to an extent that did not impress many surgical colleagues and was often associated with prolonged paresthesia-induced nerve injury-like sequalae. Nerve stimulator guidance provided a real improvement that increased success rate and reduced the risk for nerve injury. Further, the report by Kapral in 1994 of ultrasound guided regional anesthesia represented a seminal breakthrough that allowed, not only orientation of the needle tip immediately close to the target nerve structures, but also visualization of the local spread of the injected local anesthetic.<sup>2</sup> If not optimal, then the needle tip can be re-localized and the injection repeated until a satisfactory spread is achieved. In a way this represents going full circle from Halstead, thus, allowing perfect visualization of both nerve structures and the spread of local anesthetic. In a sense peripheral regional anesthesia was perfected by ultrasound guidance, especially if occasionally used as a combined technique with nerve stimulation then visualization with ultrasound is difficult (e.g. deep blocks or obese patients). However, as peripheral regional anesthesia became ‘perfected’, a new concept was launched simultaneously in Ireland and Australia in 2007- the landmark-based fascial plane block called the TAP (Transverse Abdominis Plane) block.<sup>3,4</sup> This new concept hinges on the idea of injecting a large volume of local anesthetics in an anatomical fascial plane that contain the nerves of interest. After introducing ultrasound guidance to perform this block, the TAP and many other fascial plane blocks were invented by the dozen and has spread like wildfire. One can wonder where this popularity really come from, since replacing the high-precision techniques of ultrasound guided proper peripheral nerve blocks, with injecting a large volume of local anesthetics in a fascial plane, not seeing the actual nerve structures or adequate spread of the local anesthetic, defy logic. One cannot help wondering if this is merely because many fascial plane blocks do not require much skill or knowledge, especially regarding ultrasound visualization.<sup>5</sup> In summary, when performing the different fascial plane blocks, you will inject your LA in a defined fascial plane but not close to all the nerve structures that you would like to block and, thus, you will rely on a random but favorable spread of the LA to get a reasonable block. Are all fascial plane blocks basically the same? The answer to this is obviously no. Some fascial plane blocks have a quite clear mode of action and does anesthetize well defined nerve structures. Examples of such blocks are the rectus sheath and PECS II blocks where the injection is made close to target nerves that are well known to innervate the area of surgery. Thus, these blocks are in a sense close to the situation of the ilio-inguinal, ilio-hypogastric nerve block, where the injection is done very close to the nerves even if you cannot fully visualize both nerves (e.g. in the obese patient). The Trans-muscular Quadratus Lumborum Block (TQLB) also represents a technique where the injection is made very close to relevant nerve structures and where relatively consistent spread is also seen to the caudal parts of the thoracic paravertebral space (thereby creating a lower Thoracic ParaVetebral Block; TPVB), which partly explain its effect.<sup>6</sup> Other fascial plane blocks rely on being lucky, getting a favorable spread involving all relevant nerve structures, e.g. the TAP, QL I and II blocks. Other fascial plane block, especially the Erector Spinae Plane block (ESPB), or its close relative retrolaminar nerve block, have no defined mode of action, at least regarding how they supposedly produce any analgesic effect in front of the mid-axillary line. Furthermore, since you do not inject close to the nerve structure/structures at hand, it is not surprising that the quality of the nerve block achieved is not as dense as compared to what you achieve with an ultrasound guided proper peripheral nerve block with the injection being performed immediately close to the nerve structures. What fascial plane blocks can do: 1. Meta-analyses show that fascial plane blocks add moderately improved analgesia as compared to placebo or established clinical routine analgesic regimens.<sup>7,8</sup> 2. Provide equipotent analgesia when compared to proper regional anesthetic blocks for surgery associated with limited tissue trauma but not for more major open surgery (e.g. laparoscopic vs. open cholecystectomy).<sup>9,10</sup> 3. Produce rapid and high plasma levels, as well as prolonged elimination half-life, of local anesthetics when compared to intravenous administration.<sup>11</sup> This is caused by very rapid uptake of the local anesthetic from the site of injection by the lymphatic system.<sup>12</sup> 4. Produce local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) both in adults and children.<sup>13–16</sup> 5. Provide equipotent postoperative analgesia as compared to intravenous lidocaine in renal transplant patients.<sup>17</sup> 6. Provide worse postoperative analgesia, with a higher failure rate, when compared to proper peripheral nerve blocking techniques in association with breast surgery.<sup>18,19</sup> What fascial plane blocks cannot do: 1. Provide successful surgical anesthesia on its own, as proper regional anesthesia nerve blocking techniques can (e.g. spinal, epidural, brachial plexus, ankle blocks etc). Thus, they are best employed as part of multimodal analgesia with other systemic analgesics, rather than as sole anesthetic techniques.<sup>20</sup> 2. Spread through substantial anatomical barriers, e.g. ligament structures, in a sufficient and reliable way.<sup>12,21,22</sup> 3. Provide reliable anesthesia of the anterior part of the thorax.<sup>23,24</sup> Of cause, the above is not a fully comprehensive review of the vast literature but do provide a relevant summary of the current situation in the opinion of the author. For more in-depth critical reading, two previous communications by the author are recommended.<sup>25,26</sup> Even proponents of fascial plane blocks, in this case the ESPB, suggest that a large part of its overall moderate effect may just be due to the systemic analgesic effects of the absorbed local anesthetic (11) and this interpretation is repeated by Bryne et al.<sup>24</sup> In summary, the situation may possibly be best illustrated by a quote from a previous Editorial on fascial plane blocks: ‘…, just because fascial planes exist in most parts of the body, it does not mean that injecting local anesthetics into these fascial planes always produces relevant blockade of local nerve structures to the degree that it will produce clinically relevant intra- and postoperative analgesia.’.<sup>25</sup> <h3>References</h3> Halsted WS.

But, what selective pressures led to seed dormancy? A recent study provides a major analysis of the factors driving this trait at the global scale (Zhang et al., 2022). Using c. 12 000 species and 10 million records across the globe, they conclude that dormancy is a strategy for plants living under ‘seasonal/unpredictable’ environments; and suggest that bet-hedging could be the major mechanism behind the pattern. To reach their conclusions the authors relate the proportion of species with dormant seeds in a grid-cell global map against climate variables related to annual precipitation, temperature and seasonality. Then they showed that the most significant variables were those related to climate seasonality that they equate with unpredictable climates (although seasonal climates usually are highly predictable in their seasonal cycles). The mechanism by which an unpredictable environment selects for seed dormancy is via the bet-hedging strategy, that is, spreading germination over a number of years to reduce year-to-year variation in fitness but taking advantage of exceptionally good years for establishment (Cohen, 1966; Philippi, 1993). However, actual unpredictability (i.e. interannual variability; Cowling et al., 2005) was not tested by Zhang et al. (2022). Furthermore, it is difficult to think of a mechanism for the selection of dormancy as an adaptive response to seasonality as such (i.e. predictable intra-annual variation); here nondormancy would appear to be equally adaptive if the same seasonal conditions suitable for germination are repeated every year. There may be some correlation between seasonality and unpredictability but, from a biological point of view, they are quite different constraints and select for different plant strategies. Note that in all of these studies (and here as well, unless otherwise stated), seed dormancy refers to inherent (also called primary or organic) dormancy, which is dormancy driven by seed characteristics, and includes physical, physiological and morphological dormancy (Baskin & Baskin, 2014). Once this dormancy is broken (or if the seeds produced are nondormant), seeds still do not germinate until the hydrothermal conditions are suitable. Overcoming this additional, environmentally imposed dormancy is controlled by when the wet season actually starts or local temperatures reaching certain thresholds, but this imposed dormancy is not considered in current broad-scale studies. The importance of climatic variables, including seasonality, as correlates of (inherent) dormancy aligns well with other recent global studies focused on Fabaceae (Rubio de Casas et al., 2017; Wyse & Dickie, 2018) and on germination responses at the European scale (Carta et al., 2022). Another recent analysis of seedbank data for 2000 species across the globe (Gioria et al., 2020) considered binary variables related to habitat type, habitat openness (yes/no) and disturbance (yes/no) in addition to climate, and came up with a different conclusion. They concluded that habitat-related variables (disturbance and canopy openness), but not climate, affected the ability of seed plants to form persistent seed banks, and concluded that dormancy, the prerequisite for seedbanks, is a bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments. Overall, these studies suggest that the mechanism selecting for seed dormancy is the bet-hedging strategy for dealing with unpredictable environments. Although this is notable in some ecosystems (especially arid regions; Cohen, 1966, Philippi, 1993, Venable, 2007), here we draw attention to the fact that there are other selective pressures unrelated to climate-associated bet-hedging that have shaped seed dormancy in many species across the globe but are not recognized in these recent studies. Our own contributions have been centred on seed germination in fire-prone environments, and hence have an emphasis on fire vs climate. The best-bet strategy A large part of the world has a seasonal climate with a dry season during which the vegetation is highly flammable (mediterranean, savanna, warm temperate, and dry boreal ecosystems). In these ecosystems, wildfires are frequent. Fire intervals are usually shorter than lifespan of the dominant species; thus, they act as a selective force shaping survival and reproductive traits of plants (Keeley et al., 2012). Among the adaptive traits is fire-released seed dormancy (see reviews in Keeley, 1991, Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Fires provide both a mechanism for dormancy release (proximate cause) and conditions (postfire) optimal for germination and establishment (low competition, high resource availability, low predation, low pathogen load) that increase fitness and allow maintenance of the population (ultimate cause). Thus, fires create a unique window of opportunity for recruitment, especially among weakly competitive, shade-intolerant plants. That is, fire is worth waiting for! In order to benefit from postfire conditions, seeds of many species have acquired the ability to survive the passage of fire and detect presence of the fire gap to initiate germination. Seeds possess two means of detecting a fire event in order to break dormancy and prime the seeds for germination: they are sensitive either to heat or chemicals produced during the combustion of organic matter (collectively called ‘smoke’, although it may include ash and charcoal). Species with these mechanisms exhibit two syndromes: heat-released dormancy and smoke-released dormancy (Pausas & Lamont, 2022). The first is associated mainly with physical dormancy and the latter with physiological dormancy, although some seeds may respond to both fire cues (heat may increase permeability to by-products of combustion). There are 100s of articles that provide experimental evidence among many species of the fitness benefits (enhanced germination and seedling establishment) when their seeds are subjected to smoke or heat intensities compatible with fire (reviewed in Pausas & Lamont, 2022). In most cases, these species accumulate seeds in the soil during their entire lifespan, and recruitment occurs in a single cohort after fire (postfire seeder species; Figs 1, 2, Supporting Information Fig. S1). That is, postfire recruitment occurs in a single pulse after fire. Here selection does not favour spreading the risk of recruitment failure over many years (bet-hedging) but, instead, maximizes germination in a single year when conditions are optimal, thus following the first substantial rains after fire. We call this strategy the best-bet strategy (Table 1) or environmental matching (sensu Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Although this strategy entails risks, it has adaptive advantages when fires are sufficiently frequent and predictable to occur within the interval between plant maturation and senescence (Pausas & Keeley, 2014). In these ecosystems, seed-dormancy release is not just a fail-safe response to unpredictable seasonal climates but also a routine response following a stochastic disturbance expected within the lifespan of most species in the plant community.

The first two are recruitment from the soil seed bank, the third from a canopy seed bank (serotinous pine). Photos: J. G. Pausas (top and middle) and S. Greenler (bottom).

Fig. 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Schematic representation of the dynamics of seed recruitment for plants lacking seed dormancy (nondormant; top panel), and for plants with dormant seeds following the bet-hedging strategy (middle panel) and the best-bet strategy (bottom panel). The figure shows the moment of flowering (red asterisk; spring), the germination (black bars; autumn), the seed bank in autumn (empty bars), the recruitment 2 months later (green bars) and the fire (flame; summer). As an example, the seasons are considered as in the Northern Hemisphere, and vertical dotted lines are the end of the year. Under the bet-hedging strategy plants germinate every year, but only produce a significant recruitment in the years with the appropriated conditions (here indicated as wet year). Plants under the best-bet strategy do not germinate until a fire (the heat or the smoke) release their dormancy and then most of the seedbank germinates – thus, they maximize the germination in a single (optimal) year.

Main characteristics of the evolutionary strategies that select for seed dormancy and seed banks (bet-hedging, best-bet) and a strategy that selects for seed dormancy unrelated to seed bank (spatial bet-hedging), together with the nondormant strategy.

Fire-released dormancy is prominent in ecosystems that are seasonal and have dense, woody vegetation that limits recruitment of nondormant seeds. Under such conditions, fires are intense (crown-fire ecosystems) and create extensive gaps for recruitment. Prime examples include mediterranean, warm temperate and subtropical shrublands distributed all over the world (Menges & Kohfeldt, 1995; Bradstock et al., 2012; Keeley et al., 2012; Pausas et al., 2021). Fire-released dormancy also is present, but less important, in grassy ecosystems with scattered woody shrubs and trees (surface-fire regimes) such as Brazilian savannas (Zirondi et al., 2019). Fire-released dormancy is almost absent in deserts, extremely cold environments and rainforests; in some of these ecosystems, seed dormancy may be common but unlinked to fire (nonfire-released dormancy), and thus is more aligned to the bet-hedging strategy. For Helianthemum, a large genus in Cistaceae, loss of hard-seededness and heat-released dormancy are notable only among a few recently evolved species that now occupy fire-free habitats, such as gypsum outcrops, deserts and saline wetlands (Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Serotiny (delayed seed release and dispersal) also is a strategy to accumulate seeds over the years, in this case held in closed cones or fruits stored in the plant crown (Lamont et al., 2020). It occurs mainly among conifers (in the Northern Hemisphere), and in a range of families in the Southern Hemisphere (Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, Casuarinaceae, Bruniaceae, and more rarely among Asteraceae, Anacardiaceae and Ericaceae). Fire again is the mechanism for cone/fruit opening and for creating the appropriate environment for dispersal and for suitable recruitment conditions of the dispersed seeds. Consequently, serotinous species recruit mostly after fire and not during the interfire period. Thus, serotiny (via pyriscence, fire-induced seed release) may also be viewed as an example of accumulating a seed bank as best-bet strategy. The importance of fire does not mean that climate is unimportant in shaping seed dormancy in fire-prone ecosystems. For instance, summer temperatures determine the heat thresholds for dormancy release to ensure seed bank persistence – by avoiding germination before a fire (Zomer et al., 2022). Under a warming climate, summer temperatures may cross thresholds for dormancy release and stimulate germination under suboptimal conditions, thus depleting the seedbank and jeopardizing the postfire recruitment. In that sense, species with heat-released dormancy may be more sensitive to climate change than species with smoke-released dormancy. In addition, final germination not only depends on (inherent) dormancy release, but also on the hydrothermal conditions for germination (imposed-dormancy release), and this makes seed-bank species sensitive to climatic change. For instance, higher temperatures may maintain imposed dormancy for longer, resulting in reduced postfire germination, despite receiving the appropriate stimulus for dormancy release (e.g. fire; Arnolds et al., 2015). Furthermore, many species with seed dormancy that form the seed bank have dry fruits that are dispersed at relatively short distances (myrmecochory, autochory) and thus their potential migration in a rapidly warming planet is limited. Long-distance seed dispersal ‘Bet-hedging’ and ‘best-bet’ are two strategies that select for seed dormancy in order to accumulate a seed bank and thus delay germination until conditions become more suitable. There is a further driver that selects for seed dormancy that does not imply the formation of seed banks. Many seeds have acquired seed dormancy to facilitate long-distance dispersal and thus spread germination across the landscape. The clearest example is dispersal by vertebrate frugivores (endozoochory by birds, bats, mammals and reptiles; Levey et al., 2002, Traveset et al., 2007). Frugivores consume the fruit pulp and defaecate or regurgitate the seeds far from the mother plant. This means that seeds need to resist passage through the gut and remain intact until arriving at a new microsite for germination. In such a way, plants benefit from long-distance dispersal to a potentially optimal microsite, often including the faecal material acting as fertilizer (Dinerstein & Wemmer, 1988; Traveset et al., 2007). Thus, seeds of fleshy fruited species typically are dormant, and scarification through the gut releases their dormancy (chemical and/or mechanical scarification, and more rarely removal of inhibitors in the pulp; Traveset et al., 2007). Although bet-hedging spreads germination of seeds accumulated in the seed bank over time, this strategy spreads the annual seed crop across space and thus it could be viewed as a spatial bet-hedging strategy (Table 1). Concluding remarks Climate is by no means the only driver of seed dormancy, nor is bet-hedging the only mechanism that shapes dormancy. Correlative studies based on climate datasets are unlikely to capture the diversity of adaptive strategies plants acquired to maximize their fitness; disturbances and species interactions also need to be considered. Despite the ubiquitous presence of fire across the globe (Archibald et al., 2013) and through geological time (Scott, 2018), recent seed dormancy reviews (noted above) fail to consider fire as drivers for the evolution of seed dormancy. However, fire-prone ecosystems are hotspots of seed dormancy that allow seed banks to accumulate in both the soil and the canopy (Keeley, 1991; Lamont et al., 2020; Pausas & Lamont, 2022). We need to overcome the ‘fire blindness’ syndrome (sensu Pausas & Lamont, 2018) that still seems to prevail in much ecological research. Further studies are needed to understand and quantify the relative importance of the different strategies in various ecosystems across the globe. An interesting test of climate vs disturbance as selective factors would be to compare dormancy in closed forests that seldom burn with species in adjacent regularly burnt shrublands under the same climate. We predict that dormancy and seedbanks would be largely restricted to the fire-prone ecosystems. More research also is needed to understand the environmental conditions that maintain and release imposed dormancy (once inherent dormancy is released or does not apply) as changes in climate cues could be the key to plant success under a changing climate.

We compiled studies of 116 such sites of which 75 sites had data of bark thickness. Taking a meta-analysis approach, here we have compared the absolute and relative bark thickness (bark thickness per unit stem diameter) of oak species sharing mixed stands to generalize adaptational significance of bark in relation to fire. For the meta-analysis we considered only natural forests with adequate evidences of fire history. We gave importance to relative bark thickness, which is less sensitive to tree size than absolute thickness while comparing species. At 100 cm girth the average absolute bark thickness was significantly higher for Diploxylon pines (3.65 cm) than for oaks (2.2 cm) and Haploxylon pines (1.65 cm). On an average, the relative bark thickness was higher for the fire adapted Diploxylon pines (6.3%) than for Quercus species, (4.4%). The resource allocation efficiency was higher in pine species than for oak species, emphasizing the importance of bark characters in their persistence and range expansion. The difference between species of two principal forest genera in relative bark thickness and hence success in fire affected landscapes across a wide geographical range strongly testifies its adaptational significance to fire.","10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120081","509","","","","1872-7042","","screened_128.ris","621568","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/6.ris","1872-7042","",""

The literature suggests fire and mechanical treatments proved more variable in their effects on understory vegetation as compared to their effects on stand structure. The growing body of work comparing fire and thinning effects on understory vegetation offers an opportunity to increase the generality of conclusions through meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine if there were consistent responses of understory vegetation to these treatments in North American forests that historically experienced frequent surface fire regimes (<20 years fire return interval, FRI). Means and standard errors were extracted from 32 papers containing data on the response of four understory functional groups (herbaceous, shrub, non-native, and total) to thinning and burning treatments to calculate effect sizes. Lack of replication and inconsistent reporting of results hindered our ability to include many studies in this analysis. For each response variable (species richness and percent cover), we compared three treatment pairs: burn vs control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood to account for variation by site. The most consistent effect of the treatments was the increase in non-native species following mechanical thinning and reduction in shrub cover following a burn. These differences suggest the two treatments may not be surrogates in the short-term (less than 5 years). Increase of non-native species due to disturbance is well established but it is not clear if burning and thinning consistently have differential impacts. Response of non-native plants to disturbance is likely a complex function of a variety of site and landscape factors that cannot be evaluated by the current literature. We conclude that prescribed fire and thinning treatments can be used successfully to restore understory species richness and cover, but they can create different conditions and these potentially different outcomes need to be considered in the planning of a fuels reduction treatment. We discuss management options to reduce negative effects of the treatments and we suggest managers use current decision-making frameworks prior to designing an intervention.

This comprehensive assessment offers an in-depth overview of disaster management systems, methods, obstacles, and potential future paths. Specifically, it focuses on flood control, a significant and recurrent category of natural disasters. The analysis begins by exploring various types of natural catastrophes, including earthquakes, wildfires, and floods. It then delves into the different domains that collectively contribute to effective flood management. These domains encompass cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis and cloud computing, providing scalable and reliable infrastructure for data storage, processing, and analysis. The study investigates the potential of the Internet of Things and sensor networks to gather real-time data from flood-prone areas, enhancing situational awareness and enabling prompt actions. Model-driven engineering is examined for its utility in developing and modeling flood scenarios, aiding in preparation and response planning. This study includes the Google Earth engine (GEE) and examines previous studies involving GEE. Moreover, we discuss remote sensing; remote sensing is undoubtedly a valuable tool for disaster management, and offers geographical data in various situations. We explore the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Spatial Data Management for visualizing and analyzing spatial data and facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation during floods. In the final section, the focus shifts to the utilization of machine learning and data analytics in flood management. These methodologies offer predictive models and data-driven insights, enhancing early warning systems, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies. Through this in-depth analysis, the significance of incorporating these spheres into flood control procedures is highlighted, with the aim of improving disaster management techniques and enhancing resilience in flood-prone regions. The paper addresses existing challenges and provides future research directions, ultimately striving for a clearer and more coherent representation of disaster management techniques.","10.3390/land12081514","12","8","","","2073-445X","","screened_128.ris","621568","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/6.ris","2073-445X","","8"

These extremes are defined as long-term, unusual events that fall into the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function derived from observations at a certain location (e.g., drought and wildfire). The quantification of future climate risks is based on climate model predictions. Here, we present a review of literature focusing on extreme climate projections in the latest generation of climate models, namely, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) from 2020 to the present. We highlight the extreme events that could cause potential societal risks, including precipitation (the 90th percentile of the cumulative frequency distribution of daily precipitation), temperature (the 10th or 90th percentile of daily temperature within a reference period), droughts (meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural), floods, heat waves, and compound/concurrent extremes. Regionally, the precipitation extremes are projected to increase in North Africa (Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya), followed by drying in South Africa. Heatwaves will increase in a warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) in Asia (Indo-Gangetic Plain) and Afghanistan. The rise in heat stress intensity in Asia will augment the climate risks to agriculture under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. On a global scale, land areas are projected to face severe drought specifically in higher biomass regions, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Future droughts bring hazards to Europe and the Amazon River basin with severe aridification over Australia, the Middle East, South and North Africa, and Central Asia. The CMIP6 model projections on a regional and global scale over the US Southwest predict intense drought and hot dry summers. The study supplements the discussion section by providing insights on sources of uncertainty in extreme event projections, the role of emergent constraints in uncertainty reduction, and the impact of extremes on water resources, agriculture, and human health.","10.1007/s00704-024-04872-3","155","4","","2523","1434-4483","","screened_128.ris","621568","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/6.ris","1434-4483","2523","4"

We used Landsat data to develop maps of canopy cover for each study area, which we then used to quantify annual territory-specific habitat covariates. We modeled the relationships between territory extinction and colonization using predictor variables of habitat, disturbance (logging, fire), climate, and elevation. We found that forests with medium (40-69%) and high (>= 70%) canopy cover were the most important predictors of territory occupancy in all study areas, and that both canopy cover categories were positively correlated with occupancy. We used analysis of deviance to estimate the amount of variation explained by the habitat covariates (primarily medium and high canopy cover) and found that these covariates explained from 35% to 67% of the variation in occupancy. Climatic covariates were not correlated with occupancy dynamics and explained little of the variation in occupancy. We also conducted a post hoc analysis in which we partitioned canopy cover into 10% classes, because our original partitioning into 3 classes may have lacked sufficient resolution to identify canopy cover levels where occupancy changed abruptly. In this post hoc analysis, occupancy declined sharply when territories contained more area with <40% canopy cover, and the amount of 50-59% and 60-69% canopy cover had a more positive association with occupancy than did 40-49% canopy cover. Our results suggest that some fuels treatments intended to reduce fire risk and improve forest resilience could be located within Spotted Owl territories without adversely impacting territory occupancy if such treatments do not consistently reduce canopy cover below 50%. We suggest that future work quantify components of forest structure (e.g., large tree density, vertical complexity) known to be selected by owls and relate these characteristics to occupancy and fitness metrics.","10.1650/CONDOR-16-66.1","118","4","","747","1938-5129","","screened_128.ris","621568","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/6.ris","1938-5129","747","4"

Yet the statistical power of these data to distinguish between burned and unburned infiltration is seldom assessed, despite the typically small number of total measurements (N). Here, parametric and nonparametric statistical approaches are used to assess the primary influences on the statistical power and whether the N is sufficient to achieve a representative power of 0.9. About half of the studies examined did not achieve a power >= 0.9 at the as-sampled N, suggesting the need for post-fire infiltration studies to collect more measurements. Effect size was the primary control on power, and therefore the N needed to achieve a given power. Because effect size tends to decrease with time since fire, N generally needs to increase with time since fire in infiltration studies. Power estimates were similar for parametric and nonparametric analyses. Comparisons between infiltration methods suggested that steady state rainfall simulation produced a greater power for a given N, relative to both tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters. The greater power of the steady state rainfall simulation method was the result of smaller variability, compared to the tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters. The substantial variability of post-fire tension infiltrometer measurements may complicate using these data in meta-analyses. This work further suggests that synthesis or meta-analysis studies of post-fire soil-hydraulic properties may be more robust if data are weighted by statistical power. The differences in statistical power between infiltration measurement methods require further demonstration for a broader range of datasets before extrapolation beyond the datasets considered here.","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128019","612","","","","1879-2707","","screened_128.ris","621568","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/6.ris","1879-2707","",""

A correlation analysis was applied to the selected indicators in order to identify the most important variables contributing to each land degradation process. The analysis indicates that the most important indicators are: (i) rain seasonality affecting water erosion, water stress, and forest fires, (ii) slope gradient affecting water erosion, tillage erosion and water stress, and (iii) water scarcity soil salinization, water stress, and forest fires.

However, factors controlling PAH production in soils subjected to fires in different sites are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 143 sets of previously published data to evaluate the concentrations and composition profiles of PAHs in ash and soils associated with forest fires and to assess the impacts of soil depth, fire intensity, post-fire duration, and vegetation type on their occurrence. Compared to unburned soils, the total PAH concentrations increased by 205% (95% confidential interval of 152-269%; n = 136) in soils associated with fires. This increase surpassed that of PAH toxic equivalents (73%) because fires produce dominantly low-ring PAHs with relatively low toxicity. PAH concentrations in fire-impacted sites increased by 684%, 258%, and 155% in the ash, 0-5 cm soil depth interval, and >5 cm soil depth interval, respectively. The increases in PAH concentrations associated with mild-intensity fires (412%) exceeded those associated with moderate-intensity (163%) and high-intensity (168%) fires, which is possibly due to pyromineralization or volatilization of organic matters at high burning temperatures. These increases were highest within a month after the fire (280%), gradually decreasing over time, and showed no significant difference compared to the reference sites after 24 months. The concentration increases exhibit no major difference between various vegetation types (broad-leaved forest vs. coniferous forest vs. shrub). Assessments reveal that exposure to post-fire soil PAHs involves no serious human health risk.

However, these mechanized operations require an environmental impact assessment to identify the short-term impacts, both positive and negative. This is especially important in the Mediterranean basin given the specific climatic conditions which exist. In this study, the environmental impact of mechanized shrub harvesting is analyzed in relation to (i) changes in biodiversity and in the presence and growth of species; (ii) physical and chemical properties of the soil; and (iii) changes in forest fire risk. For this purpose, a pre-harvest inventory was conducted and post-harvest monitoring schedules of 1- and 2-year durations were established in three characteristic Mediterranean shrubland formations located in the northern-central area of the Iberian Peninsula. Our results reveal that the recovery rates in biodiversity indices after harvesting were very high, with values ranging from 30 to 70% depending on the site. Two years after harvesting, the species coverage was similar to the pre-harvest scenario in some locations, although not with regards to height, the ericaceous species being those with the greatest sprouting capacity. Significant changes in the physical and chemical properties of soils were also observed. In this regard, negative impacts such as soil compaction or slight acidification were identified at some sites. However, positive effects were also found such as an increment in carbon and nitrogen content after harvesting, along with increased litter quantity a year from the clearing operation due to biomass residue left on the ground after harvesting. Furthermore, mechanical harvesting effectively modified fire behavior in all the shrub formations 2 years after clearing, with a notable reduction in fire risk at all the studied sites.","10.3390/f9070393","9","7","","","1999-4907","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1999-4907","","7"

Lichen persistence, growth, and colonization were examined by reviewing studies on e.g. edge-effects, lichen transplants, and logging experiments. Recovery rates were examined by reviewing studies on relationships between lichen diversity and stand age. The results from the reviewed studies were analysed by various meta-analysis methods. The review showed e.g. overall negative effects of disturbance on lichen persistence, but that persistence depend on the magnitude of the disturbance (e.g. forest edge orientation and clear-cut size). However, many lichens seem to persist disturbance, and growth rates were as good in disturbed as in intact forest. The review also showed that lichen populations may need long time to recover, but that species richness does not necessarily increase over time. However, disturbance origin (logging or natural disturbance) is important to explain lichen diversity but is often confounded with stand age. The results are promising for the potential to restore and maintain lichen diversity by forest management methods based on natural disturbance regimes. Further research is needed to e.g. separate the effects of time since disturbance and disturbance type, to examine edge-effects under varying edge conditions, and to examine the influence of landscape context on stand level lichen diversity.

However, no study has evaluated the effect of regulatory actions to prohibit vegetation burning on respiratory morbidity. We examined the effect of a burning ban enforced in May 2016 on hospital visits for respiratory diseases in UNT. Methods This study used data from eight provinces in UNT. Analyses were conducted for January to April of 2014-2016 (before ban enforcement) and January to April of 2017-2018 (after ban enforcement). Particulate matter of 10 microns in diameter or smaller (PM10) concentrations, numbers of satellite fire hotspots and age-standardized rates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases before and after ban enforcement were compared. The effect of the ban on hospital visits for respiratory diseases was evaluated using an interrupted time-series analysis controlled for season-specific temporal trends, day of week, public holiday, temperature, relative humidity, number of hospitals and offset population, with gastrointestinal diseases as a negative control. A meta-analysis was performed to pool province-specific effect estimates. Results The daily average PM10 concentration and the number of fire hotspots decreased after ban enforcement in all provinces in UNT, with percent changes ranging from 5.3 to 34.3% and 14.3 to 81.5%, respectively. The adjusted pooled effect estimates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases decreased by 9.1% (95% CI: 5.1, 12.9), whereas a null association was observed for gastrointestinal diseases.

UAV path planning deals with finding the most optimal or shortest path for UAVs such that minimum energy and resources are utilized. This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning's key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.","10.1016/j.comcom.2021.01.003","168","","","114","0140-3664 and 1873-703X","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0140-3664 and 1873-703X","114",""

These forests are globally recognized for their exceptional biodiversity but are frequently threatened by wildfires. To achieve this, the study uses the space-time scan statistics permutation (STSSP) model to identify areas with a higher frequency of fires. The study also analyzes the effects of fires on the Zagros forests from 2000 to 2021 using remote-sensing MODIS data. Also, to understand the elements at risk of fire, burned areas were assessed based on the richness of vertebrate species, determined by the distribution of 88 vertebrate species. The results show that the annual fire rate in the Zagros forests is 76.2 (fire occurrences per year), calculated using the Poisson distribution. Findings show the highest fire rates are found in the northwest and a part of the south of the Zagros. The northwest of the Zagros also has the largest number of single fires and clusters, indicating a wide spatial distribution of fire in these regions. On the other side, it was unexpectedly found that these regions have the richest number of species and higher habitat value. The results demonstrate a significant correlation between the value of the habitat and the extent of burned areas (p < 0.05). The study also reveals that the greatest impact of fires is on small vertebrates. The overlap of frequent fire spots with the richest regions of Zagros oak forests in terms of vertebrate diversity emphasizes the need for strategic forest risk reduction planning, especially in these priority zones.","10.1038/s41598-024-65355-z","14","1","","","2045-2322","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","2045-2322","","1"

From a land management point of view, it is important to identify the WUI to determine areas to prioritise for fire risk prevention. It is also important to know the fire risk mitigation measures available to select the most appropriate for each specific context. In this systematic review, definitions of the WUI were investigated and physical mitigation measures for reducing the risk of fire were examined from a land management perspective. The PRISMA 2020 Statement was applied to records published until 31 December 2022 and retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and other research engines. A total of 162 publications from scientific journals and the grey literature were scrutinised and selected for analysis. Only publications providing an original definition of the WUI or proposing physical measures to reduce fire risk at the interface were retained, while those relating to emergency management and social perception were not considered. The risk of bias was reduced by internal cross-assessment by the research team. Definitions of the WUI (n = 40 publications) changed according to the research objective, varying broadly in identification of the anthropogenic and the wildland components of the interface. Terminology varied according to the definition, and the term wildland-human interface (WHI) was found to be more comprehensive than WUI. Methodological definitions of the interface ranged from using aggregated data through to identification of the buildings at risk in the interface with considerable precision. Five categories of physical fire risk mitigation measures (n = 128 publications) were identified: clearance distances, landscaping, wildland fuel management, land planning, and buildings design and materials. The most effective measures were those applied at early stages of urban development, and maintenance of assets and vegetation is crucial for preparedness. This review represents an analysis of scientific evidence on which land managers can base their actions to reduce the fire hazard risk in the WUI. The number of studies investigating the WUI is considerable, but experimental studies and quantitative results are scarce, and better communication and coordination among research groups and land management agencies is advisable.

This problem is tackled using a meta-analytical approach: (1) published estimates of charcoal source area are compiled to assess all available data and constraints, (2) the limitations and implications of these source area estimates are discussed, and (3) the parameter space of the relationship between charcoal size and dispersal distance is modelled using the published estimates as constraints and with the goal of estimating the functional charcoal source area (FCSA), or the globally applicable source area necessary to facilitate spatially-explicit fire history reconstructions and data-model comparisons. Source area estimates exist in numerous forms and flavors including direct assessments of source area (both relevant (RSAC) and potential charcoal source area (PCSA)) as well as indirect and/or opportunistic observations of dispersal distance. These estimates span several orders of magnitude and do not exhibit size dependent dispersal which may be due to differences in the flavor of source area constrained by each study, limitations of the inferences by the observed fire history at each site in time and space, the physical inability of size class differences examined in paleofire research (e.g. micron scale), to result in observable size-dependence of dispersal, or the effects of other unconstrained influences affecting dispersal and source area. The model results show the FCSA of all size fractions is limited to 50 km. This estimate of the FCSA enables spatially explicit paleofire reconstructions and climate model comparisons. However, the meta-analysis results and broad strokes approach of the model in this paper highlight the need for further research characterizing the parameters affecting charcoal dispersal as well as the limitations of fire history in delineating charcoal source area.","10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110111","562","","","","0031-0182 and 1872-616X","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0031-0182 and 1872-616X","",""

Still, it can also act as a negative force against many ecosystems. Despite some knowledge of the interactions of fire and vegetation, there is no clear understanding of how different components of fire regimes (i.e., severity, history, or frequency) influence known patterns of animal communities. Therefore, we performed a systematic review on the global responses of arthropods, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians to different fire regimes. Specifically, we focused on assessing how fire severity, history, and frequency modulate the effect of fire on the richness and abundance of faunal communities. We conducted a systematic review of 566 papers retrieved from the Scopus database. We also scrutinized all the documents included in the meta-analysis of Pastro et al. (Pastro et al. Glob Ecol Biogeogr 23:1146-1156, 2014). Our selection criteria excluded studies without data on species richness or abundance. We also excluded studies without adequate controls and those without information about the fire regime of the study zone. After careful examination, we used data from 162 studies to perform a quantitative meta-analysis. From the 162 studies meeting our selection criteria, nearly 60% of the studies are from North America, 25% from Australia, 11% from Europe, and 4% from the tropics. According to the ecological role of fire, 90% of the studies were carried out in fire-dependent ecosystems (i.e., conifer forests, natural savannas, pastures). Finally, 40% of the studies analyzed birds, 22% mammals, and 20% arthropods. The meta-analysis of the available evidence indicates that fire history is an important modulator of animal richness and abundance. Whether negative or positive, animal responses depended on the time since the last fire event. Considering that short-term studies may not capture such a long-term effect on fauna, this translates to more challenges at implementing fire management strategies. Whether or not we can anticipate the impact of the fire will then depend on future efforts to implement long-term research.","10.1186/s13717-021-00357-7","11","1","","","2192-1709","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","2192-1709","","1"

These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed. Results: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential newdirections, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of datamining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology. Conclusions: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data.

The model including combination of climatic (precipitation of driest quarter, actual evapotranspiration, and minimum temperature), geographical (distance to coast and topography complexity), and forest characteristics (tree density) performs better than any other model in explaining the distribution of disturbance agents (R-2 = 0.74). We provide global maps (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees) of current and potential future distribution of forest disturbance agents. Globally, the most frequent disturbance agent was fire (46.09 %), followed by pest outbreak (23.27 %), hydro-geomorphic disturbances (18.97 %), and wind (11.67 %). Our projections indicate spatially contrasting shifts in disturbance agents, with fire and wind risk increase between similar to 50 degrees S and similar to 40 degrees N under warming climate. In particular, the substantial increase in fire risk, exceeding 31 % in the most affected areas, is projected over Mediterranean, the western and southeast USA, African, Oceanian, and South American forests. On the other hand, pest outbreak and hydro-geomorphic disturbances are projected to increase in more southern (> similar to 50 degrees S) and northern (> similar to 40 degrees N) latitudes. Our findings are critical for understanding ongoing changes and developing mitigation strategies to maintain the ecological integrity and ecosystem services under shifts in forest disturbances. We suggest that projected shifts in the global distribution of forest disturbance agents needs to be considered to future models of vegetation or carbon sink dynamics under projected climate change.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170117","915","","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","",""

The methology used in the present literature review was designed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines. The databases used were Web of Science and SCOPUS. This systematic review comprises the 25 articles which met our selection criteria out of the 63,852 studies initially found in the search. Although the progressive incorporation of a gender perspective can be seen in the academic study of disasters within the field of social sciences, the scientific production, especially with reference to the emergency phase, remains scant. The current literature reveals the importance of taking into account the knowledge women have, as well as how they behave following a disaster of natural origin. The results of the analysis carried out demonstrate that in making visible how gender roles operate during the early response period in an emergency, especially in relation to the role played by women as active subjects, the traditional notion of rescue is extended. On the basis of this analysis, recommendations are made which can facilitate an approach to disaster risk management that guarantees gender equality in an emergency.","10.1007/s11069-022-05663-7","116","1","","51","0921-030X and 1573-0840","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0921-030X and 1573-0840","51","1"

This value is driven by aspen's ecological importance, positive impact on local economies, and aesthetic and cultural values. Generally, the scant aspen populations that remain in the Southwest lack resilience and adaptive capacity, and managers are unsure how best to maintain the species in an uncertain future. This systematic review seeks to address that need by reviewing existing literature from the Southwest on which biotic and abiotic factors influence aspen forest dynamics and by synthesizing that literature with a discussion of how management can promote aspen ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity. We found that fire and silvicultural treatments promote aspen regeneration, but chronic ungulate browse inhibits recruitment. Moreover, drought is a driver of overstory mortality and has a negative influence on recruitment. In the second half of this review, we propose three management objectives for increasing aspen resilience and adaptive capacity: (1) promote diversity in age structure, (2) mitigate ungulate impacts, and (3) enhance complexity. We consider how various management strategies could meet these objectives and highlight potential threats to aspen forest health and resilience.","10.1093/forsci/fxad004","69","3","","334","0015-749X and 1938-3738","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0015-749X and 1938-3738","334","3"

For agricultural non operating landowners, we find limited participation in land management decisions, particularly among women, a variety of individual and social factors play a role in involvement, and while they have pro-conservation attitudes, implementation of conservation practices is more limited. Absentee forest landowners we find are more willing to use management plans, yet less willing to engage in active management and risk reduction.

Understanding fire effects on soil seed banks is critical in the context of altered global fire regimes. Through a systematic and quantitative review of the literature, we provide the first global assessment of how soil seed banks respond to fire based on 539 paired comparisons. The overall effects of fire on soil seed bank richness (i.e., the species richness in soil seed bank) and abundance were negative and neutral, respectively. Wildfires and high-intensity fires led to greater decreases in the richness and abundance of the seed bank than prescribed burns and low-severity fires, respectively. As an important fire cue, the presence of simulated smoke increased seed bank richness and abundance, but simulated heat shock had no effect on both two metrics, in contrast to the findings of previous empirical studies. Strong, positive fire effects on soil seed bank abundance were found in Mediterranean ecosystems, but fire effects were negative for forest ecosystems, especially tropical forests. Both the richness and abundance of tree species in the seed bank decreased after fire. Burning only had a negative effect on the soil seed bank in habitats with no previous fire history or a short fire history. As time elapsed post-fire, the soil seed bank abundance also increased. Overall, fire tended to decrease soil seed bank richness globally, and this was especially the case for high-severity fires in non-fire-prone ecosystems. Our findings enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability in fire effects on soil seed banks, and highlight the importance of monitoring post-fire seed bank composition across ecosystems, with crucial implications for vegetation regeneration and ecosystem recovery.","10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02132","36","","","","2351-9894","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","2351-9894","",""

Prescribed fires could be a useful tool to control or eliminate invasive species; however, they are not yet fully accepted as a management tool in natural ecosystems. We conducted a systematic review to gather information on the use of fire as a tool to control invasive woody species in natural areas around the world. Our work reveals not only the scarcity of reports focusing on the effects of fire on woody plants, but also its uneven distribution across continents and subcontinents. Most studies cover areas less than 10 ha and analyze the effect of a single burn. The frequency and intensity of fires is indicated only in a few cases, despite being a key characteristic for the survival of the plants targeted for control. Almost 80 % of the studies aimed that sought to evaluate the effect of prescribed burning as a control tool for invasive woody species reported positive results in that direction, and most of them explicitly recommended prescribed burning as an effective intervention. We conclude that prescribed fires have high potential for use in invasion management, particularly in fire-adapted ecosystems, and point out some features that, if considered in the works that study the effects of fire, would allow to strengthen the evidence about its value and limitations as a management tool.","10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110602","293","","","","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","",""

Thirty-seven publications yielded 305 effect sizes for tree density and 135 for height. We found no significant effect of salvage logging on tree density or height. Also, most effect moderators were not significant. The effect size of salvage logging on tree density increased over time after logging, potentially indicating resilience to initial salvage logging impacts. Tree density in old (>100 years) disturbed forests was less negatively affected by salvage logging than in young (<50 years) and intermediate-aged forests. Study site and phylogenetic relatedness improved model fit, indicating modulation by local ecological factors and tree species characteristics. Synthesis.

This study used a meta-analysis method to synthesize up to 185 data sets from 87 studies published from 1955 to 1999. Six N response variables related to fire were examined: fuel N amount (FNA) and concentration (FNC). soil N amount (SNA) and concentration (SNC). and soil ammonium (NH4-) and nitrate (NO3-) pools. When all comparisons (fire treatment vs. control) were considered together, fire significantly reduced FNA (58%), increased soil NH4+ (94%) and NO3- (152%), and had no significant influences on FNC, SNA, and SNC. The responses of N to fire varied with different independent variables, which were vegetation type, fire type, fuel type, fuel consumption amount, fuel consumption percentage, time after fire, and soil sampling depth. The response of FNA to fire was significantly influenced by vegetation type. fuel type, and fuel consumption amount and percentage. The reduction in FNA was linearly correlated with fuel consumption percentage (r(2) = 0.978). The response of FNC to fire was only affected by fuel type. None of the seven independent variables had any effect on SNA. The responses of SNC, NH4+, and NO3- depend on soil sampling depth. The responses of both NH4+ and NO3- to fire were significantly affected by fire type and time after fire but had different temporal patterns. The soil NH4+ pool increased approximately twofold immediately after fire, then gradually declined to the prefire level after one year. The fire-induced increase in the soil NO3- pool was small (24%) immediately after fire, reached a maximum of approximately threefold of the prefire level within 0.5-1 year after fire, and then declined. This study has identified the general patterns of the responses of ecosystem N that occur for several years after fire. A key research need relevant to fire management is to understand how the short-term responses of N to fire influence the function and structure of terrestrial ecosystems in the long term.","10.2307/3060925","11","5","","1349","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","1349","5"

Logging to ""salvage"" economic returns from forests affected by natural disturbances has become increasingly prevalent globally. Despite potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for post-disturbance management are widely lacking. 2. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been conducted less than 5years following natural disturbances, and focused on non-saproxylic organisms. 3. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms) decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats increased in the number of species after salvage logging. 4. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of 17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas. Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.","10.1111/1365-2664.12945","55","1","","279","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","279","1"

We conducted a meta-analysis of population data for 4 populations in the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1990 to 2005 to assist a listing evaluation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study areas (from N to S) were on the Lassen National Forest (LAS), Eldorado National Forest (ELD), Sierra National Forest (SIE), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (SKC). These study areas represented a broad spectrum of habitat and management conditions in these mountain ranges. We estimated apparent survival probability, reproductive output, and rate of population change for spotted owls on individual study areas and for all study areas combined (meta-analysis) using model selection or model-averaging based on maximum-likelihood estimation. We followed a formal protocol to conduct this analysis that was similar to other spotted owl meta-analyses. Consistency of field and analytical methods among our studies reduced confounding methodological effects when evaluating results. We used 991 marked spotted owls in the analysis of apparent survival. Apparent survival probability was higher for adult than for subadult owls. There was little difference in apparent survival between male and female owls. Model-averaged mean estimates of apparent survival probability of adult owls varied from 0.811 +/- 0.021 for females at LAS to 0.890 +/- 0.016 for males at SKC. Apparent survival increased over time for owls of all age classes at LAS and SIE, for adults at ELD, and for second-year subadults and adults at SKC. The meta-analysis of apparent survival, which included only adult owls, confirmed an increasing trend in survival over time. Survival rates were higher for owls on SKC than on the other study areas. We analyzed data from 1,865 observations of reproductive outcomes for female spotted owls. The proportion of subadult females among all territorial females of known age ranged from 0.00 to 0.25 among study areas and years. The proportion of subadults among female spotted owls was negatively related to reproductive output (no. of young fledged/territorial F owl) for ELD and SIE. Eldorado study area and LAS showed an alternate-year trend in reproductive output, with higher output in even-numbered years. Mean annual reproductive output was 0.988 +/- 0.154 for ELD, 0.624 +/- 0.140 for LAS, 0.478 +/- 0.106 for SIE, and 0.555 +/- 0.110 for SKC. Eldorado Study Area exhibited a declining trend and the greatest variation in reproductive output over time, whereas SIE and SKC, which had the lowest reproductive output, had the lowest temporal variation. Meta-analysis confirmed that reproductive output varied among study areas. Reproductive output was highest for adults, followed by second-year subadults, and then by first-year subadults. We used 842 marked subadult and adult owls to estimate population rate of change. Modeling indicated that lambda(t) (lambda(t) is the finite rate of population change estimated using the reparameterized Jolly-Seber estimator [Pradel 1996]) was either stationary (LAS and SIE) or increasing after an initial decrease (ELD and SKC). Mean estimated lt for the 4 study areas was 1.007 (95% CI 5 0.952-1.066) for ELD; 0.973 (95% CI 5 0.946-1.001) for LAS; 0.992 (95% CI 5 0.966-1.018) for SIE; and 1.006 (95% CI 5 0.947-1.068) for SKC. The best meta-analysis model of population trend indicated that l varied across time but was similar in trend among the study areas. Our estimates of realized population change (Delta Franklin et al. 2004), which we estimated as the product 1 x (lambda) over cap (3) x (lambda) over cap (1) x ... x (lambda) over cap (k-1), were based on estimates of lambda(t) from individual study areas and did not require estimating annual population size for each study area. Trends represented the proportion of the population size in the first year that remained in each subsequent year. Similar to (lambda) over cap (t) on which they were based, these (Delta) over cap (t) showed evidence of decline over the study period for LAS and SIE. The best model indicated recruitment of male and female adult and subadults varied from 0.10 to 0.31 new territorial individuals at time t/number of territorial individuals at time t - 1 and similarly among areas. We also conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) based on results of our meta-analysis. This PVA was of limited utility for ELD and SKC study areas because 95% confidence intervals on the probability of decline or increase spanned the interval [0, 1] within 5-10 years. When we restricted inferences to 7 years, estimated probability of a >10% decline for SIE was 0.41 (95% CI 5 0.09-0.78); for LAS the probability was 0.64 (95% CI 5 0.27-0.94). In contrast, estimated probability of a >10% increase in 7 years for SIE was 0.23 (95% CI 5 0.01-0.55) and for LAS was 0.10 (95% CI 5 0.00-0.34). For comparisons, we simulated a PVA for a hypothetical population with mean lambda = 1.0 and the same temporal variation as observed in our owl populations. Our PVA suggested that both the SIE and LAS populations had higher probabilities of declining in a 7-year period than increasing but that it would be difficult to determine if a population was in a slight gradual decline. Our analysis and the repository of information on our 4 study populations provide a data-rich template for managers to monitor impacts of future management actions on the owl. Specifically, our data can be used to evaluate the effect of management strategies on spotted owls that are being implemented by the United States Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildfire in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem. Our information also provides baseline information for evaluating the status of the owl for potential listing as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.","","","174","","1","0084-0173 and 1938-5455","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0084-0173 and 1938-5455","1","174"

The potential carbon neutrality of forest biomass is a source of considerable scientific debate because of the complexity of dynamic forest ecosystems, varied feedstock types, and multiple energy production pathways. The lack of scientific consensus leaves decision makers struggling with contradicting technical advice. Analyzing previously published studies, our goal was to identify and prioritize those attributes of bioenergy greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions analysis that are most influential on length of carbon payback period. We investigated outcomes of 59 previously published forest biomass greenhouse gas emissions research studies published between 1991 and 2014. We identified attributes for each study and classified study cases by attributes. Using classification and regression tree analysis, we identified those attributes that are strong predictors of carbon payback period (e.g. the time required by the forest to recover through sequestration the carbon dioxide from biomass combusted for energy).

Additionally, we demonstrate that evaluation criteria consistency is required to facilitate equitable comparison between projects.

In the last half-century, shifts in the culture and policy of land management agencies have facilitated the management practice of letting some naturally ignited fires burn, allowing fire to fulfill its ecological role and increasing the extent of fire-related research opportunities. With the goal of identifying the global scientific advances enabled by this paradigm shift in wilderness fire management, we conducted a systematic review of publications that either (1) selected protected areas for investigation because of an active fire regime enabled by wilderness fire management, (2) studied modern fires or fire regimes deliberately located in a wilderness area, or (3) conducted applied research to support wilderness fire management.ResultsOur systematic review returned a sample of 222 publications that met these criteria, with an increase in wilderness fire science over time. Studies largely occurred in the USA and were concentrated in a relatively small number of protected areas, particularly in the Northern Rocky Mountains. As a result, this sample of wilderness fire science is highly skewed toward areas of temperate mixed-conifer forests and historical mixed-severity fire regimes. Common principal subjects of publications included fire effects (44%), wilderness fire management (18%), or fire regimes (17%), and studies tended to focus on vegetation, disturbance, or wilderness management as response variables.ConclusionsThis work identifies major scientific contributions facilitated by fire in wilderness, including self-limitation of fire, the effects of active fire regimes on forest and aquatic systems, barriers and potential solutions to wilderness fire management, and the effect of fire on wilderness recreation and visitor experiences. Our work reveals geographic and bioclimatic areas where more research attention is needed and highlights under-represented wilderness areas that could serve to fill these gaps. Finally, we identify priorities for future wilderness fire research, including the past and potential role of Indigenous and prescribed burning, the effects of changing climate and fire regimes on ecosystem processes, and how to overcome barriers to wilderness fire management.","10.1186/s42408-023-00195-2","19","1","","","1933-9747","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1933-9747","","1"

Exclusion of fire by livestock grazing and intentional suppression is thought to have been a cause of these changes. National assessments suggest that many woodlands have missed one or more low-severity surface fires and are thus in poor condition, requiring restoration. We undertook a systematic review of seven questions about fire history, fire severity, and the role of fire in these woodlands to evaluate the scientific basis for the national assessment. First, unless pi (n) over tilde ons and jumpers record fire by means of fire scars, it will be difficult to reconstruct fire history. Evidence suggests that most species of pi (n) over tilde ons and jumpers can record fire by means of scars, but scars may be uncommon or absent in some cases and common in others. This variability in scarring has competing explanations that are poorly substantiated. Second, evidence exists for at least three modes of low-severity surface fires in these woodlands: (1) spreading surface fires, (2) patchy surface fires of small extent, and (3) an absence or near absence of surface fires. Methodological problems limit our ability to assess how common each mode is, but spreading, low-severity surface fires were likely not common. Third, there are no reliable estimates of mean fire intervals for low-severity surface tires in these woodlands because of methodological problems. Fourth, fires can kill small trees in true savannas and grasslands,. helping to maintain a low tree density, but in most pi (n) over tilde on-jumper woodlands low-severity surface fires do not consistently lower tree density and may become high-severity fires. Fifth, nearly all observed fires since EuroAmerican settlement in these woodlands were high-severity fires. In only two studies is there sufficient information to allow a conclusion about whether high-severity fires have or have not increased since settlement, and in these cases the authors conclude they have not. Sixth, the fire rotation for high-severity fires is estimated in only two studies, 400 years in one case, 480 years in the other. Finally, fires may in some cases burn with mixed severity. In conclusion, national fire plans and assessments of the condition and health of pi (n) over tilde on-jumper woodlands in the western United States are based on premature and likely incorrect conclusions about the natural fire regime in pi (n) over tilde on-jumper woodlands. Local research is essential, at the present time, if effective, scientifically based restoration prescriptions are to be derived. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Forest edges have been well studied in temperate and tropical forests, but less so in less productive, disturbance-adapted boreal forests. We synthesized data on forest vegetation at edges of boreal forests and compared edge influence among edge types (fire, cut, lake/wetland; old vs. young), forest types (broadleaf vs. coniferous) and geographic regions. Our objectives were to quantify vegetation responses at edges of all types and to compare the strength and extent of edge influence among different types of edges and forests. Research was conducted using the same general sampling design in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in Sweden and Finland. We conducted a meta-analysis for a variety of response variables including forest structure, deadwood abundance, regeneration, understorey abundance and diversity, and non-vascular plant cover. We also determined the magnitude and distance of edge influence (DEI) using randomization tests. Some edge responses (lower tree basal area, tree canopy and bryophyte cover; more logs; higher regeneration) were significant overall across studies. Edge influence on ground vegetation in boreal forests was generally weak, not very extensive (DEI usually <20m) and decreased with time. We found more extensive edge influence at natural edges, at younger edges and in broadleaf forests. The comparison among regions revealed weaker edge influence in Fennoscandian forests.Synthesis. Edges created by forest harvesting do not appear to have as strong, extensive or persistent influence on vegetation in boreal as in tropical or temperate forested ecosystems. We attribute this apparent resistance to shorter canopy heights, inherent heterogeneity in boreal forests and their adaptation to frequent natural disturbance. Nevertheless, notable differences between forest structure responses to natural (fire) and anthropogenic (cut) edges raise concerns about biodiversity implications of extensive creation of anthropogenic edges. By highlighting universal responses to edge influence in boreal forests that are significant irrespective of edge or forest type, and those which vary by edge type, we provide a context for the conservation of boreal forests.","10.1111/1365-2745.12398","103","3","","550","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","550","3"

While scientific literature often describes ''inappropriate fire regimes'' as a significant threat to biodiversity, less attention has been paid to the characteristics that make a fire regime inappropriate. We go beyond this generic description and synthesize how inappropriate fire regimes contribute to declines of animal populations using threatened mammals as a case study. We developed a demographic framework for classifying mechanisms by which fire regimes cause population decline and applied the framework in a systematic review to identify fire characteristics and interacting threats associated with population declines in Australian threatened land mammals (n = 99). Inappropriate fire regimes threaten 88% of Australian threatened land mammals. Our review indicates that intense, large, and frequent fires are the primary cause of fire-related population declines, particularly through their influence on survival rates. However, several species are threatened by a lack of fire, and there is considerable uncertainty in the evidence base for fire-related declines. Climate change and predation are documented or predicted to interact with fire to exacerbate mammalian declines. This demographic framework will help target conservation actions globally and will be enhanced by empirical studies of animal survival, movement, and reproduction.","10.1111/conl.12905","15","5","","","1755-263X","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1755-263X","","5"

Therefore, we leveraged a historical study (conducted 1959-70) with remeasurements in 2015 to evaluate effects of fire season (dormant, summer), frequency (annual, biennial, periodic), and their interaction on soil physical and chemical properties in a red pine (Pinus maltose Ait.) forest in northern Minnesota, USA. To protect against across-year differences in sampling and analysis, we used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate treatment effects on soil properties. We also used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination to investigate legacy (> 45 years post-fire) treatment effects. The greatest effects of fire occurred in organic horizons, and decreased with depth. In the short-term, fire decreased organic horizon depths and nitrogen (N) and increased base cations (K, Ca, Mg) and pH in the mineral soil, whereas effects on phosphorus (P) were variable. Prescribed fire treatments had legacy effects on organic horizon and mineral soil properties > 45 years post-fire. In general, summer burns decreased nutrient stocks, whereas dormant season burns increased nutrient stocks, and the majority of legacy effects occurred in annual burn treatments, in both seasons. Legacy effects of summer burns decreased organic horizon depths, organic matter, nutrient stocks (N, P, K), and pH, as well as lower (0-15 cm) mineral soil N; whereas, the dormant annual burn increased Ca in the total forest floor and N and P in the upper (15-91 cm) mineral soil. In contrast, the summer annual burn increased P, whereas the dormant annual burn decreased pH in the lower mineral soil. Trends in short- and long-term effect sizes appeared to differ by season of burning and further magnified by increased fire frequency within season. Relative to dormant season burns, summer burns resulted in immediate and long-lasting desirable effects for red pine ecosystems (e.g., decreased forest floor depths and nutrient stocks) without persistent undesirable effects (e.g., increased nutrient stocks or changes in cation exchange capacity, soil texture, and bulk density) in the mineral soil. Our results suggest that summer burns may be a valuable approach to increase the variability in burn schedules representative of historical regional fire regimes in red pine forests, and may help promote soil characteristics that support overall ecosystem health.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.01.021","415","","","47","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","47",""

A systematic review","2018","ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE","Background: While the effects of prescribed burning on tree regeneration and on pyrophilous and/or saproxylic species are relatively well known, effects on other organisms are less clear. The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests, and whether burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Methods: The review examined primary field studies of the effects of prescribed burning on biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests in protected areas or under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternate levels of intervention were comparators. Relevant outcomes were species richness and diversity, excluding that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies were extracted from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update were undertaken using a strategy targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Grey literature and bibliographies of relevant published reviews were also searched for evidence. Studies were assessed for internal and external validity and data were extracted, using validity assessment and data extraction tools specifically designed for this review. Studies were presented in a narrative synthesis and interactive map, and those which were suitable were quantitatively synthesised using meta-analyses, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: Searches generated a total of 12,971 unique records. After screening for relevance, 244 studies (from 235 articles) were included in this review. Most studied forests were located in the USA (172/244), with the rest located in Canada, Europe and Australia. Eighty-two studies reporting 219 comparisons were included in the quantitative synthesis. Within the meta-analyses for each group of taxa, we identified a small to moderate volume of evidence, and heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Prescribed burning had significant positive effects on vascular plant richness, non-native vascular plant richness, and in broadleaf forests, herbaceous plant richness. Time since the burn, forest type and climate zone were significant moderators predicting the effect of burning on herbaceous plant richness. No other significant relationships were identified. Conclusions: Knowledge gaps exist for studies outside North America, in mixed forests and for non-plant organism outcomes. We identify a need to apply study designs consistently and appropriately, minimising the impact of confounding factors wherever possible, and to provide extensive detail in study reports. We recommend that researchers build long-term datasets charting the impacts of prescribed burning on succession. The lack of consistent findings was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators, and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. Rather than making any general recommendations on the use of prescribed burning for biodiversity restoration, we provide an evidence atlas of previous studies for researchers and practitioners to use. We observe that outcomes are still difficult to predict, and any restoration project should include a component of monitoring to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve conservation targets. Prescribed burning may have harmful effects on taxa that are conservation-dependent and careful planning is needed.","10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5","7","1","","","2047-2382","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","2047-2382","","1"

Most compound interactions occurred in North America and involved five or fewer years between disturbances. Common and interrelated disturbance legacies that facilitated compound interactions included reduced seed source availability, deadwood deposition and extraction, and increased light and growing space availability. Forest recovery was assessed with a diversity of metrics including woody and herbaceous plants, soil properties, and carbon stocks, which sometimes determined whether and what kind of compound interaction was detected. Distinctions between recovery time and trajectory, forest succession and development, and species-specific and community-level responses also influenced the detection and direction of compound interactions. Moving forward, we advocate a more holistic approach to quantify ecosystem recovery that considers multiple response variables. Other opportunities to improve compound disturbance ecology include increased emphasis on understudied disturbance types, regions, and forest types.

Here, a systematized review was conducted to explore patterns and biases in studies examining the impacts of ash on freshwater fish. Out of the 43 studies included in this review, 38 reported harmful effects of ash exposure on fish traits. The median lowest concentration of ashes capable of inducing negative effects on fish traits was found to be 2 g/L. Diet restrictions (84.6%), behavioral changes (83.3%), cytological and genetic damages (64.7%), and bioaccumulation of toxic compounds (57.1%) exhibited the highest proportions of negative results in statistical evaluations testing ash effects on fish traits. In contrast, biomarkers related to reproduction (94.7%) and metabolism (66.4%) had the highest proportion of non-significant associations between fish traits and ash exposure. Statistical models indicate that the ash source does not determine the direction (positive or negative) of its effect on fish traits. Furthermore, no evidence supports the hypothesis of similar sensitivity levels to ash exposure among phylogenetically closely related fish species.

Overall, 57 chemical and 17 physical parameters were evaluated, comprising 304 and 77 cases, respectively. Fire altered 68 % of the cases studied and contingency tables showed that this alteration was proportionally similar between chemical (66 %) and physical (75 %) properties. Nutrient concentration, metal ions, alkalinity, turbidity and temperature were parameters recurrently increased by fire (56 %), whereas oxygen mostly decreased (70 %). Our study demonstrates that fire commonly affects water quality parameters of freshwater ecosystems. Biases and resulting gaps may steer future sampling efforts and promote a broader understanding of the impacts of fire on these environments. Our results may ultimately guide applicable conservation policies for biodiversity and water management strategies of freshwater ecosystems.","10.1127/fal/2023/1488","196","2","","137","1863-9135","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1863-9135","137","2"

This study revealed that the increased interactions formed during the transformation of the energy landscape into an ecosystem could notably increase the vulnerability of the energy infrastructure. Such complex ecosystem cannot be assessed using the present state of the art models used by the energy system modelers. Therefore, this study introduces a novel analogy known as the COVID analogy to understand the propagation of disruption within and beyond the energy ecosystem and organized the present state of the art based on the COVID analogy. The analogy helps to categorize the vulnerability of the energy infrastructure into three stages. The study revealed that although there are many publications covering the vulnerability and resilience of the energy infrastructure, considering extreme climate events, the majority are focused on the direct impact of extreme climate on the energy ecosystem. In addition, most of the studies do not consider the impact of future climate variations during this assessment. The propa-gation of disruptions was assessed mainly for wildfires and hurricanes. Further, there is a clear research gap in considering vulnerability assessment for interconnected energy infrastructure. The transformation of energy systems into a complex ecosystem notably increases the complexity, making it difficult to assess vulnerability and resilience. A shift from a centralized to decentralized modeling architecture could be beneficial when considering the complexities brought by that transformation. Hybrid models consisting of both physical and data-driven machine learning techniques could also be beneficial in this context.","10.1016/j.rser.2022.113038","173","","","","1364-0321 and 1879-0690","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1364-0321 and 1879-0690","",""

The management of harvesting residues includes a range of solutions that vary from site to site, from context to context. The purpose of this review is to determine the current state-of-the-art of harvesting residue management treatments at a global scale. Our review indicates that there are few studies that compare residue management and treatment options, considering the variety of impacts and effects that can be generated. This is surprising as residue management affects residue quantity and distribution and is relevant for numerous ecological processes. The retention of fine and coarse residues can generate positive effects and impacts on various aspects of forest ecosystems including (i) biodiversity, by promoting stand regeneration and providing habitats for fauna at different levels; (ii) soil properties, by decreasing the risk of erosion and soil compaction while retaining moisture at ground level; and (iii) soil nutrients, by replenishing C, N, and micronutrient stocks. On the contrary, harvesting residues can provide material for bioenergy production and potentially other fiber industries. The removal of residues can also reduce wildfire risks and dampen insect outbreak dynamics. In this work, we provide a general outline of the role of residues as well as a summary of current management options adopted around the world. The intention of the work is to provide an information base for stakeholders including forest managers and policymakers in identifying and assessing potential alternatives for their current local practices.","10.1093/forestry/cpae041","","","","","0015-752X and 1464-3626","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0015-752X and 1464-3626","",""

This article contains terms, descriptions, and opinions used for historical context that may be culturally sensitive for some readers. Background. Understanding drivers of boreal forest dynamics supports adaptation strategies in the context of climate change. Aims. We aimed to understand how burn rates varied since the early 1700s in North American boreal forests. Methods. We used 16 fire-history study sites distributed across such forests and investigated variation in burn rates for the historical period spanning 1700-1990. These were benchmarked against recent burn rates estimated for the modern period spanning 1980-2020 using various data sources. Key results. Burn rates during the historical period for most sites showed a declining trend, particularly during the early to mid 1900s. Compared to the historical period, the modern period showed less variable and lower burn rates across sites. Mean burn rates during the modern period presented divergent trends among eastern versus northwestern sites, with increasing trends in mean burn rates in most northwestern North American sites. Conclusions. The synchronicity of trends suggests that large spatial patterns of atmospheric conditions drove burn rates in addition to regional changes in land use like fire exclusion and suppression. Implications. Low burn rates in eastern Canadian boreal forests may continue unless climate change overrides the capacity to suppress fire.","10.1071/WF22090","31","12","","1184","1049-8001 and 1448-5516","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1049-8001 and 1448-5516","1184","12"

However, overall trends for fungal response to fire, which can be especially critical in a post-fire context, have been difficult to elucidate. We used meta-analytical techniques to investigate fungal response to fire across studies, ecosystems, and fire types. Change in fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization were used as the effect size metrics in random effects models. When different types of methods for assessing fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization were considered together, there was an average reduction of 28 % in fungal species richness post fire, but no significant response in mycorrhizal colonization. In contrast, there was a 41 % reduction in fungal species richness post fire when assessed by sporocarp surveys, but fungal species richness was not significantly affected when assessed by molecular methods. Measured in situ, fire reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 21 %, yet no significant response occurred when assessed by ex situ bioassays. These findings suggest that the putative magnitude of fire effects on soil fungal communities may be dependent on the approach and assessment method used. Furthermore, biome, but not fire type (i.e., wildfire versus prescribed fire) was a significant moderator of our categorical models, suggesting that biome might be a more useful predictor of fungal species richness response to fire than fire type. Reductions in fungal species richness and in situ mycorrhizal colonization post fire declined logarithmically and approached zero (i.e., no effect) at 22 and 11 years, respectively. We concluded that fire reduces fungal species richness and in situ mycorrhizal colonization, but if conditions allow communities to recover (e.g., without subsequent disturbance, favorable growing conditions), soil fungi are resilient on decadal time scales; the resiliency of soil fungi likely contributes to the overall rapid ecosystem recovery following fire.","10.4996/fireecology.130237746","13","2","","37","1933-9747","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1933-9747","37","2"

Projections of future carbon sequestration potential typically do not account for the changing economic costs of timber and agricultural production and land use change. We integrated a dynamic forward-looking economic optimization model of global land use with results from a dynamic global vegetation model and meta-analysis of climate impacts on crop yields to project future carbon sequestration in forests. We find that the direct impacts of climate change on forests, represented by changes in dieback and forest growth, and indirect effects due to lost crop productivity, together result in a net gain of 17 Gt C in aboveground forest carbon storage from 2000 to 2100. Increases in climate-driven forest growth rates will result in an 81%-99% reduction in costs of reaching a range of global forest carbon stock targets in 2100, while the increases in dieback rates are projected to raise the costs by 57%-132%. When combined, these two direct impacts are expected to reduce the global costs of climate change mitigation in forests by more than 70%. Inclusion of the third, indirect impact of climate change on forests through reduction in crop yields, and the resulting expansion of cropland, raises the costs by 11%-38% and widens the uncertainty range. While we cannot rule out the possibility of climate change increasing mitigation costs, the central outcomes of the simultaneous impacts of climate change on forests and agriculture are 64%-86% reductions in the mitigation costs. Overall, the results suggest that concerns about climate driven dieback in forests should not inhibit the ambitions of policy makers in expanding forest-based climate solutions.","10.1088/1748-9326/ac8ec5","17","10","","","1748-9326","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1748-9326","","10"

Successful use of arthropods in this capacity win require a systematic and rigorous process, including selection of potential indicators, definition of relationships between indicators and disturbance variables, optimization of the useful range of the indicator and application of the indicator(s) in monitoring. In Canada, the single greatest impediment to the use of arthropods as ecological indicators is the importance of accurate species-level identification and the difficulty achieving it. Consequently, most work has focused on a few relatively well-known groups (e.g., epigacic carabid and staphylinid beetles and spiders, saproxylic beetles, butterflies and larger night flying moths). Many recent studies have provided baseline data about the range of natural variation and have begun to quantify arthropod responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the context of preplanned experiments or through various retrospective approaches. Carabid beetles are the best-studied group and sufficient sets of data now exist to permit a meta-analysis of the robustness of carabids as indicators across multiple spatial scales and in terms of how well they represent broader ecological responses to disturbances. There is good potential to incorporate arthropod indicators into monitoring programs in Canada, but it is necessary to first complete a scientifically credible selection process for specific ecological indicators. Future research should focus on completing the process for taxa under current study as this develops the best presently understood opportunities for using arthropod indicators in assessing various aspects of environmental change. Researchers should also consider other means of monitoring arthropod biodiversity by the use of surrogate ecological parameters such as ecological land classification and habitat classification systems.","10.5558/tfc82344-3","82","3","","344","0015-7546 and 1499-9315","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0015-7546 and 1499-9315","344","3"

Plant community composition shifted in response to princess tree invasion across all invasion stages and burn areas. Species richness and Shannon diversity values decreased in invaded plots. Overall community structure also differed in invaded plots within immature invasions (P = 0.004). The distribution of princess tree age classes in both burn areas indicates that fire promotes invasion but is not necessary for subsequent recruitment. Additionally, preliminary genetic analyses among distinct princess tree populations revealed very low genetic diversity, suggesting that a single introduction may have occurred in the LGWA. This information regarding community shift and strong post-fire recruitment by princess tree may inform management decisions by prioritizing princess tree control immediately after wildfires and immediately before and after prescribed burns.","10.1017/inp.2017.14","10","2","","125","1939-7291 and 1939-747X","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1939-7291 and 1939-747X","125","2"

Methods for this study included survey and focus groups with older adults (n = 161 and n = 10, respectively) and other high-risk groups from across Canada, that are vulnerable to these natural hazards. The main findings from this study are that current awareness and preparedness among older adults is low, though stronger perceptions of risks are associated with risks specific to geographic locations where respondents live. Several barriers, such as hazard vulnerability misperceptions, cost-related reasons, and lack of hazard awareness have resulted in low awareness and preparedness among these populations.

For snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777), post-fire landscapes could include risky open patches, as well as dense regenerating stands rich in food and cover. We analyzed snowshoe hare tortuosity, speed of movement, and amount of browse along winter foraging pathways in unburned mature forest and in dense regenerating stands or open areas with sparse regeneration 12-13 years after the Okanagan Mountain Park fire (>25 000 ha near Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada) to determine whether hares change foraging behaviour in relation to cover type. Hares moved the fastest and browsed the least in open habitats. Hares browsed most often in areas where sapling regeneration was dense; their main forage was lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon). No differences were found in pathway tortuosity in relation to cover type (open, regenerating, or mature patches). When hares moved slower along foraging pathways, they also moved slightly more tortuously and ate more.

In mixedwood forests, understory conifers such as white spruce are typically destroyed during natural disturbance harvest (NDH). Understory protection (UP) is a harvesting approach that seeks to protect understory conifers during hardwood harvesting in mixedwood forests. While understory protection harvesting has been implemented for over a decade in Alberta, Canada, there has been no assessment of its use by birds. We surveyed birds in UP and NDH harvest blocks, and the nearby unharvested forest, and evaluated differences in species richness and community composition between the three treatment types. We found NDH had significantly higher species richness than unharvested forests, but did not differ from UP. The three treatments all had significantly different avian community compositions, and NDH showed no convergence with the unharvested forest over 15 years post-harvest. However, UP represented an intermediary between NDH and unharvested forests. When comparing the oldest age class of UP with unharvested forest, we found no significant difference in the bird communities 12 years post-harvest. These results suggest that following understory protection harvest, the retained forest regenerates quickly, rapidly providing habitat to more mature forest species than NDH.","10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.033","407","","","9","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","9",""

The question of how to maximize the effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments at landscape scales is important because treating an entire landscape may be undesirable or unfeasible. We reviewed 86 simulation studies that examined landscape-scale fuel reduction treatment effectiveness for landscapes of the USA or Canada. Each of these studies tested effects of fuel reduction treatments on wildfire through comparisons of landscape scenarios differing by treatment design or other attributes. Results from these studies were summarized to assess what they reveal about factors determining fuel treatment effectiveness at landscape scales.ResultsQualifying studies focused primarily but not exclusively on forested landscapes of the western USA and ranged in size from 200 to 3,400,000 ha. Most studies showed that scenarios with fuel reduction treatments had lower levels of wildfire compared to untreated scenarios. Damaging wildfire types decreased while beneficial wildfire increased as a result of treatments in most cases where these were differentiated. Wildfire outcomes were influenced by five dimensions of treatment design (extent, placement, size, prescription, and timing) and other factors beyond the treatments (weather, climate, fire/fuel attributes, and other management inputs). Studies testing factorial combinations showed that the relative importance of these factors varied across landscapes and contexts.ConclusionsSimulation studies have highlighted general principles of effective fuel treatment design at landscape scales, including the desirability of treating extensive areas with appropriate prescriptions at sufficient frequency to reduce wildfire impacts even under extreme conditions that may be more prevalent in the future. More specific, context-dependent strategies have also been provided, such as a variety of placement schemes prioritizing the protection of different resources. Optimization algorithms were shown to be helpful for determining treatment placement and timing to achieve desired objectives under given constraints. Additional work is needed to expand the geographical scope of these studies, further examine the importance and interactions of driving factors, and assess longer-term effects of fuel reduction treatments under projected climate change.","10.1186/s42408-022-00163-2","19","1","","","1933-9747","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1933-9747","","1"

Compared with fire metaphors, health news featuring war metaphors increased both positive emotions and perceived threats of COVID-19, which in turn promoted pro-health behaviors against COVID-19 and perceived solidarity to cope with the public health crisis. Moreover, positive emotions in response to war metaphors also indirectly encouraged the retransmission of science-based COVID-19 health news.

We collected soil samples at four collection dates over an eight-month period after wildfire and amplified fungal DNA. We predicted that fungal communities within the drought and ambient treatments would differ significantly across collection dates owing to differing responses to post-wildfire conditions. Richness was stable across collection dates, regardless of precipitation treatment, in both sites. Differences between treatments were significant at every collection date with respect to taxonomical community composition. Differences in community composition between collection dates within each treatment were also significant. Additionally, the monotonic trends of drought and ambient communities over time differed in strength and direction. Differences in shrubland functional guild composition across collection dates and contrasting trends suggest a drought-dependent shift after the fire. Overall, we conclude that drought mediates how soil fungal communities respond after a wildfire in the long term, however drought effects may differ across ecosystems.","10.1016/j.soilbio.2024.109511","196","","","","0038-0717 and 1879-3428","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0038-0717 and 1879-3428","",""

Comprehending the influence of fire on soil greenhouse gas dynamics is crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms between fire disturbances and climate change. Despite work on CO2 fluxes, there is a large uncertainty as to whether and how soil CH4 and N2O fluxes change in response to fire disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. To narrow this knowledge gap, we performed a meta-analysis synthesizing 3615 paired observations from 116 global studies. Our findings revealed that fire increased global soil CH4 uptake in uplands by 23.2 %, soil CH4 emissions from peatlands by 74.7 %, and soil N2O emissions in terrestrial ecosystems (including upland and peatland) by 18.8 %. Fire increased soil CH4 uptake in boreal, temperate, and subtropical forests by 20.1 %, 38.8 %, and 30.2 %, respectively, and soil CH4 emissions in tropical forests by 193.3 %.

Our meta-regression analysis showed that the positive effects of fire on soil CH4 and N2O emissions were significantly positively correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), indicating that climate warming will amplify the positive effects of fire disturbance on soil CH4 and N2O emissions.

Such impacts are often associated with an increase of post-fire hydrological and erosive responses, which are difficult to predict. Soil erosion models have been proven to be a valuable tool in the decision-making process, from emergency response to long-term planning, however, they were not designed for post-fire conditions, so need to be adapted to include fire-induced changes. In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies testing different models and adaptations for the prediction of post-fire soil erosion. However, many of these adaptations are being applied without field validation or model performance assessment. Therefore, this study aims to describe the scientific advances in the last 20 years in post-fire soil erosion modelling research and evaluate model adaptations to burned areas that aim to include: (i) fire-induced changes in soil and ground cover; (ii) fire-induced changes in infiltration; (iii) burn severity; and (iv) mitigation measures in their predictions. This study also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, suggests potential improvements, and identifies directions for future research. Results show that studies are not homogeneously distributed worldwide, according to the model type used or by region most affected by wildfire. During calibration, 73% of cases involved model adaptation to burned conditions, and only 21% attempted to accommodate new processes. Burn severity was addressed in 75% of cases, whilst mitigation measures were simulated in 27%. Additionally, only a minor percentage of model predictions were validated with independent field data (17%) or assessed for uncertainties (13%). Therefore, further efforts are required in the adaptation of erosion models to burned conditions, to be widely used for post-fire management decisions. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Because carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and sequestered in forests and wood products, mitigation strategies to sustain and increase forest carbon sequestration are being developed. These strategies require full accounting of forest sector GHG budgets. Here, we describe a rigorous approach using over one million observations from forest inventory data and a regionally calibrated life-cycle assessment for calculating cradle-to-grave forest sector emissions and sequestration. We find that Western US forests are net sinks because there is a positive net balance of forest carbon uptake exceeding losses due to harvesting, wood product use, and combustion by wildfire. However, over 100 years of wood product usage is reducing the potential annual sink by an average of 21%, suggesting forest carbon storage can become more effective in climate mitigation through reduction in harvest, longer rotations, or more efficient wood product usage. Of the similar to 10 700 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents removed from west coast forests since 1900, 81% of it has been returned to the atmosphere or deposited in landfills. Moreover, state and federal reporting have erroneously excluded some product-related emissions, resulting in 25%-55% underestimation of state total CO2 emissions. For states seeking to reach GHG reduction mandates by 2030, it is important that state CO2 budgets are effectively determined or claimed reductions will be insufficient to mitigate climate change.","10.1088/1748-9326/ab28bb","14","9","","","1748-9326","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1748-9326","","9"

However, little is known about how fire may indirectly impact shrub performance by altering mycorrhizal symbionts. We used molecular tools, including ARISA and fungal ITS sequencing, to characterize the mycorrhizal communities on resprouting Betula nana shrubs across a fire-severity gradient after the largest tundra fire recorded in the Alaskan Arctic (July-October 2007). Fire effects on the components of fungal composition were dependant on the scale of taxonomic resolution. Variation in fungal community composition was correlated with fire severity. Fungal richness and relative abundance of dominant taxa declined with increased fire severity. Yet, in contrast to temperate and boreal regions with frequent wildfires, mycorrhizal fungi on resprouting shrubs in tundra were not strongly differentiated into fire-specialists and fire-sensitive fungi. Instead, dominant fungi, including taxa characteristic of late successional stages, were present regardless of fire severity. It is likely that the resprouting life history strategy of tundra shrubs confers resilience of dominant mycorrhizal fungi to fire disturbance by maintaining an inoculum source on the landscape after fire. Based on these results, we suggest that resprouting shrubs may facilitate post-fire vegetation regeneration and potentially the expansion of trees and shrubs under predicted scenarios of increased warming and fire disturbance in Arctic tundra.","10.2980/20-3-3620","20","3","","296","1195-6860 and 2376-7626","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1195-6860 and 2376-7626","296","3"

For the DNA fingerprinting, we analyzed both extracellular and intracellular DNA fractions of the soil metagenome. The fire impact on soil was also rated in terms of selected enzyme activities, as reliable bioindicators of biogeochemical cycles. An immediate fire-induced general decrease in enzyme activities and more durable changes in the bacterial and fungal communities structure were found, although microbial biomass was not significantly affected. Litter layer was completely turned to char and ash by the fire, but after 10 months, it showed a fair amount of DNA, a structured microbial community, and a good enzymatic activity. Overall, such relatively fast recovery was likely caused by the microbial biomass that survived the fire, which evidently adapted to the new soil conditions.","10.1097/SS.0000000000000250","184","2","","35","0038-075X and 1538-9243","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0038-075X and 1538-9243","35","2"

Though the effects of wildfire on free-living aquatic communities are relatively well-studied, how host-parasite interactions respond to fire disturbance is largely unexplored. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact design, we surveyed 10 stream sites (5 burned and 5 unburned) in the Willamette River Basin, Oregon and quantified snail host infection status and trematode parasite community structure 1 year before and two years after historic wildfires. Despite the severity of the wildfires, snail host populations did not show significant shifts in density or size distributions. We detected nine taxa of trematode parasites and overall probability of infection remained consistent over the three-year study period. However, at the taxon-specific level, we found evidence that infection probability by one trematode decreased and another increased after fire. In a larger dataset focusing on the first year after fire (9 burned, 8 unburned sites), we found evidence for subtle differences in trematode community structure, including higher Shannon diversity and evenness at the burned sites. Taken together, host-parasite interactions were remarkably stable for most taxa; for trematodes that did show responses, changes in abundance or behavior of definitive hosts may underlie observed patterns. These results have implications for using parasites as bioindicators of environmental change and suggest that aquatic snail-trematode interactions may be relatively resistant to wildfire disturbance in some ecosystems.","10.1007/s00442-023-05422-w","204","2","","401","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","401","2"

Mycorrhizas constitute a potential restoration tool for this species. Firstly, in a greenhouse we tested A. araucana growth responses to single/mixed commercial and native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculum. Secondly, in plantations under contrasting tree covers we compared the growth responses of greenhouse-grown A. araucana seedlings with and without native AMF inoculum. Four treatments were established under greenhouse conditions (25 A. araucana seedlings per treatment): T0, non-mycorrhizal control; T1, single AMF species commercial inoculum; T2, four AMF species commercial inoculum; and T3, 17 AMF species native inoculum. Seedlings were grown for 1.5 years, after which, seven growth traits and the Ritchie plant quality index were recorded. After this, in Nahuelbuta National Park (native inoculum and seeds' site), a total of 80 seedlings were sown for 13 months: 40 from T0 and 40 from T3, in two contrasting plots regarding their tree mycorrhizal dominance (ectomycorrhizal vs. arbuscular mycorrhizal). Under greenhouse conditions, native AMF inoculum, over one and four species' commercial inoculum, increased A. araucana seedlings' fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots. In situ, the sympatric combination of native seedlings and AMF inoculum growing under original soil conditions, resulted in higher plant growth and quality. Functional complementarity among AMF species probably explains our greenhouse results, as inoculum complexity is a good predictor of plant performance. Local adaptation of AMF and seedlings to soil biotic/abiotic conditions might explain our plantation results.","10.1007/s42729-023-01501-2","23","4","","6459","0718-9508 and 0718-9516","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0718-9508 and 0718-9516","6459","4"

Despite recommendations for research on the role of the microsite environment for oak regeneration, very little is known about the interacting effects of fire, soil, and surrounding plant community on oak establishment. We collected undisturbed and burned soil in the aftermath of a wildfire in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and used amplicon sequencing to identify differences in composition of bacterial and fungal communities between unburned and burned soils. To assess the effects of plant community, fire-induced shifts in soil microbial communities, and their interaction we conducted a glasshouse experiment and grew Quercus velutina seedlings in factorial treatments of plant neighbor (oak vs. pine seedling) and soil burn status (unburned vs. burned soil). Fire reduced the diversity of plant pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi and reduced the relative abundance of plant pathogenic fungi. Fire did not affect soil bacterial communities. Shifts in soil fungal community composition enhanced oak seedling root growth, but the effect of the soil microbiome was mediated by plant neighbor interactions. Seedling root growth was negatively correlated with diversity of pathogenic fungi. Root growth was enhanced in burned soil relative to unburned soil, but only when growing with a pine seedling neighbor as opposed to an oak seedling neighbor. Results from this study show that interactions between soil microbes and nearby plants can in part mediate oak seedling growth. As such, nuanced decisions that consider the ecological interactions of the microsite environment are needed to achieve desired outcomes for oak regeneration.","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119774","503","","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","",""

Fire is one such perturbation that causes significant disruption by causing mortality and altering habitats and resources for animals. Fire regimes are changing on a global scale, but the effects of these changes on animal communities are poorly understood. Arthropods are one of the most ubiquitous and diverse animal taxa on the planet and their populations are sensitive to environmental change. Given their wide-ranging impacts on ecosystem functioning, a better understanding of arthropod responses to changing fire regimes is critical and may also provide more general insights into how other groups might respond to fire. Here, we provide a comprehensive meta-analytical assessment of how fire influences the arthropod community across habitats and functional groups. Using data from 130 peer-reviewed papers across the globe, we tested how a variety of fire characteristics, including management regime, severity and time-since-fire affect arthropod populations and communities across habitats. Our results show that arthropod communities display substantial variation in response to fire and that community-level responses are most likely to be detected within the first year. Responses also vary depending on fire characteristics and habitat. Specifically, while community metrics such as diversity were increased by low severity fires, they were reduced by high severity fires. Likewise, evenness increased after prescribed burns but was reduced after wildfire. Measures of arthropod community structure decreased following fires in deserts and forests. Across the entire arthropod community, fire also had variable effects on community diversity. Fire tended to have a negative effect size on arthropods across life stages, but responses did vary among groups. Nearly all functional groups exhibited a negative response to fire with the exception of herbivores, for which abundance, diversity and richness increased after fire. Our results suggest that the increasing prevalence of high-severity wildfires are changing the structure of arthropod communities. Given their ubiquitous presence and diverse roles in terrestrial ecosystems, these community changes are likely to affect ecosystem functioning in various ways, including through increased herbivory.

They can maintain ephemeral habitat, alter local and landscape biodiversity, drive carbon balance changes and trigger whole ecosystem regime shifts. Yet, there are few theories and only limited frameworks underlying disturbance ecology by which scientists and practitioners can anticipate the impacts of novel disturbances or changes in disturbance regimes. Much of the challenge in developing and testing theories lies in the diversity of ecosystems and disturbance processes and the general inability to (a) properly replicate studies and (b) compare results across disparate systems, from bacterial communities to boreal forests. General syntheses of disturbance processes have identified key aspects of disturbance impact and response-resource stock change, resource flux change, spatial dynamics and trait diversity-that should apply across systems. Yet, application and testing remain challenging due to a lack of a common set of metrics and baselines for comparisons across systems. Here, I propose a discipline-wide effort to develop and publish standardized metrics (in addition to study-specific data) such that the field as a whole can build and test general theory that works across ecological systems. Ten metrics spanning event type, location/design data and biotic composition comprise this suite of 'minimum descriptors' and are directly derived from current disturbance ecology theory. Several examples of cross-system applicability, from bacterial studies to palaeoecological disturbances, are noted. These are example metrics, intended to open the conversation about the most appropriate and theory-based lines of commonality across the field, and they may be further refined through cross-disciplinary conversation. The result of standardizing metrics will be a coordinated dataset that allows for inter-system testing of theory, meaning disturbance ecology studies can move past disparate, seemingly unique systems with little replication to integrated research. To phrase it in another way, disturbance ecology studies should be planned, in part, to contribute to future quantitative meta-analyses. If done, we (as a community) will be much better prepared to address the challenges of emerging disturbances, novel ecosystems, and no-analogue changes in disturbance regimes which are anticipated with climate change and increasing human pressures.","10.1111/2041-210X.13702","12","12","","2276","2041-210X and 2041-2096","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","2041-210X and 2041-2096","2276","12"

In the southwestern United States, areas that were once dominated by conifer forests are now shrub- or grasslands after high-severity wildfire, an ecosystem conversion that could be permanent without human intervention. Yet, the reforestation of these landscapes is rarely successful, with a mean planted seedling survival of just 25 %. Given these low rates, we carried out a planting experiment to quantify the impacts of biochar as a soil amendment and shrubs as nurse plants on planted conifer seedling survival and growth following high-severity wildfire. We planted 1200 seedlings of three species (Pinus ponderosa, P. strobiformis, and Pseudotsuga menziesii) in a 2-ha area within the footprint of the Las Conchas fire in New Mexico, USA. We used four treatments: under shrubs, or in the open and with or without biochar in a fullfactorial design. We found that planting tree seedlings underneath shrubs increased tree seedling survival by 46 % after 3 years, with some marginal evidence that shrubs inhibited seedling diameter growth (mean R2 = 0.08). The addition of biochar increased seedling survival by 11 % but had no effect on seedling growth. Our study suggests that planted seedling survival in post-wildfire areas can be increased by planting under shrubs in soil amended with biochar. The widespread adoption of these methods may improve the success rates of postwildfire reforestation efforts in semi-arid areas, regaining some of the ecosystem services lost to high-severity wildfire.","10.1016/j.foreco.2023.120971","537","","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","",""

However, knowledge on broad-scale patterns of ecosystem and organism responses to fires is still scarce. Through a systematic quantitative review of available studies across South America, we assessed fire effects on biodiversity and abundance of different organisms (i.e., plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates), plant fitness, and soil properties under four climate types, and time since the last fire (i.e., early and late post fire). We addressed: (1) What fire effects have been studied across South America? (2) What are the overall responses of biodiversity, abundance, fitness, and soil properties to fires? (3) How do climate and time since fire modulate those responses? Results We analyzed 160 articles reporting 1465 fire responses on paired burned and unburned conditions. We found no effect of fire on biodiversity or on invertebrate abundance, a negative effect on woody plant species and vertebrate abundance, and an increase in shrub fitness. Soil in burned areas had higher bulk density and pH, and lower organic matter and nitrogen. Fire effect was significantly more positive at early than at late post fire for plant fitness and for soil phosphorus and available nitrogen. Stronger negative effects in semiarid climate compared to humid warm climate suggest that higher temperatures and water availability allow a faster ecosystem recovery after fire. Conclusions Our review highlights the complexity of the climate-fire-vegetation feedback when assessing the response of soil properties and different organisms at various levels. The resilience observed in biodiversity may be expected considering the large number of fire-prone ecosystems in South America. The recovery of invertebrate abundance, the reduction of the vertebrate abundance, and the loss of nitrogen and organic matter coincide with the responses found in global reviews at early post-fire times. The strength of these responses was further influenced by climate type and post-fire time. Our synthesis provides the first broad-scale diagnosis of fire effects in South America, helping to visualize strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in fire research. It also brings much needed information for developing adequate land management in a continent where fire plays a prominent socio-ecological role.","10.1186/s42408-021-00100-9","17","1","","","1933-9747","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1933-9747","","1"

Most of the information available is about long-term responses to wildfires often dismissing the initial transformations in the affected ecosystems after the event. In this study, we aimed to identify changes in the short-term post-fire activity of a medium-sized mammal community after a high-severity wildfire in a recently burnt Mediterranean coastal pine forest and in an identical contiguous unburnt area. Evidence of each species presence in the study area was registered at several checkpoints along selected forest paths in the burnt and unburnt areas. Potential factors of disturbance and feeding sources were also identified in each area. Data collection was carried out 3 months after the wildfire and repeated 15 months later. Spatial and temporal variation in distribution and activity between areas for each identified taxon showed different responses based on each species mobility, adaptability to changes in the ecosystem, tolerance to human presence, and diet, including prey availability. Overall activity and number of species decreased in the burnt area during the first months after the wildfire but after 15 months it increased to values approximate to the observed in the unburnt area. This study gives detailed information on mammal activity in the short-term period after a wildfire, contributing with novel information about the process of recolonization of burnt areas by mammals in Mediterranean ecosystems. It also develops post-fire assessment methods for mammal communities in burnt areas that can be used to provide a quicker response to post-fire mitigation measures.","10.1016/j.foreco.2024.121940","562","","","","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","",""

In October 2017, Northern California experienced devastating and historic wildfires leaving the community in need of support to foster emotional resilience during the recovery process. Adolescents represent a particularly vulnerable population in the wake of disaster, and digital mental health interventions may hold promise for reaching teens at scale. The present study examined the feasibility and efficacy of a mobile mental health app for disaster, Sonoma Rises. A multiple-baseline single-case experimental design (SCED) utilizing a research-enabled version of the app was employed with seven adolescents who experienced significant damage to their homes and schools in the wildfires. Participants completed daily mood ratings, weekly measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and then pre-post-measures of anxiety, depression, wellbeing, sleep, academic engagement, and perceived social support as well as quantitative and qualitative measures of intervention satisfaction and feasibility. Sonoma Rises was found to be feasible in terms of engagement, satisfaction, and likelihood of recommending to a friend. During the study, another wildfire occurred and all participants underwent a prolonged mandated evacuation and were subject to a series of extended power outages. Uptake of the publicly available version of the Sonoma Rises app among the general population was modest but engagement among users was sustained.

An improved understanding of how compounded events affect tree physiology and mortality is needed given the reliance of fire management planning on accurate estimates of postfire tree mortality. In this study, we use a toxicological dose-response approach to quantify the impact of variable-intensity drought and fire on the physiology and mortality of Pinus monticola and Pseudotsuga menziesii saplings. We show that the dose-response relationship between fire intensity and mortality shifts toward increased vulnerability under drought, indicating higher mortality with increasing drought at any fire intensity. The trajectory we observed in postfire chlorophyll fluorescence, an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency and stress, was an effective early warning sign of impending tree death. Postfire mortality modeling shows that accurate mortality classification can be achieved using prefire physiology and morphology metrics combined with fire intensity. Variable importance measures indicate that physiological condition and fire intensity have greater influence on the classification accuracy than morphological metrics. The wide range in drought and fire responses observed between this study and others highlights the need for more research on compound disturbance effects.Study Implications: An improved understanding of how drought and fire affect tree physiology and mortality is needed by natural resource managers looking to predict postfire tree mortality. This study advances our compound disturbance understanding by subjecting conifer saplings to variable drought and fire intensities and quantifying and modeling moderate-term recovery and mortality. The results show reduced physiological recovery and amplified mortality in saplings exposed to greater drought and fire intensity. Overall, this study highlights the importance of physiological condition when modeling tree mortality and could potentially be used to inform current postfire tree mortality models.","10.1093/forsci/fxae013","70","3","","189","0015-749X and 1938-3738","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0015-749X and 1938-3738","189","3"

Then, we tested these messages through two between-subject factorial online experiments in flood- and hurricane-prone U.S. states with adult samples (N = 2,286). In experiment 1 (i.e., purchasing flood insurance), the injunctive norms message using weather forecasters and the social disapproval rationale message significantly increased social norms perceptions, which in turn influenced behavioral intentions. In experiment 2 (i.e., installing water barriers), the injunctive norms message using weather forecasters, the injunctive norms message using neighbors, and the social disapproval rationale message significantly increased social norms perceptions, which in turn influenced mitigation intentions. However, the descriptive social norms message was not effective in increasing social norms perceptions. We provide some of the first empirical evidence on how organizations' risk communication can empower community members to prepare and mitigate the impact of disasters.","10.1111/risa.13957","42","11","","2550","0272-4332 and 1539-6924","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0272-4332 and 1539-6924","2550","11"

Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) communities have areas with high levels of vegetation heterogeneity and high thermal variation; however, fire removes vegetation that provides protection from predators and extreme environmental conditions. To examine the influence of microclimates on Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) nest site selection and nest success in a fire-affected landscape, we measured black bulb temperature (T-bb) and vegetation attributes (e.g., visual obstruction) at 3 spatial scales (i.e. nest bowl, microsite, and landscape) in unburned and burned areas. Nest bowls exhibited greater buffering of T-bb than both nearby microsites and the broader landscape. Notably, nest bowls were warmer in cold temperatures, and cooler in hot temperatures, than nearby microsites and the broader landscape, regardless of burn stage. Nest survival (NS) was higher for nests in unburned areas compared to nests in burned areas (unburned NS = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33-0.54; burned NS = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.46). The amount of bare ground was negatively associated with NS, but effects diminished as the amount of bare ground reached low levels. Shrub height and visual obstruction were positively associated with NS during the entire study period, whereas minimum T-bb had a weaker effect. Our findings demonstrate that thermoregulatory selection by Greater Sage-Grouse at nest sites had marginal effects on their NS. However, given that increases in vegetation structure (e.g., shrub height) provide thermal refuge and increase NS, vegetation remnants or regeneration in a post-fire landscape could be critical to Greater Sage-Grouse nesting ecology.","10.1093/ornithapp/duaa068","123","1","","","0010-5422 and 2732-4621","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0010-5422 and 2732-4621","","1"

There is a lack of consensus on whether (and to what extent) post-fire management assists or hinders managers in achieving goals, particularly in under-studied regions like eastern ponderosa pine forests. This makes it difficult for forest managers to balance among competing interests. We contrast structural and community characteristics across unburned ponderosa pine forest, severely burned ponderosa pine forest, and severely burned ponderosa pine forest treated with post-fire management with respect to three management objectives: ponderosa pine regeneration, wildland fuels control, and habitat conservation. Ponderosa pine saplings were more abundant in treated burned sites than untreated burned sites, suggesting increases in tree regeneration following tree planting; however, natural regeneration was evident in both unburned and untreated burned sites. Wildland fuels management greatly reduced snags and coarse woody debris in treated burned sites. Understory cover measurements revealed bare ground and fine woody debris were more strongly associated with untreated burned sites, and greater levels of forbs and grass were more strongly associated with treated burned sites. Wildlife habitat was greatly reduced following post-fire treatments. There were no tree cavities in treated burned sites, whereas untreated burned sites had an average of 27 +/- 7.68 cavities per hectare. Correspondingly, we found almost double the avian species richness in untreated burned sites compared to treated burned sites (22 species versus 12 species). Unburned forests and untreated burned areas had the same species richness, but hosted unique avian communities. Our results indicate conflicting outcomes with respect to management objectives, most evident in the clear costs to habitat conservation following post-fire management application.","10.3390/f10030286","10","3","","","1999-4907","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1999-4907","","3"

However, little is known about the longer -term responses of these forests to multiple disturbances and the forests' capacity to maintain ecosystem function. This is particularly so for below -ground organisms, which have received less attention than those above -ground, despite their essential contributions to forest function. We investigated rhizosphere microbial communities in a resprouting Eucalyptus marginata forest, southwestern Australia, that had experienced a severe wildfire four years previously, and a hotter drought eight years previously. Our aim was to understand how microbial communities are affected over longer -term trajectories by hotter drought and wildfire, singularly, and in combination. Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from soil samples, amplified, and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Richness, diversity, composition, and putative functional groups were then examined. We found a monotonic decrease in fungal, but not bacterial, richness and diversity with increasing disturbance with the greatest changes resulting from the combination of drought and wildfire. Overall fungal and bacterial community composition reflected a stronger effect of fire than drought, but the combination of both produced the greatest number of indicator taxa for fungi, and a significant negative effect on the abundance of several fungal functional groups. Key mycorrhizal fungi, fungal saprotrophs and fungal pathogens were found at lower proportions in sites affected by drought plus wildfire. Wildfire had a positive effect on bacterial hydrogen and bacterial nitrogen recyclers. Fungal community composition was positively correlated with live tree height. These results suggest that microbial communities, in particular key fungal functional groups, are highly responsive to wildfire following drought. Thus, a legacy of past climate conditions such as hotter drought can be important for mediating the responses of soil microbial communities to subsequent disturbance like wildfire.","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170111","915","","","","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0048-9697 and 1879-1026","",""

However, uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to decadal changes in fire frequency makes it difficult to predict the effects of altered fire regimes on the carbon cycle; for instance, we do not fully understand the long-term effects of fire on soil carbon and nutrient storage, or whether fire-driven nutrient losses limit plant productivity(4,5). Here we analyse data from 48 sites in savanna grasslands, broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning up to 65 years, during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each site. We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil carbon and nitrogen that was non-saturating through time, having 36 per cent (+/- 13 per cent) less carbon and 38 per cent (+/- 16 per cent) less nitrogen after 64 years than plots that were protected from fire. Fire-driven carbon and nitrogen losses were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests, but not in temperate and boreal needleleaf forests. We also observe comparable soil carbon and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model simulations of global vegetation. The model study predicts that the long-term losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20 per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same period. Furthermore, we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include multidecadal changes in soil carbon, especially in drier savanna grasslands. Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth, altering the carbon sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests.","10.1038/nature24668","553","7687","","194","0028-0836 and 1476-4687","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0028-0836 and 1476-4687","194","7687"

This pilot study demonstrated that the SOLAR program can be used for German survivors of various trauma types in a randomized controled trial. Satisfaction with the program was high. The results provide preliminary evidence of the program's effectiveness in reducing distress, insomnia, and functional impairment, and in increasing perceived social support and quality of life. Introduction: Many disaster and trauma survivors experience persistent subclinical distress that places them at risk of developing a mental health disorder. This study describes the first European feasibility study of a brief and scalable skills-based intervention targeting persistent subclinical distress following disasters and trauma. Method: Randomized controlled feasibility study of the Skills fOr Life Adjustment and Resilience (SOLAR) group program. German trauma survivors (N = 30) with subclinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder or functional impairment, but no current mental disorder other than adjustment disorder, were randomized to the SOLAR group program (n = 15) or to a wait-list control group (n = 15). The primary outcome was feasibility, operationalized through eligibility rate, recruitment speed, treatment adherence, dropout rate, and participant satisfaction with the program. Secondary outcomes were psychological distress, symptoms of insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, patient-centered outcomes, quality of life, and perceived social support. Results: Eligibility rate was 33.6%; recruitment speed was two days per participant; 92.9% completed at least four of five sessions; dropout rate was 10.0%; 92.3% were ""very satisfied"" with the program. Between-group change scores showed a large effect size for patient-centered outcomes. Medium effect sizes were found for symptoms of insomnia, perceived social support, and quality of life. Small effects were identified for reductions in distress and functional impairment. Discussion: The application of the SOLAR group program within a randomized controlled trial was feasible. Its efficacy should be further tested in a larger trial.","10.1037/tra0001105","14","1","","161","1942-9681 and 1942-969X","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1942-9681 and 1942-969X","161","1"

A century of aggressive logging and fire suppression in combination with conditions exacerbated by climate change have created an ongoing ecological, economic, and public health emergency. Between commercial harvests on California's working forestlands and the increasing number of acres the state treats each year for fire risk reduction and carbon sequestration, California forests generate millions of tons of woody residues annually-residues that are typically left or burned in the field. State policymakers have turned to biomass electricity generation as a key market for woody biomass in the hope that it can support sustainable forest management activities while also providing low-carbon renewable electricity. However, open questions surrounding the climate and air pollution performance of electricity generation from woody biomass have made it difficult to determine how best to manage the risks and opportunities posed by forest residues. The California Biomass Residue Emissions Characterization (C-BREC) model offers a spatially-explicit life cycle assessment framework to rigorously and transparently establish the climate and air pollution impacts of biopower from forest residues in California under current conditions. The C-BREC model characterizes the variable emissions from different biomass supply chains as well as the counterfactual emissions from prescribed burn, wildfire, and decay avoided by residue mobilization. We find that the life cycle 'carbon footprint' of biopower from woody residues generated by recent forest treatments in California ranges widely-from comparable with solar photovoltaic on the low end to comparable with natural gas on the high end. This variation stems largely from the heterogeneity in the fire and decay conditions these residues would encounter if left in the field, with utilization of residue that would otherwise have been burned in place offering the best climate and air quality performance. California's energy and forest management policies should account for this variation to ensure desired climate benefits are achieved.","10.1088/1748-9326/acbd93","18","3","","","1748-9326","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","1748-9326","","3"

To avoid the negative impacts of wildfire, prescribed fire is applied in several environments, often with post-fire soil mulching, to control wildfire hazard and erosion in burned areas. However, uncertainties remain about impacts of these forest management techniques on post-fire regeneration, especially for some forest species, such as oak, which is predominant in Mediterranean fire-prone areas. This study evaluates the effects of prescribed fire and post-fire soil mulching with fern on initial recruitment of an oak forest of Southern Italy. Acorn emergence and seedling survival as well as some important plant and root biometric characteristics (height, diameter, and dry weight) have been monitored in plots burned by prescribed fire with or without post-fire treatment with fern. The acorn rain among the experimental conditions was not statistically different, whereas the prescribed fire significantly increased acorn emergence compared to the unburned area. About 30% of acorns germinated, of which more than 70% survived. Soil mulching with fern did not significantly increase acorn emergence (35%) and plant survival (85%) compared to the burned and untreated sites, presumably due to the shadowing effect of the cut fern, which reduces the light availability for juvenile plants. However, this post-fire treatment significantly enhanced plant height (+ 44%) and root mass (+ 30%) but not its diameter (+ 6%) and root length (+ 1%). These contrasting effects in part support the initial hypothesis that soil mulching may be synergistic with the prescribed fire. Overall, the knowledge of the beneficial influences of prescribed fire and post-fire treatments on oak recruitment, thanks to the fire-tolerance character of this forest species, is useful to develop sustainable management plans for the delicate forest ecosystems of the semi-arid Mediterranean environment.","10.1007/s00468-022-02290-4","36","4","","1303","0931-1890 and 1432-2285","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","0931-1890 and 1432-2285","1303","4"

If post-fire differences in microbial communities affect soil carbon (C) pool dynamics, altered microbial communities could influence the transition of forests from C sources to C sinks during ecosystem recovery. For example, fire may change the abundance of copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria, influencing the kinetic rates of soil C pools due to differences in C-acquisition strategies and nutrient requirements. We assessed differences in soil bacterial communities and soil C pool kinetics 1 year after a wildfire in a mixed-conifer forest in northern California, United States. We determined whether differences in bacterial communities and soil C pools were related to copiotrophic versus oligotrophic life history strategies. Specifically, we assessed bacterial community oligotrophy versus copiotrophy based on phyla relative abundances and predicted 16S gene copy numbers. We then determined whether these life-histories were correlated with C pool kinetic rates. We further determined whether C degradation metabolic pathways predicted using PICRUSt2 were related to C pool kinetics. We found that copiotrophic bacteria exhibited greater abundance in burned areas than unburned areas, evidenced by increases in 16S rRNA gene copy number and by taxonomic classifications. Furthermore, the abundance of predicted metabolic pathways associated with fast-cycling C compounds increased with severity, including carbohydrate, alcohol, and amine degradation pathways, suggesting increased copiotrophic metabolic strategies. In contrast, the abundance of metabolic pathways of slow-cycling aromatic C compounds did not change, indicating oligotrophic metabolic strategies did not increase. The kinetic rate of the active C pool was positively related to the copiotrophic metabolic pathway of alcohol degradation, and negatively related to oligotrophic pathways like aromatic compound degradation. The links between C pool kinetics and phylum-level life-strategy classifications were ambiguous. Overall, our results suggest that metabolic life-strategies are related to soil C pool kinetics and could have short- and long-term impacts on soil C persistence during post-fire recovery. In the short-term, increased copiotrophy could increase soil C efflux via rapid cycling of labile C pools. However, over the longer-term lower prevalence of oligotrophic strategies could allow aromatic compounds associated with pyrogenic C to accumulate, increasing stable soil C stocks.","10.3389/ffgc.2022.873527","5","","","","2624-893X","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","2624-893X","",""

This vole is a common inhabitant of moist meadows, grasslands, and early successional sites after forest clearcutting and wildfire and may damage plantation trees on reforestation sites. We tested three hypotheses (H) that populations of M. pennsylvanicus would (H1) increase in abundance and potentially fluctuate owing to the availability of early seral post-harvest habitats associated with cumulative clearcut harvesting; and (H2) be positively associated with mean cover of herbaceous vegetation on clearcut sites; and (H3) be at lower abundance when the long-tailed vole (M. longicaudus) is present at higher numbers. Overall, mean abundances of M. pennsylvanicus were generally low, and hence differences among Periods were not formally significant. Thus, H1, that meadow voles would increase in abundance on new clearcuts was not supported, except for Period 2 with the highest mean density recorded at 14.3 voles/ha. There was some evidence of a 4-year multi-annual fluctuation in 1998 and 2002 in Period 2. Mean ground cover of total herbs, grasses, and shrubs were similar in Periods 2 and 3. However, meadow vole populations were dramatically different in these two Periods, with few meadow voles captured in Period 3 and then a decline to extirpation in Period 4. Thus, H2 was supported for Period 2, but not Period 3. Both species of voles were present at similarly low numbers (< 5/ha) with fewer meadow voles in the three years of peak numbers (22-33/ha) of long-tailed voles, and hence this pattern provided weak support for H3. The lack of increases in meadow vole numbers post-cutting in Periods 1, 3, and 4 may have been related to very high numbers of M. longicaudus in Period 1 and possibly the advent of cattle grazing and drought conditions in Periods 3 and 4. Although the decline in Microtus on post-harvest forest sites may be beneficial for pest management and reforestation, such declines may have serious consequences for predator communities, biodiversity, and other ecological functions.","10.1007/s13364-024-00746-1","","","","","2199-2401 and 2199-241X","","wos_278.ris","629345","application/x-research-info-systems","C:\\Users\\TREVOR~1.RIL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1\\RtmpqU5utu/c0f1a539da4e7cf25f1b2c30/7.ris","2199-2401 and 2199-241X","",""

During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. Objective: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. Methods: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart. Results: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. Conclusions: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents.
