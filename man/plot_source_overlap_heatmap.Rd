\title{Create a heatmap matrix showing the overlap between sources}
\usage{
plot_source_overlap_heatmap(
  data,
  cells = "source",
  facets = NULL,
  plot_type = c("counts", "percentages"),
  sort_sources = TRUE,
  interactive = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tibble with one record per row, an id column and then one column
per source indicating whether the record was found in that source.}

\item{cells}{Variable to display in the cells. Should be 'source', 'label' or 'string'}

\item{facets}{Variable in data used for facets (i.e. sub-plots). Should be NULL, 'source', 'label' or 'string'}

\item{plot_type}{Either \code{counts} (number of shared records) or \code{percentages}
(share of overlapping records).}

\item{sort_sources}{Should sources be shown based on the number of records they
contained? If FALSE, order of data is retained.}

\item{interactive}{Should returned plot be interactive and enable user to export
records underlying each field?}
}
\value{
The requested plot as a either a \code{ggplot2} object (when interactive = FALSE), which can then be
further formatted or saved using \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}}, or a \code{plotly} object when \code{interactive = TRUE}
}
\description{
Show overlap between different record sources, either by showing the
number or the percentages of shared records between any pair of sources.
}
\examples{
data <- data.frame(
  article_id = 1:500,

  source__source3 = rbinom(500, 1, .1) == 1,
  source__source4 = rbinom(500, 1, .6) == 1,
  source__source5 = rbinom(500, 1, .7) == 1
