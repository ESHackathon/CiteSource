TI  - Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Methodologies to Optimise Patient Care and Enhance Policy Decisions
SO  - EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS IN HEALTHCARE: A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK FOR CLINICIANS
SP  - 1
EP  - 46
AB  - Evidence synthesis is a term applied to a group of assessment techniques that integrate the data from variable evidence sources. These techniques are used to provide best evidence in healthcare. Evidence synthesis has several advantages when compared to single studies and traditional data integration through meta-analysis. The complexities of combining heterogeneous data sources such as the amalgamation of both qualitative and quantitative data sources can be successfully overcome by applying these techniques. Evidence synthesis can summarise data by classifying each individual source according to its quality whilst it can also quantify the degree of uncertainty in synthesis results. In this chapter, we discuss current evidence synthesis methods and consider their application for medical practitioners, scientists and policymakers. We identify the future trends and increased importance of utilising evidence synthesis for evidence-based medicine. The versatility of evidence synthesis renders it a powerful tool in attaining the ultimate goal of improved health outcomes, innovation and enhanced quality of patient care.

AB  - BackgroundEven the systematic reviews of qualitative studies are discussed health literature, the significance of their results is not fully recognised in evidence-based practice. AimThe aim of this article is to describe the systematic reviews of qualitative studies, metasynthesis and its process and consider the meaning of meta-synthesis in evidence-based practice. ConclusionsMeta-synthesis is a method for synthesising knowledge, for example, relating to service users' healthcare-related experiences and the factors that facilitate their involvement in their own care and commitment to a healthy lifestyle. This type of knowledge is needed in evidence-based practice. Meta-synthesis is a concept that includes several methodologies in synthesising qualitative research findings. This article focuses on meta-synthesis with meta-aggregation as a method for combining data from original studies. Following the principles of scientific rigour, systematic reviews synthesise the best available and critically appraised knowledge. The article describes the process and the role of systematic review of qualitative studies and discusses its significance for evidence-based practice when making clinical and administrative decisions, as well as more widely in social and political decision-making.

TI  - Structured methodology review identified seven (RETREAT) criteria for selecting qualitative evidence synthesis approaches
SO  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
VL  - 99
SP  - 41
EP  - 52
AB  - Objective: To compare and contrast different methods of qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) against criteria identified from the literature and to map their attributes to inform selection of the most appropriate QES method to answer research questions addressed by qualitative research. Study Design and Setting: Electronic databases, citation searching, and a study register were used to identify studies reporting QES methods. Attributes compiled from 26 methodological papers (2001-2014) were used as a framework for data extraction. Data were extracted into summary tables by one reviewer and then considered within the author team. Results: We identified seven considerations determining choice of methods from the methodological literature, encapsulated within the mnemonic Review question Epistemology Time/Timescale Resources Expertise Audience and purpose Type of data. We mapped 15 different published QES methods against these seven criteria. The final framework focuses on stand-alone QES methods but may also hold potential when integrating quantitative and qualitative data. Conclusion: These findings offer a contemporary perspective as a conceptual basis for future empirical investigation of the advantages and disadvantages of different methods of QES. It is hoped that this will inform appropriate selection of QES approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis in cost-effectiveness analysis
SO  - PHARMACOECONOMICS
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 1
EP  - 19
AB  - Recently, health systems internationally have begun to use cost-effectiveness research as formal inputs into decisions about which interventions and programmes should be funded from collective resources. This process has raised some important methodological questions for this area of research. This paper considers one set of issues related to the synthesis of effectiveness evidence for use in decision-analytic cost-effectiveness (CE) models, namely the need for the synthesis of all sources of available evidence, although these may not 'fit neatly' into a CE model. Commonly encountered problems include the absence of head-to-head trial evidence comparing all options under comparison, the presence of multiple endpoints from trials and different follow-up periods. Full evidence synthesis for CE analysis also needs to consider treatment effects between patient subpopulations and the use of nonrandomised evidence. Bayesian statistical methods represent a valuable set of analytical tools to utilise indirect evidence and can make a powerful contribution to the decision-analytic approach to CE analysis. This paper provides a worked example and a general overview of these methods with particular emphasis on their use in economic evaluation.

AB  - Study Design: Best evidence synthesis. Objective: To provide a detailed description of the methods undertaken in a systematic search and perform a best evidence synthesis on the frequency, determinants, assessment, interventions, course and prognosis of neck pain, and its associated disorders. Summary of Background Data: Neck pain is an important cause of health burden; however, the published information is vast, and stakeholders would benefit from a summary of the best evidence. Methods: The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders conducted a systematic search and critical review of the literature published between 1980 and 2006 to assemble the best evidence on neck pain. Citations were screened for relevance to the Neck Pain Task Force mandate, using a priori criteria, and relevant studies were critically reviewed for their internal scientific validity. Findings from studies meeting criteria for scientific validity were synthesized into a best evidence synthesis. Results: We found 3 1,878 citations, of which 1203 were relevant to the mandate of the Neck Pain Task Force. After critical review, 552 studies (46%) were judged scientifically admissible and were compiled into the best evidence synthesis. Conclusion: The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders undertook a best evidence synthesis to establish a baseline of the current best evidence on the epidemiology, assessment and classification of neck pain, as well as interventions and prognosis for this symptom. This article reports the methods used and the outcomes from the review. We found that 46% of the research literature was of acceptable scientific quality to inform clinical practice, policy-making, and future research. (J Manipulative Physiol Ther 2009;32:S39-S45)

SP  - 760

AB  - Background Evidence syntheses provide the basis for evidence-based decision making in healthcare. To judge the certainty of findings for the specific decision context evidence syntheses should consider context suitability (ie, generalizability, external validity, applicability or transferability). Our objective was to determine the status quo and to provide a comprehensive overview of existing methodological recommendations of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Systematic Review (SR) producing organizations in assessing context suitability of evidence on effectiveness of health care interventions. Additionally, we analyzed similarities and differences between the recommendations. Methods In this Integrative Review we performed a structured search for methods documents from evidence synthesis producing organizations that include recommendations on appraising context suitability in effectiveness assessments. Two reviewers independently selected documents according to predefined eligibility criteria. Data were extracted in standardized and piloted tables by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. We performed a thematic analysis to identify and summarize the main themes and categories regarding recommended context suitability assessments. Results We included 14 methods documents of 12 organizations in our synthesis. Assessment approaches are very heterogeneous both regarding the general concepts (eg, integration in the evidence synthesis preparation process) and the content of assessments (eg, assessment criteria). Conclusion Some heterogeneity seems to be justified because of the need to tailor the assessment to different settings and medical areas. However, most differences were inexplicable. More harmonization is desirable and appears possible.

VL  - 13

SP  - 1
EP  - +
AB  - Objectives: To provide an overview of methods to identify postnatal depression (PND) in primary care and to assess their validity, acceptability, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, to model estimates of cost, to assess whether any method meets UK National Screening Committee (NSC) criteria and to identify areas for future research. Data sources: Searches of 20 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CENTRAL, DARE and CDSR), forward citation searching, personal communication with authors and searching of reference lists. Review methods: A generalised linear mixed model approach to the bivariate meta-analysis was undertaken for the validation review with quality assessment using QUADAS. Within the acceptability review, a textual narrative approach was employed to synthesise qualitative and quantitative research evidence. For the clinical and cost-effectiveness reviews methods outlined by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration were followed. Probabilistic models were developed to estimate the costs associated with different identification strategies. Results: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was the most frequently explored instrument across all of the reviews. In terms of test performance, postnatally the EPDS performed reasonably well: sensitivity ranged from 0.60 (specificity 0.97) to 0.96 (specificity 0.45) for major depression only; from 0.31 (specificity 0.99) to 0.91 (specificity 0.67) for major or minor depression; and from 0.38 (specificity 0.99) to 0.86 (specificity 0.87) for any psychiatric disorder. Evidence from the acceptability review indicated that, in the majority of studies, the EPDS was acceptable to women and health-care professionals when women were forewarned of the process, when the EPDS was administered in the home, with due attention to training, with empathetic skills of the health visitor and due consideration to positive responses to question 10 about self-harm. Suggestive evidence from the clinical effectiveness review indicated that use of the EPDS, compared with usual care, may lead to reductions in the number of women with depression scores above a threshold. In the absence of existing cost-effectiveness studies of PND identification strategies, a decision-analytic model was developed. The results of the base-case analysis suggested that use of formal identification strategies did not appear to represent value for money, based on conventional thresholds of cost-effectiveness used in the NHS. However, the scenarios considered demonstrated that this conclusion was primarily driven by the costs of false positives assumed in the base-case model. Conclusions: In light of the results of our evidence synthesis and decision modelling we revisited the examination of PND screening against five of the NSC criteria. We found that the accepted criteria for a PND screening programme were not currently met. The evidence suggested that there is a simple, safe, precise and validated screening test, in principle a suitable cutoff level could be defined and that the test is acceptable to the population. Evidence surrounding clinical and cost-effectiveness of methods to identify PND is lacking. Further research should aim to identify the optimal identification strategy, in terms of key psychometric properties for postnatal populations. In particular, research comparing the performance of the Whooley and help questions, the EPDS and a generic depression measure would be informative. It would also be informative to identify the natural history of PND over time and to identify the clinical effectiveness of the most valid and acceptable method to identify PND. Further research within a randomised controlled trial would provide robust estimates of the clinical effectiveness.

AB  - In 25 patients with the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis the intrathecal secretion of specific antiborrelia antibodies was assessed and compared with evidence of Borrelia DNA in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Autochthonous production of antiborrelia antibodies was assessed by calculation using the specific antibody index AI(Bb) and for detection of the DNA of spirochete the authors used the two-stage polymerase chain reaction (,,nested" PCR) with three sets of primers: for the plasmid gene coding OspC protein and for chromosomal genes coding 16S rDNA and flagellin. Specific antiborrelia antibodies in serum were detected in 20 (80%) patients and intrathecal synthesis of specific IgG antibodies was found in 22/(88%) of the examined subjects. DNA spirochetes were detected in cerebrospinal fluid 12x (48%) and in plasma 6x (24%). At least once DNA of borrelias in some examined biological material was detected in 13 (52%) of the patients. In 3 patients DNA was detected and no specific antibodies were found. By comparison of results of assessment of autochthonous production of antiborrelia antibodies and PCR it was revealed that the method of calculation of the antibody index was more sensitive (88%) as compared with ,,direct" evidence of the spirochete in cerebrospinal fluid (48%) and in plasma (24%) before antibiotic therapy. The assembled results showed that the PCR for detection of borrelias can usefully supplement the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis but cannot replace,,classical" serology.

SO  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
VL  - 176
SP  - 54
EP  - 62
AB  - The volume of primary literature in conservation and environmental science is expanding rapidly. Evidence syntheses that review and combine the findings from research on policy-relevant questions are therefore vital for informing decision-making. However, such syntheses exhibit considerable variation in conduct and reporting, potentially undermining their value to decision-makers. To address this problem, we developed a scoring system - the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Synthesis Assessment Tool (CEESAT) - that uses detailed criteria and guidelines to evaluate policy-relevant syntheses in conservation and environmental science. The higher the score awarded, the greater the objectivity, comprehensiveness and transparency of the synthesis, hence the greater the confidence in its reliability. We then used 40 review articles to test CEESAT in terms of (i) applicability to different syntheses, (ii) validity of scores awarded, (iii) effectiveness at discriminating between syntheses, and (iv) repeatability of scoring by different assessors. CEESAT was applicable to 36 articles, and scores ranged from 1 to 33 (mean = 13.2, median = 15, maximum possible = 39). Variation in overall scores and in the individual criteria shows that CEESAT discriminates effectively among syntheses, making differences in rigour clear. Scoring was repeatable, indicating that assessments are not overly susceptible to differences in the application and interpretation of guidelines. The detailed rationale and guidelines for each criterion should help improve future syntheses and promote consistent scoring between assessors. Furthermore, scores can be used directly by non-specialists to compare syntheses that investigate key conservation questions and to incorporate reliability and rigour into decision-making.

TI  - Methods of Monitoring Internal and External Loads and Their Relationships with Physical Qualities, Injury, or Illness in Adolescent Athletes: A Systematic Review and Best-Evidence Synthesis
SO  - SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundWith the increasing professionalisation of youth sports, training load monitoring is increasingly common in adolescent athletes. However, the research examining the relationship between training load and changes in physical qualities, injury, or illness in adolescent athletes is yet to be synthesised in a systematic review.ObjectiveThe aim of this review was to systematically examine the research assessing internal and external methods of monitoring training load and physical qualities, injury, or illness in adolescent athletes.MethodsSystematic searches of SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL and SCOPUS were undertaken from the earliest possible records to March 2022. Search terms included synonyms relevant to adolescents, athletes, physical qualities, injury, or illness. To be eligible for inclusion, articles were required to (1) be original research articles; (2) be published in a peer-reviewed journal; (3) include participants aged between 10 and 19 years and participating in competitive sport; (4) report a statistical relationship between a measure of internal and/or external load and physical qualities, injury or illness. Articles were screened and assessed for methodological quality. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted to identify trends in the relationships reported.ResultsThe electronic search yielded 4125 articles. Following screening and a review of references, 59 articles were included. The most commonly reported load monitoring tools were session ratings of perceived exertion (n = 29) and training duration (n = 22). Results of the best-evidence synthesis identified moderate evidence of positive relationships between resistance training volume load and improvement in strength, and between throw count and injury. However, evidence for other relationships between training load and change in physical qualities, injury, or illness were limited or inconsistent.ConclusionsPractitioners should consider monitoring resistance training volume load for strength training. Additionally, where appropriate, monitoring throw counts may be useful in identifying injury risk. However, given the lack of clear relationships between singular measures of training load with physical qualities, injury, or illness, researchers should consider multivariate methods of analysing training load, as well as factors that may mediate the load-response relationship, such as maturation.

TI  - Toward a comprehensive evidence map of overview of systematic review methods: paper 2-risk of bias assessment; synthesis, presentation and summary of the findings; and assessment of the certainty of the evidence
SO  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Overviews of systematic reviews (SRs) attempt to systematically retrieve and summarise the results of multiple systematic reviews. This is the second of two papers from a study aiming to develop a comprehensive evidence map of the methods used in overviews. Our objectives were to (a) develop a framework of methods for conducting, interpreting and reporting overviews (stage I)-the Methods for Overviews of Reviews (MOoR) framework-and (b) to create an evidence map by mapping studies that have evaluated overview methods to the framework (stage II). In the first paper, we reported findings for the four initial steps of an overview (specification of purpose, objectives and scope; eligibility criteria; search methods; data extraction). In this paper, we report the remaining steps: assessing risk of bias; synthesis, presentation and summary of the findings; and assessing certainty of the evidence arising from the overview. Methods: In stage I, we identified cross-sectional studies, guidance documents and commentaries that described methods proposed for, or used in, overviews. Based on these studies, we developed a framework of possible methods for overviews, categorised by the steps in conducting an overview. Multiple iterations of the framework were discussed and refined by all authors. In stage II, we identified studies evaluating methods and mapped these evaluations to the framework. Results: Forty-two stage I studies described methods relevant to one or more of the latter steps of an overview. Six studies evaluating methods were included in stage II. These mapped to steps involving (i) the assessment of risk of bias (RoB) in SRs (two SRs and three primary studies, all reporting evaluation of RoB tools) and (ii) the synthesis, presentation and summary of the findings (one primary study evaluating methods for measuring overlap). Conclusion: Many methods have been described for use in the latter steps in conducting an overview; however, evaluation and guidance for applying these methods is sparse. The exception is RoB assessment, for which a multitude of tools exist-several with sufficient evaluation and guidance to recommend their use. Evaluation of other methods is required to provide a comprehensive evidence map.

VL  - 9
IS  - 3
SP  - 352
EP  - 360
AB  - In studies with time-to-event data, outcomes may be reported as hazard ratios (HR) or binomial counts/proportions at a specific time point. If the intent is to synthesise evidence by performing a meta-analysis or network meta-analysis (NMA) using the HR as the measure of treatment effect, studies that only report binomial data cannot be included in the network. Methods for converting binomial data to HRs were investigated, so that studies reporting binomial data only could be included in a network of HR data. Estimating the log HR is relatively straightforward under the assumptions of proportional hazards and minimal censoring at the binomial data time point. Estimating the standard error of the log HR is harder, but a simple method based on using a Taylor series expansion to approximate the variance is proposed. Thus, we have 2 easy-to-calculate equations for the log HR and variance. The performance of the method was assessed using simulations and data from a NMA of multiple sclerosis treatments. In the simulation, our binomial method produced very similar HRs to those from survival analysis when censoring rates were low, and also when censoring rates were high but the event rate was low. In all situations, it outperformed using relative risk to approximate the HR. In the NMA, results were consistent between reported HRs and HRs derived from binomial data for studies that reported both types of data. This method may be useful for easily incorporating trials reporting binomial data into an evidence synthesis of HR data, under certain assumptions.

SP  - 4949
EP  - 4954
AB  - Since the evidence classification synthetic method is not enough accurate in the classification of general evidence and conflict evidence, it leads to the final fusion is not precise. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the D-S evidence classification synthesis rule, this paper redefines evidence classification attributes in the basis of the similarity between evidences and utilizing the employed information entropy attribute. Combining with the similarity attribute, the evidence could be divided into high credibility evidence, general evidence and conflict evidence. According to the division, the evidence set classified is assigned with different importance coefficients, which could be revised to improve. After improving, the general evidence and high conflict evidence are pushed close to the high credibility evidence opinion. Finally, the revised evidence is synthesized with the D-S evidence combination rule. Experimental results show that the improved approach not only solve the conflict issue well, but also reduce the evidence uncertainty. And thus, better data fusion is achieved.

SO  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
VL  - 97
SP  - 39
EP  - 48
AB  - This paper updates previous Cochrane guidance on question formulation, searching, and protocol development, reflecting recent developments in methods for conducting qualitative evidence syntheses to inform Cochrane intervention reviews. Examples are used to illustrate how decisions about boundaries for a review are formed via an iterative process of constructing lines of inquiry and mapping the available information to ascertain whether evidence exists to answer questions related to effectiveness, implementation, feasibility, appropriateness, economic evidence, and equity. The process of question formulation allows reviewers to situate the topic in relation to how it informs and explains effectiveness, using the criterion of meaningfulness, appropriateness, feasibility, and implementation. Questions related to complex questions and interventions can be structured by drawing on an increasingly wide range of question frameworks. Logic models and theoretical frameworks are useful tools for conceptually mapping the literature to illustrate the complexity of the phenomenon of interest. Furthermore, protocol development may require iterative question formulation and searching. Consequently, the final protocol may function as a guide rather than a prescriptive route map, particularly in qualitative reviews that ask more exploratory and open-ended questions.

EP  - 19078
AB  - In this paper, we report on a new path of ZnWO4 phase formation, synthesized by the polymerizable complex (PC) method. At 550 degrees C, we obtained a single phase of the ZnWO4 complex oxide. To explain the phase transformation processes, we propose a mechanism based on the coexistence of more than one amorphous phase after the pre-pyrolysis process. These amorphous metastable phases indicate a different phase formation path, which has not yet been described in the literature for multi-component oxides processed by the PC method. The formation path proposed here shows the relevance of the metastable phases in the reaction processes of complex oxides.

TI  - Applying GRADE-CERQual to qualitative evidence synthesis findings-paper 3: how to assess methodological limitations
SO  - IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
VL  - 13
AB  - Background: The GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach has been developed by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Working Group. The approach has been developed to support the use of findings from qualitative evidence syntheses in decision-making, including guideline development and policy formulation. CERQual includes four components for assessing how much confidence to place in findings from reviews of qualitative research (also referred to as qualitative evidence syntheses): (1) methodological limitations, (2) coherence, (3) adequacy of data and (4) relevance. This paper is part of a series providing guidance on how to apply CERQual and focuses on CERQual's methodological limitations component. Methods: We developed the methodological limitations component by searching the literature for definitions, gathering feedback from relevant research communities and developing consensus through project group meetings. We tested the CERQual methodological limitations component within several qualitative evidence syntheses before agreeing on the current definition and principles for application. Results: When applying CERQual, we define methodological limitations as the extent to which there are concerns about the design or conduct of the primary studies that contributed evidence to an individual review finding. In this paper, we describe the methodological limitations component and its rationale and offer guidance on how to assess methodological limitations of a review finding as part of the CERQual approach. This guidance outlines the information required to assess methodological limitations component, the steps that need to be taken to assess methodological limitations of data contributing to a review finding and examples of methodological limitation assessments. Conclusions: This paper provides guidance for review authors and others on undertaking an assessment of methodological limitations in the context of the CERQual approach. More work is needed to determine which criteria critical appraisal tools should include when assessing methodological limitations. We currently recommend that whichever tool is used, review authors provide a transparent description of their assessments of methodological limitations in a review finding. We expect the CERQual approach and its individual components to develop further as our experiences with the practical implementation of the approach increase.

TI  - Evidence Synthesis as the Basis for Decision Analysis: A Method of Selecting the Best Agricultural Practices for Multiple Ecosystem Services
SO  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
VL  - 3
AB  - Agricultural management practices have impacts not only on crops and livestock, but also on soil, water, wildlife, and ecosystem services. Agricultural research provides evidence about these impacts, but it is unclear how this evidence should be used to make decisions. Two methods are widely used in decision making: evidence synthesis and decision analysis. However, a system of evidence-based decision making that integrates these two methods has not yet been established. Moreover, the standard methods of evidence synthesis have a narrow focus (e.g., the effects of onemanagement practice), but the standard methods of decision analysis have a wide focus (e.g., the comparative effectiveness of multiple management practices). Thus, there is a mismatch between the outputs from evidence synthesis and the inputs that are needed for decision analysis. We show how evidence for a wide range of agricultural practices can be reviewed and summarized simultaneously ("subject-wide evidence synthesis"), and how this evidence can be assessed by experts and used for decision making ("multiple-criteria decision analysis"). We show how these methods could be used by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in California to select the best management practices for multiple ecosystem services in Mediterranean-type farmland and rangeland, based on a subject-wide evidence synthesis that was published by Conservation Evidence (www.conservationevidence.com). This method of "evidence-based decision analysis" could be used at different scales, from the local scale (farmers deciding which practices to adopt) to the national or international scale (policy makers deciding which practices to support through agricultural subsidies or other payments for ecosystem services). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this method, and we suggest some general principles for improving evidence synthesis as the basis for multi-criteria decision analysis.

TI  - The effectiveness and acceptability of evidence synthesis summary formats for clinical guideline development groups: a mixed-methods systematic review
SO  - IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - Introduction Clinical guideline development often involves a rigorous synthesis of evidence involving multidisciplinary stakeholders with different priorities and knowledge of evidence synthesis; this makes communicating findings complex. Summary formats are typically used to communicate the results of evidence syntheses; however, there is little consensus on which formats are most effective and acceptable for different stakeholders. Methods This mixed-methods systematic review (MMSR) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability (e.g. preferences and attitudes and preferences towards) of evidence synthesis summary formats for GDG members. We followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis for MMSRs. We searched six databases (inception to April 20, 2021) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RCTs with a qualitative component, and qualitative studies. Screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed in duplicate. Qualitative findings were synthesised using meta-aggregation, and quantitative findings are described narratively. Results We identified 17,240 citations and screened 54 full-text articles, resulting in 22 eligible articles (20 unique studies): 4 articles reported the results of 5 RCTs, one of which also had a qualitative component. The other 18 articles discussed the results of 16 qualitative studies. Therefore, we had 5 trials and 17 qualitative studies to extract data from. Studies were geographically heterogeneous and included a variety of stakeholders and summary formats. All 5 RCTs assessed knowledge or understanding with 3 reporting improvement with newer formats. The qualitative analysis identified 6 categories of recommendations: 'presenting information', 'tailoring information' for end users, 'trust in producers and summary', 'knowledge required' to understand findings, 'quality of evidence', and properly 'contextualising information'. Across these categories, the synthesis resulted in 126 recommendations for practice. Nine recommendations were supported by both quantitative and qualitative evidence and 116 by only qualitative. A majority focused on how to present information (n = 64) and tailor content for different end users (n = 24). Conclusions This MMSR provides guidance on how to improve evidence summary structure and layout. This can be used by synthesis producers to better communicate to GDGs. Study findings will inform the co-creation of evidence summary format prototypes based on GDG member's needs. Trial registration The protocol for this project was previously published, and the project was preregistered on Open Science Framework (Clyne and Sharp, Evidence synthesis and translation of findings for national clinical guideline development: addressing the needs and preferences of guideline development groups, 2021; Sharp and Clyne, Evidence synthesis summary formats for decision-makers and Clinical Guideline Development Groups: A mixed-methods systematic review protocol, 2021).

SO  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
VL  - 13

SP  - 667
EP  - 680
AB  - Reviewing complex interventions is challenging because they include many elements that can interact dynamically in a nonlinear manner. A systems perspective offers a way of thinking to help understand complex issues, but its application in evidence synthesis is not established. The aim of this project was to understand how and why systems perspectives have been applied in evidence synthesis. A methodological mapping review was conducted to identify papers using a systems perspective in evidence synthesis. A search was conducted in seven bibliographic databases and three search engines. A total of 101 papers (representing 98 reviews) met the eligibility criteria. Two categories of reviews were identified: (1) reviews using a "systems lens" to frame the topic, generate hypotheses, select studies, and guide the analysis and interpretation of findings (n = 76) and (2) reviews using systems methods to develop a systems model (n = 22). Several methods (e.g., systems dynamic modeling, soft systems approach) were identified, and they were used to identify, rank and select elements, analyze interactions, develop models, and forecast needs. The main reasons for using a systems perspective were to address complexity, view the problem as a whole, and understand the interrelationships between the elements. Several challenges for capturing the true nature and complexity of a problem were raised when performing these methods. This review is a useful starting point when designing evidence synthesis of complex interventions. It identifies different opportunities for applying a systems perspective in evidence synthesis, and highlights both commonplace and less familiar methods.

SO  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - One of the most important steps in the process of conducting a systematic review or map is data extraction and the production of a database of coding, metadata and study data. There are many ways to structure these data, but to date, no guidelines or standards have been produced for the evidence synthesis community to support their production. Furthermore, there is little adoption of easily machine-readable, readily reusable and adaptable databases: these databases would be easier to translate into different formats by review authors, for example for tabulation, visualisation and analysis, and also by readers of the review/map. As a result, it is common for systematic review and map authors to produce bespoke, complex data structures that, although typically provided digitally, require considerable efforts to understand, verify and reuse. Here, we report on an analysis of systematic reviews and maps published by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, and discuss major issues that hamper machine readability and data reuse or verification. We highlight different justifications for the alternative data formats found: condensed databases; long databases; and wide databases. We describe these challenges in the context of data science principles that can support curation and publication of machine-readable, Open Data. We then go on to make recommendations to review and map authors on how to plan and structure their data, and we provide a suite of novel R-based functions to support efficient and reliable translation of databases between formats that are useful for presentation (condensed, human readable tables), filtering and visualisation (wide databases), and analysis (long databases). We hope that our recommendations for adoption of standard practices in database formatting, and the tools necessary to rapidly move between formats will provide a step-change in transparency and replicability of Open Data in evidence synthesis.

SO  - BMJ OPEN
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
AB  - Objectives To systematically review published pretrial qualitative research studies and explore how their findings were used to inform recruitment and retention processes in full-scale trials. Design Qualitative evidence synthesis using thematic analysis. Data sources and eligibility criteria We conducted a comprehensive search of databases; Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts and PsycINFO. We included all reports of pretrial qualitative data on recruitment and retention in clinical trials up to March 2018. Data extraction and synthesis Two authors independently extracted data using a predefined data extraction form that captured study aims, design, methodological approach and main findings, including barriers and facilitators to recruitment and or retention. The synthesis was undertaken using Thomas and Harden's thematic synthesis method and reported following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research guidelines. Confidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research approach. Results Thirty-five papers (connected to 31 feasibility studies) from three different countries, published between 2010 and 2017 were included. All studies were embedded in pilot or feasibility studies to inform design aspects in preparation for a subsequent full-scale trial. Twelve themes were identified as recruitment barriers and three as recruitment facilitators. Two themes were identified as barriers for retention and none as retention facilitators. The findings from qualitative research in feasibility or pilot trials are often not explicitly linked to proposed changes to the recruitment and retention strategies to be used in the future or planned full-scale trial. Conclusions Many trial teams do pretrial qualitative work with the aim of improving recruitment and retention in future full-scale trials. Just over half of all reports of such work do not clearly show how their findings will change the recruitment and retention strategy of the future trial. The scope of pretrial work needs to expand beyond looking for problems and also look for what might help and spend more time on retention.

SO  - ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION
VL  - 23
IS  - 4
SP  - 833
EP  - 851
AB  - Qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) is a suite of methodologies that combine qualitative techniques with the synthesis of qualitative knowledge. They are particularly suited to medical education as these approaches pool findings from original qualitative studies, whilst paying attention to context and theoretical development. Although increasingly sophisticated use is being made of qualitative primary research methodologies in health professions education (HPE) the use of secondary qualitative reviews in HPE remains underdeveloped. This study examined QES methods applied to clinical humanism in healthcare as a way of advancing thinking around the use of QES in HPE in general. A systematic search strategy identified 49 reviews that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-study was used to develop an analytic summary of methodological characteristics, the role of theory, and the synthetic processes used in QES reviews. Fifteen reviews used a defined methodology, and 17 clearly explained the processes that led from data extraction to synthesis. Eight reviews adopted a specific theoretical perspective. Authors rarely described their reflexive relationship with their data. Epistemological positions tended to be implied rather than explicit. Twenty-five reviews included some form of quality appraisal, although it was often unclear how authors acted on its results. Reviewers under-reported qualitative approaches in their review methodologies, and tended to focus on elements such as systematicity and checklist quality appraisal that were more germane to quantitative evidence synthesis. A core concern was that the axiological (value) dimensions of the source materials were rarely considered let alone accommodated in the synthesis techniques used. QES can be used in HPE research but only with careful attention to maintaining axiological integrity.

TI  - Help seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse: an example of an integrated mixed methods synthesis of systematic review evidence defining methodological terms
SO  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
AB  - BackgroundDomestic violence and abuse is a violation of human rights which damages the health and wellbeing of victims, their families and their friends. There has been less research on the experiences and support needs of male victims than those of women. Historically research on men's experiences has not focused on what constitutes effective, needs-led service provision. The aim of this paper was to conduct an integrated mixed methods synthesis of systematic review evidence on the topic of help-seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse.MethodsAn integrated mixed methods synthesis approach was taken to enhance our understanding of the complex phenomenon of help seeking by, and service provision to male victims. This process also identifies gaps in the evidence. Using previously identified systematic review data; mixed methods data from four primary-level service evaluation studies, along with expert and patient consultation were used to develop research propositions. Primary-level qualitative interview and survey data from 12 studies of men experiences were mapped onto the propositions to support them.ResultsFourteen propositions were composed. Seven propositions were supported or at least partly supported by the qualitative data. These supported propositions were used to make recommendations for policy and practice particularly concerning service preferences of male victims. The remaining seven propositions were not specifically supported by the qualitative data. These unsupported propositions were used to develop research recommendations concerning the need to further understand the potential blurred boundaries of victim-perpetrator, hybrid perpetrator-victim experiences, men who are/have been victims of childhood sexual abuse and determining the level of risk for men. They also highlight the need to produce better guidance for the response of the police & the criminal justice system. Finally, they highlight the need to produce the most appropriate service for men in terms of access, linkage, substance/alcohol abuse, mental health, sexuality, and race.ConclusionIntegrated mixed-methods synthesis of systematic review evidence is a relatively novel approach. This approach can lead to recommendations for policy and practice as well as highlighting gaps in the research agenda as shown in this example.

AB  - Light detection and ranging system (LIDAR) can quickly, proactively and automatically acquire point cloud data of large-scale area, which contains three-dimensional land-cover object information, meanwhile the multispectral cameras can acquire multi-band spectral information. This paper extracts and selects sixteen features according to point cloud data and spectral images, then these features are divided into five groups, such as height feature subset, intensity subset, spectral subset and texture subset. The weight of each group of features in the decision-making process is characterized by the features' importance. This paper introduces evidence synthesis theory to overcome the evidence conflict in decision-making and to improve decision precision. Final land-cover objects labels are predicted through ensemble algorithm based on random forest and weighted D-S evidence synthesis. The experiment results indicate that classification performance of joint feature set is superior to single feature set, compound classification framework can optimize final classification results. The overall accuracy reaches to 94% and other parameters can also be improved more or less.

SO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
VL  - 49
IS  - 1
SP  - 322
EP  - 329
AB  - Background: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are popular tools for identifying appropriate adjustment strategies for epidemiological analysis. However, a lack of direction on how to build them is problematic. As a solution, we propose using a combination of evidence synthesis strategies and causal inference principles to integrate the DAG-building exercise within the review stages of research projects. We demonstrate this idea by introducing a novel protocol: 'Evidence Synthesis for Constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs' (ESC-DAGs)'. Methods: ESC-DAGs operates on empirical studies identified by a literature search, ideally a novel systematic review or review of systematic reviews. It involves three key stages: (i) the conclusions of each study are 'mapped' into a DAG; (ii) the causal structures in these DAGs are systematically assessed using several causal inference principles and are corrected accordingly; (iii) the resulting DAGs are then synthesised into one or more 'integrated DAGs'. This demonstration article didactically applies ESC-DAGs to the literature on parental influences on offspring alcohol use during adolescence. Conclusions: ESC-DAGs is a practical, systematic and transparent approach for developing DAGs from background knowledge. These DAGs can then direct primary data analysis and DAG-based sensitivity analysis. ESC-DAGs has a modular design to allow researchers who are experienced DAG users to both use and improve upon the approach. It is also accessible to researchers with limited experience of DAGs or evidence synthesis.

TI  - Building capacity for evidence generation, synthesis and implementation to improve the care of mothers and babies in South East Asia: methods and design of the SEA-ORCHID Project using a logical framework approach
SO  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Rates of maternal and perinatal mortality remain high in developing countries despite the existence of effective interventions. Efforts to strengthen evidence-based approaches to improve health in these settings are partly hindered by restricted access to the best available evidence, limited training in evidence-based practice and concerns about the relevance of existing evidence. South East Asia - Optimising Reproductive and Child Health in Developing Countries (SEA-ORCHID) was a five-year project that aimed to determine whether a multifaceted intervention designed to strengthen the capacity for research synthesis, evidence-based care and knowledge implementation improved clinical practice and led to better health outcomes for mothers and babies. This paper describes the development and design of the SEA-ORCHID intervention plan using a logical framework approach. Methods: SEA-ORCHID used a before-and-after design to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted tailored intervention at nine sites across Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia, supported by three centres in Australia. We used a logical framework approach to systematically prepare and summarise the project plan in a clear and logical way. The development and design of the SEA-ORCHID project was based around the three components of a logical framework (problem analysis, project plan and evaluation strategy). Results: The SEA-ORCHID logical framework defined the project's goal and purpose (To improve the health of mothers and babies in South East Asia and To improve clinical practice in reproductive health in South East Asia), and outlined a series of project objectives and activities designed to achieve these. The logical framework also established outcome and process measures appropriate to each level of the project plan, and guided project work in each of the participating countries and hospitals. Conclusions: Development of a logical framework in the SEA-ORCHID project enabled a reasoned, logical approach to the project design that ensured the project activities would achieve the desired outcomes and that the evaluation plan would assess both the process and outcome of the project. The logical framework was also valuable over the course of the project to facilitate communication, assess progress and build a shared understanding of the project activities, purpose and goal.

SO  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
AB  - Background There is a growing interest in the inclusion of real-world and observational studies in evidence synthesis such as meta-analysis and network meta-analysis in public health. While this approach offers great epidemiological opportunities, use of such studies often introduce a significant issue of double-counting of participants and databases in a single analysis. Therefore, this study aims to introduce and illustrate the nuances of double-counting of individuals in evidence synthesis including real-world and observational data with a focus on public health. Methods The issues associated with double-counting of individuals in evidence synthesis are highlighted with a number of case studies. Further, double-counting of information in varying scenarios is discussed with potential solutions highlighted. Results Use of studies of real-world data and/or established cohort studies, for example studies evaluating the effectiveness of therapies using health record data, often introduce a significant issue of double-counting of individuals and databases. This refers to the inclusion of the same individuals multiple times in a single analysis. Double-counting can occur in a number of manners, such as, when multiple studies utilise the same database, when there is overlapping timeframes of analysis or common treatment arms across studies. Some common practices to address this include synthesis of data only from peer-reviewed studies, utilising the study that provides the greatest information (e.g. largest, newest, greater outcomes reported) or analysing outcomes at different time points. Conclusions While common practices currently used can mitigate some of the impact of double-counting of participants in evidence synthesis including real-world and observational studies, there is a clear need for methodological and guideline development to address this increasingly significant issue.

SO  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
VL  - 213
SP  - 135
EP  - 145
AB  - Achieving evidence-based environmental management requires that decision-makers have access to evidence that can help identify the most effective interventions for their management context. Evidence synthesis supports evidence-based decision-making because it collates, filters and makes sense of a sometimes large and often conflicting evidence-base, potentially yielding new insights. There are many approaches to evidence synthesis. They each have different strengths and weaknesses, making them suited to different purposes, questions and contexts, given particular constraints. To make sense of the wide array of approaches, we outline the important considerations when selecting the most appropriate method for a particular decision context. These include the purpose for the synthesis, the required outcomes, and the multiple constraints within which decision-makers must operate. We then critically assess a spectrum of approaches to evidence synthesis commonly used within environmental management, detailing the characteristics of each that can be used to determine when it is a suitable method. To guide this selection process we provide a decision tree for those commissioning (e.g., decision-makers or stakeholders) or conducting (e.g., scientists) evidence synthesis, which can be used to identify an appropriate method. The decision tree classifies evidence synthesis methods according to whether their purpose is to test or generate hypotheses, the level of resources they require, the level of certainty in the outputs, and the type and scope of the question being addressed. This tool is a major advance because it helps select an appropriate synthesis method based on the multiple constraints that impact the decision. We conclude that there is an approach to evidence synthesis that will suit all management contexts, but that selecting the right approach requires careful consideration of what is fit for purpose.

TI  - Qualitative evidence synthesis for complex interventions and guideline development: clarification of the purpose, designs and relevant methods
SO  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
VL  - 4
AB  - This paper is one of a series exploring the implications of complexity for systematic reviews and guideline development, commissioned by the WHO. The paper specifically explores the role of qualitative evidence synthesis. Qualitative evidence synthesis is the broad term for the group of methods used to undertake systematic reviews of qualitative research evidence. As an approach, qualitative evidence synthesis is increasingly recognised as having a key role to play in addressing questions relating to intervention or system complexity, and guideline development processes. This is due to the unique role qualitative research can play in establishing the relative importance of outcomes, the acceptability, fidelity and reach of interventions, their feasibility in different settings and potential consequences on equity across populations. This paper outlines the purpose of qualitative evidence synthesis, provides detail of how qualitative evidence syntheses can help establish understanding and explanation of the complexity that can occur in relation to both interventions and systems, and how qualitative evidence syntheses can contribute to evidence to decision frameworks. It provides guidance for the choice of qualitative evidence synthesis methods in the context of guideline development for complex interventions, giving ` real life' examples of where this has occurred. Information to support decision-making around choice qualitative evidence synthesis methods in the context of guideline development is provided. Approaches for reporting qualitative evidence syntheses are discussed alongside mechanisms for assessing confidence in the findings of a review.

SO  - JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
VL  - 17

SP  - 657
EP  - 663
AB  - Objectives In a qualitative synthesis, primary qualitative studies are integrated to develop a theory or evidence-based interventions. Until now, the strength of the evidence in the primary studies has not been taken into account in the outcome of the qualitative synthesis. In this paper, a method is developed and evaluated to assign weights to the findings of the qualitative studies using both the frequency and the quality of the reported results. Method Seventeen qualitative studies were retrieved in an illustrative example project on children and trauma. Findings were extracted from the primary studies with the use of coding which resulted in 14 themes. The quality of the studies was appraised using both expert judgement and a quality checklist. These outcomes are used to calculate the weights. Results When the outcomes of the checklist appraisal are compared with those of the expert judgement, the effect on the strength of the evidence is virtually always in the same direction. We found that as the frequency with which a concept is studied is low, the strength of the evidence oftentimes decreases even further when using the quality of the results in the weighing process. Conclusions In the end, the outcomes of a critical appraisal affect the weight that is placed on particular studies. The use of a checklist is recommended because of its more distinguishing ability. The method that was developed for assigning weights to the evidence is discussed in light of both the quality appraisal in qualitative research and the objectives of qualitative synthesis.

VL  - 14

EP  - 192
AB  - Background Enhanced uptake of systematic reviews that use qualitative comparative analyses (QCA) requires knowing how end-users interpret such findings. The study purpose was to identify effective approaches to communicating results from a QCA within a systematic review. Methods Sequential exploratory mixed methods design; thematic analysis of interviews with 11 end-users followed by a randomized experiment with 254 participants that provided QCA results for a hypothetical review presented through three formats (text, table, and figure). A survey administered after the experiment assessed subjective and objective comprehension of QCA results. Results Interview themes included use of jargon; appropriate use of appendices, tables, figures; and integration of QCA results within the systematic review. In the experiment, we observed a significant difference (p = 0.035) in subjective comprehension across the three presentation formats. Participants randomized to the figure and text formats scored higher compared to the table. No significant differences were observed for objective comprehension overall (p = 0.11). However, for parameter interpretation (a unique component of QCA results), scores among participants that received the figure format were significantly higher than scores for participants who received the text (p = 0.001) or table (p = 0.004). No significant differences (p = 0.09) were observed in objective comprehension for configuration interpretation. Conclusions End-users of systematic reviews saw value in the use of QCA, but unfamiliar methods and terminology were barriers to full understanding of the findings. When presenting results, a figure format appears to be superior to text or table formats based on measures of subjective comprehension and some measures of objective comprehension.

AB  - Objectives: To explore healthcare professional perceived barriers and facilitators to discussing sexual health and wellbeing with patients after diagnosis of chronic illness. Methods: Five databases were searched and included data were synthesised using a meta-ethnographic approach. Confidence in findings was assessed using the GRADE-CERQual framework. Searches, extraction and quality assessment procedures were conducted independently by at least two authors. Results: Concepts extracted from 30 included studies were used to develop a conceptual framework based on five overarching themes. These were [1] individual and societal attitudes to sex and sexual wellbeing [2], patient specific factors [3], organizational and professional factors [4], strategies to overcome barriers in practice and [5] perceived training needs. Healthcare professionals acknowledged the importance of discussing and providing support for sexual wellbeing needs, but recognized it is not routinely provided. Conclusions: While patient specific factors and organizational issues such as lack of time were frequently identified as barriers, intra-personal and social perceptions appear to have the strongest influence on healthcare professional perspectives. Practice implications: Brief education and tools to support healthcare professionals to have effective conversations with patients are required. These should address social barriers, normalise sexual issues, and support healthcare professionals to initiate discussions around sexual concerns. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this article was to iteratively account for and discuss the handling of methodological challenges in two qualitative research syntheses concerning patients' experiences of hospital transition. We applied Sandelowski and Barroso's guidelines for synthesizing qualitative research, and to our knowledge, this is the first time researchers discuss their methodological steps. In the process, we identified a need for prolonged discussions to determine mutual understandings of the methodology. We discussed how to identify the appropriate qualitative research literature and how to best conduct exhaustive literature searches on our target phenomena. Another finding concerned our status as third-order interpreters of participants' experiences and what this meant for synthesizing the primary findings. Finally, we discussed whether our studies could be classified as metasummaries or metasyntheses. Although we have some concerns regarding the applicability of the methodology, we conclude that following Sandelowski and Barroso's guidelines contributed to valid syntheses of our studies.

AB  - Background The prevalence and incidence of obesity are high in people with severe mental illness (SMI). In England, around 6000 people with SMI access care from secure mental health units. There is currently no specific guidance on how to reduce the risk of obesity-related morbidity and mortality in this population. Aims To identify international evidence that addresses the issue of obesity in mental health secure units. Method A mixed method review of evidence (published 2000-2015) was carried out to assess obesity prevalence, intervention and policy change, as well as barriers to change. Results Evidence from 22 mainly small, non-comparator studies (reported in 21 papers) using a range of methods was reviewed. Dietary, physical activity and cultural interventions being implemented within secure units to address the problem of obesity showed some promising outcomes for physical health and health education. These were facilitated by adequate organisational resources, staff training and motivated staff. Holistic interventions that included a social and/or competitive element were more likely to be taken up. Involving patients in decision-making mediated the tension between facilitating behaviour change and imposing control. Barriers to successful outcomes included patient movement in and out of units, severity of mental health condition and resistance to change by patients and staff. Conclusions Despite the promising outcomes reported, further assessment is needed of the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of interventions and policies targeting the obesogenic environment, using robust research methods.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to implementation of epilepsy self-management programs: a systematic review using qualitative evidence synthesis methods
SO  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Background Epilepsy affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Self-management is critical for individuals with epilepsy in order to maintain optimal physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Implementing and adopting a self-management program requires considering many factors at the person, program, and systems levels. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative and mixed-methods studies to identify facilitators and barriers that impact implementation and adoption of self-management programs for adults with epilepsy. Methods We used established systematic review methodologies for qualitative and mixed-methods studies. We included studies addressing facilitators (i.e., factors that aided) or barriers (i.e., factors that impeded) to implementation and adoption of self-management interventions for adults with epilepsy. We conducted a narrative thematic synthesis to identify facilitators and barriers. Results The literature search identified 2700 citations; 13 studies met eligibility criteria. Our synthesis identified five themes that categorize facilitators and barriers to successful implementation epilepsy self-management: (1) relevance, intervention content that facilitates acquisition of self-management skills; (2) personalization, intervention components that account for the individual's social, physical, and environmental characteristics; (3) intervention components, components and dosing of the intervention; (4) technology considerations, considerations that account for individual's use, familiarity with, and ownership of technology; and (5) clinician interventionist, role and preparation of the individual who leads intervention. We identified facilitators in 11 of the 13 studies and barriers in 11 of the 13 studies and classified these by social-ecological level (i.e., patient/caregiver, program, site/system). Conclusion Identification of facilitators and barriers at multiple levels provides insight into disease-specific factors that influence implementation and adoption of self-management programs for individuals with epilepsy. Our findings indicate that involving individuals with epilepsy and their caregivers in intervention development, and then tailoring intervention content during the intervention, can help ensure the content is relevant to intervention participants. Our findings also indicate the role of the clinician (i.e., the individual who provides self-management education) is important to intervention implementation, and key issues with clinicians were identified as barriers and opportunities for improvement. Overall, our findings have practical value for those seeking to implement and adopt self-management interventions for epilepsy and other chronic illnesses.

AB  - AimsThe aim of this study was to assess the acceptability of methods that increase trial inclusion in meta-analyses, and the level of evidence for skin-to-skin contact for procedural pain in infants. BackgroundThe current Cochrane review of skin-to-skin contact for pain in newborns found it to be an effective intervention, but identified several methodological limitations. DesignMeta-re-analysis MethodsTrial designs included randomized trials reporting a validated pain assessment tool as a primary outcome including term and pre-term infants undergoing a tissue-breaking painful procedure. The search in the original review was conducted to January 2013. Scores of validated tools were scaled to the premature infant pain profile in a fixed-effect meta-re-analysis. The GRADE was used to assess quality of meta-analysed evidence. ResultsNew analysis vs. original found a mean difference: -311 in favour of skin-to-skin contact vs. -321 at 30seconds; and -271 vs. -185 at 60seconds for heel lance. Based on cut-off scores for the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale, infants receiving skin-to-skin contact during IM injection were more likely to display low pain after injection; and during recovery. ConclusionScaling scores to a single outcome can provide additional information in meta-analyses, simplifies interpretability of pooled scores, and can improve GRADE outcomes. Sensitivity analyses of scaled scores improve confidence in their validity. Risk of bias subgroups simplified the GRADE process, and confidence intervals for heterogeneity statistics assisted in interpretation of sensitivity analyses.

EP  - 657
AB  - The use of systematic approaches to evidence review and synthesis has recently become more common in the field of organizational research, yet their value remains unclear and largely untested. First used in medical research, evidence review is a technique for identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing existing empirical evidence. With greater demand for the best evidence about what works in organizational settings, nuanced approaches to evidence synthesis have evolved to address more complex research questions. Narrative synthesis is perceived to be particularly suited to evaluating diverse evidence types spanning multiple disciplinary fields, characteristic of the HRM domain. This article evaluates the narrative evidence synthesis approach, explains how it differs from other techniques, and describes a worked example in relation to employee engagement. We consider its strengths, the challenges of using it, and its value in HRM research.

EP  - 1781
AB  - Deep belief network (DBN) is a generative learning strategy which has been proposed very early, similar to the rest deep learning algorithms, the complex network structure and the large size of parameters increase calculation cost greatly, the application is limited greatly. In order to solve this problem, a decision-level identification method named distributed DBN weighted Dempster-Shafer synthesis (DDWDS) is proposed for high-precision classification of remote sensing objects. Firstly, the low-dimensional features and a small number of samples are selected randomly, many distributed, independent and lean DBN networks are constructed and trained. Secondly, their classification results are used as a trust allocation function of the evidence focal element, and finally obtain the trust allocation function of each focal element based on weighted synthetic rules. With the multi-source remote sensing data of the light detection and ranging(LIDAR) system, the recognition accuracy of distributed DBNs which are constructed by 4 features and 20% samples is below 0.7, this situation shows great conflict, training cost decreases significantly, but the final classification recognition accuracy is raised to more than 0.9 with the proposed DD-WDS. The results show that the method can determine the scale of the network by itself, and achieves better performance.

AB  - Study Design. Best evidence synthesis. Objective. To provide a detailed description of the methods undertaken in a systematic search and perform a best evidence synthesis on the frequency, determinants, assessment, interventions, course and prognosis of neck pain, and its associated disorders. Summary of Background Data. Neck pain is an important cause of health burden; however, the published information is vast, and stakeholders would benefit from a summary of the best evidence. Methods. The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders conducted a systematic search and critical review of the literature published between 1980 and 2006 to assemble the best evidence on neck pain. Citations were screened for relevance to the Neck Pain Task Force mandate, using a priori criteria, and relevant studies were critically reviewed for their internal scientific validity. Findings from studies meeting criteria for scientific validity were synthesized into a best evidence synthesis. Results. We found 31,878 citations, of which 1203 were relevant to the mandate of the Neck Pain Task Force. After critical review, 552 studies (46%) were judged scientifically admissible and were compiled into the best evidence synthesis. Conclusion. The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders undertook a best evidence synthesis to establish a baseline of the current best evidence on the epidemiology, assessment and classification of neck pain, as well as interventions and prognosis for this symptom. This article reports the methods used and the outcomes from the review. We found that 46% of the research literature was of acceptable scientific quality to inform clinical practice, policy-making, and future research.

TI  - Minority Stress and Positive Identity Aspects in Members of LGBTQ+ Parent Families: Literature Review and a Study Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Evidence Synthesis
SO  - CHILDREN-BASEL
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
AB  - Background: Parents and children in LGBTQ+ parent families face unique stressors (i.e., minority stress), but also possess unique resources (i.e., positive identity aspects) related to their family identity. Empirical evidence and theory suggest that these minority stressors and positive identity aspects are situated on the individual, couple, and family level and may be associated with key outcomes, including parent and child health, family functioning, and school-related outcomes. A systematic evidence synthesis and a theoretical placement are currently lacking. The aims of the systematic review outlined in this protocol are thus to (1) map minority stressors and positive identity aspects according to multiple levels in the family system, and (2) to synthesize evidence on their associations with key outcomes. Methods: We will conduct a PRISMA-conform mixed-methods systematic review. Studies will be retrieved using a multi-tiered search strategy, including database searches (PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science), cited literature searches, authors' publication lists, and study requests. The mixed-methods synthesis will follow a parallel-results convergent synthesis design, where quantitative results will be synthesized via meta-analysis and qualitative results via thematic synthesis. Conclusions: Our proposed systematic review may add to the theoretical understanding of LGBTQ+ parent family functioning and advance social inclusion of LGBTQ+ parent families.

TI  - A review of the quantitative effectiveness evidence synthesis methods used in public health intervention guidelines
SO  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The complexity of public health interventions create challenges in evaluating their effectiveness. There have been huge advancements in quantitative evidence synthesis methods development (including meta-analysis) for dealing with heterogeneity of intervention effects, inappropriate 'lumping' of interventions, adjusting for different populations and outcomes and the inclusion of various study types. Growing awareness of the importance of using all available evidence has led to the publication of guidance documents for implementing methods to improve decision making by answering policy relevant questions. Methods: The first part of this paper reviews the methods used to synthesise quantitative effectiveness evidence in public health guidelines by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that had been published or updated since the previous review in 2012 until the 19th August 2019.The second part of this paper provides an update of the statistical methods and explains how they address issues related to evaluating effectiveness evidence of public health interventions. Results: The proportion of NICE public health guidelines that used a meta-analysis as part of the synthesis of effectiveness evidence has increased since the previous review in 2012 from 23% (9 out of 39) to 31% (14 out of 45). The proportion of NICE guidelines that synthesised the evidence using only a narrative review decreased from 74% (29 out of 39) to 60% (27 out of 45).An application in the prevention of accidents in children at home illustrated how the choice of synthesis methods can enable more informed decision making by defining and estimating the effectiveness of more distinct interventions, including combinations of intervention components, and identifying subgroups in which interventions are most effective. Conclusions: Despite methodology development and the publication of guidance documents to address issues in public health intervention evaluation since the original review, NICE public health guidelines are not making full use of meta-analysis and other tools that would provide decision makers with fuller information with which to develop policy. There is an evident need to facilitate the translation of the synthesis methods into a public health context and encourage the use of methods to improve decision making.

SP  - 576
EP  - 589
AB  - Background The CLUSTER model of searching was proposed as a systematic method of searching for studies for reviews of complex interventions. Aim The method has not been evaluated before. This methodological review identified and evaluated a sample of evidence syntheses that have used CLUSTER. Methods A forward citation search on the seed CLUSTER publication was conducted on Web of Science Core Collection using six journal citation indexes and Google Scholar in December 2020. Reviews which used the CLUSTER method were eligible for inclusion. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the types of evidence syntheses that used CLUSTER searching, the extent to which the CLUSTER approach has been operationalised within evidence syntheses and whether the value, benefits and limitations of CLUSTER were assessed by the reviewers. Findings A total of 16 reviews were identified and eligible for synthesis. Six different review types that used CLUSTER were identified with realist reviews being the most prominent. The evaluation of complex interventions was the most common review topic area. The use of CLUSTER varied among reviews with the retrieval of sibling studies being the most common reason. 'Citations' and 'Lead authors' were the most followed elements of CLUSTER. Conclusions Evidence suggests that CLUSTER has been adopted for use in reviews of complex interventions. Its usage varied among the included reviews. It is imperative that future reviewers diligently report the elements and steps of CLUSTER that were utilised in order to provide a reproducible and transparent search strategy that can be reported with similar transparency to bibliographic database searches.

AB  - Mixed methods research is well-suited to grapple with questions of what counts as valid knowledge across different contexts and perspectives. This article introduces Weight of Evidence as a transformative procedure for stakeholders to interpret, expand on and prioritize evidence from evidence syntheses, with a focus on engaging populations historically excluded from planning and decision making. This article presents the procedure's five steps using pilot data on perinatal care of immigrant women in Canada, engaging family physicians and birth companions. Fuzzy cognitive mapping offers an accessible and systematic way to generate priors to update published literature with stakeholder priorities. Weight of Evidence is a transparent procedure to broaden what counts as expertise, contributing to a more comprehensive, context-specific, and actionable understanding.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the impact of restricting systematic reviews of conventional or alternative medical treatments or diagnostic tests to English-language publications. Study design and setting: We systematically searched MEDLINE (Ovid), the Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and Current Contents Connect (Web of Science) up to April 24, 2020. Eligible methods studies assessed the impact of restricting systematic reviews to English-language publications on effect estimates and conclusions. Two reviewers independently screened the literature; one investigator performed the data extraction, a second investigator checked for completeness and accuracy. We synthesized the findings narratively. Results: Eight methods studies (10 publications) met the inclusion criteria; none addressed language restrictions in diagnostic test accuracy reviews. The included studies analyzed nine to 147 meta-analyses and/or systematic reviews. The proportions of non-English language publications ranged from 2% to 100%. Based on five methods studies, restricting literature searches or inclusion criteria to English-language publications led to a change in statistical significance in 23/259 meta-analyses (9%). Most commonly, the statistical significance was lost, but had no impact on the conclusions of systematic reviews. Conclusion: Restricting systematic reviews to English-language publications appears to have little impact on the effect estimates and conclusions of systematic reviews. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To compare and contrast different knowledge synthesis methods and map their specific steps through a scoping review to gain a better understanding of how to select the most appropriate knowledge synthesis method to answer research questions of complex evidence. Study design and setting: Electronic databases were searched to identify studies reporting emerging knowledge synthesis methods (e.g., Realist review) across multidisciplinary fields. Two reviewers independently selected studies and abstracted data for each article. Results: We synthesized diverse, often conflicting evidence to identify 12 unique knowledge synthesis methods and 13 analysis methods. We organized the 12 full knowledge synthesis methods according to their purpose, outputs and applicability for practice and policy, as well as general guidance on formulating the research question. To make sense of the overlap across these knowledge synthesis methods, we derived a conceptual algorithm to elucidate the process for selecting the optimal knowledge synthesis methods for particular research questions. Conclusion: These findings represent a preliminary understanding on which we will base further advancement of knowledge in this field. As part of next steps, we will convene a meeting of international leaders in the field aimed at clarifying emerging knowledge synthesis approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
