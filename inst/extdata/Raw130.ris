TI  - CLUSTER searching approach to inform evidence syntheses: A methodological review
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - Background The CLUSTER model of searching was proposed as a systematic method of searching for studies for reviews of complex interventions. Aim The method has not been evaluated before. This methodological review identified and evaluated a sample of evidence syntheses that have used CLUSTER. Methods A forward citation search on the seed CLUSTER publication was conducted on Web of Science Core Collection using six journal citation indexes and Google Scholar in December 2020. Reviews which used the CLUSTER method were eligible for inclusion. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the types of evidence syntheses that used CLUSTER searching, the extent to which the CLUSTER approach has been operationalised within evidence syntheses and whether the value, benefits and limitations of CLUSTER were assessed by the reviewers. Findings A total of 16 reviews were identified and eligible for synthesis. Six different review types that used CLUSTER were identified with realist reviews being the most prominent. The evaluation of complex interventions was the most common review topic area. The use of CLUSTER varied among reviews with the retrieval of sibling studies being the most common reason. 'Citations' and 'Lead authors' were the most followed elements of CLUSTER. Conclusions Evidence suggests that CLUSTER has been adopted for use in reviews of complex interventions. Its usage varied among the included reviews. It is imperative that future reviewers diligently report the elements and steps of CLUSTER that were utilised in order to provide a reproducible and transparent search strategy that can be reported with similar transparency to bibliographic database searches.

TI  - Rapid evidence synthesis approach for limits on the search date: How rapid could it be?
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - Rapid reviews have been widely employed to support timely decision-making, and limiting the search date is the most popular approach in published rapid reviews. We assessed the accuracy and workload of search date limits on the meta-analytical results to determine the best rapid strategy. The meta-analyses data were collected from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). We emulated the rapid reviews by limiting the search date of the original CDSR to the recent 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 7, 5, and 3 years, and their results were compared to the full meta-analyses. A random sample of 10% was drawn to repeat the literature search by the same timeframe limits to measure the relative workload reduction (RWR). The relationship between accuracy and RWR was established. We identified 21,363 meta-analyses of binary outcomes and 7683 meta-analyses of continuous outcomes from 2693 CDSRs. Our results suggested that under a maximum tolerance of 5% and 10% on the bias of magnitude, a limit on the recent 20 years can achieve good accuracy and at the same time save the most workload. Under the tolerance of 15% and 20% on the bias, a limit on the recent 10 years and 15 years could be considered. Limiting the search date is a valid rapid method to produce credible evidence for timely decisions. When conducting rapid reviews, researchers should consider both the accuracy and workload to make an appropriate decision.

TI  - A prospective comparison of evidence synthesis search strategies developed with and without text-mining tools
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: We compared the process of developing searches with and without using text-mining tools (TMTs) for evidence synthesis products.
   Study Design: This descriptive comparative analysis included seven systematic reviews, classified as simple or complex. Two librarians created MEDLINE strategies for each review, using either usual practice (UP) or TMTs. For each search we calculated sensitivity, number-needed-to-read (NNR) and time spent developing the search strategy.
   Results: We found UP searches were more sensitive (UP 92% (95% CI, 85-99); TMT 84.9% (95% CI, 74.4-95.4)), with lower NNR (UP 83 (SD 34); TMT 90 (SD 68)). UP librarians spent an average of 12 h (SD 8) developing search strategies, compared to TMT librarians' 5 hours (SD 2).
   Conclusion: Across all reviews, TMT searches were less sensitive than UP searches, but confidence intervals overlapped. For simple SR topics, TMT searches were faster and slightly less sensitive than UP. For complex SR topics, TMT searches were faster and less sensitive than UP searches but identified unique eligible citations not found by the UP searches. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Peer review of searches for studies for health technology assessments, systematic reviews, and other evidence syntheses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE
AB  - Introduction
   Peer review of searches is a process whereby both the search strategies and the search process description are reviewed, ideally using an evidence-based checklist.
   Rationale
   As the search strategy underpins any well-conducted evidence synthesis, its quality could affect the final result. Evidence shows, however, that search strategies are prone to error.
   Findings
   There is increasing awareness and use of the PRESS Evidence-Based Checklist and peer review of search strategies, at the outset of evidence syntheses, prior to the searches being run, and this is now recommended by a number of evidence synthesis organizations.
   Recommendations and conclusions
   Searches for evidence syntheses should be peer reviewed by a suitably qualified and experienced librarian or information specialist after being designed, ideally, by another suitably qualified and experienced librarian or information specialist. Peer review of searches should take place at two important stages in the evidence synthesis process; at the outset of the project prior to the searches being run and at the prepublication stage. There is little empirical evidence, however, to support the effectiveness of peer review of searches. Further research is required to assess this. Those wishing to stay up to date with the latest developments in information retrieval, including peer review of searches, should consult the SuRe Info resource (http://www.sure-info.org), which seeks to help information specialists and others by providing easy access to the findings from current information retrieval methods research and thus support more research-based information retrieval practice.

TI  - Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group guidance series-paper 2: methods for question formulation, searching, and protocol development for qualitative evidence synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - This paper updates previous Cochrane guidance on question formulation, searching, and protocol development, reflecting recent developments in methods for conducting qualitative evidence syntheses to inform Cochrane intervention reviews. Examples are used to illustrate how decisions about boundaries for a review are formed via an iterative process of constructing lines of inquiry and mapping the available information to ascertain whether evidence exists to answer questions related to effectiveness, implementation, feasibility, appropriateness, economic evidence, and equity. The process of question formulation allows reviewers to situate the topic in relation to how it informs and explains effectiveness, using the criterion of meaningfulness, appropriateness, feasibility, and implementation. Questions related to complex questions and interventions can be structured by drawing on an increasingly wide range of question frameworks. Logic models and theoretical frameworks are useful tools for conceptually mapping the literature to illustrate the complexity of the phenomenon of interest. Furthermore, protocol development may require iterative question formulation and searching. Consequently, the final protocol may function as a guide rather than a prescriptive route map, particularly in qualitative reviews that ask more exploratory and open-ended questions.

T2  - 11TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND MEASUREMENT (ESEM 2017)
CP  - 11th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)
AB  - Background: research synthesis is still challenge in Software Engineering due to the heterogeneity of primary studies in the area. Also, it generates a significant volume of information which is complex to manage. Aims: to provide support to this kind of studies in SE. Method: we present the Evidence Factory, a tool designed to support the Structured Synthesis Method (SSM). SSM is a research synthesis method that can be used to aggregate both quantitative and qualitative studies. It is a kind of integrative synthesis method, such as meta-analysis, but has several features from interpretative methods, such as meta-ethnography, particularly those concerned with conceptual development. Results: the tool is a web-based infrastructure, which supports the organization of synthesis studies. Researchers can compare findings from different studies by modeling their results according to the evidence meta-model. After deciding whether the evidence can be combined, the tool automatically computes the uncertainty associated with the aggregated results using the formalisms from the Mathematical Theory of Evidence. Conclusion: the tool was used in real synthesis studies and is freely available for the SE community.

TI  - Bayesian methods in meta-analysis and evidence synthesis
T2  - STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - This paper reviews the use of Bayesian methods in meta-analysis. Whilst there has been an explosion in the use of meta-analysis over the last few years, driven mainly by the move towards evidence-based healthcare, so too Bayesian methods are being used increasingly within medical statistics. Whilst in many meta-analysis settings the Bayesian models used mirror those previously adopted in a frequentist formulation, there are a number of specific advantages conferred by the Bayesian approach. These include: full allowance for all parameter uncertainty in the model, the ability to include other pertinent information that would otherwise be excluded, and the ability to extend the models to accommodate more complex, but frequently occurring, scenarios. The Bayesian methods discussed are illustrated by means of a meta-analysis examining the evidence relating to electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and perinatal mortality in which evidence is available from a variety of sources.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background and Objectives: Identify currently methodological aspects proposed for planning, conducting, and reporting living evi-dence (LE) synthesis. Develop a preliminary checklist of key LE synthesis elements.
   Methods: A survey of methodological articles describing or analyzing methods for the design, conduction, or reporting of LE synthesis.
   Results: Twelve methodological articles were identified and analyzed. Key elements were related to: i) definition of LE and charac-teristics of LE synthesis, ii) methods and tools for the living process, iii) new evidence integration (methods and considerations), iv) updates dissemination and publication, v) revisiting living parameters, and vi) protocol considerations for LE synthesis.
   Conclusion: This survey displays basic methodological concepts that can drive the development of LE synthesis and identifies specific aspects with opportunities for development. The potential impact of the LE approach calls for a change in the current evidence synthesis updating processes to more open, collaborative, transparent, and efficient systems. LE approaches also challenge journal editors to shift toward more efficient processes for synthesis update dissemination, which minimizes the risks of reliability of published information.

TI  - Using Bayesian Evidence Synthesis Methods to Incorporate Real-World Evidence in Surrogate Endpoint Evaluation
T2  - MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
AB  - Objective. Traditionally, validation of surrogate endpoints has been carried out using randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. However, RCT data may be too limited to validate surrogate endpoints. In this article, we sought to improve the validation of surrogate endpoints with the inclusion of real-world evidence (RWE). Methods. We use data from comparative RWE (cRWE) and single-arm RWE (sRWE) to supplement RCT evidence for the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) as a surrogate endpoint to overall survival (OS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Treatment effect estimates from RCTs, cRWE, and matched sRWE, comparing antiangiogenic treatments with chemotherapy, were used to inform surrogacy patterns and predictions of the treatment effect on OS from the treatment effect on PFS. Results. Seven RCTs, 4 cRWE studies, and 2 matched sRWE studies were identified. The addition of RWE to RCTs reduced the uncertainty around the estimates of the parameters for the surrogate relationship. The addition of RWE to RCTs also improved the accuracy and precision of predictions of the treatment effect on OS obtained using data on the observed effect on PFS. Conclusion. The addition of RWE to RCT data improved the precision of the parameters describing the surrogate relationship between treatment effects on PFS and OS and the predicted clinical benefit of antiangiogenic therapies in mCRC.
   Highlights circle Regulatory agencies increasingly rely on surrogate endpoints when making licensing decisions, and for the decisions to be robust, surrogate endpoints need to be validated. In the era of precision medicine, when surrogacy patterns may depend on the drug's mechanism of action and trials of targeted therapies may be small, data from randomized controlled trials may be limited. circle Real-world evidence (RWE) is increasingly used at different stages of the drug development process. When used to enhance the evidence base for surrogate endpoint evaluation, RWE can improve inferences about the strength of surrogate relationships and the precision of predicted treatment effect on the final clinical outcome based on the observed effect on the surrogate endpoint in a new trial. circle Careful selection of RWE is needed to reduce risk of bias.

TI  - Reverse-Bayes methods for evidence assessment and research synthesis
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - It is now widely accepted that the standard inferential toolkit used by the scientific research community-null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)-is not fit for purpose. Yet despite the threat posed to the scientific enterprise, there is no agreement concerning alternative approaches for evidence assessment. This lack of consensus reflects long-standing issues concerning Bayesian methods, the principal alternative to NHST. We report on recent work that builds on an approach to inference put forward over 70 years ago to address the well-known "Problem of Priors" in Bayesian analysis, by reversing the conventional prior-likelihood-posterior ("forward") use of Bayes' theorem. Such Reverse-Bayes analysis allows priors to be deduced from the likelihood by requiring that the posterior achieve a specified level of credibility. We summarise the technical underpinning of this approach, and show how it opens up new approaches to common inferential challenges, such as assessing the credibility of scientific findings, setting them in appropriate context, estimating the probability of successful replications, and extracting more insight from NHST while reducing the risk of misinterpretation. We argue that Reverse-Bayes methods have a key role to play in making Bayesian methods more accessible and attractive for evidence assessment and research synthesis. As a running example we consider a recently published meta-analysis from several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the association between corticosteroids and mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

TI  - An Improved Evidence Classification Synthesis Method Combined Information Entropy
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 28TH CHINESE CONTROL AND DECISION CONFERENCE (2016 CCDC)
CP  - 28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference
AB  - Since the evidence classification synthetic method is not enough accurate in the classification of general evidence and conflict evidence, it leads to the final fusion is not precise. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the D-S evidence classification synthesis rule, this paper redefines evidence classification attributes in the basis of the similarity between evidences and utilizing the employed information entropy attribute. Combining with the similarity attribute, the evidence could be divided into high credibility evidence, general evidence and conflict evidence. According to the division, the evidence set classified is assigned with different importance coefficients, which could be revised to improve. After improving, the general evidence and high conflict evidence are pushed close to the high credibility evidence opinion. Finally, the revised evidence is synthesized with the D-S evidence combination rule. Experimental results show that the improved approach not only solve the conflict issue well, but also reduce the evidence uncertainty. And thus, better data fusion is achieved.

TI  - Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis in cost-effectiveness analysis
T2  - PHARMACOECONOMICS
AB  - Recently, health systems internationally have begun to use cost-effectiveness research as formal inputs into decisions about which interventions and programmes should be funded from collective resources. This process has raised some important methodological questions for this area of research. This paper considers one set of issues related to the synthesis of effectiveness evidence for use in decision-analytic cost-effectiveness (CE) models, namely the need for the synthesis of all sources of available evidence, although these may not 'fit neatly' into a CE model.
   Commonly encountered problems include the absence of head-to-head trial evidence comparing all options under comparison, the presence of multiple endpoints from trials and different follow-up periods. Full evidence synthesis for CE analysis also needs to consider treatment effects between patient subpopulations and the use of nonrandomised evidence.
   Bayesian statistical methods represent a valuable set of analytical tools to utilise indirect evidence and can make a powerful contribution to the decision-analytic approach to CE analysis. This paper provides a worked example and a general overview of these methods with particular emphasis on their use in economic evaluation.

TI  - Weight of Evidence: Participatory Methods and Bayesian Updating to Contextualize Evidence Synthesis in Stakeholders' Knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIXED METHODS RESEARCH
AB  - Mixed methods research is well-suited to grapple with questions of what counts as valid knowledge across different contexts and perspectives. This article introduces Weight of Evidence as a transformative procedure for stakeholders to interpret, expand on and prioritize evidence from evidence syntheses, with a focus on engaging populations historically excluded from planning and decision making. This article presents the procedure's five steps using pilot data on perinatal care of immigrant women in Canada, engaging family physicians and birth companions. Fuzzy cognitive mapping offers an accessible and systematic way to generate priors to update published literature with stakeholder priorities. Weight of Evidence is a transparent procedure to broaden what counts as expertise, contributing to a more comprehensive, context-specific, and actionable understanding.

TI  - Developing methods for the overarching synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence: The interweave synthesis approach
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - The incorporation of evidence derived from multiple research designs into one single synthesis can enhance the utility of systematic reviews making them more worthwhile, useful, and insightful. Methodological guidance for mixed-methods synthesis continues to emerge and evolve but broadly involves a sequential, parallel, or convergent approach according to the degree of independence between individual syntheses before they are combined. We present two case studies in which we used novel and innovative methods to draw together the findings from individual but related quantitative and qualitative syntheses to aid interpretation of the overall evidence base. Our approach moved beyond making a choice between parallel, sequential, or convergent methods to interweave the findings of individual reviews and offers three key innovations to mixed-methods synthesis methods: The use of intersubjective questions to understand the findings of the individual reviews through different lenses, Immersion of key reviewers in the entirety of the evidence base, and Commencing the process during the final stages of the synthesis of individual reviews, at a point where reviewers are developing an understanding of initial findings. Underlying our approach is the process of exploration and identification of links between and across review findings, an approach that is fundamental to all evidence syntheses but usually occurs at the level of the study. Adapting existing methods for exploring and identifying patterns and links between and across studies to interweave the findings between and across reviews may prove valuable.

TI  - Research design and methods of quantitative synthesis of medical evidence
T2  - OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To review the scientific principles, strengths, and limitations of research designs and methods of quantitative synthesis of medical evidence.
   Data Sources: We used MEDLINE to perform a systematic search for literature using the keywords research design, epidemiology, and biometry. Journals searched included six major journals in obstetrics and gynecology and three in general medicine. These sources were supplemented with texts and reviews from the general medical literature.
   Methods of Study Selection: We reviewed the publications identified by our search and evaluated critically the relevant reports. We summarized objectives and scientific guidelines for the common research methodologies and outlined their advantages and disadvantages.
   Tabulation, Integration, and Results: The standard of clinical research design is the randomized controlled trial (RCT), which, if performed with sufficient methodologic rigor, is least likely to have serious biases. Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies are common observational studies used in reproductive health; such observational studies are more susceptible to biases that can distort the researcher's results and conclusions. Descriptive studies such as case series and case reports are often interesting as clinical vignettes but have limited scientific merit. Methods for quantitative Synthesis of medical evidence, including metaanalysis, decision analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis are being used with increased frequency in the reproductive health literature to summarize medical evidence.
   Conclusion: Various research methods have their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. An understanding of the scientific principles of these methods will enable the clinician to evaluate medical evidence critically. ((C) 1997 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists).

TI  - Using systems perspectives in evidence synthesis: A methodological mapping review
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - Reviewing complex interventions is challenging because they include many elements that can interact dynamically in a nonlinear manner. A systems perspective offers a way of thinking to help understand complex issues, but its application in evidence synthesis is not established. The aim of this project was to understand how and why systems perspectives have been applied in evidence synthesis. A methodological mapping review was conducted to identify papers using a systems perspective in evidence synthesis. A search was conducted in seven bibliographic databases and three search engines. A total of 101 papers (representing 98 reviews) met the eligibility criteria. Two categories of reviews were identified: (1) reviews using a "systems lens" to frame the topic, generate hypotheses, select studies, and guide the analysis and interpretation of findings (n = 76) and (2) reviews using systems methods to develop a systems model (n = 22). Several methods (e.g., systems dynamic modeling, soft systems approach) were identified, and they were used to identify, rank and select elements, analyze interactions, develop models, and forecast needs. The main reasons for using a systems perspective were to address complexity, view the problem as a whole, and understand the interrelationships between the elements. Several challenges for capturing the true nature and complexity of a problem were raised when performing these methods. This review is a useful starting point when designing evidence synthesis of complex interventions. It identifies different opportunities for applying a systems perspective in evidence synthesis, and highlights both commonplace and less familiar methods.

TI  - Causal assessment in evidence synthesis: A methodological review of reviews
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - In fields (such as population health) where randomised trials are often lacking, systematic reviews (SRs) can harness diversity in study design, settings and populations to assess the evidence for a putative causal relationship. SRs may incorporate causal assessment approaches (CAAs), sometimes called 'causal reviews', but there is currently no consensus on how these should be conducted. We conducted a methodological review of self-identifying 'causal reviews' within the field of population health to establish: (1) which CAAs are used; (2) differences in how CAAs are implemented; (3) how methods were modified to incorporate causal assessment in SRs. Three databases were searched and two independent reviewers selected reviews for inclusion. Data were extracted using a standardised form and summarised using tabulation and narratively. Fifty-three reviews incorporated CAAs: 46/53 applied Bradford Hill (BH) viewpoints/criteria, with the remainder taking alternative approaches: Medical Research Council guidance on natural experiments (2/53, 3.8%); realist reviews (2/53, 3.8%); horizontal SRs (1/53, 1.9%); 'sign test' of causal mechanisms (1/53, 1.9%); and a causal cascade model (1/53, 1.9%). Though most SRs incorporated BH, there was variation in application and transparency. There was considerable overlap across the CAAs, with a trade-off between breadth (BH viewpoints considered a greater range of causal characteristics) and depth (many alternative CAAs focused on one viewpoint). Improved transparency in the implementation of CAA in SRs in needed to ensure their validity and allow robust assessments of causality within evidence synthesis.

TI  - Methods for evidence synthesis in the case of very few studies
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - In systematic reviews, meta-analyses are routinely applied to summarize the results of the relevant studies for a specific research question. If one can assume that in all studies the same true effect is estimated, the application of a meta-analysis with common effect (commonly referred to as fixed-effect meta-analysis) is adequate. If between-study heterogeneity is expected to be present, the method of choice is a meta-analysis with random effects. The widely used DerSimonian and Laird method for meta-analyses with random effects has been criticized due to its unfavorable statistical properties, especially in the case of very few studies. A working group of the Cochrane Collaboration recommended the use of the Knapp-Hartung method for meta-analyses with random effects. However, as heterogeneity cannot be reliably estimated if only very few studies are available, the Knapp-Hartung method, while correctly accounting for the corresponding uncertainty, has very low power. Our aim is to summarize possible methods to perform meaningful evidence syntheses in the situation with only very few (ie, 2-4) studies. Some general recommendations are provided on which method should be used when. Our recommendations are based on the existing literature on methods for meta-analysis with very few studies and consensus of the authors. The recommendations are illustrated by 2 examples coming from dossier assessments of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care.

TI  - Methodology for Evidence Synthesis and Development of Comprehensive Evidence-Based Guidelines for Interventional Techniques in Chronic Spinal Pain
T2  - PAIN PHYSICIAN
AB  - Background: The re-engineered definition of clinical guidelines in 2011 from the IOM (Institute of Medicine) states, "clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that is informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefit and harms of alternative care options." The revised definition distinguishes between the term "clinical practice guideline" and other forms of clinical guidance derived from widely disparate development processes, such as consensus statements, expert advice, and appropriate use criteria.
   Objective: To assess the literature and develop methodology for evidence synthesis and development of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature including methodology of guideline development encompassing GRADE approach for guidance on evidence synthesis with recommendations.
   Results: Some of the many factors described in 2011 continue as of 2020 and impede the development of clinical practice guidelines. These impediments include biases due to a variety of conflicts and confluence of interest, inappropriate and poor methodological quality, poor writing and ambiguous presentation, projecting a view that these are not applicable to individual patients or too restrictive with the elimination of clinician autonomy, and overzealous and inappropriate recommendations, either positive, negative, or non-committal. Thus, ideally, a knowledgeable, multidisciplinary panel of experts with true lack of bias and confluence of interest must develop guidelines based on a systematic review of the existing evidence.
   This manuscript describes evidence synthesis from observational studies, various types of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and, finally, methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews. The manuscript also describes various methods utilized in the assessment of the quality of observational studies, diagnostic accuracy studies, RCTs, and systematic reviews.
   Limitations: Paucity of publications with appropriate evidence synthesis methodology in reference to interventional techniques.
   Conclusion: This review described comprehensive evidence synthesis derived from systematic reviews, including methodologic quality and bias measurement. The manuscript described various methods utilized in the assessment of the quality of the systematic reviews, RCTs, diagnostic accuracy studies, and observational studies.

TI  - Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Methodologies to Optimise Patient Care and Enhance Policy Decisions
T2  - EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS IN HEALTHCARE: A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK FOR CLINICIANS
AB  - Evidence synthesis is a term applied to a group of assessment techniques that integrate the data from variable evidence sources. These techniques are used to provide best evidence in healthcare. Evidence synthesis has several advantages when compared to single studies and traditional data integration through meta-analysis. The complexities of combining heterogeneous data sources such as the amalgamation of both qualitative and quantitative data sources can be successfully overcome by applying these techniques. Evidence synthesis can summarise data by classifying each individual source according to its quality whilst it can also quantify the degree of uncertainty in synthesis results. In this chapter, we discuss current evidence synthesis methods and consider their application for medical practitioners, scientists and policymakers. We identify the future trends and increased importance of utilising evidence synthesis for evidence-based medicine. The versatility of evidence synthesis renders it a powerful tool in attaining the ultimate goal of improved health outcomes, innovation and enhanced quality of patient care.

TI  - Meta-synthesis and evidence-based health care - a method for systematic review
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES
AB  - BackgroundEven the systematic reviews of qualitative studies are discussed health literature, the significance of their results is not fully recognised in evidence-based practice.
   AimThe aim of this article is to describe the systematic reviews of qualitative studies, metasynthesis and its process and consider the meaning of meta-synthesis in evidence-based practice.
   ConclusionsMeta-synthesis is a method for synthesising knowledge, for example, relating to service users' healthcare-related experiences and the factors that facilitate their involvement in their own care and commitment to a healthy lifestyle. This type of knowledge is needed in evidence-based practice. Meta-synthesis is a concept that includes several methodologies in synthesising qualitative research findings. This article focuses on meta-synthesis with meta-aggregation as a method for combining data from original studies. Following the principles of scientific rigour, systematic reviews synthesise the best available and critically appraised knowledge. The article describes the process and the role of systematic review of qualitative studies and discusses its significance for evidence-based practice when making clinical and administrative decisions, as well as more widely in social and political decision-making.

TI  - Bayesian methods for the cross-design synthesis of epidemiological and toxicological evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS
AB  - Systematic review and synthesis (meta-analysis) methods are now increasingly used in many areas of health care research. We investigate the potential usefulness of these methods for combining human and animal data in human health risk assessment of exposure to environmental chemicals. Currently, risk assessments are often based on narrative review and expert judgment, but systematic review and formal synthesis methods offer a more transparent and rigorous approach. The method is illustrated by using the example of trihalomethane exposure and its possible association with low birth weight. A systematic literature review identified 13 relevant studies (five epidemiological and eight toxicological). Study-specific dose-response slope estimates were obtained for each of the studies and synthesized by using Bayesian meta-analysis models. Sensitivity analyses of the results obtained to the assumptions made suggest that some assumptions are critical. It is concluded that systematic review methods should be used in the synthesis of evidence for environmental standard setting, that meta-analysis will often be a valuable approach in these contexts and that sensitivity analyses are an important component of the approach whether or not formal synthesis methods (such as systematic review and meta-analysis) are used.

TI  - Leveraging Research Synthesis Methods to Support Evidence-Based Policy- and Decision-Making
T2  - PREVENTION SCIENCE
AB  - This commentary discusses the potential utility of research syntheses for evidence-based policy- and decision-making, examining the papers that comprise the special issue on modern meta-analytic methods. Evidence and data have the potential to play a critical role in the development of policies and in the administration of programs that meet the social and economic needs of children and families. Novel, innovative, and methodologically rigorous methods that allow for comprehensive and systematic research synthesis, such as those disseminated in this special issue, can help inform the work of the federal government and the prevention science field at large. Overall, the papers hold promise for strengthening the rigor of existing approaches, illustrate novel approaches, and demonstrate the utility of information that research syntheses can produce. Collectively, the studies in this special issue advance the available toolbox of methods that can be used to support evidence-based policy- and decision-making.

TI  - Semi-Automated evidence synthesis in health psychology: current methods and future prospects
T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - The evidence base in health psychology is vast and growing rapidly. These factors make it difficult (and sometimes practically impossible) to consider all available evidence when making decisions about the state of knowledge on a given phenomenon (e.g., associations of variables, effects of interventions on particular outcomes). Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other rigorous syntheses of the research mitigate this problem by providing concise, actionable summaries of knowledge in a given area of study. Yet, conducting these syntheses has grown increasingly laborious owing to the fast accumulation of new evidence; existing, manual methods for synthesis do not scale well. In this article, we discuss how semi-automation via machine learning and natural language processing methods may help researchers and practitioners to review evidence more efficiently. We outline concrete examples in health psychology, highlighting practical, open-source technologies available now. We indicate the potential of more advanced methods and discuss how to avoid the pitfalls of automated reviews.

TI  - Using Sandelowski and Barroso's Meta-Synthesis Method in Advancing Qualitative Evidence
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this article was to iteratively account for and discuss the handling of methodological challenges in two qualitative research syntheses concerning patients' experiences of hospital transition. We applied Sandelowski and Barroso's guidelines for synthesizing qualitative research, and to our knowledge, this is the first time researchers discuss their methodological steps. In the process, we identified a need for prolonged discussions to determine mutual understandings of the methodology. We discussed how to identify the appropriate qualitative research literature and how to best conduct exhaustive literature searches on our target phenomena. Another finding concerned our status as third-order interpreters of participants' experiences and what this meant for synthesizing the primary findings. Finally, we discussed whether our studies could be classified as metasummaries or metasyntheses. Although we have some concerns regarding the applicability of the methodology, we conclude that following Sandelowski and Barroso's guidelines contributed to valid syntheses of our studies.

TI  - Structured methodology review identified seven (RETREAT) criteria for selecting qualitative evidence synthesis approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To compare and contrast different methods of qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) against criteria identified from the literature and to map their attributes to inform selection of the most appropriate QES method to answer research questions addressed by qualitative research.
   Study Design and Setting: Electronic databases, citation searching, and a study register were used to identify studies reporting QES methods. Attributes compiled from 26 methodological papers (2001-2014) were used as a framework for data extraction. Data were extracted into summary tables by one reviewer and then considered within the author team.
   Results: We identified seven considerations determining choice of methods from the methodological literature, encapsulated within the mnemonic Review question Epistemology Time/Timescale Resources Expertise Audience and purpose Type of data. We mapped 15 different published QES methods against these seven criteria. The final framework focuses on stand-alone QES methods but may also hold potential when integrating quantitative and qualitative data.
   Conclusion: These findings offer a contemporary perspective as a conceptual basis for future empirical investigation of the advantages and disadvantages of different methods of QES. It is hoped that this will inform appropriate selection of QES approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Why do researchers co-author evidence syntheses with librarians? A mixed-methods study
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - Librarians and information specialists are experts in designing comprehensive literature searches, such as those needed for Evidence Syntheses (ES). The contributions of these professionals to ES research teams have several documented benefits, especially when they collaborate on the project. However, librarian co-authorship is relatively rare. This study explores researcher motivations for working with librarians at the co-author level through a mixed methods design. Interviews with researchers identified 20 potential motivations that were then tested through an online questionnaire sent to authors of recently published ES. Consistent with previous findings, most respondents did not have a librarian co-author on their ES, though 16% acknowledged one in their manuscript and 10% consulted one but did not document the contribution. Search expertise was the most common motivation both to and not to co-author with librarians. Those that had or were interested in co-authoring stated that they wanted the librarians' search expertise, while those who had not or were not interested stated that they already had the necessary search expertise. Researchers who were motivated by methodological expertise and availability were more likely to have co-authored their ES with a librarian. No motivations were negatively associated with librarian co-authorship. These findings provide an overview of the motivations that influence researchers to bring a librarian into an ES investigatory team. More research is needed to substantiate the validity of these motivations.

AB  - Background: Organizations have been established in many countries and internationally to support the use of research evidence by producing clinical practice guidelines, undertaking health technology assessments, and/or directly supporting the use of research evidence in developing health policy on an international, national, and state or provincial level. Learning from these organizations can reduce the need to 'reinvent the wheel' and inform decisions about how best to organize support for such organizations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Methods: We undertook a multi-method study in three phases - a survey, interviews, and case descriptions that drew on site visits - and in each of the second and third phases we focused on a purposive sample of those involved in the previous phase. We used the seven main recommendations that emerged from the advice offered in the interviews to organize much of the synthesis of findings across phases and methods. We used a constant comparative method to identify themes from across phases and methods.
   Results: Seven recommendations emerged for those involved in establishing or leading organizations that support the use of research evidence in developing health policy: 1) collaborate with other organizations; 2) establish strong links with policymakers and involve stakeholders in the work; 3) be independent and manage conflicts of interest among those involved in the work; 4) build capacity among those working in the organization; 5) use good methods and be transparent in the work; 6) start small, have a clear audience and scope, and address important questions; and 7) be attentive to implementation considerations, even if implementation is not a remit. Four recommendations emerged for the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations and networks: 1) support collaborations among organizations; 2) support local adaptation efforts; 3) mobilize support; and 4) create global public goods.
   Conclusion: This synthesis of findings from a multi-method study, along with the more detailed findings from each of the three phases of the study (which are reported in the three following articles in the series), provide a strong basis on which researchers, policymakers, international organizations (and networks) like WHO can respond to the growing chorus of voices calling for efforts to support the use of research evidence in developing health policy.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in COVID-19 evidence syntheses was underutilized, but impactful: a methodological study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: A rapidly developing scenario like a pandemic requires the prompt production of high-quality systematic reviews, which can be automated using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We evaluated the application of AI tools in COVID-19 evidence syntheses. Study Design: After prospective registration of the review protocol, we automated the download of all open-access COVID-19 systematic reviews in the COVID-19 Living Overview of Evidence database, indexed them for AI-related keywords, and located those that used AI tools. We compared their journals' JCR Impact Factor, citations per month, screening workloads, completion times (from pre-registration to preprint or submission to a journal) and AMSTAR-2 methodology assessments (maximum score 13 points) with a set of publication date matched control reviews without AI. Results: Of the 3,999 COVID-19 reviews, 28 (0.7%, 95% CI 0.47-1.03%) made use of AI. On average, compared to controls (n = 64), AI reviews were published in journals with higher Impact Factors (median 8.9 vs. 3.5, P < 0.001), and screened more abstracts per author (302.2 vs. 140.3, P = 0.009) and per included study (189.0 vs. 365.8, P < 0.001) while inspecting less full texts per author (5.3 vs. 14.0, P = 0.005). No differences were found in citation counts (0.5 vs. 0.6, P = 0.600), inspected full texts per included study (3.8 vs. 3.4, P = 0.481), completion times (74.0 vs. 123.0, P = 0.205) or AMSTAR-2 (7.5 vs. 6.3, P = 0.119). Conclusion: AI was an underutilized tool in COVID-19 systematic reviews. Its usage, compared to reviews without AI, was associated with more efficient screening of literature and higher publication impact. There is scope for the application of AI in automating systematic reviews. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Synthesis of evidence from zero-events studies: A comparison of one-stage framework methods
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - In evidence synthesis, dealing with zero-events studies is an important and complicated task that has generated broad discussion. Numerous methods provide valid solutions to synthesizing data from studies with zero-events, either based on a frequentist or a Bayesian framework. Among frequentist frameworks, the one-stage methods have their unique advantages to deal with zero-events studies, especially for double-arm-zero-events. In this article, we give a concise overview of the one-stage frequentist methods. We conducted simulation studies to compare the statistical properties of these methods to the two-stage frequentist method (continuity correction) for meta-analysis with zero-events studies when double-zero-events studies were included. Our simulation studies demonstrated that the generalized estimating equation with unstructured correlation and beta-binomial method had the best performance among the one-stage methods. The random intercepts generalized linear mixed model showed good performance in the absence of obvious between-study variance. Our results also showed that the continuity correction with inverse-variance heterogeneous (IVhet) analytic model based on the two-stage framework had good performance when the between-study variance was obvious and the group size was balanced for included studies. In summary, the one-stage framework has unique advantages to deal with studies with zero events and is not susceptive to group size ratio. It should be considered in future meta-analyses whenever possible.

TI  - Making a difference: towards a method for weighing the evidence in a qualitative synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Objectives In a qualitative synthesis, primary qualitative studies are integrated to develop a theory or evidence-based interventions. Until now, the strength of the evidence in the primary studies has not been taken into account in the outcome of the qualitative synthesis. In this paper, a method is developed and evaluated to assign weights to the findings of the qualitative studies using both the frequency and the quality of the reported results.
   Method Seventeen qualitative studies were retrieved in an illustrative example project on children and trauma. Findings were extracted from the primary studies with the use of coding which resulted in 14 themes. The quality of the studies was appraised using both expert judgement and a quality checklist. These outcomes are used to calculate the weights.
   Results When the outcomes of the checklist appraisal are compared with those of the expert judgement, the effect on the strength of the evidence is virtually always in the same direction. We found that as the frequency with which a concept is studied is low, the strength of the evidence oftentimes decreases even further when using the quality of the results in the weighing process.
   Conclusions In the end, the outcomes of a critical appraisal affect the weight that is placed on particular studies. The use of a checklist is recommended because of its more distinguishing ability. The method that was developed for assigning weights to the evidence is discussed in light of both the quality appraisal in qualitative research and the objectives of qualitative synthesis.

TI  - Novel tools and methods for designing and wrangling multifunctional, machine-readable evidence synthesis databases
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB  - One of the most important steps in the process of conducting a systematic review or map is data extraction and the production of a database of coding, metadata and study data. There are many ways to structure these data, but to date, no guidelines or standards have been produced for the evidence synthesis community to support their production. Furthermore, there is little adoption of easily machine-readable, readily reusable and adaptable databases: these databases would be easier to translate into different formats by review authors, for example for tabulation, visualisation and analysis, and also by readers of the review/map. As a result, it is common for systematic review and map authors to produce bespoke, complex data structures that, although typically provided digitally, require considerable efforts to understand, verify and reuse. Here, we report on an analysis of systematic reviews and maps published by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, and discuss major issues that hamper machine readability and data reuse or verification. We highlight different justifications for the alternative data formats found: condensed databases; long databases; and wide databases. We describe these challenges in the context of data science principles that can support curation and publication of machine-readable, Open Data. We then go on to make recommendations to review and map authors on how to plan and structure their data, and we provide a suite of novel R-based functions to support efficient and reliable translation of databases between formats that are useful for presentation (condensed, human readable tables), filtering and visualisation (wide databases), and analysis (long databases). We hope that our recommendations for adoption of standard practices in database formatting, and the tools necessary to rapidly move between formats will provide a step-change in transparency and replicability of Open Data in evidence synthesis.

TI  - Barriers and enablers to adolescent self-consent for vaccination: A mixed-methods evidence synthesis
T2  - VACCINE
AB  - 2 Introduction: The recent global expansion of routine adolescent vaccination programmes has the potential to protect young people against infectious diseases and improve their health. Although the legal framework in many countries permits young people to consent for vaccinations if competent, lack of written parental consent can still prevent uptake. We aimed to review systematically the associated barriers and enablers to implementation of adolescent self-consent procedures.
   Methods: A comprehensive search strategy of ten databases from inception to June 2018 was undertaken to identify relevant qualitative and quantitative studies. Titles, abstracts and full texts were assessed for eligibility, and the methodological quality of eligible primary studies evaluated. Thematic synthesis methods were used to interpret and combine qualitative data, and to identify overarching themes as well as similarities and differences within themes. Quantitative data were summarised and, because the data were sufficiently similar in focus, were integrated within the qualitative framework.
   Results: Twenty-five publications related to 23 studies were included. Three themes were identified which related to the policy framework, protection, and self-determination. Despite supportive national policy frameworks, implementation of adolescent self-consent procedures can be prevented by local policies, professionals' misunderstandings of the legal framework and the context in which the vaccination programme is delivered. Motivation to protect young people's health increased acceptability of adolescent self-consent, but implementation might be prevented to protect the reputation of professionals or relationships with parents. Further, maintaining the role of parents as decision-makers for their child's healthcare was frequently prioritised over enabling young people's autonomy to consent.
   Conclusions: Barriers to the implementation of adolescent self-consent procedures have implications for young people's health and uptake of vaccination programmes. There is a need to clarify the policy framework and challenge the primacy of parental consent. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Misleading Meta-Analyses during COVID-19 Pandemic: Examples of Methodological Biases in Evidence Synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Not all evidence is equal. Evidence-based public health and medicine emanate from the principle that there is a hierarchy of evidence, with systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) being at the top, as the highest level of evidence. Despite this, it is common in literature to find SRMAs with methodological issues that can distort the results and can thus have serious public health or clinical implications. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the importance of evidence and the way in which evidence was produced was stress tested and revealed a wide array of methodological biases that might have led to misleading conclusions and recommendations. We provide a critical examination of methodological biases in selected SRMAs on COVID-19, which have been widely used to guide or justify some pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions with high public health and clinical significance, such as mask wearing, asymptomatic transmission, and ivermectin. Through these selected examples, we highlight the need to address biases related to the methodological quality and relevance of study designs and effect size computations and considerations for critical appraisal of available data in the evidence synthesis process for better quality evidence. Such considerations help researchers and decision makers avoid misleading conclusions, while encouraging the provision of the best policy recommendations for individual and public health.

TI  - Tackling obesity in mental health secure units: a mixed method synthesis of available evidence
T2  - BJPSYCH OPEN
AB  - Background
   The prevalence and incidence of obesity are high in people with severe mental illness (SMI). In England, around 6000 people with SMI access care from secure mental health units. There is currently no specific guidance on how to reduce the risk of obesity-related morbidity and mortality in this population.
   Aims
   To identify international evidence that addresses the issue of obesity in mental health secure units.
   Method
   A mixed method review of evidence (published 2000-2015) was carried out to assess obesity prevalence, intervention and policy change, as well as barriers to change.
   Results
   Evidence from 22 mainly small, non-comparator studies (reported in 21 papers) using a range of methods was reviewed. Dietary, physical activity and cultural interventions being implemented within secure units to address the problem of obesity showed some promising outcomes for physical health and health education. These were facilitated by adequate organisational resources, staff training and motivated staff. Holistic interventions that included a social and/or competitive element were more likely to be taken up. Involving patients in decision-making mediated the tension between facilitating behaviour change and imposing control. Barriers to successful outcomes included patient movement in and out of units, severity of mental health condition and resistance to change by patients and staff.
   Conclusions
   Despite the promising outcomes reported, further assessment is needed of the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of interventions and policies targeting the obesogenic environment, using robust research methods. (c) The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2018.

TI  - Introducing EMMIE: an evidence rating scale to encourage mixed-method crime prevention synthesis reviews
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - This paper describes the need for, and the development of, a coding system to distil the quality and coverage of systematic reviews of the evidence relating to crime prevention interventions. The starting point for the coding system concerns the evidence needs of policymakers and practitioners.
   The proposed coding scheme (EMMIE) builds on previous scales that have been developed to assess the probity, coverage and utility of evidence both in health and criminal justice. It also draws on the principles of realist synthesis and review.
   The proposed EMMIE scale identifies five dimensions to which systematic reviews intended to inform crime prevention should speak. These are the Effect of intervention, the identification of the causal Mechanism(s) through which interventions are intended to work, the factors that Moderate their impact, the articulation of practical Implementation issues, and the Economic costs of intervention.
   Systematic reviews of crime prevention, and the primary studies on which they are based, typically address the question of effect size, but are often silent on the other dimensions of EMMIE. This lacuna of knowledge is unhelpful to practitioners who want to know more than what might work to reduce crime. The EMMIE framework is intended to encourage the collection of primary data regarding these issues and the synthesis of such knowledge in future systematic reviews.

TI  - A review of the quantitative effectiveness evidence synthesis methods used in public health intervention guidelines
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The complexity of public health interventions create challenges in evaluating their effectiveness. There have been huge advancements in quantitative evidence synthesis methods development (including meta-analysis) for dealing with heterogeneity of intervention effects, inappropriate 'lumping' of interventions, adjusting for different populations and outcomes and the inclusion of various study types. Growing awareness of the importance of using all available evidence has led to the publication of guidance documents for implementing methods to improve decision making by answering policy relevant questions.
   Methods: The first part of this paper reviews the methods used to synthesise quantitative effectiveness evidence in public health guidelines by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that had been published or updated since the previous review in 2012 until the 19th August 2019.The second part of this paper provides an update of the statistical methods and explains how they address issues related to evaluating effectiveness evidence of public health interventions.
   Results: The proportion of NICE public health guidelines that used a meta-analysis as part of the synthesis of effectiveness evidence has increased since the previous review in 2012 from 23% (9 out of 39) to 31% (14 out of 45). The proportion of NICE guidelines that synthesised the evidence using only a narrative review decreased from 74% (29 out of 39) to 60% (27 out of 45).An application in the prevention of accidents in children at home illustrated how the choice of synthesis methods can enable more informed decision making by defining and estimating the effectiveness of more distinct interventions, including combinations of intervention components, and identifying subgroups in which interventions are most effective.
   Conclusions: Despite methodology development and the publication of guidance documents to address issues in public health intervention evaluation since the original review, NICE public health guidelines are not making full use of meta-analysis and other tools that would provide decision makers with fuller information with which to develop policy. There is an evident need to facilitate the translation of the synthesis methods into a public health context and encourage the use of methods to improve decision making.

TI  - A Novel LIDAR Classification Method Based on Ensemble Random Forest and D-S Evidence Synthesis
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2018 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODELLING, IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL (ICMIC)
CP  - 10th International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control (ICMIC)
AB  - Light detection and ranging system (LIDAR) can quickly, proactively and automatically acquire point cloud data of large-scale area, which contains three-dimensional land-cover object information, meanwhile the multispectral cameras can acquire multi-band spectral information. This paper extracts and selects sixteen features according to point cloud data and spectral images, then these features are divided into five groups, such as height feature subset, intensity subset, spectral subset and texture subset. The weight of each group of features in the decision-making process is characterized by the features' importance. This paper introduces evidence synthesis theory to overcome the evidence conflict in decision-making and to improve decision precision. Final land-cover objects labels are predicted through ensemble algorithm based on random forest and weighted D-S evidence synthesis. The experiment results indicate that classification performance of joint feature set is superior to single feature set, compound classification framework can optimize final classification results. The overall accuracy reaches to 94% and other parameters can also be improved more or less.

TI  - Applying GRADE-CERQual to qualitative evidence synthesis findings-paper 3: how to assess methodological limitations
T2  - IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
AB  - Background: The GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach has been developed by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Working Group. The approach has been developed to support the use of findings from qualitative evidence syntheses in decision-making, including guideline development and policy formulation. CERQual includes four components for assessing how much confidence to place in findings from reviews of qualitative research (also referred to as qualitative evidence syntheses): (1) methodological limitations, (2) coherence, (3) adequacy of data and (4) relevance. This paper is part of a series providing guidance on how to apply CERQual and focuses on CERQual's methodological limitations component.
   Methods: We developed the methodological limitations component by searching the literature for definitions, gathering feedback from relevant research communities and developing consensus through project group meetings. We tested the CERQual methodological limitations component within several qualitative evidence syntheses before agreeing on the current definition and principles for application.
   Results: When applying CERQual, we define methodological limitations as the extent to which there are concerns about the design or conduct of the primary studies that contributed evidence to an individual review finding. In this paper, we describe the methodological limitations component and its rationale and offer guidance on how to assess methodological limitations of a review finding as part of the CERQual approach. This guidance outlines the information required to assess methodological limitations component, the steps that need to be taken to assess methodological limitations of data contributing to a review finding and examples of methodological limitation assessments.
   Conclusions: This paper provides guidance for review authors and others on undertaking an assessment of methodological limitations in the context of the CERQual approach. More work is needed to determine which criteria critical appraisal tools should include when assessing methodological limitations. We currently recommend that whichever tool is used, review authors provide a transparent description of their assessments of methodological limitations in a review finding. We expect the CERQual approach and its individual components to develop further as our experiences with the practical implementation of the approach increase.

TI  - Systematic review of the methodological literature for integrating qualitative evidence syntheses into health guideline development
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - Guidelines produced by local, national and international bodies underpin clinical practice and healthcare services worldwide. For guidelines to be based on the best available evidence, it is critical that syntheses of both qualitative and quantitative evidence are used to inform decision-making. As methods for qualitative evidence syntheses (QES) develop, they are increasingly able to inform health guideline production. However, the process whereby this form of evidence is considered and incorporated tends to be unclear. This systematic review synthesized existing guidance concerning the use of QES in guideline development. Sources published in English that described or prescribed methods for incorporating QES into evidence-based health guidelines were eligible for inclusion. Seventeen relevant papers were identified. The literature indicates that there is a reasonable consensus about many stages of conducting a QES to inform guideline development. Areas needing further exploration include: the way that committees engage with QES; the usefulness of different QES methodologies; and understanding of how expert committees use evidence. Methods for producing QES for guideline committees tend to be similar to quantitative systematic review methods in terms of searching, quality appraisal, systematic management of data, and presentation of results. While this allows transparency and accountability, it could be argued that it is less "true" to the principles of being led by the data, which are fundamental to most qualitative research. Understanding the process of using QES to produce guidelines is critical to determining their validity and applicability, and to ensure that healthcare provision is based on the best available evidence.

TI  - A scoping review found increasing examples of rapid qualitative evidence syntheses and no methodological guidance
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: The objective of the study was to identify existing methodological guidance for the conduct of rapid qualitative evidence syntheses and examples of rapid qualitative evidence syntheses to describe the methods used.
   Study Design and Setting: We conducted a systematic scoping review. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, gray literature, including PROSPERO, with no date limits and solicited examples through experts and researchers in the field.
   Results: We found no methodological guidance to direct the conduct of rapid qualitative evidence synthesis and 15 examples including 13 completed reviews and two protocols. Diverse methods to abbreviate the review process were followed, which largely mirror methods developed for rapid reviews of clinical effects. Abbreviated search strategies, including date and language restrictions, were common, as was the use of a single reviewer for screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal. Descriptive approaches to synthesis, such as thematic synthesis, were more common than interpretive approaches, such as metaethnography.
   Conclusion: There is a need to develop and explore methods for the synthesis of qualitative research that balance the need for rapidity with rigor. In the meantime, providing details on the methods used, shortcuts made, and the implications of such methodological choices, together with collective sharing of innovations, becomes more important under increased time constraints.

AB  - Deep belief network (DBN) is a generative learning strategy which has been proposed very early, similar to the rest deep learning algorithms, the complex network structure and the large size of parameters increase calculation cost greatly, the application is limited greatly. In order to solve this problem, a decision-level identification method named distributed DBN weighted Dempster-Shafer synthesis (DDWDS) is proposed for high-precision classification of remote sensing objects. Firstly, the low-dimensional features and a small number of samples are selected randomly, many distributed, independent and lean DBN networks are constructed and trained. Secondly, their classification results are used as a trust allocation function of the evidence focal element, and finally obtain the trust allocation function of each focal element based on weighted synthetic rules. With the multi-source remote sensing data of the light detection and ranging(LIDAR) system, the recognition accuracy of distributed DBNs which are constructed by 4 features and 20% samples is below 0.7, this situation shows great conflict, training cost decreases significantly, but the final classification recognition accuracy is raised to more than 0.9 with the proposed DD-WDS. The results show that the method can determine the scale of the network by itself, and achieves better performance.

TI  - End-user understanding of qualitative comparative analysis used within evidence synthesis: A mixed-methods study
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - Background Enhanced uptake of systematic reviews that use qualitative comparative analyses (QCA) requires knowing how end-users interpret such findings. The study purpose was to identify effective approaches to communicating results from a QCA within a systematic review. Methods Sequential exploratory mixed methods design; thematic analysis of interviews with 11 end-users followed by a randomized experiment with 254 participants that provided QCA results for a hypothetical review presented through three formats (text, table, and figure). A survey administered after the experiment assessed subjective and objective comprehension of QCA results. Results Interview themes included use of jargon; appropriate use of appendices, tables, figures; and integration of QCA results within the systematic review. In the experiment, we observed a significant difference (p = 0.035) in subjective comprehension across the three presentation formats. Participants randomized to the figure and text formats scored higher compared to the table. No significant differences were observed for objective comprehension overall (p = 0.11). However, for parameter interpretation (a unique component of QCA results), scores among participants that received the figure format were significantly higher than scores for participants who received the text (p = 0.001) or table (p = 0.004). No significant differences (p = 0.09) were observed in objective comprehension for configuration interpretation. Conclusions End-users of systematic reviews saw value in the use of QCA, but unfamiliar methods and terminology were barriers to full understanding of the findings. When presenting results, a figure format appears to be superior to text or table formats based on measures of subjective comprehension and some measures of objective comprehension.

TI  - Evaluating and improving the reliability of evidence syntheses in conservation and environmental science: A methodology
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The volume of primary literature in conservation and environmental science is expanding rapidly. Evidence syntheses that review and combine the findings from research on policy-relevant questions are therefore vital for informing decision-making. However, such syntheses exhibit considerable variation in conduct and reporting, potentially undermining their value to decision-makers. To address this problem, we developed a scoring system - the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Synthesis Assessment Tool (CEESAT) - that uses detailed criteria and guidelines to evaluate policy-relevant syntheses in conservation and environmental science. The higher the score awarded, the greater the objectivity, comprehensiveness and transparency of the synthesis, hence the greater the confidence in its reliability. We then used 40 review articles to test CEESAT in terms of (i) applicability to different syntheses, (ii) validity of scores awarded, (iii) effectiveness at discriminating between syntheses, and (iv) repeatability of scoring by different assessors. CEESAT was applicable to 36 articles, and scores ranged from 1 to 33 (mean = 13.2, median = 15, maximum possible = 39). Variation in overall scores and in the individual criteria shows that CEESAT discriminates effectively among syntheses, making differences in rigour clear. Scoring was repeatable, indicating that assessments are not overly susceptible to differences in the application and interpretation of guidelines. The detailed rationale and guidelines for each criterion should help improve future syntheses and promote consistent scoring between assessors. Furthermore, scores can be used directly by non-specialists to compare syntheses that investigate key conservation questions and to incorporate reliability and rigour into decision-making.

TI  - Use of GRADE in evidence syntheses published in high-impact-factor nutrition journals: A methodological survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To identify and describe the use of the GRADE approach for rating the certainty of evidence in nutrition systematic reviews (SRs). Study design and setting: We systematically searched for SRs using GRADE that were published between 2015 and 2019 in the 10 "nutrition" journals with the highest impact factor according to the JCR 2018. Results: Out of 800 SRs, 55 SRs of randomized control trials (RCTs) and/or nonrandomized studies (NRSs) used GRADE. Fortyseven SRs (5.9%) rated the outcome specific certainty of evidence (n = 36 in 2018/2019). We identified a total of 465 certainty of evidence outcome ratings (n = 335 RCT ratings), ranging from very-low (28.8%) to low (41%), moderate (26.5%), and high (3.7%). Very-low and high certainty of evidence ratings accounted for 61.4% and 0.8% of ratings in SRs of NRSs, compared to 16.1% and 4.8% in SRs of RCTs. Certainty of evidence was downgraded mostly for risk of bias (37.8%) and imprecision (33%) in SRs of RCTs and for imprecision (32.7%), risk of bias (29.4%) and inconsistency (29%) in SRs of NRSs. Conclusion: Our study suggests a need for directing more attention toward strengthening acceptance of GRADE as well as building knowledge of the GRADE methodology in nutrition evidence synthesis.

TI  - Weaving common threads in environmental causal assessment methods: toward an ideal method for rapid evidence synthesis
T2  - FRESHWATER SCIENCE
AB  - Accurate and informative methods for evidence synthesis that are also simple and inexpensive to implement would greatly increase our ability to use scientific research results to better manage natural environments. Across the world, pressure to use evidence-based environmental management is increasing, but little guidance exists as to what 'evidence-based' actually means. Methods for systematic review of literature evidence have been modified from those used in medical research, but the effort involved in using these methods means that they have not been widely adopted. We compared 3 independently developed approaches to 'rapid evidence synthesis' methods developed in an attempt to improve efficiency and responsiveness compared to standard methods for systematic review. Each method has features that should be included in an ideal rapid evidence-synthesis method and has potential for further development. Increasing standardization of methods for evidence extraction, quality assessment, and synthesis increases the transparency and repeatability of the results obtained. However, the most important consideration is that the methods are fit for purpose; i.e., that each method is good enough to do the job required. The methods presented in this BRIDGES cluster, and potentially a combined method derived from them, could reduce the effort and cost of evidence synthesis to the scales required for management decisions.

TI  - Evidence of protein synthesis during resuscitation of ischemically damaged canine pancreas by the two-layer method
T2  - PANCREAS
AB  - The two-layer method, which supplies sufficient oxygen to the canine pancreas graft and allows adenotriphosphate synthesis within the graft, resuscitates the ischemically damaged pancreas graft during mild hypothermic (20 degrees C) preservation, but the mechanisms are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether protein synthesis was performed on ischemically damaged pancreas graft during preservation by the two-layer method in a canine autotransplantation model. The pancreas,grafts subjected to 90 minutes of warm ischemia were preserved by the two-layer method (perfluorochemical/University of Wisconsin solution) at 20 degrees C for 5 hours. Graft viability was judged from graft survival after autotransplantation. DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis was quantitated by determining incorporation of tritiated thymidine, tritiated uridine, and tritiated leucine, respectively, during preservation. Significant increases in RNA and subsequent protein syntheses were observed during preservation by the two-layer method. In contrast, DNA synthesis did not follow RNA and protein synthesis. We conclude that protein is synthesized in the process of post ischemic cellular recovery of the pancreas graft during mild hypothermic preservation by the two-layer method.

TI  - Considering axiological integrity: a methodological analysis of qualitative evidence syntheses, and its implications for health professions education
T2  - ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION
AB  - Qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) is a suite of methodologies that combine qualitative techniques with the synthesis of qualitative knowledge. They are particularly suited to medical education as these approaches pool findings from original qualitative studies, whilst paying attention to context and theoretical development. Although increasingly sophisticated use is being made of qualitative primary research methodologies in health professions education (HPE) the use of secondary qualitative reviews in HPE remains underdeveloped. This study examined QES methods applied to clinical humanism in healthcare as a way of advancing thinking around the use of QES in HPE in general. A systematic search strategy identified 49 reviews that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-study was used to develop an analytic summary of methodological characteristics, the role of theory, and the synthetic processes used in QES reviews. Fifteen reviews used a defined methodology, and 17 clearly explained the processes that led from data extraction to synthesis. Eight reviews adopted a specific theoretical perspective. Authors rarely described their reflexive relationship with their data. Epistemological positions tended to be implied rather than explicit. Twenty-five reviews included some form of quality appraisal, although it was often unclear how authors acted on its results. Reviewers under-reported qualitative approaches in their review methodologies, and tended to focus on elements such as systematicity and checklist quality appraisal that were more germane to quantitative evidence synthesis. A core concern was that the axiological (value) dimensions of the source materials were rarely considered let alone accommodated in the synthesis techniques used. QES can be used in HPE research but only with careful attention to maintaining axiological integrity.

TI  - GRADE Use in Evidence Syntheses Published in High-Impact-Factor Gynecology and Obstetrics Journals: A Methodological Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To identify and describe the certainty of evidence of gynecology and obstetrics systematic reviews (SRs) using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Method: Database searches of SRs using GRADE, published between 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020, in the 10 "gynecology and obstetrics" journals with the highest impact factor, according to the Journal Citation Report 2019. Selected studies included those SRs using the GRADE approach, used to determine the certainty of evidence. Results: Out of 952 SRs, ninety-six SRs of randomized control trials (RCTs) and/or nonrandomized studies (NRSs) used GRADE. Sixty-seven SRs (7.04%) rated the certainty of evidence for specific outcomes. In total, we identified 946 certainty of evidence outcome ratings (n = 614 RCT ratings), ranging from very-low (42.28%) to low (28.44%), moderate (17.65%), and high (11.63%). High and very low certainty of evidence ratings accounted for 2.16% and 71.60% in the SRs of NRSs, respectively, compared with 16.78% and 26.55% in the SRs of RCTs. In the SRs of RCTs and NRSs, certainty of evidence was mainly downgraded due to imprecision and bias risks. Conclusions: More attention needs to be paid to strengthening GRADE acceptance and building knowledge of GRADE methods in gynecology and obstetrics evidence synthesis.

TI  - Expediting evidence synthesis for healthcare decision-making: exploring attitudes and perceptions towards rapid reviews using Q methodology
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background: Rapid reviews expedite the knowledge synthesis process with the goal of providing timely information to healthcare decision-makers who want to use evidence-informed policy and practice approaches. A range of opinions and viewpoints on rapid reviews is thought to exist; however, no research to date has formally captured these views. This paper aims to explore evidence producer and knowledge user attitudes and perceptions towards rapid reviews.
   Methods: A Q methodology study was conducted to identify central viewpoints about rapid reviews based on a broad topic discourse. Participants rank-ordered 50 text statements and explained their Q-sort in free-text comments. Individual Q-sorts were analysed using Q-Assessor (statistical method: factor analysis with varimax rotation). Factors, or salient viewpoints on rapid reviews, were identified, interpreted and described.
   Results: Analysis of the 11 individual Q sorts identified three prominent viewpoints: Factor A cautions against the use of study design labels to make judgements. Factor B maintains that rapid reviews should be the exception and not the rule. Factor C focuses on the practical needs of the end-user over the review process.
   Conclusion: Results show that there are opposing viewpoints on rapid reviews, yet some unity exists. The three factors described offer insight into how and why various stakeholders act as they do and what issues may need to be resolved before increase uptake of the evidence from rapid reviews can be realized in healthcare decision-making environments.

TI  - Quantitative Evidence for the Dependence of Highly Crystalline Single Wall Carbon Nanotube Synthesis on the Growth Method
T2  - NANOMATERIALS
AB  - We present a study quantitatively demonstrating that the method of synthesis (gas phase, fixed bed, non-fixed bed) represents a determining factor in the level of crystallinity in growing single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Using far infrared spectroscopy, the "effective length" (associated with the level of crystallinity) was estimated for CNTs grown using various synthetic methods (lab-produced and supplemented by commercially purchased SWCNTs) as a metric for crystallinity (i.e., defect density). Analysis of the observed "effective lengths" showed that the SWCNTs fell into two general groups: long and short (high and low crystallinity) synthesized by gas-phase methods and all other supported catalyst methods, respectively. Importantly, the "long" group exhibited effective lengths in the range of 700-2200 nm, which was greater than double that of the typical values representing the "short" group (110-490 nm). These results highlight the significant difference in crystallinity. We interpret that the difference in the crystallinity stemmed from stress concentration at the nanotube-catalyst interface during the growth process, which originated from various sources of mismatch in growth rates (e.g., vertically aligned array) as well as impact stress from contact with other substrates during fluidization or rotation. These results are consistent with well-accepted belief, but now are demonstrated quantitatively.

Until in recent times, the results of scientific findings have been summarised in narrative reviews where the summary of transparent and objective results have become increasingly difficult. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, conducted by subsequent strict protocols to guarantee reproducibility and decrease bias, have become more common in the synthesis of evidence.

TI  - Qualitative evidence synthesis for complex interventions and guideline development: clarification of the purpose, designs and relevant methods
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - This paper is one of a series exploring the implications of complexity for systematic reviews and guideline development, commissioned by the WHO. The paper specifically explores the role of qualitative evidence synthesis. Qualitative evidence synthesis is the broad term for the group of methods used to undertake systematic reviews of qualitative research evidence. As an approach, qualitative evidence synthesis is increasingly recognised as having a key role to play in addressing questions relating to intervention or system complexity, and guideline development processes. This is due to the unique role qualitative research can play in establishing the relative importance of outcomes, the acceptability, fidelity and reach of interventions, their feasibility in different settings and potential consequences on equity across populations. This paper outlines the purpose of qualitative evidence synthesis, provides detail of how qualitative evidence syntheses can help establish understanding and explanation of the complexity that can occur in relation to both interventions and systems, and how qualitative evidence syntheses can contribute to evidence to decision frameworks. It provides guidance for the choice of qualitative evidence synthesis methods in the context of guideline development for complex interventions, giving ` real life' examples of where this has occurred. Information to support decision-making around choice qualitative evidence synthesis methods in the context of guideline development is provided. Approaches for reporting qualitative evidence syntheses are discussed alongside mechanisms for assessing confidence in the findings of a review.

TI  - How do systematic reviews incorporate risk of bias assessments into the synthesis of evidence? A methodological study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Background Systematic reviews (SRs) are expected to critically appraise included studies and privilege those at lowest risk of bias (RoB) in the synthesis. This study examines if and how critical appraisals inform the synthesis and interpretation of evidence in SRs.
   Methods All SRs published in March-May 2012 in 14 high-ranked medical journals and a sample from the Cochrane library were systematically assessed by two reviewers to determine if and how: critical appraisal was conducted; RoB was summarised at study, domain and review levels; and RoB appraisals informed the synthesis process.
   Results Of the 59 SRs studied, all except six (90%) conducted a critical appraisal of the included studies, with most using or adapting existing tools. Almost half of the SRs reported critical appraisal in a manner that did not allow readers to determine which studies included in a review were most robust. RoB assessments were not incorporated into synthesis in one-third (20) of the SRs, with their consideration more likely when reviews focused on randomised controlled trials. Common methods for incorporating critical appraisals into the synthesis process were sensitivity analysis, narrative discussion and exclusion of studies at high RoB. Nearly half of the reviews which investigated multiple outcomes and carried out study-level RoB summaries did not consider the potential for RoB to vary across outcomes.
   Conclusions The conclusions of the SRs, published in major journals, are frequently uninformed by the critical appraisal process, even when conducted. This may be particularly problematic for SRs of public health topics that often draw on diverse study designs.

TI  - Methods to identify postnatal depression in primary care: an integrated evidence synthesis and value of information analysis
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Objectives: To provide an overview of methods to identify postnatal depression (PND) in primary care and to assess their validity, acceptability, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, to model estimates of cost, to assess whether any method meets UK National Screening Committee (NSC) criteria and to identify areas for future research.
   Data sources: Searches of 20 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CENTRAL, DARE and CDSR), forward citation searching, personal communication with authors and searching of reference lists.
   Review methods: A generalised linear mixed model approach to the bivariate meta-analysis was undertaken for the validation review with quality assessment using QUADAS. Within the acceptability review, a textual narrative approach was employed to synthesise qualitative and quantitative research evidence. For the clinical and cost-effectiveness reviews methods outlined by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration were followed. Probabilistic models were developed to estimate the costs associated with different identification strategies.
   Results: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was the most frequently explored instrument across all of the reviews. In terms of test performance, postnatally the EPDS performed reasonably well: sensitivity ranged from 0.60 (specificity 0.97) to 0.96 (specificity 0.45) for major depression only; from 0.31 (specificity 0.99) to 0.91 (specificity 0.67) for major or minor depression; and from 0.38 (specificity 0.99) to 0.86 (specificity 0.87) for any psychiatric disorder. Evidence from the acceptability review indicated that, in the majority of studies, the EPDS was acceptable to women and health-care professionals when women were forewarned of the process, when the EPDS was administered in the home, with due attention to training, with empathetic skills of the health visitor and due consideration to positive responses to question 10 about self-harm. Suggestive evidence from the clinical effectiveness review indicated that use of the EPDS, compared with usual care, may lead to reductions in the number of women with depression scores above a threshold. In the absence of existing cost-effectiveness studies of PND identification strategies, a decision-analytic model was developed. The results of the base-case analysis suggested that use of formal identification strategies did not appear to represent value for money, based on conventional thresholds of cost-effectiveness used in the NHS. However, the scenarios considered demonstrated that this conclusion was primarily driven by the costs of false positives assumed in the base-case model.
   Conclusions: In light of the results of our evidence synthesis and decision modelling we revisited the examination of PND screening against five of the NSC criteria. We found that the accepted criteria for a PND screening programme were not currently met. The evidence suggested that there is a simple, safe, precise and validated screening test, in principle a suitable cutoff level could be defined and that the test is acceptable to the population. Evidence surrounding clinical and cost-effectiveness of methods to identify PND is lacking. Further research should aim to identify the optimal identification strategy, in terms of key psychometric properties for postnatal populations. In particular, research comparing the performance of the Whooley and help questions, the EPDS and a generic depression measure would be informative. It would also be informative to identify the natural history of PND over time and to identify the clinical effectiveness of the most valid and acceptable method to identify PND. Further research within a randomised controlled trial would provide robust estimates of the clinical effectiveness.

TI  - Conceptual recommendations for selecting the most appropriate knowledge synthesis method to answer research questions related to complex evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To compare and contrast different knowledge synthesis methods and map their specific steps through a scoping review to gain a better understanding of how to select the most appropriate knowledge synthesis method to answer research questions of complex evidence.
   Study design and setting: Electronic databases were searched to identify studies reporting emerging knowledge synthesis methods (e.g., Realist review) across multidisciplinary fields. Two reviewers independently selected studies and abstracted data for each article.
   Results: We synthesized diverse, often conflicting evidence to identify 12 unique knowledge synthesis methods and 13 analysis methods. We organized the 12 full knowledge synthesis methods according to their purpose, outputs and applicability for practice and policy, as well as general guidance on formulating the research question. To make sense of the overlap across these knowledge synthesis methods, we derived a conceptual algorithm to elucidate the process for selecting the optimal knowledge synthesis methods for particular research questions.
   Conclusion: These findings represent a preliminary understanding on which we will base further advancement of knowledge in this field. As part of next steps, we will convene a meeting of international leaders in the field aimed at clarifying emerging knowledge synthesis approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Double-counting of populations in evidence synthesis in public health: a call for awareness and future methodological development
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background There is a growing interest in the inclusion of real-world and observational studies in evidence synthesis such as meta-analysis and network meta-analysis in public health. While this approach offers great epidemiological opportunities, use of such studies often introduce a significant issue of double-counting of participants and databases in a single analysis. Therefore, this study aims to introduce and illustrate the nuances of double-counting of individuals in evidence synthesis including real-world and observational data with a focus on public health. Methods The issues associated with double-counting of individuals in evidence synthesis are highlighted with a number of case studies. Further, double-counting of information in varying scenarios is discussed with potential solutions highlighted. Results Use of studies of real-world data and/or established cohort studies, for example studies evaluating the effectiveness of therapies using health record data, often introduce a significant issue of double-counting of individuals and databases. This refers to the inclusion of the same individuals multiple times in a single analysis. Double-counting can occur in a number of manners, such as, when multiple studies utilise the same database, when there is overlapping timeframes of analysis or common treatment arms across studies. Some common practices to address this include synthesis of data only from peer-reviewed studies, utilising the study that provides the greatest information (e.g. largest, newest, greater outcomes reported) or analysing outcomes at different time points. Conclusions While common practices currently used can mitigate some of the impact of double-counting of participants in evidence synthesis including real-world and observational studies, there is a clear need for methodological and guideline development to address this increasingly significant issue.

TI  - MARXISM AS A THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK IN COLLECTIVE HEALTH: IMPLICATIONS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS OF EVIDENCE
T2  - REVISTA DA ESCOLA DE ENFERMAGEM DA USP
AB  - In this study, we discuss the integration in systematic reviews of research developed from a Marxist perspective of knowledge production and their results as evidence in healthcare. The study objectives are to review the assumptions of dialectical and historical materialism (DHM) and discuss the implications of dialectics for a literature review and the synthesis of evidence. DHM is a powerful framework for knowledge generation and transformation of policies and practices in healthcare. It assumes that social contradictions underlie the health-disease process, the fundamental theoretical construction in the field of collective health. Currently, we observe a considerable influence of the critical paradigm, of Marxist origin, in the construction of knowledge in health. Studies based on this critical paradigm incorporate complex methods, which are inherent to the guidelines of dialect, to identify the object and arrive at results that constitute evidence in healthcare. Systematic reviews should address the methodological difficulties associated with entirely integrating these results to healthcare.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to implementation of epilepsy self-management programs: a systematic review using qualitative evidence synthesis methods
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background Epilepsy affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Self-management is critical for individuals with epilepsy in order to maintain optimal physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Implementing and adopting a self-management program requires considering many factors at the person, program, and systems levels. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative and mixed-methods studies to identify facilitators and barriers that impact implementation and adoption of self-management programs for adults with epilepsy. Methods We used established systematic review methodologies for qualitative and mixed-methods studies. We included studies addressing facilitators (i.e., factors that aided) or barriers (i.e., factors that impeded) to implementation and adoption of self-management interventions for adults with epilepsy. We conducted a narrative thematic synthesis to identify facilitators and barriers. Results The literature search identified 2700 citations; 13 studies met eligibility criteria. Our synthesis identified five themes that categorize facilitators and barriers to successful implementation epilepsy self-management: (1) relevance, intervention content that facilitates acquisition of self-management skills; (2) personalization, intervention components that account for the individual's social, physical, and environmental characteristics; (3) intervention components, components and dosing of the intervention; (4) technology considerations, considerations that account for individual's use, familiarity with, and ownership of technology; and (5) clinician interventionist, role and preparation of the individual who leads intervention. We identified facilitators in 11 of the 13 studies and barriers in 11 of the 13 studies and classified these by social-ecological level (i.e., patient/caregiver, program, site/system). Conclusion Identification of facilitators and barriers at multiple levels provides insight into disease-specific factors that influence implementation and adoption of self-management programs for individuals with epilepsy. Our findings indicate that involving individuals with epilepsy and their caregivers in intervention development, and then tailoring intervention content during the intervention, can help ensure the content is relevant to intervention participants. Our findings also indicate the role of the clinician (i.e., the individual who provides self-management education) is important to intervention implementation, and key issues with clinicians were identified as barriers and opportunities for improvement. Overall, our findings have practical value for those seeking to implement and adopt self-management interventions for epilepsy and other chronic illnesses.

TI  - Using narrative evidence synthesis in HRM research: An overview of the method, its application, and the lessons learned
T2  - HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
AB  - The use of systematic approaches to evidence review and synthesis has recently become more common in the field of organizational research, yet their value remains unclear and largely untested. First used in medical research, evidence review is a technique for identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing existing empirical evidence. With greater demand for the best evidence about what works in organizational settings, nuanced approaches to evidence synthesis have evolved to address more complex research questions. Narrative synthesis is perceived to be particularly suited to evaluating diverse evidence types spanning multiple disciplinary fields, characteristic of the HRM domain. This article evaluates the narrative evidence synthesis approach, explains how it differs from other techniques, and describes a worked example in relation to employee engagement. We consider its strengths, the challenges of using it, and its value in HRM research.

TI  - Testing filter term performance in PsycINFO to identify evidence syntheses in crime reduction, using the relative recall method
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB  - Objectives To test filter term performance against an original search strategy to identify evidence syntheses with a crime reduction outcome in the PsycINFO database, with a view to maximising efficiency and/or effectiveness in the search phase of a systematic review. Methods A search strategy was developed to identify evidence syntheses with crime reduction outcomes. A 'quasi-gold standard' set of 255 relevant studies that were indexed in the PsycINFO database was derived from this initial work and was used to test various filter terms available in the database using the relative recall method. Precision and sensitivity statistics were generated for each search strategy. Results Seven search strategies were tested using three clusters of index terms, on (1) method filter terms, (2) topic filter terms and (3) method and topic filter terms. These were applied as filters for the original search strategy and, to facilitate comparison, against all records in PsycINFO. The most sensitive filter scored 74.1%, the most precise scored 44.1% and the best compromise between sensitivity and precision scored 53.7% sensitivity and 16.3% precision. Conclusions Filter term performance in PsycINFO can be used to inform search strategies used within criminology and allied fields for systematic reviews. The variety of filter terms tested here, in the absence and presence of a keyword search, caters for researchers with different information requirements. Using an evidence-based approach to systematic searching can yield considerable resource savings in conducting a systematic review.

TI  - Evidence synthesis combining individual patient data and aggregate data: a systematic review identified current practice and possible methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) is the " gold- standard" for synthesizing evidence across several studies. Some studies, however, may only provide aggregate data (AD). In this situation researchers might need to combine IPD with AD to utilize all the evidence available. Here, we review applied IPD meta-analysis articles to assess if and how AD is combined with IPD in practice.
   Study Design and Setting: A systematic review of articles identified from bibliographic databases and searches.
   Results: We identified 33 applied IPD articles that combined IPD and AD and 166 that did not. For each article, we recorded the proportion of total studies providing IPD, and to found that articles combining IPD and AD had, on average, IPD available in only 64% of studies (compared to 90% in articles not combining IPD and AD). Two different methods were used to combine IPD and AD, the two-stage method and analysis of partially reconstructed IPD, but a review of methodological articles identified two further methods, multilevel modeling and Bayesian hierarchical related regression. We summarize each method to aid practitioners.
   Conclusion: Combining IPD and AD is a relevant issue for evidence synthesis, and the further development and validation of suitable meta-analysis methods is needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Synthesis of ZnWO4 by the polymerizable complex method: Evidence of amorphous phase coexistence during the phase formation process
T2  - CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In this paper, we report on a new path of ZnWO4 phase formation, synthesized by the polymerizable complex (PC) method. At 550 degrees C, we obtained a single phase of the ZnWO4 complex oxide. To explain the phase transformation processes, we propose a mechanism based on the coexistence of more than one amorphous phase after the pre-pyrolysis process. These amorphous metastable phases indicate a different phase formation path, which has not yet been described in the literature for multi-component oxides processed by the PC method. The formation path proposed here shows the relevance of the metastable phases in the reaction processes of complex oxides.

TI  - Simplifying the selection of evidence synthesis methods to inform environmental decisions: A guide for decision makers and scientists
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Achieving evidence-based environmental management requires that decision-makers have access to evidence that can help identify the most effective interventions for their management context. Evidence synthesis supports evidence-based decision-making because it collates, filters and makes sense of a sometimes large and often conflicting evidence-base, potentially yielding new insights. There are many approaches to evidence synthesis. They each have different strengths and weaknesses, making them suited to different purposes, questions and contexts, given particular constraints. To make sense of the wide array of approaches, we outline the important considerations when selecting the most appropriate method for a particular decision context. These include the purpose for the synthesis, the required outcomes, and the multiple constraints within which decision-makers must operate. We then critically assess a spectrum of approaches to evidence synthesis commonly used within environmental management, detailing the characteristics of each that can be used to determine when it is a suitable method. To guide this selection process we provide a decision tree for those commissioning (e.g., decision-makers or stakeholders) or conducting (e.g., scientists) evidence synthesis, which can be used to identify an appropriate method. The decision tree classifies evidence synthesis methods according to whether their purpose is to test or generate hypotheses, the level of resources they require, the level of certainty in the outputs, and the type and scope of the question being addressed. This tool is a major advance because it helps select an appropriate synthesis method based on the multiple constraints that impact the decision. We conclude that there is an approach to evidence synthesis that will suit all management contexts, but that selecting the right approach requires careful consideration of what is fit for purpose.

TI  - Evidence synthesis to inform model-based cost-effectiveness evaluations of diagnostic tests: a methodological review of health technology assessments
T2  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
AB  - Background: Evaluations of diagnostic tests are challenging because of the indirect nature of their impact on patient outcomes. Model-based health economic evaluations of tests allow different types of evidence from various sources to be incorporated and enable cost-effectiveness estimates to be made beyond the duration of available study data. To parameterize a health-economic model fully, all the ways a test impacts on patient health must be quantified, including but not limited to diagnostic test accuracy.
   Methods: We assessed all UK NIHR HTA reports published May 2009-July 2015. Reports were included if they evaluated a diagnostic test, included a model-based health economic evaluation and included a systematic review and meta-analysis of test accuracy. From each eligible report we extracted information on the following topics: 1) what evidence aside from test accuracy was searched for and synthesised, 2) which methods were used to synthesise test accuracy evidence and how did the results inform the economic model, 3) how/whether threshold effects were explored, 4) how the potential dependency between multiple tests in a pathway was accounted for, and 5) for evaluations of tests targeted at the primary care setting, how evidence from differing healthcare settings was incorporated.
   Results: The bivariate or HSROC model was implemented in 20/22 reports that met all inclusion criteria. Test accuracy data for health economic modelling was obtained from meta-analyses completely in four reports, partially in fourteen reports and not at all in four reports. Only 2/7 reports that used a quantitative test gave clear threshold recommendations. All 22 reports explored the effect of uncertainty in accuracy parameters but most of those that used multiple tests did not allow for dependence between test results. 7/22 tests were potentially suitable for primary care but the majority found limited evidence on test accuracy in primary care settings.
   Conclusions: The uptake of appropriate meta-analysis methods for synthesising evidence on diagnostic test accuracy in UK NIHR HTAs has improved in recent years. Future research should focus on other evidence requirements for cost- effectiveness assessment, threshold effects for quantitative tests and the impact of multiple diagnostic tests.

TI  - A Bayesian method for the synthesis of evidence from qualitative and quantitative reports: the example of antiretroviral medication adherence
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH & POLICY
AB  - Objectives: Bayesian meta-analysis is a frequently cited but very little-used method for synthesizing qualitative and quantitative research findings. The only example published to date used qualitative data to generate an informative prior probability and quantitative data to generate the likelihood. We developed a method to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative evidence in the likelihood in a Bayesian synthesis of evidence about the relationship between regimen complexity and medication adherence.
   Methods: Data were from 11 qualitative and six quantitative studies. We updated two different non-informative prior distributions with qualitative and quantitative findings to find the posterior distribution for the probabilities that a more complex regimen was associated with lower adherence and that a less complex regimen was associated with greater adherence.
   Results: The posterior mode for the qualitative findings regarding more complex regimen and lesser adherence (using the uniform prior with Jeffreys' prior yielding highly similar estimates) was 0.588 (95% credible set limits 0.519, 0.663) and for the quantitative findings was 0.224 (0.203, 0.245); due to non-overlapping credible sets, we did not combine them. The posterior mode for the qualitative findings regarding less complex regimen and greater adherence was 0.288 (0.214, 0.441) and for the quantitative findings was 0.272 (0.118, 0.437); the combined estimate was 0.299 (0.267, 0.334).
   Conclusions: The utility of Bayesian methods for synthesizing qualitative and quantitative research findings at the participant level may depend on the nature of the relationship being synthesized and on how well the findings are represented in the individual reports.

TI  - The effectiveness and acceptability of evidence synthesis summary formats for clinical guideline development groups: a mixed-methods systematic review
T2  - IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction Clinical guideline development often involves a rigorous synthesis of evidence involving multidisciplinary stakeholders with different priorities and knowledge of evidence synthesis; this makes communicating findings complex. Summary formats are typically used to communicate the results of evidence syntheses; however, there is little consensus on which formats are most effective and acceptable for different stakeholders. Methods This mixed-methods systematic review (MMSR) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability (e.g. preferences and attitudes and preferences towards) of evidence synthesis summary formats for GDG members. We followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis for MMSRs. We searched six databases (inception to April 20, 2021) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RCTs with a qualitative component, and qualitative studies. Screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed in duplicate. Qualitative findings were synthesised using meta-aggregation, and quantitative findings are described narratively. Results We identified 17,240 citations and screened 54 full-text articles, resulting in 22 eligible articles (20 unique studies): 4 articles reported the results of 5 RCTs, one of which also had a qualitative component. The other 18 articles discussed the results of 16 qualitative studies. Therefore, we had 5 trials and 17 qualitative studies to extract data from. Studies were geographically heterogeneous and included a variety of stakeholders and summary formats. All 5 RCTs assessed knowledge or understanding with 3 reporting improvement with newer formats. The qualitative analysis identified 6 categories of recommendations: 'presenting information', 'tailoring information' for end users, 'trust in producers and summary', 'knowledge required' to understand findings, 'quality of evidence', and properly 'contextualising information'. Across these categories, the synthesis resulted in 126 recommendations for practice. Nine recommendations were supported by both quantitative and qualitative evidence and 116 by only qualitative. A majority focused on how to present information (n = 64) and tailor content for different end users (n = 24). Conclusions This MMSR provides guidance on how to improve evidence summary structure and layout. This can be used by synthesis producers to better communicate to GDGs. Study findings will inform the co-creation of evidence summary format prototypes based on GDG member's needs. Trial registration The protocol for this project was previously published, and the project was preregistered on Open Science Framework (Clyne and Sharp, Evidence synthesis and translation of findings for national clinical guideline development: addressing the needs and preferences of guideline development groups, 2021; Sharp and Clyne, Evidence synthesis summary formats for decision-makers and Clinical Guideline Development Groups: A mixed-methods systematic review protocol, 2021).

TI  - Assessing the Mental Health of Fathers, Other Co-parents, and Partners in the Perinatal Period: Mixed Methods Evidence Synthesis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Introduction: Five to 10 percentage of fathers experience perinatal depression and 5-15% experience perinatal anxiety, with rates increasing when mothers are also experiencing perinatal mental health disorders. Perinatal mental illness in either parent contributes to adverse child and family outcomes. While there are increasing calls to assess the mental health of both parents, universal services (e.g., maternity) and specialist perinatal mental health services usually focus on the mother (i.e., the gestational parent). The aim of this review was to identify and synthesize evidence on the performance of mental health screening tools and the acceptability of mental health assessment, specifically in relation to fathers, other co-parents and partners in the perinatal period.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Maternity, and Infant Care Database and CINAHL). Articles were eligible if they included expectant or new partners, regardless of the partner's gender or relationship status. Accuracy was determined by comparison of screening tool with diagnostic interview. Acceptability was predominantly assessed through parents' and health professionals' perspectives. Narrative synthesis was applied to all elements of the review, with thematic analysis applied to the acceptability studies.
   Results: Seven accuracy studies and 20 acceptability studies were included. The review identified that existing evidence focuses on resident fathers and assessing depression in universal settings. All accuracy studies assessed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale but with highly varied results. Evidence on acceptability in practice is limited to postnatal settings. Amongst both fathers and health professionals, views on assessment are mixed. Identified challenges were categorized at the individual-, practitioner- and service-level. These include: gendered perspectives on mental health; the potential to compromise support offered to mothers; practitioners' knowledge, skills, and confidence; service culture and remit; time pressures; opportunity for contact; and the need for tools, training, supervision and onward referral routes.
   Conclusion: There is a paucity of published evidence on assessing the mental health of fathers, co-mothers, step-parents and other partners in the perinatal period. Whilst practitioners need to be responsive to mental health needs, further research is needed with stakeholders in a range of practice settings, with attention to ethical and practical considerations, to inform the implementation of evidence-based assessment.

TI  - Evidence synthesis for constructing directed acyclic graphs (ESC-DAGs): a novel and systematic method for building directed acyclic graphs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are popular tools for identifying appropriate adjustment strategies for epidemiological analysis. However, a lack of direction on how to build them is problematic. As a solution, we propose using a combination of evidence synthesis strategies and causal inference principles to integrate the DAG-building exercise within the review stages of research projects. We demonstrate this idea by introducing a novel protocol: 'Evidence Synthesis for Constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs' (ESC-DAGs)'.
   Methods: ESC-DAGs operates on empirical studies identified by a literature search, ideally a novel systematic review or review of systematic reviews. It involves three key stages: (i) the conclusions of each study are 'mapped' into a DAG; (ii) the causal structures in these DAGs are systematically assessed using several causal inference principles and are corrected accordingly; (iii) the resulting DAGs are then synthesised into one or more 'integrated DAGs'. This demonstration article didactically applies ESC-DAGs to the literature on parental influences on offspring alcohol use during adolescence.
   Conclusions: ESC-DAGs is a practical, systematic and transparent approach for developing DAGs from background knowledge. These DAGs can then direct primary data analysis and DAG-based sensitivity analysis. ESC-DAGs has a modular design to allow researchers who are experienced DAG users to both use and improve upon the approach. It is also accessible to researchers with limited experience of DAGs or evidence synthesis.

TI  - Uptake of methodological advances for synthesis of continuous and time-to-event outcomes would maximize use of the evidence base
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: The objective of the study is to establish how often continuous and time-to-event outcomes are synthesized in health technology assessment (HTA), the statistical methods and software used in their analysis and how often evidence synthesis informs decision models.
   Study Design and Setting: This is a review of National Institute of Health Research HTA reports, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisals, and NICE guidelines reporting quantitative meta-analysis or network meta-analysis of at least one continuous or time-to-event outcome published from April 01, 2018 to March 31, 2019.
   Results: We identified 47 eligible articles. At least one continuous or time-to-event outcome was synthesized in 51% and 55% of articles, respectively. Evidence synthesis results informed decision models in two-thirds of articles. The review and expert knowledge identified five areas where methodology is available for improving the synthesis of continuous and time-to-event outcomes: i) outcomes reported on multiple scales, ii) reporting of multiple related outcomes, iii) appropriateness of the additive scale, iv) reporting of multiple time points, and v) nonproportional hazards. We identified three anticipated barriers to the uptake and implementation of these methods: i) statistical expertise, ii) software, and iii) reporting of trials.
   Conclusion: Continuous and time-to-event outcomes are routinely reported in HTA. However, increased uptake of methodological advances could maximize the evidence base used to inform the decision making process. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - From Randomized Controlled Trials of Antidepressant Drugs to the Meta-Analytic Synthesis of Evidence: Methodological Aspects Lead to Discrepant Findings
T2  - CURRENT NEUROPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - During the last decade, several meta-analytic studies employing different methodological approaches have had inconsistent conclusions regarding antidepressant efficacy. Herein, we aim to comment on methodological aspects that may have contributed to disparate findings. We initially discuss methodological inconsistencies and limitations related to the conduct of individual antidepressant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including differences in allocated samples, limitations of psychometric scales, possible explanations for the heightened placebo response rates in antidepressant RCTs across the past two decades as well as the reporting of conflicts of interest. In the second part of this article, we briefly describe the various meta-analyses techniques (e.g., simple random effects meta-analysis and network meta-analysis) and the application of these methods to synthesize evidence related to antidepressant efficacy. Recently published antidepressant meta-analyses often provide discrepant results and similar results often lead to different interpretations. Finally, we propose strategies to improve methodology considering real-world clinical scenarios.

TI  - Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group guidance series-paper 6: reporting guidelines for qualitative, implementation, and process evaluation evidence syntheses
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: To outline contemporary and novel developments for the presentation and reporting of syntheses of qualitative, implementation, and process evaluation evidence and provide recommendations for the use of reporting guidelines.
   Study Design and Setting: An overview of reporting guidelines for qualitative, implementation, and process evaluation evidence syntheses drawing on current international literature and the collective expert knowledge of the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group.
   Results: Several reporting guidelines exist that can be used or adapted to report syntheses of qualitative, implementation, and process evaluation evidence. Methods to develop individual guidance varied. The use of a relevant reporting guideline can enhance the transparency, consistency, and quality of reporting. Guidelines that exist are generic, method specific, and for particular aspects of the reviewing process, searching.
   Conclusion: Caution is expressed over the potential for reporting guidelines to produce a mechanistic approach moving the focus away from the content and toward the procedural aspects of the review. The use of a reporting guideline is recommended and a five-step decision flowchart to guide the choice of reporting guideline is provided. Gaps remain in method-specific reporting guidelines such as mixed-study, implementation, and process evaluation evidence syntheses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - MACROMOLECULES
AB  - The Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization of 3-alkylthiophenes proceeds by a quasi"living" chain growth mechanism, not by a step growth process. Kinetic studies of the Grignard metathesis polymerization of 2,5-dibromo-3-alkylthiophenes showed that the molecular weight of poly(3-alkylthiophenes) is a function of the molar ratio of the monomer to nickel initiator, and conducting polymers with predetermined molecular weights and relatively narrow molecular weight distributions (PDIs = 1.2-1.5) can be made. Sequential monomer addition resulted in new block copolymers containing different poly(3-alkylthiophene) segments.

TI  - Evidence Synthesis as the Basis for Decision Analysis: A Method of Selecting the Best Agricultural Practices for Multiple Ecosystem Services
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Agricultural management practices have impacts not only on crops and livestock, but also on soil, water, wildlife, and ecosystem services. Agricultural research provides evidence about these impacts, but it is unclear how this evidence should be used to make decisions. Two methods are widely used in decision making: evidence synthesis and decision analysis. However, a system of evidence-based decision making that integrates these two methods has not yet been established. Moreover, the standard methods of evidence synthesis have a narrow focus (e.g., the effects of onemanagement practice), but the standard methods of decision analysis have a wide focus (e.g., the comparative effectiveness of multiple management practices). Thus, there is a mismatch between the outputs from evidence synthesis and the inputs that are needed for decision analysis. We show how evidence for a wide range of agricultural practices can be reviewed and summarized simultaneously ("subject-wide evidence synthesis"), and how this evidence can be assessed by experts and used for decision making ("multiple-criteria decision analysis"). We show how these methods could be used by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in California to select the best management practices for multiple ecosystem services in Mediterranean-type farmland and rangeland, based on a subject-wide evidence synthesis that was published by Conservation Evidence (www.conservationevidence.com). This method of "evidence-based decision analysis" could be used at different scales, from the local scale (farmers deciding which practices to adopt) to the national or international scale (policy makers deciding which practices to support through agricultural subsidies or other payments for ecosystem services). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this method, and we suggest some general principles for improving evidence synthesis as the basis for multi-criteria decision analysis.

TI  - A simple method for combining binomial counts or proportions with hazard ratios for evidence synthesis of time-to-event data
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - In studies with time-to-event data, outcomes may be reported as hazard ratios (HR) or binomial counts/proportions at a specific time point. If the intent is to synthesise evidence by performing a meta-analysis or network meta-analysis (NMA) using the HR as the measure of treatment effect, studies that only report binomial data cannot be included in the network.
   Methods for converting binomial data to HRs were investigated, so that studies reporting binomial data only could be included in a network of HR data. Estimating the log HR is relatively straightforward under the assumptions of proportional hazards and minimal censoring at the binomial data time point. Estimating the standard error of the log HR is harder, but a simple method based on using a Taylor series expansion to approximate the variance is proposed. Thus, we have 2 easy-to-calculate equations for the log HR and variance.
   The performance of the method was assessed using simulations and data from a NMA of multiple sclerosis treatments. In the simulation, our binomial method produced very similar HRs to those from survival analysis when censoring rates were low, and also when censoring rates were high but the event rate was low. In all situations, it outperformed using relative risk to approximate the HR. In the NMA, results were consistent between reported HRs and HRs derived from binomial data for studies that reported both types of data.
   This method may be useful for easily incorporating trials reporting binomial data into an evidence synthesis of HR data, under certain assumptions.

TI  - Toward a comprehensive evidence map of overview of systematic review methods: paper 2-risk of bias assessment; synthesis, presentation and summary of the findings; and assessment of the certainty of the evidence
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background: Overviews of systematic reviews (SRs) attempt to systematically retrieve and summarise the results of multiple systematic reviews. This is the second of two papers from a study aiming to develop a comprehensive evidence map of the methods used in overviews. Our objectives were to (a) develop a framework of methods for conducting, interpreting and reporting overviews (stage I)-the Methods for Overviews of Reviews (MOoR) framework-and (b) to create an evidence map by mapping studies that have evaluated overview methods to the framework (stage II). In the first paper, we reported findings for the four initial steps of an overview (specification of purpose, objectives and scope; eligibility criteria; search methods; data extraction). In this paper, we report the remaining steps: assessing risk of bias; synthesis, presentation and summary of the findings; and assessing certainty of the evidence arising from the overview.
   Methods: In stage I, we identified cross-sectional studies, guidance documents and commentaries that described methods proposed for, or used in, overviews. Based on these studies, we developed a framework of possible methods for overviews, categorised by the steps in conducting an overview. Multiple iterations of the framework were discussed and refined by all authors. In stage II, we identified studies evaluating methods and mapped these evaluations to the framework.
   Results: Forty-two stage I studies described methods relevant to one or more of the latter steps of an overview. Six studies evaluating methods were included in stage II. These mapped to steps involving (i) the assessment of risk of bias (RoB) in SRs (two SRs and three primary studies, all reporting evaluation of RoB tools) and (ii) the synthesis, presentation and summary of the findings (one primary study evaluating methods for measuring overlap).
   Conclusion: Many methods have been described for use in the latter steps in conducting an overview; however, evaluation and guidance for applying these methods is sparse. The exception is RoB assessment, for which a multitude of tools exist-several with sufficient evaluation and guidance to recommend their use. Evaluation of other methods is required to provide a comprehensive evidence map.

TI  - A methodologic survey on use of the GRADE approach in evidence syntheses published in high-impact factor urology and nephrology journals
T2  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
AB  - Background To identify and describe the use of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for rating the certainty of systematic reviews (SRs) evidence published in urology and nephrology journals. Methods SRs that were published in the top ten "urology and nephrology" journals with the highest impact factor according to the 2020 Journal Citation Reports (covering 2016-2020) were systematically searched and evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results A total of 445 SRs were researched. Sixty SRs of randomized control trials (RCTs) and/or non-randomized studies (NRSs) were evaluated using the GRADE approach. Forty-nine SRs (11%) rated the outcome-specific certainty of evidence (n = 29 in 2019-2020). We identified 811 certainty of evidence outcome ratings (n = 544 RCT ratings) as follows: very low (33.0%); low (32.1%); moderate (24.5%); and high (10.4%). Very low and high certainty of evidence ratings accounted for 55.0% and 0.4% of ratings in SRs of NRSs compared to 23.0% and 15.3% in SRs of RCTs. The certainty of evidence for RCTs and NRSs was downgraded most often for risk of bias and imprecision. Conclusions We recommend increased emphasis on acceptance of the GRADE approach, as well as optimal use of the GRADE approach, in the synthesis of urinary tract evidence.

TI  - Skin-to-skin contact for procedural pain in neonates: acceptability of novel systematic review synthesis methods and GRADEing of the evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - AimsThe aim of this study was to assess the acceptability of methods that increase trial inclusion in meta-analyses, and the level of evidence for skin-to-skin contact for procedural pain in infants.
   BackgroundThe current Cochrane review of skin-to-skin contact for pain in newborns found it to be an effective intervention, but identified several methodological limitations.
   DesignMeta-re-analysis
   MethodsTrial designs included randomized trials reporting a validated pain assessment tool as a primary outcome including term and pre-term infants undergoing a tissue-breaking painful procedure. The search in the original review was conducted to January 2013. Scores of validated tools were scaled to the premature infant pain profile in a fixed-effect meta-re-analysis. The GRADE was used to assess quality of meta-analysed evidence.
   ResultsNew analysis vs. original found a mean difference: -311 in favour of skin-to-skin contact vs. -321 at 30seconds; and -271 vs. -185 at 60seconds for heel lance. Based on cut-off scores for the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale, infants receiving skin-to-skin contact during IM injection were more likely to display low pain after injection; and during recovery.
   ConclusionScaling scores to a single outcome can provide additional information in meta-analyses, simplifies interpretability of pooled scores, and can improve GRADE outcomes. Sensitivity analyses of scaled scores improve confidence in their validity. Risk of bias subgroups simplified the GRADE process, and confidence intervals for heterogeneity statistics assisted in interpretation of sensitivity analyses.

TI  - Robot-assisted arm therapy in neurological health conditions: rationale and methodology for the evidence synthesis in the CICERONE Italian Consensus Conference
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL AND REHABILITATION MEDICINE
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted Arm Therapy (RAT) has been increasingly applied in the last years for promoting functional recovery in patients with disabilities related to neurological health conditions. Evidence of a knowledge-to-action gap for applying robot-assisted technologies in the rehabilitation of patients with neurological health conditions and the difficulty to apply and tailor the knowledge to the local contexts solicited the need for a national consensus conference on these interventions. AIM: The aim of this paper was to explain the methodology used by the working group dedicated to synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of RAT in neurological health conditions in the context of the CICERONE Italian Consensus Conference. DESIGN: The methodological approach of the working group. SETTING: All rehabilitation settings. POPULATION: Patients with disability following a neurological health condition. METHODS: Following the indications proposed by the Methodological Manual published by the Italian National Institute of Health, a Promoting Committee and a Technical Scientific Committee have been set up. Six working groups (WGs) have been composed to collect evidence on differ- ent questions, among which WG2.2 was focused on the effectiveness of RAT in neurological health conditions. RESULTS: WG2.2 started its work defining the specific research questions. It was decided to adopt the ICF as the reference framework for the reporting of all outcomes. Literature search, data extraction and qualitative assessment, evidence analysis and synthesis have been performed. CONCLUSIONS: This paper summarized the methodological approaches used by the WG2.2 of the CICERONE Italian Consensus Conference to define the effectiveness of RAT in the management of patients with neurological health conditions. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: WG2.2 synthesis might help clinicians, researchers, and all rehabilitation stakeholders to address the use of RAT in the Individualized Rehabilitation Plan, to guide the allocation of resources and define clinical protocols and indications for the management of patients with different neurological health conditions.

TI  - Restricting evidence syntheses of interventions to English-language publications is a viable methodological shortcut for most medical topics: a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: To assess the impact of restricting systematic reviews of conventional or alternative medical treatments or diagnostic tests to English-language publications. Study design and setting: We systematically searched MEDLINE (Ovid), the Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and Current Contents Connect (Web of Science) up to April 24, 2020. Eligible methods studies assessed the impact of restricting systematic reviews to English-language publications on effect estimates and conclusions. Two reviewers independently screened the literature; one investigator performed the data extraction, a second investigator checked for completeness and accuracy. We synthesized the findings narratively. Results: Eight methods studies (10 publications) met the inclusion criteria; none addressed language restrictions in diagnostic test accuracy reviews. The included studies analyzed nine to 147 meta-analyses and/or systematic reviews. The proportions of non-English language publications ranged from 2% to 100%. Based on five methods studies, restricting literature searches or inclusion criteria to English-language publications led to a change in statistical significance in 23/259 meta-analyses (9%). Most commonly, the statistical significance was lost, but had no impact on the conclusions of systematic reviews. Conclusion: Restricting systematic reviews to English-language publications appears to have little impact on the effect estimates and conclusions of systematic reviews. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Assessing context suitability (generalizability, external validity, applicability or transferability) of findings in evidence syntheses in healthcare-An integrative review of methodological guidance
T2  - RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
AB  - Background Evidence syntheses provide the basis for evidence-based decision making in healthcare. To judge the certainty of findings for the specific decision context evidence syntheses should consider context suitability (ie, generalizability, external validity, applicability or transferability). Our objective was to determine the status quo and to provide a comprehensive overview of existing methodological recommendations of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Systematic Review (SR) producing organizations in assessing context suitability of evidence on effectiveness of health care interventions. Additionally, we analyzed similarities and differences between the recommendations. Methods In this Integrative Review we performed a structured search for methods documents from evidence synthesis producing organizations that include recommendations on appraising context suitability in effectiveness assessments. Two reviewers independently selected documents according to predefined eligibility criteria. Data were extracted in standardized and piloted tables by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. We performed a thematic analysis to identify and summarize the main themes and categories regarding recommended context suitability assessments. Results We included 14 methods documents of 12 organizations in our synthesis. Assessment approaches are very heterogeneous both regarding the general concepts (eg, integration in the evidence synthesis preparation process) and the content of assessments (eg, assessment criteria). Conclusion Some heterogeneity seems to be justified because of the need to tailor the assessment to different settings and medical areas. However, most differences were inexplicable. More harmonization is desirable and appears possible.

TI  - Healthcare professional perceived barriers and facilitators to discussing sexual wellbeing with patients after diagnosis of chronic illness: A mixed-methods evidence synthesis
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
AB  - Objectives: To explore healthcare professional perceived barriers and facilitators to discussing sexual health and wellbeing with patients after diagnosis of chronic illness.
   Methods: Five databases were searched and included data were synthesised using a meta-ethnographic approach. Confidence in findings was assessed using the GRADE-CERQual framework. Searches, extraction and quality assessment procedures were conducted independently by at least two authors.
   Results: Concepts extracted from 30 included studies were used to develop a conceptual framework based on five overarching themes. These were [1] individual and societal attitudes to sex and sexual wellbeing [2], patient specific factors [3], organizational and professional factors [4], strategies to overcome barriers in practice and [5] perceived training needs. Healthcare professionals acknowledged the importance of discussing and providing support for sexual wellbeing needs, but recognized it is not routinely provided.
   Conclusions: While patient specific factors and organizational issues such as lack of time were frequently identified as barriers, intra-personal and social perceptions appear to have the strongest influence on healthcare professional perspectives.
   Practice implications: Brief education and tools to support healthcare professionals to have effective conversations with patients are required. These should address social barriers, normalise sexual issues, and support healthcare professionals to initiate discussions around sexual concerns. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Using qualitative methods in pilot and feasibility trials to inform recruitment and retention processes in full-scale randomised trials: a qualitative evidence synthesis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives To systematically review published pretrial qualitative research studies and explore how their findings were used to inform recruitment and retention processes in full-scale trials. Design Qualitative evidence synthesis using thematic analysis. Data sources and eligibility criteria We conducted a comprehensive search of databases; Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts and PsycINFO. We included all reports of pretrial qualitative data on recruitment and retention in clinical trials up to March 2018. Data extraction and synthesis Two authors independently extracted data using a predefined data extraction form that captured study aims, design, methodological approach and main findings, including barriers and facilitators to recruitment and or retention. The synthesis was undertaken using Thomas and Harden's thematic synthesis method and reported following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research guidelines. Confidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research approach. Results Thirty-five papers (connected to 31 feasibility studies) from three different countries, published between 2010 and 2017 were included. All studies were embedded in pilot or feasibility studies to inform design aspects in preparation for a subsequent full-scale trial. Twelve themes were identified as recruitment barriers and three as recruitment facilitators. Two themes were identified as barriers for retention and none as retention facilitators. The findings from qualitative research in feasibility or pilot trials are often not explicitly linked to proposed changes to the recruitment and retention strategies to be used in the future or planned full-scale trial. Conclusions Many trial teams do pretrial qualitative work with the aim of improving recruitment and retention in future full-scale trials. Just over half of all reports of such work do not clearly show how their findings will change the recruitment and retention strategy of the future trial. The scope of pretrial work needs to expand beyond looking for problems and also look for what might help and spend more time on retention.

TI  - Cost Utility of Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha Inhibitors for Rheumatoid Arthritis An Application of Bayesian Methods for Evidence Synthesis in a Markov Model
T2  - PHARMACOECONOMICS
AB  - Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1.5 million people in the US. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors have been shown to effectively treat and maintain remission in patients with moderately to severely active RA compared with conventional agents. The high acquisition cost of TNF-alpha inhibitors prohibits access, which mandates economic investigations into their affordability. The lack of head-to-head comparisons between these agents makes it difficult to determine which agent is the most cost effective.
   Objective: This study aimed to determine which TNF-alpha inhibitor was the most cost-effective agent for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA from the US healthcare payer's perspective.
   Methods: A Markov model was constructed to analyse the cost utility of five TNF-alpha inhibitors (in combination with methotrexate [+MTX]) versus MTX monotherapy using Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis. The model had a cycle length of 3 months and an overall time horizon of 5 years. Transition probabilities and utility scores were based on published studies. Total direct costs were adjusted to year 2009 $US using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. All costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Patient response to the different strategies was determined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)50 criteria. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed to test the robustness of the base-case scenario. The base-case scenario was changed to ACR20 criteria (scenario 1) and ACR70 criteria (scenario 2) to determine the model's robustness. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and cost-effectiveness frontiers were used to estimate the cost-effectiveness probability of each treatment strategy. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was defined as three times the US GDP per capita ($US139 143 per additional QALY gained). Primary results were presented as incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs).
   Results: Etanercept+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy in the base-case scenario up to a WTP threshold of $US546 449 per QALY gained. At a WTP threshold of greater than $US546 499 per QALY gained, certolizumab+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy. One-way analyses showed that the base-case scenario was sensitive to the probability of achieving ACR50 criteria for MTX and each TNF-alpha inhibitor, and changes in the utility score for patients who achieved the ACR50 criteria. With the exception of infliximab, all of the TNF-alpha inhibitors were sensitive to drug cost per cycle. In the scenario analyses, certolizumab+MTX was a dominant treatment strategy using ACR20 criteria, but etanercept+MTX was a dominant treatment strategy using ACR70 criteria.
   Conclusions: Etanercept+MTX was a cost-effective treatment strategy in the base-case scenario; however, the model was sensitive to parameter uncertainties and ACR response criteria. Although Bayesian methods were used to determine transition probabilities, future studies will need to focus on head-to-head comparisons of multiple TNF-alpha inhibitors to provide valid comparisons.

TI  - Comparison of two methods - Evidence of intrathecal synthesis of specific antiborrelia antibodies and the polymerase chain reaction - in the diagnosis of Lyme Borreliosis
T2  - CESKA A SLOVENSKA NEUROLOGIE A NEUROCHIRURGIE
AB  - In 25 patients with the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis the intrathecal secretion of specific antiborrelia antibodies was assessed and compared with evidence of Borrelia DNA in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Autochthonous production of antiborrelia antibodies was assessed by calculation using the specific antibody index AI(Bb) and for detection of the DNA of spirochete the authors used the two-stage polymerase chain reaction (,,nested" PCR) with three sets of primers: for the plasmid gene coding OspC protein and for chromosomal genes coding 16S rDNA and flagellin. Specific antiborrelia antibodies in serum were detected in 20 (80%) patients and intrathecal synthesis of specific IgG antibodies was found in 22/(88%) of the examined subjects. DNA spirochetes were detected in cerebrospinal fluid 12x (48%) and in plasma 6x (24%). At least once DNA of borrelias in some examined biological material was detected in 13 (52%) of the patients. In 3 patients DNA was detected and no specific antibodies were found. By comparison of results of assessment of autochthonous production of antiborrelia antibodies and PCR it was revealed that the method of calculation of the antibody index was more sensitive (88%) as compared with ,,direct" evidence of the spirochete in cerebrospinal fluid (48%) and in plasma (24%) before antibiotic therapy. The assembled results showed that the PCR for detection of borrelias can usefully supplement the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis but cannot replace,,classical" serology.

TI  - Strength of evidence of non-inferiority trials-The adjustment of the type I error rate in non-inferiority trials with the synthesis method
T2  - STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
AB  - In non-inferiority trials that employ the synthesis method several types of dependencies among test statistics occur due to sharing of the same information from the historical trial. The conditions under which the dependencies appear may be divided into three categories. The first case is when a new drug is approved with single non-inferiority trial. The second case is when a new drug is approved if two independent non-inferiority trials show positive results. The third case is when two new different drugs are approved with the same active control. The problem of the dependencies is that they can make the type I error rate deviate from the nominal level. In order to study such deviations, we introduce the unconditional and conditional across-trial type I error rates when the non-inferiority margin is estimated from the historical trial, and investigate how the dependencies affect the type I error rates. We show that the unconditional across-trial type I error rate increases dramatically as does the correlation between two non-inferiority tests when a new drug is approved based on the positive results of two non-inferiority trials. We conclude that the conditional across-trial type I error rate involves the unknown treatment effect in the historical trial. The formulae of the conditional across-trial type I error rates provide us with a way of investigating the conditional across-trial type I error rates for various assumed values of the treatment effect in the historical trial.

TI  - What are the attitudes of health professionals regarding patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in oncology practice? A mixed-method synthesis of the qualitative evidence
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundThe adoption of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in cancer care has been widely advocated, but little is known about the evidence for the implementation of PROMs in practice. Qualitative research captures the perspectives of health professionals as end-users of PROMs and can be used to inform adoption efforts. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of qualitative research conducted to address the question: What are the attitudes of health professionals towards PROMs in oncology, including any barriers and facilitators to the adoption of PROMS, reported in qualitative evidence?MethodsSystematic searches of qualitative evidence were undertaken in four databases and reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published in English between 1998 and 2018, which reported qualitative findings about the attitudes of health professionals working in oncology towards PROMs were eligible. Studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme's Qualitative Research Checklist. A sentiment analysis was conducted on primary text to examine the polarity (neutral, positive or negative) of health professionals' views of PROMs. Qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted using a constant comparative analysis.ResultsFrom 1227 articles after duplicates were removed, with 1014 excluded against the screening criteria, 213 full text articles remained and were assessed; 34 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included. The majority of studies were of good quality. Sentiment analysis on primary text demonstrated an overall positive polarity from the expressed opinions of health professionals. The meta-synthesis showed health professionals' attitudes in four domains: identifying patient issues and needs using PROMs; managing and addressing patient issues; the care experience; and the integration of PROMs into clinical practice.ConclusionsFrom the accounts of health professionals, the fit of PROMs with existing practice, how PROMs are valued, capacity to respond to PROMs and the supports in place, formed the key factors which may impede or promote adoption of PROMs in routine practice. To assist policy-makers and services involved in implementing these initiatives, further evidence is required about the relationship between PROMs data collection and corresponding clinical actions.Trial registrationInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) CRD42019119447, 6th March, 2019.

TI  - Minority Stress and Positive Identity Aspects in Members of LGBTQ+ Parent Families: Literature Review and a Study Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Evidence Synthesis
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
AB  - Background: Parents and children in LGBTQ+ parent families face unique stressors (i.e., minority stress), but also possess unique resources (i.e., positive identity aspects) related to their family identity. Empirical evidence and theory suggest that these minority stressors and positive identity aspects are situated on the individual, couple, and family level and may be associated with key outcomes, including parent and child health, family functioning, and school-related outcomes. A systematic evidence synthesis and a theoretical placement are currently lacking. The aims of the systematic review outlined in this protocol are thus to (1) map minority stressors and positive identity aspects according to multiple levels in the family system, and (2) to synthesize evidence on their associations with key outcomes. Methods: We will conduct a PRISMA-conform mixed-methods systematic review. Studies will be retrieved using a multi-tiered search strategy, including database searches (PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science), cited literature searches, authors' publication lists, and study requests. The mixed-methods synthesis will follow a parallel-results convergent synthesis design, where quantitative results will be synthesized via meta-analysis and qualitative results via thematic synthesis. Conclusions: Our proposed systematic review may add to the theoretical understanding of LGBTQ+ parent family functioning and advance social inclusion of LGBTQ+ parent families.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Linezolid, Daptomycin, and Vancomycin in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Using Bayesian Methods for Evidence Synthesis
T2  - VALUE IN HEALTH
AB  - Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) is a prominent infection encountered in hospital and outpatient settings that is associated with high resource use for the health-care system. Objective: A decision analytic (DA) model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of linezolid, daptomycin, and vancomycin in MRSA cSSSI. Methods: Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis were used to generate efficacy and safety parameters for a DA model using published clinical trials. CEA was done from the US health-care perspective. Efficacy was defined as a successfully treated patient at the test of cure without any adverse reaction. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between linezolid and vancomycin, daptomycin and vancomycin, and linezolid and daptomycin in MRSA cSSSI. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. Results: The total direct costs of linezolid, daptomycin, and vancomycin were $18,057, $20,698, and $23,671, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratios for linezolid, daptomycin, and vancomycin were $37,604, $44,086, and $52,663 per successfully treated patient, respectively. Linezolid and daptomycin were dominant strategies compared to vancomycin. However, linezolid was dominant when compared to daptomycin. The model was sensitive to the duration of daptomycin and linezolid treatment. Conclusion: Linezolid and daptomycin are potentially cost-effective based on the assumptions of the DA model; however, linezolid appears to be more cost-effective compared to daptomycin and vancomycin for MRSA cSSSIs.

TI  - Help seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse: an example of an integrated mixed methods synthesis of systematic review evidence defining methodological terms
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundDomestic violence and abuse is a violation of human rights which damages the health and wellbeing of victims, their families and their friends. There has been less research on the experiences and support needs of male victims than those of women. Historically research on men's experiences has not focused on what constitutes effective, needs-led service provision. The aim of this paper was to conduct an integrated mixed methods synthesis of systematic review evidence on the topic of help-seeking by male victims of domestic violence and abuse.MethodsAn integrated mixed methods synthesis approach was taken to enhance our understanding of the complex phenomenon of help seeking by, and service provision to male victims. This process also identifies gaps in the evidence. Using previously identified systematic review data; mixed methods data from four primary-level service evaluation studies, along with expert and patient consultation were used to develop research propositions. Primary-level qualitative interview and survey data from 12 studies of men experiences were mapped onto the propositions to support them.ResultsFourteen propositions were composed. Seven propositions were supported or at least partly supported by the qualitative data. These supported propositions were used to make recommendations for policy and practice particularly concerning service preferences of male victims. The remaining seven propositions were not specifically supported by the qualitative data. These unsupported propositions were used to develop research recommendations concerning the need to further understand the potential blurred boundaries of victim-perpetrator, hybrid perpetrator-victim experiences, men who are/have been victims of childhood sexual abuse and determining the level of risk for men. They also highlight the need to produce better guidance for the response of the police & the criminal justice system. Finally, they highlight the need to produce the most appropriate service for men in terms of access, linkage, substance/alcohol abuse, mental health, sexuality, and race.ConclusionIntegrated mixed-methods synthesis of systematic review evidence is a relatively novel approach. This approach can lead to recommendations for policy and practice as well as highlighting gaps in the research agenda as shown in this example.

TI  - Quantitative Evidence Synthesis Methods for the Assessment of the Effectiveness of Treatment Sequences for Clinical and Economic Decision Making: A Review and Taxonomy of Simplifying Assumptions
T2  - PHARMACOECONOMICS
AB  - Sequential use of alternative treatments for chronic conditions represents a complex intervention pathway; previous treatment and patient characteristics affect both the choice and effectiveness of subsequent treatments. This paper critically explores the methods for quantitative evidence synthesis of the effectiveness of sequential treatment options within a health technology assessment (HTA) or similar process. It covers methods for developing summary estimates of clinical effectiveness or the clinical inputs for the cost-effectiveness assessment and can encompass any disease condition. A comprehensive review of current approaches is presented, which considers meta-analytic methods for assessing the clinical effectiveness of treatment sequences and decision-analytic modelling approaches used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment sequences. Estimating the effectiveness of a sequence of treatments is not straightforward or trivial and is severely hampered by the limitations of the evidence base. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of sequences were often absent or very limited. In the absence of sufficient RCTs of whole sequences, there is no single best way to evaluate treatment sequences; however, some approaches could be re-used or adapted, sharing ideas across different disease conditions. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and is influenced by the evidence available, extent of treatment sequences (number of treatment lines or permutations), and complexity of the decision problem. Due to the scarcity of data, modelling studies applied simplifying assumptions to data on discrete treatments. A taxonomy for all possible assumptions was developed, providing a unique resource to aid the critique of existing decision-analytic models.

TI  - Methods of Monitoring Internal and External Loads and Their Relationships with Physical Qualities, Injury, or Illness in Adolescent Athletes: A Systematic Review and Best-Evidence Synthesis
T2  - SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundWith the increasing professionalisation of youth sports, training load monitoring is increasingly common in adolescent athletes. However, the research examining the relationship between training load and changes in physical qualities, injury, or illness in adolescent athletes is yet to be synthesised in a systematic review.ObjectiveThe aim of this review was to systematically examine the research assessing internal and external methods of monitoring training load and physical qualities, injury, or illness in adolescent athletes.MethodsSystematic searches of SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL and SCOPUS were undertaken from the earliest possible records to March 2022. Search terms included synonyms relevant to adolescents, athletes, physical qualities, injury, or illness. To be eligible for inclusion, articles were required to (1) be original research articles; (2) be published in a peer-reviewed journal; (3) include participants aged between 10 and 19 years and participating in competitive sport; (4) report a statistical relationship between a measure of internal and/or external load and physical qualities, injury or illness. Articles were screened and assessed for methodological quality. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted to identify trends in the relationships reported.ResultsThe electronic search yielded 4125 articles. Following screening and a review of references, 59 articles were included. The most commonly reported load monitoring tools were session ratings of perceived exertion (n = 29) and training duration (n = 22). Results of the best-evidence synthesis identified moderate evidence of positive relationships between resistance training volume load and improvement in strength, and between throw count and injury. However, evidence for other relationships between training load and change in physical qualities, injury, or illness were limited or inconsistent.ConclusionsPractitioners should consider monitoring resistance training volume load for strength training. Additionally, where appropriate, monitoring throw counts may be useful in identifying injury risk. However, given the lack of clear relationships between singular measures of training load with physical qualities, injury, or illness, researchers should consider multivariate methods of analysing training load, as well as factors that may mediate the load-response relationship, such as maturation.

TI  - Methods for the best evidence synthesis on neck pain and its associated disorders - The bone and joint decade 2000-2010 task force on neck pain and its associated disorders
T2  - EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL
AB  - Study Design. Best evidence synthesis.
   Objective. To provide a detailed description of the methods undertaken in a systematic search and perform a best evidence synthesis on the frequency, determinants, assessment, interventions, course and prognosis of neck pain, and its associated disorders.
   Summary of Background Data. Neck pain is an important cause of health burden; however, the published information is vast, and stakeholders would benefit from a summary of the best evidence.
   Methods. The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders conducted a systematic search and critical review of the literature published between 1980 and 2006 to assemble the best evidence on neck pain. Citations were screened for relevance to the Neck Pain Task Force mandate, using a priori criteria, and relevant studies were critically reviewed for their internal scientific validity. Findings from studies meeting criteria for scientific validity were synthesized into a best evidence synthesis.
   Results. We found 31,878 citations, of which 1203 were relevant to the mandate of the Neck Pain Task Force. After critical review, 552 studies (46%) were judged scientifically admissible and were compiled into the best evidence synthesis.
   Conclusion. The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders undertook a best evidence synthesis to establish a baseline of the current best evidence on the epidemiology, assessment and classification of neck pain, as well as interventions and prognosis for this symptom. This article reports the methods used and the outcomes from the review. We found that 46% of the research literature was of acceptable scientific quality to inform clinical practice, policy-making, and future research.

TI  - Building capacity for evidence generation, synthesis and implementation to improve the care of mothers and babies in South East Asia: methods and design of the SEA-ORCHID Project using a logical framework approach
T2  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
AB  - Background: Rates of maternal and perinatal mortality remain high in developing countries despite the existence of effective interventions. Efforts to strengthen evidence-based approaches to improve health in these settings are partly hindered by restricted access to the best available evidence, limited training in evidence-based practice and concerns about the relevance of existing evidence. South East Asia - Optimising Reproductive and Child Health in Developing Countries (SEA-ORCHID) was a five-year project that aimed to determine whether a multifaceted intervention designed to strengthen the capacity for research synthesis, evidence-based care and knowledge implementation improved clinical practice and led to better health outcomes for mothers and babies. This paper describes the development and design of the SEA-ORCHID intervention plan using a logical framework approach.
   Methods: SEA-ORCHID used a before-and-after design to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted tailored intervention at nine sites across Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia, supported by three centres in Australia. We used a logical framework approach to systematically prepare and summarise the project plan in a clear and logical way. The development and design of the SEA-ORCHID project was based around the three components of a logical framework (problem analysis, project plan and evaluation strategy).
   Results: The SEA-ORCHID logical framework defined the project's goal and purpose (To improve the health of mothers and babies in South East Asia and To improve clinical practice in reproductive health in South East Asia), and outlined a series of project objectives and activities designed to achieve these. The logical framework also established outcome and process measures appropriate to each level of the project plan, and guided project work in each of the participating countries and hospitals.
   Conclusions: Development of a logical framework in the SEA-ORCHID project enabled a reasoned, logical approach to the project design that ensured the project activities would achieve the desired outcomes and that the evaluation plan would assess both the process and outcome of the project. The logical framework was also valuable over the course of the project to facilitate communication, assess progress and build a shared understanding of the project activities, purpose and goal.
