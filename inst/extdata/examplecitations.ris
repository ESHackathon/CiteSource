AB  - ABSTRACT Four oils (Arabian crude oil, Libyan crude oil, No. 6 fuel oil, and No. 2 fuel oil) were applied to one-square-meter salt marsh plots in Galveston Bay, Texas. Oils were applied at four levels: no oil, 1 liter on sediment, 1.5 liters on sediment and lower portions of Spartina alterniflora, and 2 liters on sediment and entire S. alterniflora surfaces. Within one week of oil application, nylon bags containing cut stems of S. alterniflora were staked in the center of all unoiled and 1.5 liter oil plots. Oil caused mortality of S. alterniflora within three weeks; the degree of mortality varied with oil type and the extent of plant coverage. Plant mortality was highest in plots with No. 2 fuel oil and those where oil was applied to entire plant surfaces. After five months, growth of plants in No. 2 fuel oil plots still was significantly below control levels. However, initial recovery was apparent in No. 2 fuel oil plots receiving 2 liters. Live biomass in Arabian crude oil, Libyan crude oil, and No. 6 fuel oil plots after five months was comparable to that of controls. Plots clipped three weeks after oil application were recolonized after five months by growth of new stems and seedlings. However, Arabian crude oil and No. 2 fuel oil significantly reduced the emergence of new stems while increasing the germination of seedlings. The decomposition of S. alterniflora was not affected significantly through the first eight months after oil application.

AB  - The Antarctic fungus Lecanicillium muscarium CCFEE-5003 was preliminary cultivated in shaken flasks to check its chitinase production on rough shrimp and crab wastes. Production on shrimp shells was much higher than that on crab shells (104.6±9.3 and 48.6±3.1U/L, respectively). For possible industrial applications, bioprocess optimization was studied on shrimp shells in bioreactor using RSM to state best conditions of pH and substrate concentration. Optimization improved the production by 137% (243.6±17.3). Two chitinolytic enzymes (CHI1 and CHI2) were purified and characterized. CHI1 (MW ca. 61kDa) showed optima at pH 5.5 and 45°C while CHI2 (MW ca. 25kDa) optima were at pH 4.5 and 40°C. Both enzymes maintained high activity levels at 5°C and were inhibited by Fe(++), Hg(++) and Cu(++). CHI2 was strongly allosamidin-sensitive. Both proteins were N-acetyl-hexosaminidases (E.C. 3.2.1.52) but showed different roles in chitin hydrolysis: CHI1 could be defined as "chitobiase" while CHI2 revealed a main "eso-chitinase" activity.

AB  - Surface water flushing of the tropical fjord of Ambon Bay is linked to stratification and frontogenesis that vary with tidal and seasonal cycles. Tidal- and seasonal-based​ deployments of CTD casts and bottom-mounted current meters in 2019 coupled with an analytical model were employed to investigate estuarine circulation (i.e. flood/ebb-mean transport) at the sill of Ambon Bay. Spring tides produce a large (flood/ebb-mean) horizontal salinity gradient, ∂ S/ ∂ x, (up to 13 × 10−4‰/m) across the sill, intensifying estuarine circulation. This intensification of ∂ S/ ∂ x is driven by strong (flood/ebb-mean) stratification at the inshore sill, associated with buoyant frontogenesis (indicated by densimetric Froude number, F o 2 ≥ 0.3) during the related strong flood tides. Estuarine circulation is stronger in the easterly monsoon (July) than in the transitional monsoon (October) since buoyant fronts are larger in thickness and horizontal extension along the sill in the easterly monsoon following high freshwater input. The estuarine circulation was intensified by a deep-water renewal process in which deep water from the adjacent open sea is upwelled to the sill by internal waves. Flushing of inner Ambon Bay (IAB, the fjord basin) due to estuarine circulation at the sill only occurs at the surface layer of IAB. Within a spring–neap sequence ( ∼ 2 weeks), the net oceanic inflow due to estuarine circulation at the sill replenished 73% and 41% volume of the surface layer of IAB in the easterly monsoon and the transitional season, respectively. The knowledge of flushing of IAB due to net oceanic inflow presented here has application for the mitigation of pollution build-up and for understanding of oceanic nutrient supply in the basin.

AB  - ABSTRACT In Indonesia, soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is the second most important staple food with low production compared to the demand. This problem can be overcome by using marginal land such as acid sulfate soil of tidal swampland, however, the optimal application of fertilizer in such soil is minimal. Therefore, this study aims to examine the application of fertilizer in acid sulfate soil in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. It was conducted using a split-plot design with three replicates and the main plot was biofertilizer, which consisted of no-biofertilizer (P1); biofertilizer consortium of decomposer fungi, P-solubilizing bacteria, N-fixing bacteria (P2), and biofertilizer consortium of N-fixing bacteria symbiotic and nonsymbiotic, P-solubilizing bacteria and phytohormone-producing bacteria (P3). Meanwhile, the subplot was NPK fertilizer dosage, consisting of no-fertilizer (A1), dose of 150% (A2), dose of 100% (A3), and dose of 50% (A4) of the recommendation. The results showed that the biofertilizer and NPK fertilization dose did not show an interaction with soil pH and Al3+. The highest N and K nutrient uptake was in P2 at 50% NPK fertilizer dosage, while P in P3 at 150% NPK fertilization dose. The highest soybean yields were obtained in the application of biofertilizer P3 with 150% NPK, i.e., 1.6 t ha-1, followed by the 1.5 t ha-1 in the application of P2 + 50% NPK. This showed that the use of P2 biofertilizer can reduce NPK fertilizer application to 50% in soybean plants in acid soil tidal lands. Furthermore, the application of biofertilizers can increase soybean productivity in acid sulfate soil in Indonesia.

AB  - This paper introduces a household model of private investment in storm protection under an endogenous risk framework to determine how defensive self-protection and self-insurance expenditures by coastal households to mitigate storm-inflicted damages are affected by the availability of public programs and the presence of a mangrove forest. The theoretical results show that publicly constructed physical barriers and mangroves encourage self-protection but discourage self-insurance expenditures. However, public disaster relief and rehabilitation programs lead to the crowding-out of self-protection but the crowding-in of self-insurance. Our empirical analysis of coastal households in Bangladesh impacted by Cyclone Sidr reveals partial support for the crowding-out and crowding-in effects of public investments and programs. Households located in a mangrove-protected area invest more in self-protection and less in self-insurance. Other controls, such as household socio-economic characteristics, also influence and add a degree of complexity to the relationship.

AB  - Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients and sediment simultaneously impact coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands, especially during storms. Independent and combined effects of sediment and ammonium nitrate loading on nitrogen fixation rates and diversity of microbes that fix nitrogen (diazotrophs) were tested via field manipulations in Spartina foliosa and unvegetated zones at Tijuana Estuary (California, USA). This estuary is subject to episodic nitrogen enrichment and sedimentation associated with rain-driven flooding and slope instabilities, the latter of which may worsen as the Triple Border Fence is constructed along the U.S.-Mexico border. Responses of diazotrophs were assessed over 17 days using acetylene reduction assays and genetic fingerprinting (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism [T-RFLP]) of nifH, which codes for dinitrogenase reductase. Sulfate-reducing bacteria performed approximately 70% of nitrogen fixation in Spartina foliosa rhizospheres in the absence of nitrogen loading, based on sodium molybdate inhibitions in the laboratory. Following nutrient additions, richness (number of T-RFs [terminal restriction fragments]) and evenness (relative T-RF fluorescence) of diazotrophs in surface sediments increased, but nitrogen fixation rates decreased significantly within 17 days. These responses illustrate, within a microbial community, conformance to a more general ecological pattern of high function among assemblages of low diversity. Diazotroph community composition (T-RF profiles) and rhizosphere diversity were not affected. Pore water ammonium concentrations were higher and more persistent for 17 days in plots receiving sediment additions (1 cm deep), suggesting that recovery of diazotroph functions may be delayed by the combination of sediment and nutrient inputs. Nitrogen fixation constitutes a mechanism for rapid transfer of fixed N to S. foliosa roots and a variety of primary consumers (within 3 and 8 days, respectively), as determined via 15N2 enrichment studies with in situ microcosms of intact marsh sediment. Thus, long-term declines in nitrogen fixation rates in response to increasingly frequent nutrient loading and sedimentation may potentially alter nitrogen sources for vascular plants as well as trophic pathways in wetland ecosystems.

AB  - The ocean, which regulates climate and supports vital ecosystem services, is crucial to our Earth system and livelihoods. Yet, it is threatened by anthropogenic pressures and climate change. A healthy ocean that supports a sustainable ocean economy requires adequate financing vehicles that generate, invest, align, and account for financial capital to achieve sustained ocean health and governance. However, the current finance gap is large; we identify key barriers to financing a sustainable ocean economy and suggest how to mitigate them, to incentivize the kind of public and private investments needed for topnotch science and management in support of a sustainable ocean economy.

AB  - For centuries, corals reefs in the South Pacific Islands have been essential to the well-being and livelihood of Pacific Islanders. Resources from coral reefs constitute essential components of the diet of the people of these Pacific Islands. Nowadays, coral reefs continue to support income-generating activities such as fisheries and tourism, thus playing a significant role in the economies of many Pacific Islands. This chapter is an attempt to demonstrate, based on recent literature review and various reports, the current conditions of some of the reefs in selected islands of the Pacific. It also offers further insights into challenges and issues that affect tourism development and the overall regional effort by relevant organisations to mitigate impacts and ensure sustainability of future reef activities.

AB  - In the past few years, many advances in terms of research, implementation and policies have taken place around the world with respect to understanding, capturing and facilitating the uptake of ecosystem-based approaches for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). We highlight some of these advances here, particularly for coastal (various hazards), riverine (floods), and mountain (landslides) environments. We also highlight that many international agreements reached in 2015 can facilitate the uptake of these approaches whereas ecosystem-based solutions can facilitate the achievement of many goals and targets related to DRR, CCA, and/or sustainable development enclosed in these agreements. Finally, the chapter provides an overview of the rest of the book.

AB  - The risks from climate change are ever-growing, especially in more vulnerable and exposed regions such as coastlines. The rise in sea level and increase in the frequency and intensity of climate-induced coastal hazards are threatening the increasing coastal populations. Brazil, with its 8,500 km of coast, is one of the countries most at risk from coastal flooding and erosion. Nature-based solutions have been suggested as climate adaptation strategies with the greatest potential to counteract coastal hazards stemming from sea-level rise and safeguard coastal cities. However, there is still a knowledge gap in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of nature-based solutions, especially at large spatial scales in Central and South America. Here, we assessed the risks from climate-induced hazards of coastal erosion and flooding related to sea-level rise on the Brazilian coast, and the effectiveness of nature-based solutions as climate adaptation strategies. We reveal that nature-based shoreline protection can reduce by 2.5 times the risks to the Brazilian coastline. The loss of existing natural habitats would substantially increase the area and population at risk from these climate-induced hazards. Worrisomely, legal mechanisms to protect these natural habitats are few and being weakened. Only 10% of the coastal natural habitats are within protected areas, and these alone do not ensure coastal protection, as our results indicate that the loss of unprotected natural habitats has about the same risk as the total absence of natural habitats. Our results warn of the severe consequences of the continued loss of natural habitats along the coast. Thus, actions towards the maintenance and protection of coastal habitats are paramount for climate adaptation and to ensure the well-being and livelihoods of coastal populations. Brazil has a central role in demonstrating the benefits of strategies based on nature-based solutions for shoreline protection, favoring their implementation worldwide. We provide both the natural habitat maps and the maps with model results with spatial and numerical information so readers can explore the relations between the natural habitats and coastal risk indexes at a sub-national level and foster their use by local stakeholders.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems consist of diverse habitats, such as reed beds, salt marshes, mangrove swamps, tidal flats, river deltas, seagrass fields, coral reefs, sandy/rocky-shore beaches and other habitats that harbour biodiversity. The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011 caused severe damage to one-third of the fishing communities along the Pacific Ocean of NE Japan. Coastal species, such as seagrasses, function as nursery areas for commercially important species. Coastal ecosystems provide natural infrastructure for the prevention and reduction of hazardous events, a process known as ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR). The preparation of topographic and thematic maps of coastal marine environments is essential to establish and visualize the concept of Eco-DRR. Experience gained following the Japanese earthquake, as well as examples from Indonesia and Thailand in the wake of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, showed that Eco-DRR is an affordable and sustainable approach. Dissemination of habitat maps should be further promoted as a way to ‘Build Back Better’. To scale up and promote Eco-DRR, scientists must work in a transdisciplinary manner and engage with society by understanding the roles of ecosystems by monitoring and analysing, providing solutions and raising the awareness of community and policy makers, enabling them to better implement Eco-DRR.

AB  - Virtually the entire population of the globally ‘Vulnerable’ Swan Goose Anser cygnoides winters in the Yangtze floodplain. Historically, the species was widely distributed throughout the floodplain but now approximately 95% of the population is confined to three closely-situated wetlands in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces. Recent counts indicate that at one of these sites, Shengjin Lake (in Anhui), a decline of about 10,000–20,000 birds, to about 1,000 currently, has taken place during the last five years. The likely cause of the decline in Swan Goose abundance at Shengjin Lake is the recent decrease in submerged vegetation, particularly tuber-producing Vallisneria which is the species’s main food; this decrease has been linked with the introduction of intensive aquaculture in the main areas used by Swan Geese within the lake. Earlier range contractions in the Yangtze floodplain may also be linked to reductions in submerged vegetation cover at other sites, where intensive aquaculture has also been implicated. Changes in lake hydrology following construction of the Three Gorges Dam may also have adversely affected submerged vegetation productivity. Key information needs for the effective implementation of conservation measures for Swan Goose include an understanding of (1) the fitness consequences of Swan Geese being forced to switch to different foods; (2) how aquaculture can be managed to minimise impacts on submerged vegetation; (3) the impact of changing lake hydrology on key Swan Goose food plants; and (4) the optimal management of wetlands to ensure that adequate food is both produced during the summer period and is available throughout the winter.

AB  - A relatively new type of beach nourishment to combat the hydrodynamical erosion is the mega-nourishment where large amounts of sand are placed in a relatively small area. The pilot project called The Sand Motor is a mega-nourishment of 21 Mm3, which was constructed in 2011 at the coast near Ter Heijde in the Netherlands. The objectives of the Sand Motor mega-nourishment are to maintain coastal safety and nature development. This research is focused on modelling dune formation pattern development at this out-of-equilibrium anthropogenic shore like the Sand Motor. Gaining knowledge about the dune growth patterns on this type of nourishment may influence decision making for the shape and elevation of future mega-nourishments projects all over the world increasing coastal safety and nature development. To get understanding which processes are influencing the dune growth at the Sand Motor the cellular model DUBEVEG (DUne BEach VEGetation) is used in this research. Advances of the DUBEVEG model is that complex processes (hydrodynamic erosion, aeolian sediment transport and vegetation development) are partly replaced by stochastic parameters decreasing the computation time significantly compared to computational fluid dynamic (CDF) models. The DUBEVEG is very flexible since many rules in the model can be easily adapted. The DUBEVEG model has not been applied previously for an out-of-equilibrium anthropogenic shore like the Sand Motor and needs adjustments to model this area. To implement the fast-changing coastline, a reference surface elevation map, measured at the Sand Motor, is used to force the changing coastline by hydrodynamical erosion or deposition. Furthermore, a new method for determining the areas that are sheltered from the hydrodynamics is implemented. The model is not able to correctly simulate the observed dune formation patterns at the Sand Motor with the standard model settings. The model results show different dune development, aeolian deposition locations and vegetation locations compared to the LIDAR measurements of actual dune development. The model simulates rows of dunes perpendicular to the wind direction while the LIDAR measurements at the coast do not show these dune patterns. The observed vegetation occurs mainly near the foredune and around the lake, while the model simulates vegetation all over the Sand Motor. A sensitivity analysis is to performed to get insight into the effect of model parameters on dune development. The parameters used in the sensitivity analysis are the aeolian probability of erosion and deposition (PePd), the groundwater depth and the pioneer vegetation expansion rate. The sensitivity analysis for the combined PePd shows that more dunes, but of similar elevation, develop at a higher PePd. The effect of PePd for the number of dunes is relatively small compared to the groundwater level. The sensitivity analysis for the groundwater level shows that increasing the groundwater level results in a decrease in the number and elevation of dunes. The effect on dune elevation is relatively small compared to the pioneer vegetation expansion rate. The sensitivity analysis for the pioneer vegetation expansion rate shows that increasing the pioneer vegetation expansion rate results in an increase in the height of the dunes but the locations of these dunes are similar and not influenced. Furthermore, two model revisions are tested for there influence on the dune development on the Sand Motor. The first model revision is multidirectional wind and the second model revision is beach armouring. In the standard model, unidirectional wind (one aeolian transport direction) is applied. Beach armouring is relevant for this area because large parts of the Sand Motor are elevated above the storm surge level. The lack of hydrodynamic erosion causes the beach armouring to limit the sediment supply available for aeolian erosion. 3 In the first model revision, including multidirectional wind in the DUBEVEG model (two aeolian transport directions) results in different dune patterns and vegetation that i more spread over the Sand Motor area compared to simulation with the unidirectional wind. The dunes, simulated by the model with the multidirectional wind, are smaller and closer together compared to the model results with the unidirectional wind. The results of the simulation with multidirectional wind are more realistic because the dune patterns are closer to observations than the rows of dunes simulated by the model with the unidirectional wind. In the second model revision, including beach armouring in the DUBEVEG model decreases the probability for aeolian erosion for armoured cells. In the model, beach armouring occurs only at the high elevated areas of the Sand Motor resulting in fewer dunes to develop on these highly elevated areas with larger distances between the dunes and fewer vegetated cells. This research shows that it is possible to implement a forced coastline by hydrodynamics, beach armouring and multidirectional wind in the DUBEVEG model, but improvements can be made in future research. The DUBEVEG model in the current form is not applicable for the out-of-equilibrium anthropogenic shores like the Sand Motor because processes are missing. However, Including multidirectional wind (aeolian transport directions) and beach armouring in the model result in a better approach to the observed dunes. Assumed is that improvements in these processes would further increase the approach of the observed dune patterns and increase the applicability of the DUBEVEG model for out-of-equilibrium anthropogenic shores.

AB  - Hydrodynamic conditions in the Oosterschelde have changed as a result of the Delta Project. Engineering works were carried out between 1960 and 1970 in the northern branch of the Oosterschelde. The Grevelingen dam was built in 1964 and the Volkerak dam was completed in the spring of 1969. With the completion of these dams, the northern branch of the Oosterschelde was cut off from other estuaries, and river flow was then regulated by a sluice complex in the Volkerak dam. Between 1980 and 1987 a storm-surge barrier was constructed across the mouth of the Oosterschelde, and two compart-mentalisation dams were built in the eastern part of the basin. The storm surge barrier decreased the effective cross-sectional area at the mouth from 80 000 m2 to 17 900 m2. The compartmentalisation dams reduce the surface area of the Oosterschelde basin from 452 km2 to 351 km2. The hydraulic impact of the works is demonstrated with data from field measurements and data from model calculations.

AB  - With the growing concerns on the impacts of climate change, one entry point identified for adaptation is through disaster risk management, specifically climate risks reduction. A greater number of national and local projects in the Philippines are now into mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction into development planning, land use planning, sectoral planning including that of agriculture, water resources, coastal zone management and in education. In this paper, one initiative of local government unit (LGU) and the local community is presented, specifically on the efforts of the provincial government of Bulacan on community-based flood early warning and mitigation through exchange of information, in cooperation with the technical information provider. Based on this existing system, a reflection on how the community-based approach, which address flood risks under current climate could also be a successful adaptation strategy towards increased flood risks under climate change conditions.

AB  - In New England salt marshes the boundary between frequently flooded low marsh habitats and less frequently flooded high marsh habitats is characterized by striking plant zonation. Spartina alterniflora monocultures dominate low marsh habitats while the seaward border of high marsh habitats is generally dominated by Spartina patens. In this paper I examine the role of interspecific competition in maintaining this zonation pattern. Spartina patens turfs and tillers transplanted into the low marsh were severely stunted with or without S. alterniflora neighbors, and low marsh bare patches bordering S. patens monocultures were not significantly colonized by S. patens in three growing seasons. The limited ability of S. patens to oxygenate its rhizosphere in anoxic soils appears to limit S. patens to high marsh habitats. In contrast, S. alterniflora transplants grew vigorously in the high and low marsh when buffered from neighbors, but were excluded from the high marsh in 2-3 yr when S. patens was present. S. alterniflora also rapidly invaded the high marsh in the absence of S. patens. These results support the hypothesis that S. alterniflora is restricted to low marsh habitats by competitive displacement. S. alterniflora thrives in anoxic low marsh habitats due to its ability to oxygenate its roots and rhizosphere. Rhizosphere oxidation by S. alterniflora, however, is not evident in seedlings and small colonizing patches and both seedlings and small colonizing patches of S. alterniflora are stunted in anoxic low marsh substrates. This suggests that the success of S. alterniflora in anoxic habitats is size dependent and may be driven by group benefits of rhizosphere oxidation. These results suggest that the maintenance of intertidal zonation in rocky beach and marsh plant communities is very similar. In both assemblages, competitive dominants monopolize physically benign habitats and displace competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats.

AB  - Bacteria form biofilm on inert and live surfaces as a strategy for survival in nature. Although biofilm is typically a consortium of microorganisms, such as bacteria, algae, fungi, and protozoa, it is possible to find a biofilm consisting only of a single species of bacterium in nature but it can be easily produced in the laboratory. Bacteria are primary colonizing organisms and, by virtue of their light independency, fast growth rates, and small size, they constitute the predominant organisms of most biofilms. Biofilm cells usually occur in very high densities per unit weight or volume of the medium compared with their plankton counterparts. Densities can be as high as 10 - 16 cells m super(3), a concentration far higher than normally achieved in suspension culture (Characklis and Marshall 1989). The exopolysaccaride glycocalyx matrix produced by the bacteria, in addition to determining the integrity of the biofilm, also acts as a barrier to the action of chemicals and heat. Ideally, biofilm can now be developed and promoted on suitable plant or animal-based substrates in vitro or in open waters for applications in the field of aquaculture. In this article we report the successful exploitation of the resistant properties and high density nature of biofilm, respectively, for development of novel oral vaccines and also increasing fish production.

AB  - The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act funded construction of the West Bay Sediment Diversion Project (WBSD) on the west bank of the Mississippi River for the purpose of coastal restoration. A multi-tiered sediment study for the WBSD was conducted to determine impacts to the adjacent navigation channel, and to the Pilottown Anchorage Area. One tier of the study is the implementation of HEC-6T, a one-dimensional (1-D) sediment model, to evaluate the regional impacts of the WBSD. The HEC-6T model results shows the long-term channel changes associated with the WBSD to be increasing shoaling in the adjacent areas on the order of 10%-20%, as compared to the no WBSD condition. However, it is extremely difficult to isolate the impacts associated with a single diversion due to multiple diversions in the region. From a holistic vantage point, the 1-D model shows the necessity to examine, on a regional scale, the lower Mississippi River, as a single congruent system on a regional scale.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of cultivation, nitrogen fertilizer, and set aside on CH sub(4) uptake after drained marshland was converted into agricultural fields, CH sub(4) fluxes and CH sub(4) concentrations in soil gas were in situ measured in a drained marsh soil, a set-aside cultivated soil, and cultivated soils in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China in August 2001. Over the measuring period, the highest CH sub(4) uptake rate was 120.7 plus or minus 6.2 mu g CH sub(4) m super(-2) h super(-1) in the drained marsh soil and the lowest was 29.5 plus or minus 4.9 mu g CH sub(4) m super(-2) h super(-1) in the set-aside cultivated soil, showing that there was no significant recovery of CH sub(4) uptake ability 5 years after cultivation activity was stopped. CH sub(4) uptake rates were significantly less in the cultivated soils than in the drained marsh soil by 30.1-74.6%, which resulted mainly from cultivation and partly from nitrogen addition. A significantly negative correlation between CH sub(4) flux and bulk density in the cultivated soils tilled by machine suggests that cultivation reduced CH sub(4) uptake through compaction, because of the enhanced diffusion resistance for CH sub(4) and O sub(2). Nitrogen fertilization slowly reduced but persistently affected CH sub(4) uptake even after long-term application of nitrogen.

AB  - Issue Title: Special feature in diversity of ecological restoration in East Asia Though there are wetlands listed by the IUCN and wetland protection areas designated by the government, it is presumed that there would be more wetlands in Korea when they are surveyed and classified according to international wetland criteria, but a considerable amount of area is yet to be identified. Therefore, in order to conduct a systematic status survey on the wetlands of Korea, a wetland classification system needs to be developed first. The objectives of this paper include reviewing international wetland classifications and mapping systems of the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan and North Korea and developing a wetland classification and mapping system appropriate to Korea based on an understanding of the major case examples of wetland types. Then, the developed system was applied to the Phanmun field watershed located at the western DMZ in Korea to conduct a case study. The overall process of a wetland classification and mapping system developed in this study is undertaken as the following from step 1 to step 5. First, wetlands are identified based on three parameters: hydrology, hydrophytes and hydric soil. Second, wetland delineation distinguished wetland areas and non-wetland areas by identifying wetlands through a field survey. Third, an ecological survey is conducted in order to classify wetland characteristics and types for the target area. Ecological survey items include the topography, landscape, biota, pollutant sources and land use status. Fourth, a wetland classification is developed through a hybrid approach based on HGM (the hydrogeomorphic method). Level 1 is classified into inland, estuarine and costal areas. Level 2, the target area, is classified as an eco-region at a watershed level, and level 3 is classified into depression, riverine, slope, flat and fringe areas based on a HGM approach. Level 4 is classified into detailed wetland types based on specific characteristics of wetlands. Level 5 is classified into marsh and swamp based on grasslands and shrubs and forest trees. Level 6 indicates the dominant vegetation communities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Chittar is an east flowing river in the Tamiraparani river basin. It has six tributaries originating from the Courtallam hills of Western Ghats at 1000 m above MSL. Fish species richness was investigated at ten sites, based on the habitat heterogeneity and man- made stressors, covering all the tributaries. Twenty five species of fish belonging to sixteen genera, four orders and eight families were recorded of which two species viz. Puntius dorsalis and Puntius bimaculatus are new records for this sub-basin. Variations in habitat characteristics such as substrate types, flow pattern, riparian vegetation and fish cover, disturbances in riparian corridors, water quality and natural barriers like big waterfalls, are the major causative factors for the decline in fish diversity.

AB  - Our team's research focuses on fundamental problems in undergraduate education in terms of how to expand use of well researched, yet still "new", teaching pedagogies of 'sensing' or 'hands-on', 'active' and 'problem-based learning' within engineering courses. It is now widely accepted that traditional lectures ARE NOT best for students - yet that is what the community almost universally does. To address this issue we are developing new Desktop Learning Modules (DLMs) that contain miniaturized processes with a uniquely expandable electronic system to contend with known sensor systems/removable cartridges, as well as, unknown expansions to the project. We have shown that miniaturized mimics of industrial-scale equipment produce process data that agree with correlations developed for large-scale equipment. We are now adapting concepts shown efficacious in a single chemical engineering course to a variety of engineering classes within civil, mechanical, bio- and electrical engineering. Some examples of new hands-on learning applications in chemical engineering include a boiler / condenser and evaporative and shell & tube heat exchangers. In bioengineering, we are developing prognostic devices for separating Prostate Cancer Tumor Cells (PCTCs) from blood, sensing for the presence of PCTCs, a thermoregulation simulated limb cartridge for studying kinematics of heat flow and heat distribution in human extremities, and immunoaffinity neuron-like ion selective electrodes. In civil engineering, the DLMs illustrate open channel flow units and a solar powered Rankine cycle is underway in mechanical engineering. We are implementing DLMs along with team learning pedagogy. In this paper we will present technical aspects surrounding development of a large number of new learning cartridges. While the assessment strategies being developed are broadly applicable we will just present one instance, with the civil engineering cartridge, of the identification of misconceptions and experimental design for assessing the impact of the DLM on learning. The assessment includes a pre- and post-test assessment to determine improvement in understanding basic concepts and persistence and/or repair of misconceptions. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the application of submerged rubble mound breakwaters as coastal defence structures. As their defensive ability highly depends on the amount of wave energy remaining at their lee side, the accurate prediction of the energy in the lee of such structures is of utmost importance. Past experiments have shown that the behaviour of rough permeable rubble mound structures under oblique wave attack was found to be significantly different from that of smooth impermeable low crested structures. This behavioural difference has led to the research objective of this present study which is to investigate oblique wave transmission by rough impermeable rubble mound submerged breakwaters using 3D physical model tests. This study intentionally uncouples two parameters, being the permeability of the core and the roughness of the breakwater. Analysing the data of this study shows that the permeability of the core has no visible influence on the structure's behaviour with respect to the influence of oblique wave attack. The fully permeable rough rubble mound breakwater behaves analogous to the fully impermeable rough rubble mound breakwater.

AB  - Nearshore regions act as an interface between the terrestrial environment and deeper waters. As such, they play important roles in the dispersal of fluvial sediment and the transport of sand to and from the shoreline. This study focused on the nearshore of Poverty Bay, New Zealand, and the processes controlling the dispersal of sediment from the main source, the Waipaoa River. Hydrodynamics and sediment-transport in water shallower than 15. m were observed from April through mid-September 2006. This deployment afforded observations during 3-4 periods of elevated river discharge and 5 dry storms. Similar wind, river discharge, wave, current, and turbidity patterns were characterized during three of the wet storms. At the beginning of each event, winds blew shoreward, increasing wave heights to 2-3. m within Poverty Bay. As the cyclonic storms moved through the system the winds reversed direction and became seaward, reducing the local wave height and orbital velocity while river discharge remained elevated. At these times, high river discharge and relatively small waves enabled fluvially derived suspended sediment to deposit in shallow water. Altimetry measurements indicated that at least 7. cm was deposited at a 15. m deep site during a single discharge event. Turbidity and seabed observations showed this deposition to be removed, however, as large swell waves from the Southern Ocean triggered resuspension of the material within three weeks of deposition. Consequently, two periods of dispersal were associated with each discharge pulse, one coinciding with fluvial delivery, and a second driven by wave resuspension a few weeks later. These observations of nearfield sediment deposition contradict current hypotheses of very limited sediment deposition in shallow water offshore of small mountainous rivers when floods and high-energy, large wave and fast current, oceanic conditions coincide. Consistently shoreward near-bed currents, observed along the 10. m isobath of Poverty Bay, were attributed to a combination of estuarine circulation, Stokes drift, and wind driven upwelling. Velocities measured at the 15. m isobath, however, were directed more alongshore and diverged from those at the 10. m isobath. The divergence in the currents observed at the 10 and 15. m locations seemed to facilitate segregation of coarse and fine sediment, with sand transported near-bed toward the beach, while suspended silts and clays were exported to deeper water. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The alteration of habitat structure by introduced ecosystem engineers imposes direct impacts on native biota but can also exert trait-mediated indirect effects. In this study, we show that the habitat structure provided by invasive Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) can also indirectly affect parasitism in native blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). We conducted a 3-month field experiment, in which uninfected mussels were positioned at the bottom and top of two intertidal oyster reefs in the Wadden Sea. On one reef, we detected a significantly higher prevalence of parasitic copepods (Mytilicola spp.) in mussels positioned on top of oysters than in mussels at the bottom, but no difference in infection intensity. For trematodes (Renicola roscovita), a different pattern was observed, with higher prevalence (one reef) and significantly higher infection intensities (both reefs) in mussels positioned at the bottom of the oyster reef. We suggest that the contrasting pattern results from differences in parasite life cycles. Mytilicola spp. larvae spend 2–3 weeks in the water column before infecting their hosts and, therefore, mussels positioned at the top are exposed to higher numbers of planktonic larvae than mussels at the bottom. In contrast, infective trematode larvae spend less than 12 h in the water column and primarily infect mussels during low tide, which may explain higher prevalence and intensity of R. roscovita in mussels near the bottom of the oyster reef. Our results demonstrate that indirect effects leading to alterations of parasite-host interactions may be a more common but hitherto rarely considered impact of biological invasions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Many promising woody plants have not been evaluated for their capacity to thrive in managed landscapes, where environmental conditions restrict diversity to a limited number of adapted taxa. My colleagues and I assess the horticultural potential of obscure or rare taxa native to habitats that require resistance to stressors common in managed landscapes. Research related to several taxa will be considered with a primary focus on our evaluation of Alnus maritima [Marsh.] Nutt. (seaside alder). This rare species occurs in only three small, disjunct provenances (part of the Delmarva Peninsula, one swamp in northwestern Georgia, and two counties in southern Oklahoma) in USDA hardiness zone 7. Plants in all provenances grow exclusively in saturated soils, and some individuals on the Delmarva Peninsula occur in estuaries and in wetlands near salt water. While its ecological niche indicates seaside alder would perform well in flood-prone managed landscapes where winters are relatively mild, we questioned how drought, low temperatures, and salt would affect the species and whether provenance differences in resistance to these stressors exist. Results under greenhouse and field conditions demonstrated drought tolerance; although gas exchange was affected, all leaves were sustained without apparent damage as plants recovered from water deficits that caused severe wilting. Twigs sampled at five-week intervals between late September and late April from plants of all provenances in native habitats and in a plantation near the border of USDA zones 4b and 5a were far more hardy than necessary for a species restricted to USDA zone 7. Field trials confirmed whole plants survive winters in Iowa and Minnesota. Resistance to root-zone salt was intermediate to that of other woody species and was similar among provenances. These data provide an example of how adaptation to multiple environmental stressors can be evaluated as part of a coordinated program to conserve and commercialize a rare species.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora (Loisel.), smooth cordgrass, is a dominant perennial salt marshgrass native to tidal wetland plant communities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. It is an important plant species for coastal reclamation and restoration efforts. It spreads quickly by rhizomes and tolerates a wide range of saline, anoxic, and sulfidic soils. However, because of poor seed production this species is propagated vegetatively for reclamation or restoration projects. Current practices reduce genetic diversity of the species by utilizing a single vegetatively propagated genotype. The objectives of this study were; 1) identify multiple genotypes of S. alterniflora for use in restoration efforts and 2) assess genetic variability of these genotypes at the molecular level. Identification of desirable plants was based on plant growth characteristics and reproductive traits. Growth characters were plant height, spread, rust reaction, and vigor. Reproductive traits were seed set, germination, kernel weight, seed weight, and total seed per plant. This process resulted in seven plants, descended from seven different original source populations, which demonstrated superior performance for vegetative and reproductive traits. Molecular marker analysis revealed that genetic diversity, essential for success in the restoration projects, was maintained in selected plants. These plants offer an enhanced germplasm base for current restoration efforts. Research is continuing on the feasibility of developing seed based populations that would add even greater genetic diversity to the current accepted restoration practices.

AB  - Deltas are a special type of alluvial estuaries, which are complex systems. They form the interface between the terrestrial drainage system and the sea. Deltas have multiple functions: morphologic, hydraulic, hydrologic, ecologic and socio-economic. They are also the areas where different sources of energy converge: tidal energy, wind energy, potential energy from freshwater and sediments, and solar energy to feed the biotic system. The dissipation of all this energy has created a unique environment, with very special tidal and morphologic characteristics. One would expect that such a complex system is difficult to describe in simple mathematical terms, but the opposite is true. If considered at the right scale, deltas and estuaries appear to obey surprisingly simple "laws". For instance: the shape of an alluvial estuary obeys a simple exponential law; the amplitude of the tidal velocity is 1 m/s at spring tide throughout the tidal region; and more surprisingly, this amplitude is the same throughout the world. If left undisturbed, estuaries tend to become "ideal" estuaries, where the tidal wave is undamped, propagating as a simple shallow water wave. As a result, there is also simplicity in the process of salt intrusion and the mixing of substances in estuaries. There are two important research questions related to this surprising simplicity. The first is of course the understanding of the more fundamental physical laws behind this surprising simplicity and uniformity; the second is how to predict the behaviour of estuaries in poorly-gauged regions, because this simplicity may help us to predict how estuaries behave when we have very limited knowledge on the ground. In this presentation, examples are given of two major deltas where predictive equations appear to work remarkably well. Copyright © 2013 IAHS Press.

AB  - Saline and subsaline wetland areas in Central Spain are fragile because of their role in maintaining and controlling environmental quality and biodiversity. The environmental importance of saline wetland areas has been recognized in recent years, due to the increased risk of degradation, and is reflected in the dramatic reduction in wetland cover. We develop a methodological approach to detect temporal and spatial changes of semi-arid wetland components associated with salinization processes, using hyperspectral and multispectral data. Two semiarid wetland sites with different levels of salinity were: a small seasonally hypersaline lagoon and ananthropogenically affected floodplain. Hyperspectral airborne data (DAIS 7915) are used to determine wetland surface cover components (soil, vegetation and water) and selected end members are extrapolated to lower spatial and spectral resolution multispectral Landsat ETM+ and TM data. A spectral unmixing is performed to monitor changing wetland conditions arising from anthropogenic influences. Results show that the methodology is successful in establishing a relationship between land use and land cover. The affected floodplain mainly reflects a monitoring results for the anthropogenically affected floodplain mainly reflects a redistribution of the salt due to management practices. The seasonal hypersaline lagoon shows an important extension of salt efflorescence and although this acts as a natural barrier, there is evidence pointing to encroaching agricultural activity.

AB  - Concern about the effects of climate change have set in motion a search for flood protection measures to adapt coastlines to the foreseen accelerated sea level rise. In this context, the potential role of salt marshes to adapt the Wadden Sea's flood defences was explored in the Netherlands Wadden Region Delta Programme. This paper provides an overview of the steps taken by the programme in developing a climate change adaptation strategy so that others might learn from its experiences. The second aim is to summarize the knowledge generated by the programme on the potential role of salt marshes as part of a climate change adaption strategy. Explorative modelling results indicate that Wadden Sea salt marshes affect wave heights, even under extreme conditions. Therefore, a salt-marsh zone in front of the Wadden Sea dikes that could keep pace with sea level rise may result in a reduced dike reinforcement task. A salt marsh potential map gives a rough impression of locations that are potentially interesting for salt marsh conservation and development, based on the current situation, on available information about abiotic conditions for salt marsh formation and the habitats present in the coastal zone. Besides elongated stretches were seminatural salt marshes are already present or developing, several stretches along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast have favourable abiotic conditions for salt marsh development. However, the prospects for integrating salt marshes into flood defences depend also on other aspects. Various nature conservation agreements are in effect with their associated obligations. Furthermore, the foreseen value of salt marsh development compared to traditional reinforcements, in terms of both costs and benefits, must be considered.

AB  - Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between different region types; for each region flood risk factors were extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood susceptibility increased by over 200% between the rural and urban regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk (80-100%) and high risk (60-80%) were located outside of the SFHA and included several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood susceptibility. Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding. Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1, respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope, land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they allow the contri ution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor. An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk factor's influence on flooding in a subregion. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20%), low risk (20-40%), medium risk (40-60%), high risk (60-80%), and very high risk (80-100%). It was observed that several areas classified as very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require additional flood risk mitigation.

AB  - Wetland monitoring is crucial for understanding wetland changes and responses to natural and anthropogenic actions. In this research, Hangzhou Bay coastal wetland was selected as the study area to analyze spatial patterns and dynamic changes based on Landsat multitemporal imagery. A hybrid approach combining expert knowledge, decision tree, threshold technique, unsupervised classification and postprocessing was developed for wetland classification. Three typical sites were selected to analyze different change patterns. Over the last 10years, the wetlands have undergone dramatic changes, continued to expand outwards due to natural accumulation and increased in area. At the same time, these wetlands have also partially decreased with artificial reclamation and urban construction. An analysis of typical sites found that the change in the western part of this region was dominated by natural accumulation and that in the central and eastern parts was dominated by reclamation due to geographical location and hydrological power. In general, wetlands are continually changing under the joint action of natural accumulation, artificial reclamation and urban construction. The local terrain, hydrology, soil, population, economy and policy also influence wetland changes. The results of wetland monitoring are essential for the protection and management of local wetlands.

AB  - Under stable sea level conditions, estuaries tend to accumulate sediment resulting in changes that can be conceptualised as a progression from a juvenile system to maturity. Sea level rise results in an increase in accommodation space within the estuary that can effectively reverse the progression towards maturity. This effect was investigated for Tairua Estuary, New Zealand, using a set of MIKE 21 HD (hydrodynamic) and MIKE 21 ST (sediment transport) numerical models forced by tides, wind and fluvial discharges. A range of scenarios of sea level rise and changing fluvial inputs were simulated. The simulation results predicted a general trend of increasing tidal range with sea level rise, which was partially offset by higher fluvial discharges within high fluvial input scenarios. Under present conditions, the estuary is ebb-dominated with predominantly fluvial inputs, but with increasing sea level, the estuary becomes increasingly flood-dominant and the transition from fluvial to marine sediments within the estuary progressively moves landward. If the sediment supply increases in tandem with the accommodation space, the result would be no significant change to the estuary's hydrodynamics and sediment transport patterns. Under present conditions, observations and modelling indicate that sediment is exported by ebb-dominant conditions, suggesting a capacity to compensate for increasing accommodation space. However, modelling indicates a sediment deficit at higher projected sea levels, resulting in sediment being scavenged from the seaward margin of the sandy barrier spit enclosing the estuary. Scavenging would increase the coastal erosion hazard for the residents of the barrier spit. This situation does not arise if the rate of increase in accommodation space remains below the annual fluvial sediment supply. Ultimately, our results show the importance of considering catchment-derived sediment supply and morphological complexity, when predicting how the changing hydrodynamics modulate the interplay between sediment stored within the estuary and the open coast, and determining the fate of the coast during sea level rise.

AB  - Artificial reefs (ARs) have been demonstrated to be a potential tool for the restoration of marine habitat and to retard the stress of coral reefs in recent decades. For most engineers, the deployment of an artificial reef ecosystem (ARE) is based on their experience, but what is the effective deployment to produce the higher abundance and to enrich biomass under the finite budget is seldom mentioned. In fact, how to deploy artificial reefs into the selected site and construct an effective ARE is the most challenge to ecological engineers. The main objective of this research is to construct a mathematical model called the deployment of artificial reef communities (DARCs) model, and then to provide a concrete approach for deploying an ARE under the finite budget. The constructing spirit of DARCs model is based on the observations of biologists that a higher complexity of habitat system will increase the species diversity and biomass. The fractal dimension (FD) is applied as an assessing indicator for the habitat system complexity of ARE in this study. In addition, a step-by-step algorithm for achieving the maximal fractal dimension of an ARE through the determinations of the number of deployed artificial reef communities (ARCs), the distance of adjacent ARCs, and the spatial configuration of ARCs in an ARE is presented. A computerized tool written by Fortran program to conduct the design of an ARE as well as perform the simulated analyses is completely proposed, and a case study is followed. The simulation-based analyses of changing budget reveal that the FD of a given region will be constrained regardless of increasing budget. This phenomenon shows that the more deployment of ARCs may lead to waste capital. Finally, a decision support system called DSS(for)ARE is established for the quick-design of an AR ecosystem under the consideration of conservation policy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several non-indigenous bivalve species have been colonising aquatic ecosystems worldwide, in some cases with great ecological and economic impacts. In this paper, we focus on the ecosystem engineering attributes of non-indigenous invasive bivalves (i.e., the capacities of these organisms to directly or indirectly affect the availability of resources to other species by physically modifying the environment). By reviewing the ecology of several invasive bivalves we identify a variety of mechanisms via which they modify, maintain and/or create habitats. Given the usually high densities and broad spatial distributions of such bivalves, their engineering activities can significantly alter ecosystem structure and functioning (e.g., changes in sediment chemistry, grain size, and organic matter content via bioturbation, increased light penetration into the water column due to filter feeding, changes in near bed flows and shear stress due to the presence of shells, provision of colonisable substrate and refuges by shells). In addition, changes in ecosystem structure and functioning due to engineering by invasive bivalves often have very large economic impacts. Given the worldwide spread of non-indigenous bivalves and the varied ways in which they physically modify habitats, their engineering effects should receive more serious consideration in restoration and management initiatives.

AB  - Shallow lowland reservoirs situated in agricultural areas are especially prone to eutrophication. For the purpose of protection of such water bodies it is essential to determine not only sources and loads of pollution, but also nutrient pathways from the catchment to the reservoir. The aim of the undertaken research was to establish surface runoff transport pathways from the direct catchment through the shore zone to the retained water. The influence of land use pattern and its management on the directions of flow and accumulation of the surface runoff was analysed. The research was conducted for the Goluchow Reservoir (N: 51 degrees 50'37 '', E: 17 degrees 56'09 ''), situated in the central-western part of Poland. From the generated digital terrain model (DTM) with the resolution of 1.0 m, terrain slopes were established and surface runoff transport pathways designated. In the direct catchment of 980 ha four surface runoff areas were delineated (from 29 to 468 ha), from which pollution flows in a concentrated manner to the reservoir through indicated delivery points. Moreover, two areas of 69 and 50 ha were identified, wherefrom unconcentrated surface runoff reaches the water body along the shoreline (1750 m and 2130 m long). Thus, the hotspots for pollution were identified. The high resolution digital terrain model (DTM) for detection of micro-topographic features proved to be especially useful in lowland catchments for identification and analysis of surface runoff transport pathways, as well as for effective planning, development and management of mitigation measures such as riparian buffers, constructed wetlands, agricultural BMPs, or other erosion control techniques (including forest roads).

AB  - Indonesia is a country prone to natural disasters that are influenced by natural factors and human factors. Natural disasters that commonly occur in Indonesia are floods, sea tides, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, and drought. Among these disasters, floods are the most frequent natural disasters in various parts of Indonesia. During 2015 there was 1732 incidence of disasters in Indonesia, 92.67% of the disasters are landslides, tornado, and flood (Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency - BNPB, (2016). Refer to BNPB (2018), during 2017, 979 incidences of flood disaster occurred in Indonesia where 2.518.578 people were affected by the flood disaster. Considering that flood is a common disaster in Indonesia, people should have flood preparedness. This research was conducted at the estuary of Bone River Gorontalo Province. The Bone River is one of the longest rivers in Gorontalo Province that cross Bone Bolango Regency and Gorontalo City. There are many communities are living in river estuaries that belong to densely populated areas, so this research is very important to understand perception and adaptation strategy of society to flood disaster. This research was conducted by distributing questionnaires to the community and analyzed quantitatively. The results show that most respondents know that they live in flood-prone areas, floods can cause various impacts, and floods can be prevented and minimized. The research result is expected to be useful in the decision-making process for decreasing flood disaster risk at the estuary of Bone River Gorontalo Province.

AB  - A high-resolution sedimentological and palynological study was performed in combination with biomarker-based organic geochemical temperature proxies TEX86 and MBT'/CBT, on a 7.4-m-thick continuous section straddling the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary at Seymour Island, at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The K-Pg interval of the Seymour Island section was deposited in a deltaic/estuarine system with considerable sedimentary input from the erosion of a distant volcanic arc at the Antarctic Peninsula, combined with ash fallouts from explosive volcanic eruptions. The Maastrichtian interval represents the prodelta of a delta prograding in a marginal marine setting, whereas the Paleocene interval was deposited in more open, shallow marine conditions, following sea-level rise and shoal submergence above the K-Pg boundary. Dinocyst biostratigraphy indicates that in the studied section the K-Pg boundary is represented by a gentle erosive surface, 30 cm below a partially-indurated, marker sandstone bed. The dinoflagellate assemblages show quantitative changes across the boundary. Representatives of Manumiella group together with abundant Palambages dominate the assemblages in the lower part of the section, i. e. below the K-Pg boundary. There is an evident peak of Fibrocysta/Ifecysta/Cordosphaeridium just above the boundary. In the upper part of the section, Senegalinium reaches relatively high abundance together with Impletosphaeridium clavus. While relatively high concentrations of soil-derived organic matter inhibit the use of the TEX86 paleothermometer to reconstruct sea surface temperatures, the MBT'/CBT paleothermometer indicates warm mean annual air temperatures for the latest Cretaceous (16.0-16.5 degrees C). These high temperatures, coinciding with the lowest abundance of the high-latitude pollen taxon Nothofagidites, may reflect the terminal Cretaceous Deccan Traps-warming pulse. Fluctuating temperatures followed in the early Paleocene, characterized by similar to 2 degrees drop in air temperatures, coincident with the maximum percentage of the high-latitude angiosperm Nothofagidites spp. and the cold-water dinocyst taxon Impletosphaeridium clavus. The recognition of ecological signals of disturbances and their relationship with short-term climatic and environmental changes, provides new insights related to the effect of the impact at the high-latitude K-Pg boundary of Antarctica.

AB  - Application of remote sensing to aquatic habitats is generally complex, due to the presence of optically active components that absorb or scatter light. According to the Beer-Lambert law, as electromagnetic energy travels through a medium, it is attenuated at an exponential rate determined by the physical and chemical properties of the medium. Determination of attenuation coefficients is complex for optically shallow inland and coastal waters due to bottom reflection and/or multi-path scattering. To better understand light attenuation in shallow waters, mathematical relationships between water depth and vertical attenuation coefficient (K-d) were derived using experimental spectral data (400-900 nm). The model was used to estimate K-d values at water depths that were beyond and in between the experimentally measured points (5-60 cm). The depth-and wavelength-dependent K-d values were used to correct the measured spectral reflectance for the corresponding light attenuation to restore the bottom reflectance signals. After the correction, the spectral reflectance patterns measured above submerged aquatic plants appeared to include a restored signal from vegetation especially in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Comparison between the modelled spectra and the empirically measured spectra suggest that the proposed approach produced an effective model for light attenuation in optically shallow waters.

AB  - Spartina patens, an intertidal C-4 grass, grows in the upper salt marsh and tolerates coastal seawater salinity. The regulation of ion movement across the plasma membrane (PM) for plant salt tolerance is thought to be achieved by an electrochemical gradient generated by plasma membrane H+-ATPase. in this study, the change of PM H+-ATPase in response to NaCl was characterized for S. patens callus. Callus was cultured for 10 weeks under salinity levels of 0 mM, 170 mM, 340 mM, and 510 mM NaCl. Plasma membrane was isolated from a Dextran/PEG aqueous polymer two-phase system and the purity was demonstrated with membrane enzyme markers. There was a significant increase (up to 2-3-fold) of PM H+-ATPase activity when callus was grown on media containing NaCl. The incremental activation of PM H+-ATPase activity would enable the cell to tolerate higher cytoplasmic NaCl concentrations. PM H+-ATPase appeared to have a higher V-max and a lower substrate concentration (K-m) to reach V-max. When growth medium salinity increased from 0 mM to 170 and 340 mM, the V-max of H+-ATPase increased from 0.64 to 1.00 and 1.73, respectively, while the K-m decreased from 3.58 to 2.07 and 2.44 mM, respectively. In vitro NaCl inhibition kinetic data revealed a pattern of non-competitive inhibition by NaCl on PM H+-ATPase. The response of PM H+-ATPase in S. patens callus suggests that this species has evolved mechanisms that can regulate this important enzyme when cells are exposed to NaCl.

AB  - Vegetation recovery and poverty alleviation are critical problems in the karst national designed poor counties (NPDC) in southwest China. However, little information is available about the relationship between poverty and vegetation dynamics in these areas. In this study, we used remote sensing and statistical datasets from 2000 to 2015 to identify the relations between vegetation dynamics and poverty among the NPDC in southwest rocky desertification areas. We estimated the vegetation dynamics using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and poverty with the rural per capita net income. Local indicator of spatial association and the space-time transition type of poverty were applied to identify spatial patterns of the poverty spatial distribution relationship and transition. Also, poverty, natural and ecological governance factors were assessed using the Geo-detector method to uncover the driving factors of karst vegetation. The results showed that vegetation increased significantly (p < 0.05) in karst NPDC (82.82%) and rocky desertification control counties (78.77%). The karst NPDC was significantly clustered. The hot spots of rural per capita net income changed from west and north (2000) to only north (2015) and cold spots changed from east and south (2000) to only south (2015). The rural per capita net income spatiotemporal transition was higher in 2000 than in 2015. We found a weak synergy between vegetation change and poverty type transition in 42.86% of the browning counties, 45.45% in the slowly greening counties, and 43.65% in stable greening counties. However, 57.50% of counties in the quick greening counties showed a tradeoff relationship with the poverty type transition. The rocky desertification rate and ecological engineering measures affected vegetation dynamics importantly. The results will help decision-makers to understand the interdependence between vegetation and poverty. This will contribute to better policies formulation to tackle poverty in the karst rocky desertification area. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding long-term, large cyclone activity is critical for coastal management and disaster prevention and mitigation, particularly with projected rising sea level and increasing cyclone frequency and the intensity. Here we present sedimentary evidence (cyclone overwash deposits, beachrock boulders, and cyclone-induced clastic deposits) of historic large cyclone events from coastal dune deposits on eastern Hainan Island, China. Based on luminescence dating and sedimentological analysis, eight historic tropical cyclone events (at 1095 +/- 90 BCE, 900-1000 BCE, 975 +/- 50 CE, 1720 +/- 20 CE, 1740 +/- 35 CE, 1790 +/- 25 CE, 1850 +/- 15 CE, and 1895 +/- 10 CE) have been identified in this region. The elevation of the termination point of cyclone overwash deposit layers that represent the paleo-cyclone minimum wave run-up stage, in combination with knowledge of present-day cyclone events, was applied to assess the intensity of these extreme events. The intensity of these cyclone events was likely greater than that of cyclones in the local instrumental records. Furthermore, these large cyclone events correspond to historic records of devastating cyclones. Through comparison with regional and global climate records, we infer that the variability of large cyclones in the South China Sea was probably modulated by the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation, western Pacific warm pool, and local sea surface temperatures over the past 3400 yr. These results provide an improved understanding of long-term, extreme cyclone events and their response to climate change, thereby contributing to regional planning and coastal defense strategies.

AB  - Along wetland shorelines, the energetic wave environment generated by cold fronts occurs more frequently than for major storms, yet their impact on wetland evolution processes has not been fully identified. To capture the changes in wave climate during the passage of cold fronts, a wave gauge was installed near a salt marsh edge in Galveston Bay, Texas, USA. A coupled wave-hydrodynamic model, validated with the data, was used to assess the dominant processes of cold front induced surge and waves. During the measurement period, wind gusts and abrupt direction shifts during cold fronts produced high-energy wave events that propagated toward the wetland edge. Before a cold front passed our study area, there was an initial increase in the water level inside the bay. As soon as the cold front passed and the wind direction shifted, large waves were created by strong winds. Over the first few hours, the relatively high water level reduced the depth limitations on these waves, allowing them to be quite large. However, as the waves struck the wetland edge at these higher water levels, vegetation intercepted and dampened the erosive force. Over the next few days, the water level dropped well below the mean tide, allowing plunging waves to impinge directly on the edge with a high-energy flux. From the calculated wave power during the entire measurement period, it was found that cold front-induced waves, despite their brief duration, had a high erosive impact on the evolution of the wetland edge.

AB  - Background and Aims Sea level rise (SLR) associated with climate change is intensifying permanent submersion and salinity in salt marshes. In this scenario, hybridization between native and invasive species may result in hybrids having greater tolerance of abiotic stress factors than their parents. Thus, understanding the responses of native and invasive halophytes and their hybrids to interacting physiological stresses imposed by SLR is key to native species conservation. We analysed how salinity, inundation depth and their interaction impact the functional traits of native and invasive cordgrass species and their hybrid (genus Spartina; Poaceae). Methods In a mesocosm experiment, we evaluated interactive stress effects of three inundation depths (4.5, 35.5 and 55 cm) and four aqueous salinities (0.5, 10, 20 and 40 ppt) on 27 functional traits of native Spartina foliosa, invasive S. densiflora and their hybrid S. densiflora x S. foliosa from San Francisco Estuary. Key Results The combined effect of salinity and inundation led to synergistic effects on leaf biochemical stress indicators. Spartina foliosa behaved as a stress-tolerant species, with high leaf sodium exudation rate and glycine betaine concentrations that also increased with stress. Spartina foliosa was less sensitive to salinity than S. densiflora and the hybrid but was highly growth-limited in response to increased inundation and salinity. Spartina densiflora was fast-growing in low-stress conditions and tolerated moderate interactive stresses. The hybrid produced more biomass, rhizome reserves and tillers than its parents, even under the most stressful conditions. Transgressivity improved the hybrid's capacity to deal with flooding stress more so than its response to increasing salinity. Conclusions Based on our observations, we predict that established populations of both native and invasive cordgrasses will experience reduced vegetative and sexual fitness in response to SLR. In particular, the combined effects of high salinity and deep inundation may decrease floret production in S. densiflora, a key trait for the spread of its invasive populations. In contrast, the hybrid likely will be able to sustain its invasiveness under SLR based on its ability to maintain growth and biomass production under stressful conditions.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across similar to 185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141-466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2-3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3-25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9-13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621-1,064) Tg CO(2)e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to similar to 3% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

AB  - Restoration is increasingly implemented as a strategy to mitigate global declines in biogenic habitats, such as salt marshes and oyster reefs. Restoration efforts could be improved if we knew how site characteristics at landscape scales affect the ecological success of these foundation species. In this study, we determined how salt marsh shoreline geomorphologies (e.g. with variable hydrodynamic energy, fetch, erosion rates, and slopes) affect the success of restored intertidal oyster reefs, as well as how fauna utilize restored reefs and forage along marsh habitats. We constructed oyster reefs along three marsh shoreline geomorphologies in May 2012: 1) "creek" (small-fetch, gradual-sloped shoreline), "ramp" (large-fetch, gradual-sloped shoreline), and "scarp" (large-fetch, steep-sloped shoreline). Following recruitment, oyster spat density was greatest on ramp reefs; however, 2 years later, the highest adult oyster densities were found on creek reefs. Total nekton and blue crab catch rates in trawl nets were highest in the creek, while piscivore catch rates in gill nets were highest along the scarp shoreline. We found no difference in predation on snails in the salt marsh behind constructed reef and nonconstructed reference sites, but there were more snails consumed in the creek shoreline, which corresponded with the distribution of their major predator-blue crabs. We conclude that oyster reef construction was most successful for oysters in small-fetch, gradual-sloped, creek environments. However, nekton abundance did not always follow the same trends as oyster density, which could suggest constructed reefs may offer similar habitat-related functions (prey availability and refuge) already present along existing salt marsh borders.

AB  - In the Netherlands, the concept of a multifunctional dike has already often been implemented, and has been identified as a promising climate adaptation measure. In a multifunctional dike, functions like urban development, transport infrastructure, recreation, agriculture or nature are deliberately combined with its primary flood protection function. This means that the design must be based on the requirements and life span of all different functions, while in a monofunctional dike only the flood protection function is considered. By accommodating other functions, a multifunctional dike may easier fit into, or even contribute to the quality of the landscape. Moreover, these other functions may help in financing the flood protection works, but governance is more complicated. To avoid costly adjustments forthcoming from changed safety standards, incorporation of multiple functions can require a more "robust" flood defence than a monofunctional flood defence. A robust flood defence can withstand more extreme situations than required by the present safety standards, and has a substantially lower flooding probability. Therefore, a multifunctional dike may be attractive in view of the uncertainties regarding the effects of climate change and a changing world. Moreover, it will result in reduced flood risk. As part of the Dutch Delta programme, several explorative studies on multifunctional dikes were initiated. Most studies focused on urban areas, but also in the rural area interest emerged for multifunctional dikes, e.g. for the integration of salt marshes into the flood defences. Marshes provide valuable habitat for vegetation and invertebrate species, and are important for wading birds. Furthermore, under condition of abundant sediment availability they can keep pace with sea level rise. Explorative modelling results indicate that vegetated forelands affect wave heights, even under extreme conditions. However, the inclusion of a vegetated foreland into the dike design does not automatically mean that nature values and flood protection are well integrated. Flood protection imposes rather different requirements on the extent and features of marshes than nature conservation and development. Wave damping is most effective with a high and stable marsh, while nature thrives with dynamic processes and differences in elevation. Therefore, only a design that allows natural marsh dynamics and includes different marsh zones could combine nature values with flood protection. In practice, this means a dike design with an uncertain foreland, that offers space for natural processes. The uncertainty in foreland development reduces the possible flood risk reduction. In our paper we describe the critical points of interest concerning risk reduction in this system.

Little is known about variation among the habitats occupied by this species, its distribution, chemical composition, and allelopathic activity. The present study aimed to (a) assess the vegetation composition of three different habitats (Western Coast, Delta Coast, and Wadi Hagoul) of R. tingitana in Egypt, (b) determine their correlation to soil factors, (c) identify the changes in the bioactive constituents of R. tingitana in the three regions, and (d) evaluate the allelopathic activity regarding the variation in the habitat. Density and cover of all plant species associated with R. tingitana were estimated within 52 plots, representing three regions. Physical and chemical parameters of soil were analyzed in each plot. R. tingitana aboveground biomass was collected from each habitat, and the bioactive composition was analyzed using HPLC. The allelopathic effect against two weeds (Amaranthus lividius and Chenopodium murale) was assessed. The floristic composition showed the presence of 133 species belonging to 27 families. In the Delta Coast habitat of R. tingitana, Zygophyllum aegyptium and Calligonum polygonoides co-dominate, while Lycium shawii dominate the Western Coast habitat and finally the habitat of Wadi Hagoul was dominated by Haloxylon salicomicum. Soil analysis revealed little variations among habitats, especially salinity and organic matter. Fifteen compounds, mainly phenolics (60% of the total identified compounds) were identified from all R. tingitana samples. The major compounds were quercetin, naringenin, ellagic, gallic, chlorogenic, and caffeic acids. These compounds varied in diversity or quantity among different habitats. The Western Coast sample was the richest in species, followed by Delta Coast sample. Our study showed that salinity is the crucial factor that induces the production of bioactive constituents in R. tingitana, especially phenolics and flavonoids. The R. tingitana extracts significantly reduced the germination and growth of Chenopodium and Amaranthus. However, the Western Coast sample showed potent allelopathic activity, where the germination was wholly inhibited at 75 mg L-1 and 50 mg L-1, respectively. Thereby, this extract could be used as eco-friendly bioherbicide and may be integrated into weed control strategies. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Contaminated surface sediments were removed from a coastal marsh and replaced with clean engineered sediments before marsh vegetation was replanted and the site was reopened to the tide. Differences in trace metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) were monitored for 11 years at different sediment depths, under two types of engineered sediments (with and without compost), and at three marsh surface elevations. Except for Hg and Cd, all others followed the patterns of Fe and Mn of decreasing concentration during drought years and increasing concentration during wet years. Metals in deep sediments (> 25 cm) are always higher than on the surface. Surfaces higher in the terrain had fewer metal concentrations compared to lower elevations. The compost treatment had no insignificant effect on metal concentration. The main pathways involved in remobilization from the buried legacy sediments are organic metal complexation, reductive dissolution, and oxidation of metal sulfides. Hg showed an enrichment pattern throughout the study period suggesting atmospheric deposition as the main pathway. Similarly, sources of Cd are most likely from atmospheric wet deposition since most of the Cd variation is explained by changes in the amounts of rain. Metal concentration in the sediments decreased up to 50% from pre-restoration conditions; the only exceptions were Hg and Cd which continue to accumulate. Increasing dry periods and storm frequencies from changing global weather patterns have the potential to create conditions for greater bioavailability of metals from this and similar world estuaries.

AB  - Leaf abundance of trees plays a dominant role in energy, water and nutrient flux of forest ecosystems, in defining the habitat structure of entrained biota and in mediating interspecific competition among tree species. We quantified leaf abundance of three dominant tree species (Acer saccharum Marsh.; Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.; Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) for 27 years in mature northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA using annual counts of leaves of each species collected in 117 litter traps (0.1 m2, each). We hypothesized that variation in leaf abundance would reflect known disturbance events and canopy dieback episodes. No significant trend in leaf abundance of the three species over 27 years (1993-2019) was observed in seven reference stands despite known canopy dieback of sugar maple and American beech in these stands, indicating that 1) maple decline preceded our sampling interval and 2) expansion of beech understory compensated for canopy dieback caused by beech bark disease. Leaf abundance temporarily declined significantly in response to known disturbances (ice storm, 34 to 47%; late-spring frost, 13 to 16%). Increased leaf abundance, especially for sugar maple (30%), on a watershed where calcium addition restored acidified soils, was probably associated with increased soil pH, Ca availability and decreased Al. The temporal sequence of decline of paper birch at higher elevations following a severe drought in 2002 also was apparent. Leaf abundance based on leaf litterfall in deciduous forests provides a useful indicator of forest ecosystem function and forest health.

AB  - Barrier islands are exposed to the wind and wave action from storms, which often disturbs both the geomorphology and vegetation. Conservation and restoration efforts for these important habitats could be improved with knowledge of how native plants respond to storms. We analyzed 10 years of annual data of vegetation of St. George Island, Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, to quantify how the plant community responds to major storms and to predict which dune species might be appropriate for restoration after storm damage across dune zones. This prediction was tested with six plant species that differed in their storm response-from highly negative (local extinction in response to storms) to highly positive (increased abundance in response to storms). We measured transplant survival and growth (plant height and number of shoots) over 2 years in a restoration experiment across three major dune zones. We found that different species can be useful for restoration purposes in different dune zones, depending on both short- and longer-term management strategies. Uniola paniculata is a particularly strong restoration candidate across all dune zones, whereas Muhlenbergia capillaris and Schizachyrium maritimum would be beneficial for restoration in the interdune area. Fimbristylis spp. and Sporobolus virginicus demonstrate the strongest potential for restoration in the interdune and backdune areas. Restoration of disturbed areas often involves the seeding or transplanting of species to stabilize the landscape and initiate the return of the original vegetation. We show that the performance of native species, in response to storms, especially in conjunction with information on plant life history, can be useful for identifying the best species to use for restoration.

AB  - Due to high productivity, periodic submersion, and rapid sedimentation rate, mangroves are important carbon sinks in tropical-subtropical coastal zones. Mangrove expansion can significantly enhance burial carbon storage in coastal zones and has been reported in many subtropical regions due to climate change in recent years. To better understand the response of carbon storage to climate change in subtropical- tropical coastal zones, it is necessary to estimate the change in burial organic carbon (OC) storage in mangroves undergoing expansion. In the Nanliu River estuary of South China, the total mangrove area has increased from 72 to 622 ha in recent decades. Based on a sedimentology study combined with historical satellite images analysis, the accumulation rate of burial OC in these mangroves is estimated to be 400-500 g.m(-2).y(-1), of which the part imported to the stratigraphy beneath the mangrove deposit layer is approximately 130 g.m(-2).y(-1). Globally, the reported OC accumulation rate is linearly correlated to the accretion rate in mangroves. The accumulation rate of mangrove burial OC estimated in this study is significantly higher than the corresponding value on this fitted curve, indicating that the OC accumulation rates may be underestimated in such mangroves because the OC imported to the lower root layer has been not been taken into account. Based on the estimated OC accumulation rate and the time-series data of the mangrove area, the increase in burial OC storage in the mangroves of the Nanliu River estuary from 1988 to 2018 is estimated at more than 35 Gg. This study provides an example of estimating soil OC storage increase in expanding mangroves, which can help us better understand the response of coastal carbon pool to climate change.

AB  - Mimicking the nitric oxide (NO)-release and glycocalyx functions of native vascular endothelium on cardiovascular stent surfaces has been demonstrated to reduce in-stent restenosis (ISR) effectively. However, the practical performance of such an endothelium-mimicking surfaces is strictly limited by the durability of both NO release and bioactivity of the glycocalyx component. Herein, we present a mussel-inspired amine-bearing adhesive coating able to firmly tether the NO-generating species (e.g., Cu-DOTA coordination complex) and glycocalyx-like component (e.g., heparin) to create a durable endothelium-mimicking surface. The stent surface was firstly coated with polydopamine (pDA), followed by a surface chemical cross-link with polyamine (pAM) to form a durable pAMDA coating. Using a stepwise grafting strategy, Cu-DOTA and heparin were covalently grafted on the pAMDA-coated stent based on carbodiimide chemistry. Owing to both the high chemical stability of the pAMDA coating and covalent immobilization manner of the molecules, this proposed strategy could provide 62.4% bioactivity retention ratio of heparin, meanwhile persistently generate NO at physiological level from 5.9 +/- 0.3 to 4.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) min(-1) in 1 month. As a result, the functionalized vascular stent showed long-term endothelium-mimicking physiological effects on inhibition of thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, enhanced re-endothelialization, and hence efficiently reduced ISR.

AB  - The increased number of natural hazards due to climate variability has resulted in numerous disasters in developing countries. In the Philippines, these are expected to be more common in coastal areas. The common approach to mitigate disasters in this area is to enhance the inherent capabilities of local communities to reduce the effects. Thus, this study proposed an index for a disaster-resilient coastal community at the local level. The composites of the index were determined through a process of prioritizing national-level components of a risk-management and vulnerability-reduction system. The process followed a Delphi technique, wherein 20 decision makers in Baler, Aurora, the Philippines identified criteria and elements that can be used to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities using paired comparisons for the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results showed that the environmental and natural resource management, sustainable livelihood, social protection, and planning regimes were very important and represented >= 70% of the overall weights of criteria subjected to comparisons. These criteria and their elements represented the local-level outcome indicators of the composite index for a disaster-resilient coastal community, which was measured using a weighted linear average (WLC) approach to both outcome and process indicators. The index could be used by local governments as a tool to facilitate meaningful disaster-risk reduction and management. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biological polyesters that can be naturally produced by a range of bacteria as water-insoluble inclusions composed of a PHA core coated with PHA synthesis, structural, and regulatory proteins. These naturally self-assembling shell core particles have been recently conceived as biomaterials that can be bioengineered as biologically active beads for medical applications. Protein engineering of PHA-associated proteins enabled the production of PHA protein assemblies exhibiting biologically active protein-based functions relevant for applications as vaccines or diagnostics. Here we provide an overview of the recent advances in bioengineering of PHA particles toward the display of biomedically relevant protein functions such as selected disease-specific antigens as diagnostic tools or for the design of particulate subunit vaccines against infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, meningitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis C.

AB  - Shorelines respond to rising sea-level through processes such as erosion, landward migration and in-situ drowning (i.e. overstepping). Submerged and preserved shorelines on the continental shelf play a key role in examining coastal response to rising sea levels as they provide important information on how modern shorelines may evolve in time and space within the context of changing climate and post-glacial sea-level rise. This study identifies and assesses the response of a continental shelf to stepped rises in sea level with particular focus on the stepwise evolution of incised valleys and shorelines from the shelf-edge to the inner shelf. Multibeam bathymetry from the mid-outer allows for the analysis of seafloor morphology, including the Protea Banks Reef (a palaeo-shoreline complex), and the adjacent incised, sediment starved continental shelf. Six seismic units and intervening surfaces are identified using interpretations from sub-bottom profiles, these include the incised acoustic basement, variable incised valley fill successions, aeolianite ridges and post-transgressive shoreface and associated sediments that withstood wave ravinement processes. The incised valleys of the outer-shelf are manifested as distinctive seafloor depressions, filled at their bases by fluvial deposits overlain, in the unfilled valley, by deposits derived from cascading subaqueous dunes which comprise the upper-most post-transgressive sediments. A core intersecting the dune material yields a maximum age of deposition of 1191-1263 cal yr BP (68% range), synchronous with a period of higher than present sea-levels in the region suggesting reworking and redistribution of coastal sediment as shelf sediment post-transgression. During the stepped rises in sea level, the shoreface has disconnected from the contemporary shoreline and is preserved by means of topographic barriers formed by antecedent topography as relict shoreface deposits. We provide a new perspective of shoreline response to stepped rises in sea level by integrating the seismic architecture of incised valley fills and shorelines across the continental shelf thus allowing for the assessment of variation in rates of relative sea-level rise since the last glacial maximum.

AB  - Most climate related hazards in Bangladesh are linked to water. The climate vulnerable poor-the poorest and most marginalized communities living in remote villages along Bangladesh's coastal zone that are vulnerable to climate change impacts and who possess low adaptive capacity are most affected by lack of access to safe water sources. Many climate vulnerable poor households depend on small isolated wetlands (ponds) for daily drinking water needs and other domestic requirements, including cooking, bathing and washing. Similarly, the livelihoods of many of these households also depend on access to ponds due to activities of small-scale irrigation for rice farming, vegetable farming and home gardening. This is particularly true for those poorest and most marginalized communities living in Satkhira, one of the most vulnerable coastal districts in south-west Bangladesh. These households rely on pond water for vegetable farming and home gardening, especially during winter months. However, these pond water sources are highly vulnerable to climate change induced hazards, including flooding, drought, salinity intrusion, cyclone and storm surges, erratic rainfall patterns and variations in temperature. Cyclone Sidr and Cyclone Aila, which hit Bangladesh in 2007 and 2009 respectively, led to a significant number of such ponds being inundated with saline water. This impacted upon and resulted in wide scale implications for climate vulnerable poor households, including reduced availability of safe drinking water, and safe water for health and hygiene practices and livelihood activities. Those households living in remote areas and who are most affected by these climate impacts are dependent on water being supplied through aid, as well as travelling long distances to collect safe water for drinking purposes.

AB  - The marshland upwelling system (MUS) was installed on private camps in the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Moss Point, Mississippi. The system was evaluated for its effectiveness in removing fecal coliforms from settled, raw waste-water. A suite of studies was performed at flow rates of 1.9, 2.8, and 5.5 L/min and an injection frequency of 30 min every 3 h to investigate fecal coliform removal. An additional study was performed at a flow rate of 2.8 L/min and an injection frequency of 15 min every hour. Overall, the MUS consistently maintained fecal concentrations below effluent regulatory standards for shellfish harvesting waters (14 most probable number of colonies per 100 mL). Mean influent concentrations of 55,269+/-2,218,016 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL were reduced to effluent counts of 2.7 +/- 14.07 CFU/100 mL (observed in the 1.5 m wells). Three- to four-log reductions in influent counts were observed over the initial 1.4 vector m from the injection well. The overall removal followed a first-order decay relationship with respect to vector distance, resulting in removal rate constants ranging from 5.6 to 6.6/m and predicted surface concentrations approaching 0 CFU/100 mL. The 2.8 L/min for 30 min every 3 h treatment provided the best effluent quality.

AB  - The impacts of the invasive plant Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica) on native plant and invertebrate communities in its introduced range have been relatively well studied, and studies have revealed predominantly negative impacts. However, little research has focused on the impact of knotweed on higher trophic levels. This study investigated how riparian bird communities respond to different levels of knotweed invasion. Birds were counted in 21 fixed-width transects located along ten streams in Pennsylvania, a prime avian breeding area, winter roosting site, and migratory staging area located along the Atlantic Migratory Flyway. Species richness and overall abundances did not significantly differ between levels of knotweed coverage. However, three species exhibited significant positive correlations with knotweed cover, and one species exhibited a significant negative correlation. Species and foraging guild composition differed between survey locations with and without knotweed. Species frequently found around human habitation and in degraded habitats were associated with knotweed, while more sensitive species were associated with native vegetation. Locations with knotweed were also associated with fewer foraging guilds and lacked an association with shoreline gleaners, water ambushers, and ground foragers, indicating a potential loss of ecological function. Given the widespread distribution of Japanese Knotweed, management actions to reduce or eliminate knotweed from riparian corridors are necessary in order to preserve avian diversity and function.

AB  - Sediments delivered by global rivers are of utmost importance to the morphological formation and ecosystem evolution of estuary-coast-shelf systems. In this study, numerical modeling, supported by hydrological data, was applied to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities on the water and sediments delivery of five rivers along the east coast of the Liaodong Peninsula to the North Yellow Sea. Simulation results indicate that the water discharge and sediment load of these five rivers during the past millennium reached 27.88 +/- 5.97 km(3) y(-1) and 5.97 +/- 3.26 Mty(-1), respectively. Climate change was the most significant driving factor altering water discharge in the study area, with human activity producing an insignificant effect. Different from runoff, variations in sediment loads are dominated by human activities in past millennium. Our results demonstrate that the soil erosion of five rivers induced by human activities increased sharply by up to 8.1 times over the past few centuries, and that the total dam trapping efficiency for the eastern Liaodong Peninsula was 71.7%. If no dams had been constructed in the study area between 1941 and 2012, the total sediment load of the five rivers would have reached 11.33 +/- 5.70 Mty(-1). This reflects an increase of 92.6% relative to the period between 1000 and 1850 (5.88 +/- 2.93 Mty(-1)) and would have been 3.5 times the actual sediment load during the period 1941-2012 (3.21 +/- 4.61 Mty(-1)).

AB  - Background: Substrate, ocean current and freshwater discharge are recognized as important factors that control the larval dispersal and recruitment of intertidal species. Life history traits of individual species will determine the differential responses to these physical factors, and hence resulting in contrasting phylogeography across the same biogeographic barrier. To determine how these factors affect genetic structure of rocky shore species along the China coast, a comparative phylogeographic study of four intertidal and subtidal species was conducted using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA by combining new sequences from Siphonaria japonica with previously published sequences from three species (Cellana toreuma, Sargassum horneri and Atrina pectinata). Results: Analysis of molecular variance and pairwise FST revealed significant genetic differences between the Yellow Sea (YS) and the other two marginal seas (East China Sea, ECS and South China Sea, SCS) for rocky-shore species (S. japonica, C. toreuma, S. horneri), but not for muddy-shore species Atrina pectinata. Demographic history analysis proved that the population size of all these four species were persistent though the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 20 ka BP). Migration analysis revealed that gene flow differentiated northward and southward migration for these four species. However, the inferred direction of gene flow using alternatively mitochondrial or nuclear markers was contradictory in S. japonica. Conclusions: It is concluded that there is a phylogeographical break at the Yangtze River estuary for the rocky shore species and the causation of the barrier is mainly due to the unsuitable substratum and freshwater discharge. All four intertidal and subtidal species appear to have persisted through the LGM in China, indicating the lower impact of LGM on intertidal and subtidal species than generally anticipated. The imbalanced gene flow between YS and ESCS groups for these four species could be explained by historical refugia. The discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers in the MIGRATE analysis of S. japonica prove the importance of employing multi-locus data in biogeographic study. Climate change, land reclamation and dam construction, which are changing substrate and hydrological conditions around Yangtze River estuary, will consequently affect the biogeographic pattern of intertidal species.

AB  - The application of flexible horizontal porous structure has a significant impact on the design of breakwaters and wave energy absorption devices for coastal protection and wave energy extraction, respectively. This type of structure is more economical compared to a rigid type structure. Therefore, the hydroelastic response of the flexible porous structure can be investigated to widen the influence of structural deformations in design parameters. This paper presents a generalized expansion formula for the said problem based on Green's function in the water of finite depth (FD) and infinite depth (ID). The series form of the velocity potentials for the wave-maker problem is also derived using Green's second identity. The derived expansion formula is applied to a real physical problem and the analytical solution is obtained utilizing a matched eigenfunction expansion method under velocity potential decompositions. The convergence study of the series solution is checked. The present results and the published experimental datasets, as well as analysis, are compared. The effect of design parameters on the hydroelastic response of the submerged flexible porous plate is analyzed. It is observed that the analysis of the results will be useful for gaining insight into how to design a wave energy absorption device.

AB  - The goal of wetland creation is to produce an artificial wetland that functions as a natural wetland. Studies comparing created wetlands to similarly aged natural wetlands provide important information about creation techniques and their improvement so as to attain that goal. We hypothesized that differences in sediment phosphorus accretion, deposition, and chemistry between created and natural wetlands in the Atchafalaya Delta, Louisiana, USA were a function of creation technique and natural river processes. Sediment deposition was determined with feldspar marker horizons located in created and natural wetlands belonging to three age classes (< 3, 5-10, and 15-20 yr old). Phosphorus fractions were measured in these deposited sediments and in suspended and bedload sediment from the Atchafalaya River. Bedload sediment had significantly lower iron- and aluminum-bound, reductant-soluble, and total phosphorus than suspended sediment due to its high sand percentage. This result indicates that wetlands artificially created in the Atchafalaya Delta using bedload sediment will initially differ from natural wetlands of the same age. Even so, similarities between the mudflat stratum of the < 1- to 3-yr-old created wetland and the mudflat stratum of the 15- to 20-yr-old natural wetland support the contention that created wetlands in the Atchafalaya Delta can develop natural characteristics through the deposition of river suspended sediment. Differences between three created wetland strata, the 15- to 20-yr-old willow stratum and the < 1- to 3-yr-old willow and mixed marsh strata, and their natural counterparts were linked to design elements of the created wetlands that prevented the direct deposition of the river's suspended sediment.

AB  - Development of hypoxia in Japan has been confirmed in the inner part of almost every major bay of Japan on the Pacific Coast from Tokyo southward. This paper presents multiple aspects (present condition, hydraulic mechanism, effect upon fisheries, historical progress and nutrient budget between sediment and water) using Mikawa Bay, where Japan's most serious hypoxia occurs, as an example. Although hypoxia basically results from the increase of nutrient load input from domestic and livestock sources, the intense reclamation of shallows (including tidal Bats) and the large reduction in river Bow due to farmland irrigation drastically accelerated dissolved oxygen deficiency. Oxygen-deficient waters in Mikawa Bay are large enough to strip the water purification capacity of the remaining shallows. Unfortunately, the shallows have turned from a purifier to a source of nutrient load. These conditions are more or less common in ah bays where the dissolved oxygen-deficient waters have been reported. To break this cycle, dissolved oxygen deficiency must be contained to the extent that the purification capacity of the shallows can be restored to an efficient level. For this purpose, the first thing to do is to restore tidal flats over an extensive area and to recover sufficient water flow, which may be a more urgent imperative than reducing the nutrient load input.

AB  - Cadmium is a priority hazardous substance, persistent in the aquatic environment, with the capacity to interfere with crustacean moulting. Moulting is a vital process dictating crustacean growth, reproduction and metamorphosis. However, for many organisms, moult disruption is difficult to evaluate in the short term, what limits its inclusion in monitoring programmes. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) is an enzyme acting in the final steps of the endocrine-regulated moulting cascade, allowing for the cast off of the old exoskeleton, with potential interest as a biomarker of moult disruption. This study investigated responses to waterborne cadmium of NAGase activity of Carcinus maenas originating from estuaries with different histories of anthropogenic contamination: a low impacted and a moderately polluted one. Crabs from both sites were individually exposed for seven days to cadmium concentrations ranging from 13 to 2000 mu g/L. At the end of the assays, NAGase activity was assessed in the epidermis and digestive gland. Detoxification, antioxidant, energy production, and oxidative stress biomarkers implicated in cadmium metabolism and tolerance were also assessed to better understand differential NAGase responses: activity of glutathione S-transferases (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) glutathione reductase (GR), levels of total glutathiones (TG), lipid peroxidation (LPO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Animals from the moderately polluted estuary had lower NAGase activity both in the epidermis and digestive gland than in the low impacted site. NAGase activity in the epidermis and digestive gland of C. maenas from both estuaries was sensitive to cadmium exposure suggesting its usefulness for inclusion in monitoring programmes. However, in the digestive gland NAGase inhibition was found in crabs from the less impacted site but not in those from the moderately contaminated one. Altered glutathione levels were observed in cadmium-treated crabs from the contaminated site possibly conferring enhanced tolerance to these animals through its chelator action. Investigation of enhanced tolerance should thus be accounted for in monitoring programmes employing NAGase as biomarker to avoid data misinterpretation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was carried out in the sea adjacent to a major MSF plant where a new 24MGD SWRO plant is being commissioned. Data were collected on the topographical feature of the marine basin, water quality and plankton of the intake zone. The incidents of planktonic bloom, influx of invasive organisms like jellyfish and macrofouling organisms and ingress of marine algae were monitored regularly. The Intake Bay of the plant is a well designed man-made structure studded to the coast. The marine basin in Al-Jubail is for geological reasons, a shallow gently sloping shelf while the bay proper is a dredged, deeper basin The area outside the bay is a vast sea grass bed and the seafloor sediment is sandy. The drag of seawater maintained by the intake pumps facilitates the transport of sediment particles, uprooted algae and floating objects creating fouling problems inside the plant. Seawater temperatures, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen and trace metals were found to be very much benign to the trouble free operation of the plant. Influx of jellyfish, noticed during the summer, was not found to be very severe. Data on plankton showed the presence of many phyto and zooplankton organism of biofouling potential in the plant Total suspended solids indicated the possibility of the intake bay becoming a source of elevated Silt Density Index (SDI) for the new SWRO plant. The paper considers the data in detail and discusses the effects of environment on the desalination plant in Al-Jubail and suggests certain strategies for the protection of seawater intakes and some points useful in the siting and design of coastal seawater intakes in the region.

AB  - Due to global warming and coastal development, the damages in coastal such as sea level rise and changes in coastline caused by scour and erosion are increasing, Various types of breakwaters are applied to prevent the coastal erosion, however, the problem such as scour around the structure is exacerbated, therefore a fundamental solution is needed. In this study, two-dimensional laboratory experiments were conducted in the wave flume to investigate the wave transmission phenomena of artificial coral reef. Experiments are conducted by analyzing wave transmission dependents on ratio of stem length to water depth(l(s)/h), wave height and wave period. Wave attenuation appeared to be most dependent on stem length to water depth(l(s)/h) and structure width. As incident wave height increased and the wave period decreased, the wave attenuation also increased, however, it was insignificant compared to the influence of the inundation rate. Wave attenuation increases dependents on incident wave height and period, however showed insignificant effect compared to submergence rate. In addition wave attenuation rate also affects wave energy reduction in order of l(s)/h > H-0/h > h/L-0. Based on results, we analyzed correlation between KC and C-D of artificial coral reef to suggest the equation on empirical relationship. As a result, it is judged that estimating wave transmission rate and drag coefficient of artificial coral reef dependents on sectional specification can be utilized properly in working design and application.

AB  - River fish diversity is threatened by anthropogenic environmental alteration to landscapes. The early life-history stages of fish play an important role in maintaining diversity and population recruitment and can be heavily influenced by landscape patterns. Information on temporal and spatial distribution patterns of fish eggs and larvae is also important for biodiversity conservation and management of fish resources. The Yangtze River possesses a high diversity of fishes, including many commercially important species. The economy along the lower reach of the river is well developed, and most of the area is experiencing high pressure from human impacts. This section of the Yangtze River connects with the largest freshwater lake in China at the upstream end and flows into the estuary at the downstream end. These two landscape features are likely to have a significant impact upon the spatial distributions of fish egg and larval assemblages. Environmental variables, fish eggs, and larval assemblages were sampled in three locations, at Hukou, Anqing, and Jingjiang, in the lower reach of the Yangtze River. The results suggest that the higher number of species and greater abundance in upstream sites reflect the critical function of connectivity of Poyang Lake with the river for fish recruitment in the lower Yangtze. The delayed bloom of larval fish, occurrence of estuarine species, and a lower species number and abundance of freshwater fish downstream reflect the influence of tidal intrusion from the estuary. This study highlights the value of maintaining natural river-lakes connectivity in the Yangtze River as a conservation measure. The connected river-lake system should be designated as a priority area for fish resource protection in the lower reach of the Yangtze River. We recommend further measures to break down barriers between the river and other lakes and to restore the natural lateral connectivity of the floodplain ecosystem.

AB  - Articulated coralline algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) dominate low-intertidal, wave-exposed habitats around the world, yet the mechanics of this diverse group of organisms has been almost completely unexplored. In contrast to fleshy seaweeds, articulated corallines consist of calcified segments (intergenicula) separated by uncalcified joints ( genicula). This jointed construction makes calcified fronds as flexible as fleshy seaweeds, allowing them to 'go with the flow' when struck by breaking waves. In addition to functioning as joints, genicula act as breakage points along articulated fronds. Here, I describe the allometric scaling of geniculum size, breaking force and tissue strength along articulated fronds in two species of Calliarthron. Genicular material is much stronger than tissue from fleshy macroalgae. Moreover, as fronds grow, genicula get bigger and their tissue strengthens, two processes that help them resist breakage. Within individual fronds, larger branches, which presumably experience greater drag force, are supported by bigger, stronger genicula. However, frond growth greatly outpaces genicular strengthening. As a result, Calliarthron fronds most likely break at their bases when critically stressed by incoming waves. Shedding fronds probably reduces the drag force that threatens to dislodge coralline crusts and may constitute a reproductive strategy.

AB  - Like many other structures (e.g. bridges, buildings), some coasts need maintenance. Regular maintenance of structures is never considered as a waste of money, but rather as conservation of valuable investments. The repetition of beach nourishment is often seen as a negative aspect. In this respect the attitude of some coastal zone managers should change, since beach nourishment is a very versatile tool in mitigating coastal erosion problems. For the design of coastal defense schemes distinction can be made between curing the disease and treating the symptoms, beach nourishment often being an example of the latter. A philosophy is given concerning the nourishment of sand at the offshore zone, the waterline, the dry beach, the dune front, and the top and the backside of the dune. It is recommended to define a set-back line sufficiently landward, and to provide the corresponding legal tools in order to allow the coastal zone manager space and time to execute his coastal defense policy.

AB  - To protect bather health at recreational beaches, fecal indicator bacterial standards are used to monitor water quality, and waters exceeding the standards are subsequently closed to bathers. However beachgoers are also in contact with beach sands, the sanitary quality of which is not included within beach monitoring programs. In fact sands and sediments provide habitat where fecal bacterial populations may persist, and in some cases grow, in the coastal zone. Specific pathogens are less well studied in beach sands and sediments, but there is a body of evidence that they too may persist in these environments. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the abundance and distribution of fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens in beach sands of diverse climatological regions, and at beaches subjected to varied levels of anthropogenic impact. In all regions fecal indicator bacteria are nearly ubiquitous in beach sands, and similar relationships emerge among fecal indicator abundance in dry sand, submerged sands, and water. Taken together, these studies contextualize a potential public health issue and identify research questions that must be addressed in order to support future policy decisions.

AB  - Uplift of the shoreline in tectonically-active areas can have a profound influence on geomorphology changing the entire process dynamics of the coast as the landforms are removed from the influence of the sea. Over decadal timescales it is possible for the landforms to return to their pre-earthquake condition and this paper examines the re-establishment of mixed sand and gravel beaches on the coast of Wellington, New Zealand, subsequent to an uplift event in 1855. Over 60 topographic profiles were surveyed, seven sets of aerial photographs from a 67?year period were mapped and sediment size analyses conducted in order to quantify the nature of beach change following uplift, and associated relative sea level fall. These data were supported by surveys using ground penetrating radar. It is found that uplift raised the gravel beaches out of the swash zone thereby removing them from the littoral zone. Intertidal rocky reefs which occur between each embayment were also uplifted during the same event and completely interrupted the longshore transport system. Continued input of gravel material to the littoral zone allowed beaches to re-establish sequentially along the coast as each embayment was infilled with sediment. This reconnection of the embayments with the longshore drift system is associated with the beach planform being initially drift dominated during infill but then switching to swash alignment once the embayment becomes infilled. This has resulted in shoreline accretion of over 100?m in some places, at rates of up to 4?m/yr, covering shore protection works built in the past few decades. The ability of the shore to adjust back to its pre-uplift condition appears to be a function of the accommodation space created during uplift and the rate of sediment supply.

AB  - This paper provides a glimpse of work being done in a nearly decade-long joint US/Sweden and spacecraft research collaboration exploring rapid spacecraft design based on modular components whose simplicity and composability motivate the exploitation of modern design automation approaches and concepts that have been popularized in consumer and industrial online commerce. Modular systems are engineered to minimize tight couplings between components, with an aim of permitting interchangeability of elements and free composability to form many different possible system designs. Physical wiring often contributes to the complexity, and reducing or eliminating it aids in the objectives of modularity. In this paper, we consider an approach to create modular spacecraft, with a particular emphasis on cube satellites having a 6U form factor, based on a composition of "nearly wireless" elements. Since efficient power delivery remains problematic, our scheme permits the introduction of two terminals (analogous to residential wall outlets) for the sole purpose of power access. All other functions are delivered through a wireless network self organized based on a given collection of components necessary to form a particular spacecraft design. Panel structures can be prewired for power-only distribution, eliminating the need for custom wiring harnesses. In the proposed 6U Cubesat concept, a primary flat surface (similar to 200mm x 300mm) substrate is the basis of a "dinner tray" convention. Modules are added to the pegboard-like "dinner tray" by plugging them in topside, forming a single unified planar interface for electrical, mechanical, and thermal integration. Electrical power blocks energize the substrate, processor modules provide wireless connection access points, and all other modules extract power from the strategically distributed contact points throughout the substrate. Once powered, these modules are networked through a "join and discovery" mechanism which provides a dynamically extensible application programming interface (API) expressed in the form of electronic data sheets. A sophisticated middleware layer (running on the same processing modules that provide the wireless "hotspots") matches applications using a "brokerage" publish and subscribe mechanism. When the dependencies of each application is satisfied through the existence of suitable modules, the application is activated. The entire application suite is a hierarchy implemented as a direct acyclic graph (DAG) of these dependencies that when satisfied form a viable system (in this case a spacecraft) design. The implications of the method are profound in that it is possible to rapidly develop an virtually infinite variety of system designs given a sufficiently large collection of building block hardware and software applications. This paper describes a pushbutton toolflow (PBTF) motivated by concepts electronic design automation, only they are now extended to encompass satellite (or other system) designs. This pushbutton toolflow involves a configurator concept through which the user could negotiate (with relatively simple wizard like dialogs) a variety of viable spacecraft designs. The tool would access a multi-vendor "electronic store", where prebuilt components and applications are marshaled into DAGs corresponding to buildable systems. The approach is analogous to a shopping cart metaphor, in which system cost and delivery times can be tracked based on the collection of dependencies formed by the selection of particular components need to satisfy design constraints. Documentation, including bill of materials, data sheets, and a full work breakdown structure can be produced as a byproduct. The toolflow itself could be extended to encompass automatic program generation and three-dimensional printing approaches to permit automated, customizable software and hardware generation (respectively), to complement the catalog of available components. The toolflow has other profound impacts, such as the ability to publish "recipes" (i.e., useful system representations) for use by other users, the ability to automatically coordinate communications (through a "space dialtone" concept) between orbiting platforms in ground station networks, and techniques that arrange for the construction and launch of these configurator produced spacecraft design by cooperating third-party networks.

AB  - The Burdekin Delta (BD) is located on the dry-tropical coastal strip in North Queensland, Australia. It is one of Australia's premier sugar producing districts with approximately 40,000 ha of land under sugarcane. Because the BD borders the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), industry, community, regulatory, and environmental organisations are interested in ascertaining the magnitude of deep drainage and nitrate leaching from the root zone and potential implications for the GBRWHA. Direct measurement of deep drainage and nitrate leaching is difficult, and modelling is likely to play an ever-increasing role in guiding experimental work and decision-making. Here, we describe the collection of drainage and nitrate-leaching related data collected over two cropping seasons at a specific field site within the BD and its use in the calibration and application of a drainage and nitrate-leaching model created within the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework with constituent crop-growth, soil-water, and nitrogen transformation modules (Sugar, APSIM-SWIM, Soiln2). Model application indicated that the simulated amount of drainage and nitrate leached over a cropping season compared favourably to that derived from inferred drainage and observed soil-water nitrate concentrations. Subsequent investigation of fertilizer management options using the model identified the timing and amount of both irrigation and fertilizer application as key parameters over which management control might be exploited to minimise deep drainage and flux of nitrate to groundwater.

AB  - Studies addressing the role of large herbivores on nitrogen cycling in grasslands have suggested that the direction of effects depends on soil fertility. Via selection for high quality plant species and input of dung and urine, large herbivores have been shown to speed up nitrogen cycling in fertile grassland soils while slowing down nitrogen cycling in unfertile soils. However, recent studies show that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in some temperate fertile soils, but not in others. To explain this, we hypothesize that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in loamy or clay soils through soil compaction, but not in sandy soils. Especially under wet conditions, strong compaction in clay soils can lead to periods of soil anoxia, which reduces decomposition of soil organic matter and, hence, N mineralization. In this study, we use a long-term (37-year) field experiment on a salt marsh to investigate the hypothesis that the effect of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization depends on soil texture. Our results confirm that the presence of large herbivores decreased nitrogen mineralization rate in a clay soil, but not in a sandy soil. By comparing a hand-mown treatment with a herbivore-grazed treatment, we show that these differences can be attributed to herbivore-induced changes in soil physical properties rather than to above-ground biomass removal. On clay soil, we find that large herbivores increase the soil water-filled porosity, induce more negative soil redox potentials, reduce soil macrofauna abundance, and reduce decomposition activity. On sandy soil, we observe no changes in these variables in response to grazing. We conclude that effects of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization cannot be understood without taking soil texture, soil moisture, and feedbacks through soil macrofauna into account.

AB  - Brunina, L., Rivza P. and Konstantinova, E., 2011. Coastal Spatial Planning Problems in Latvia. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1224 - 2337. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 This paper analyses coastal erosion prevention measures carried out in Latvia. The foreseen global climate change impacts and the ever growing human load on the coastal areas along with the lack of erosion policy is bring up serious concern about safety and sustainability of Latvian coastline. Although no national policy regarding coastal erosion prevention is applied in Latvia, some coastal protection measures are applied by local municipalities and private landowners. There are in total around 34 coast protection structures on the coastline of Latvia. The protected area doesn't exceed 2 km in total. Most of the coastal defences are based on natural materials like greenery, stones and timber. There is no preliminary estimation of primary needs and mandatory funding for maintenance costs. The alternate criteria for economically based solution should be defined for long term period. Therefore principles of sustainable development require the using of economically based solution and criteria which shall be established in national level. The main task is the assignment of coefficients for appropriate economical appraisal due to investments of existing infrastructure and recreation zones. The general conclusion is that, despite many of the different laws and planning documents, especially the guidelines and management plans; any of coastal planning activities must be approved by governmental budget and should take into account the principles of economically based solutions.

AB  - The Amazon tree boa Corallus hortulanus is known for featuring a wide variation in color pattern and design markings. Although there are studies on its polychromatism, none of them addresses the geographic variation in the color pattern of this species. The aim of this study was to describe the chromatic variation found in the populations of C. hortulanus from the southern Amazon Basin and its relationship with geographic distribution of the species. Analysis of both design markings and color patterns on 112 C. hortulanus specimens from the southern Amazon Basin interfluves resulted in the identification of six distinct morphotypes. Grayish-brown coloration and elongated diamond-shaped patterns were the most frequent patterns. Two morphotypes showed a tendency of correlation with the geographical distribution of those species found in Madeira and Jurua Rivers. The small sample size does not allow for a robust conclusion on the possible cause of geographic variation. The distribution of morphological patterns of C. hortullanus in the Amazon Basin suggest that there is gene flow between populations, regardless of geographical distance and natural barriers. The variation in color pattern and markings may represent a phenotypic response to the characteristics of different habitats occupied by the species.

AB  - Tropical freshwater swamps provide essential ecosystem services, such as flood mitigation and control. Land use changes cause alterations in their hydrology, increasing risks of degradation caused by extreme events like storms and hurricanes. We evaluated the effectiveness of different strategies to control opportunistic herbaceous vegetation, as a factor limiting the establishment of the dominant money tree Pachira aquatica for the restoration of swamps in the coastal floodplains of the Gulf coast in Mexico. Pachira aquatica saplings were planted in four treatments: (1) Control (saplings without further intervention), (2) Cut (herbaceous vegetation removal), (3) cutting with Vegetation mulch, and (4) cutting with Plastic cover. The effect of treatments on survival and relative growth rate (RGR) of P. aquatica saplings and on the herbaceous cover was measured after 2 years. Costs per treatment were also calculated. Saplings in the Control had the lowest survival (5.0%; only one seedling survived), followed by Cut (35.0 +/- 12.75%), Vegetation mulch (70.0 +/- 9.35%), and Plastic cover (95.0 +/- 5.0%). Sapling height and RGR were similar among treatments. The herbaceous layer cover was reduced to similar to 30% in Vegetation mulch and Plastic cover in comparison to Control and Cut treatments with similar to 94%. The most cost-effective treatment was Vegetation mulch, with almost half the cost of Plastic cover. Our results support the establishment of restoration plantings with P. aquatica to assist the recovery of swamps and highlight the need to include complementary interventions, to ensure higher tree sapling survival and to avoid total restoration failure in this system.

AB  - Coastal erosion has long been associated with longshore transport or litteral drift generated by storm waves. At the same time, swell waves have been perceived to have benefiting effects in preserving our beaches. This may not always be the case. Field observations along the southern coastline of England have shown that shingle beaches can suffer large losses of beach material under the action of swell waves. A model study has been carried out to examine the response of a shingle beach to swells of various periods and heights. It will be shown that the onshore or offshore movement of beach material is strongly associated with both the wave period and height. Under certain conditions, swell waves can cause severe damage to the beach by removing the beach crest material and transporting it offshore into deep water where the material becomes irretrievable. The findings of this study suggest that while swells of small amplitude help to maintain the beach material, swell of sufficient heights can cause both short and long term losses of beach material, resulting erosions of beaches. This has significant implications in establishing good coastal protection schemes where needed.

AB  - The papers in this Special Feature are the result of the first Marsh Resilience Summit in the Chesapeake Bay region, which occurred in February 2019. The Chesapeake Bay region has one of the highest rates of relative sea level rise in the U.S., jeopardizing over 1000 km(2) of tidal wetlands along with other coastal lands. The goal of the Summit and this collection of articles is to analyze tidal wetland response to accelerating sea level rise and the effect their response will have on adaptation planning for surrounding communities. Ten Summit presenters share their research in this Special Feature. In this Introduction, we summarize their findings on evaluating restoration potential at the site-specific level, measuring and projecting marsh migration and erosions rates, describing impacts of wetland migration on a marsh dependent animal, effects on human communities, and finally the roles of property owners and government on future tidal wetland extent. These contributions demonstrate that tidal marsh distribution is dynamic in response to sea level rise, and that social, legal, and policy tools can be used and further developed to enable opportunities for restoring or conserving wetlands when stakeholders are engaged effectively. The papers here and feedback from Summit participants illuminate diverse priorities, research unknowns, and next steps for land use planning toward resilience of the Chesapeake Bay region that also can inform global communities.

AB  - Climate change and combining related parameters of environmental hazards have left a considerable challenge in assessing social-ecological vulnerability. Here we integrated a fuzzy-based approach in the vulnerability assessment of mangrove social-ecological systems combining environmental parameters, socio-economic, and vegetative components from exposure dimensions, sensitivity and adaptive capacity along the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman for the first time. This study aims to provide critical information for habitat-scale management strategies and adaptation plans by assessing the vulnerability of mangrove social-ecological systems. This study provides a methodology framework that consists of five steps. Step 1: We com-bined the fuzzy weighted maps of seven environmental hazards, including tidal range, maximum wind speeds, drought magnitude, maximum temperatures, extreme storm surge, sea-level rise, significant wave height, and social vulnerability. This map combination determined that the computed exposure index is from 1.07 to 4.32 across the study areas, with an increasing trend from the coasts of the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. Step 2: We integrated the fuzzy weighted maps of four sensitivity variables, including area change, health change, seaward edge retreat, and production potential change. The findings show that the sensitivity index is from 1.40 to 2.64 across the study areas, increasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 3: Besides, we combined the fuzzy weighted maps of three adaptive capacity variables, including the availability of migration areas, recruitment, and local communities' participation in restoration projects and education pro-grams. The result showed that the index value across the study areas varies between 0.087 and 2.38, decreasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 4: Implementing fuzzy hierarchical analysis process to determine the relative weight of variables corresponding to exposure, sensitivity and adaptive ca-pacity. Step 5: The integration of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and the vulnerability index maps in the study areas showed variation from 0.25 to 5.92, with the vulnerability of mangroves from the west coast of the Persian Gulf (Nayband) decreasing towards Khamir, then increasing to the eastern coasts of the Gulf of Oman (Jask and Gwadar). Overall, the results indicate the importance of the proposed approach to the vulnerability of mangroves at the habitat scale along a coastal area and across environmental gradients of climatic, maritime and socio-economic variables. This study validated the findings based on the ground truth measurements, and high -resolution satellite data incorporated the Consistency Rate (CR) in the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The overall accuracy of all classified remote sensing images and maps consistently exceeded 90%, and the CR of the 25 completed questionnaires was <0.1. Finally, this study indicates differences in vulnerability of various habitats, leading to focus conservation completion and rehabilitation and climate change adaptation planning to support the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-13 implementation.

AB  - By tracking and monitoring the profile configuration, topography, and hydrodynamic factors of an artificial cobble beach in Tianquan Bay, Xiamen, China over three consecutive years after its completion, we analyzed the evolution of its profile configuration and plane morphology, and its storm response characteristics. The evolution of the profile configuration of the artificial cobble beach in Tianquan Bay can be divided into four stages. The beach was unstable during the initial stage after the beach nourishment the profile configuration changed obviously, and an upper concave composite cobble beach formed gradually, which was characterized by a steep upper part and a gentle lower part. In the second stage, the cobble beach approached dynamic equilibrium with minor changes in the profile configuration. At the third stage the beach was in a high-energy state under the influence of Typhoon Meranti, and the response of the artificial cobble beach differed significantly from that of the low-tide terrace sandy beach. Within a short time, there was net onshore transport of cobbles in the cross-shore direction. The beach face was eroded, the beach berm was accumulated, and the slope of the beach was steepened considerably. In the alongshore direction, there was notable transport of cobbles on the beach from east to west along the shore, and the total volume of the beach decreased by 4.5x10(3) m(3), which accounted for 50% of the total amount of beach volume lost within three years. The fourth stage was the restoration stage after the typhoon, characterized by a little gentler profile slope and the increase in width and the decrease in height of beach berm. Because of the action of waves and the wave-driven longshore current caused by the specific terrain and landform conditions along the coast (e.g., coastal headlands, near-shore artificial structures, and reefs), the coastline of the artificial cobble beach gradually evolved from being essentially parallel to the artificial coast upon completion to a slightly curved parabolic shape, and three distinct erosion hotspots were formed on the west side of the cape and the artificial drainpipe, and the reefs. Generally, the adoption of cobbles for beach nourishment on this macro-tidal coast beach with severe erosion has yielded excellent stability and adaptability.

AB  - Shoreline armoring, which involves the installation of hardened structures to protect coastal property, dramatically alters shoreline composition and resulting ecological functions. Accelerating hazard threats to growing coastal communities compounds this problem, creating demand for more armoring. We examine whether designation by the U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) - enacted to disincentivize urban development on hazardous coastal barriers - is associated with lower propensities to armor shorelines. In designated areas, CBRA removes access to federally-subsidized flood insurance, infrastructure subsidies, and disaster assistance. Using logistic regression modeling, we examine armoring at the parcel scale across the State of Florida (USA), controlling for CBRA designation, land use, and local population density. Our findings reveal a significant negative relationship between CBRA designation and the odds of armoring, particularly for residential and vacant properties. As coastal areas grapple with increasing impacts from coastal hazards, removal of public subsidies may be an effective non-regulatory method for maintaining the ecological and protective benefits of natural shorelines.

AB  - The ability of wetlands to accrete organic matter in response to rising sea level is a key to landscape resilience, especially in light of reduced sediment availability consequent to dam construction and channelization. This study examined the degradation of cattail (Typha spp.) and tule (Schoenoplectus acutus) litters in restored wetlands through the lens of lignin, a major structural biopolymer in vascular plants with degradation characteristics very sensitive to oxic versus anoxic conditions. A series of litterbags were deployed during the first 10 years after flooding of Deep (55 cm) and Shallow (25 cm) restored wetlands. As emergent marsh vegetation spread through the maturing wetlands, anoxic conditions were more prevalent and overall degradation rates of litter in litterbags were lower. In later experiments in the maturing wetlands, lignin was progressively enriched in litter as evidenced by carbon-normalized yields (?(8)) that increased in tule starting materials from 6.3 to 7.1 mg 100 mgOC(-1) to as high as 9.9 mg 100 mgOC(-1), and in cattail starting materials from 5.9 to 7.0 mg 100 mgOC(-1) to as high as 10.9 mg 100 mgOC(-1). However, in an experiment initiated soon after the restored wetlands were constructed, ?(8) in tule litter decreased from 6.8 to 3.6 mg 100 mgOC(-1), highlighting the prevalence of initial oxic conditions. With the exception of the early oxic conditions for tule, there was an overall trend of decreasing lignin acid-to-aldehyde ratios with litter degradation, which runs counter to most studies in the literature. We hypothesize that this reflects the utilization of more oxygen-rich lignin components as electron acceptors in redox reactions. No consistent differences were observed in degradation patterns between the Shallow and Deep wetlands. There were distinct differences in lignin degradation in cattail (more resistant) versus tule (less resistant), which indicates that although anoxia may be the dominant control on organic matter accretion in wetlands, specific types of vegetation in restored or constructed wetlands affects organic matter preservation, and hence accretion. Thus, selective management of predominant species in wetlands may prove important for the ability of wetlands to maintain emergent vegetation during sea level rise and to preserve the overall stability of wetland soils.

AB  - Coastal marshes depend on belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes to contribute to peat and soil organic carbon, accrete soil and alleviate flooding as sea level rises. For nutrient-limited plants, eutrophication has either reduced or stimulated belowground biomass depending on plant biomass allocation response to fertilization. Within a freshwater wetland impoundment receiving minimal sediments, we used experimental plots to explore growth models for a common freshwater macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus. We used N-addition and control plots (4 each) to test whether remotely sensed vegetation indices could predict leaf N concentration, root: shoot ratios and belowground biomass of S. acutus. Following 5 months of summer growth, we harvested whole plants, measured leaf N and total plant biomass of all above and belowground vegetation. Prior to harvest, we simulated measurement of plant spectral reflectance over 164 hyperspectral Hyperion satellite bands (350-2500 nm) with a portable spectroradiometer. N-addition did not alter whole plant, but reduced belowground biomass 36% and increased aboveground biomass 71%. We correlated leaf N concentration with known N-related spectral regions using all possible normalized difference (ND), simple band ratio (SR) and first order derivative ND (FDN) and SR (FDS) vegetation indices. FDN1235, (549) was most strongly correlated with leaf N concentration and also was related to belowground biomass, the first demonstration of spectral indices and belowground biomass relationships. While S. acutus exhibited balanced growth (reduced root: shoot ratio with respect to nutrient addition), our methods also might relate N-enrichment to biomass point estimates for plants with isometric root growth. For isometric growth, foliar N indices will scale equivalently with above and belowground biomass. Leaf N vegetation indices should aid in scaling-up field estimates of biomass and assist regional monitoring.

AB  - The Lanphere Dunes, part of the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge, has been the focus of foredune restoration efforts since the 1980s. Efforts have centred around removal of an invasive European beach grass species, Ammophila arenaria, introduced in the early 1900s to stabilize the dunes to protect landward communities from coastal flooding and storm surges. Despite effectively stabilizing the foredune, A. arenaria forms monotypic vegetation stands, with highly dense roots, rhizomes, and above-ground biomass that can lead to pronounced scarping of the seaward slope, alongshore steering of wind and sediment, a lack of landward transfer of sand, and a steeper, more peaked profile. Effective foredune restoration must consider the coupled interactions between dominant plant type and the geomorphic processes that influence dune form. A 5 ha reach of recently restored foredune was monitored biannually with terrestrial laser scanner and uncrewed aerial systems platforms between 2015 and 2021 to characterize the impacts of dynamic restoration on foredune form and resiliency. This reach included two control plots: (1) native, non-restored and (2) invasive, and three restored plots revegetated with native species: (3) a native grass (Elymus mollis), (4) a low-lying herb and subshrub assemblage, and (5) a mixture of the native grass, herbs, and subshrubs. After five growing seasons, restored plots exhibited distinct geomorphic and sediment budget differences. Natively vegetated plots recovered from extensive scarping 2 years faster than the invasive plot. Restored plots saw foredune height (0.5-0.7 m) and width increase, landward extension (1 m) while maintaining a similar seaward position, and positive lee-slope sediment budgets that exceeded both control plots (up to 0.015 m(3) m(-2) month(-1)). These results suggest that the native vegetation plots allowed increased landward sand transport across the foredune, and increased the capacity of the foredune to recover more quickly following dune scarping.

AB  - Mangroves are ecosystems located in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and are vital for coastal protection. Their unique characteristics make them hotspots for carbon cycling and biological diversity. Studies on isolated filamentous fungi and environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence sediments offer new understandings on how to preserve mangroves. Here we report on the filamentous fungi isolated from four mangroves. We correlated fungal community composition with sediment texture, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentration (oil pollution), pH, salinity, organic matter, total and thermotolerant coliforms (sewage pollution). In total we identified 34 genera and 97 species. The most polluted sites had highest species richness whereas the best preserved site showed the lowest species richness. Oil spill and sewage pollution were identified as the drivers of fungal community composition in the most polluted sites. We found very distinct fungal communities with no > 5 species shared between any two mangrove sites.

AB  - In coastal Louisiana, large sediment diversions from the Mississippi and Alchafalaya Rivers have been planned to enhance marsh accretion and productivity and reverse an overall deterioration of coastal marshes. Located between these rivers, there are extensive buoyant marshes in the freshwater and oligohaline zones (about 70% of the vegetated area), and little information exists on how buoyant substrates respond to mineral sediment introduction. The purpose of this study was to understand the vertical movement (buoyancy) and substrate properties of oligohaline marshes with increasing distance from the Atchafalaya River-Fourleague Bay system, a significant mineral sediment source. To do this thirty-seven stations were established (within a study area of 125 km(2)) where vertical marsh movement and marsh hydrology were monitored for a year, and soil cores were collected and analyzed for bulk properties. With increasing distance inland from the sediment source, there were significant increases in vertical movement of the marsh mat and decreasing mineral sediment content in the soil profile. In the interior marshes farthest from the sediment source, the average mat movement was greater than 15 cm, and some sites exceeded 25 cm. Non-buoyant marshes with high substrate bulk density were located closest to the sediment source. Mineral sediment deposition appeared to be a discontinuous process controlled by large events such as hurricanes and tropical storms, rather than average yearly flood events. A comparison of our data (from oligohaline marshes) with other studies (from freshwater marshes) suggests that increases of mineral matter within the upper peat matrix may decrease the vertical movement of marsh substrates.

AB  - Habitats composed of living 'ecosystem engineers', such as mussels, are subject to direct and indirect interactions with organisms that live among them. These interactions may affect the presence and structure of habitat, and hence, the associated taxa. We examined the direct effects of epibiotic algae on the Survival, biomass and recruitment of mussels (Mytilits L.) on the west coast of Ireland. A field experiment showed that the presence of epibiotic fucoid algae reduced the likelihood of survival of mussels during storms. We also found that the strength of attachment of mussels did not increase in the presence of epibionts. Another in situ experiment revealed that the presence of ephemeral epibiotic algal mats had no effect on the biomass of host mussels, suggesting no effect on mussel growth or production. The abundance of small mussels (< 5 mm) covaried with cover of epibiotic algae at one location, but experimental results suggest no direct effect of the algae on recruitment unless through the action of chemical cues which linger after the removal of algae. We have identified a negative direct interaction between epibiotic algae and mussels on exposed rocky shores, which may often be characterised by bottom-up regulation. It is thought that positive interactions may be more important on more sheltered or sedimentary shores where top-down processes are more likely to dominate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the most destructive tropical cyclones ever to strike the U.S., Hurricane Katrina made landfall along the Mississippi coast on 29th August 2005. The Mississippi-Alabama (MS-AL) barrier islands were subjected to storm breaching, area reduction, and vegetation loss caused by a number of parameters including salt spray, saltwater flooding, mechanical damage (e.g., ablation of bark from tree trunks), removal of plants and their soil substrate by scouring, burial under sand, and a 10-month, post-storm period of low rainfall. Repeated acquisitions of remotely-sensed data served as an essential tool in quantifying vegetated and total land area before and after the storm, and post-storm ecological community type and topographic elevation. Vegetated land area continued to decline on some islands in the first year following the storm. However, by November 2007, only 2.2 years after the storm, total vegetated land area had recovered to 72, 96, 77, 93, and 82%, and total subaerial land area to 97, 94, 33, 100, and 104%, of pre-Katrina values on Cat, W. Ship, E. Ship, Horn, and Petit Bois islands by natural re-growth and sediment accretion, respectively. Comparing ecological community-type maps that were developed from field and remotely-sensed data with LiDAR-derived digital elevation models determined that year 2010 ecological community type changed distinctively at the decimeter scale as mean surface elevation ranged from 0.1 m to 1.2 m. Storm-related changes in ecological community type included subtidal to supratidal sand flat, low marsh to wet or dry herbland, and woodland to wet herbland/shrubland. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS), southern Brazil, encompasses Quaternary barrier-lagoon depositional systems developed in response to successive marine transgressions driven by glacial-interglacial cycles. As an attempt to refine he chronostratigraphy of the Pleistocene depositional systems, electron spin resonance (ESR) ages were obtained in 42 disarticulated shells of the marine bivalve Amiantis purpurata preserved in deposits in the southern CPRS, consisting of 35 specimens from five boreholes made during the construction of wind farms, plus another 7 shells from an irrigation channel. The shells were obtained from depths between 5.5 and 14 m, in two chronostratigraphically distinct depositional units (Barrier-Lagoon Systems II and III). Although the ages in each group of samples vary widely, the youngest age from the Barrier II (similar to 247 ka) is consistent with the timing of the transgression of the marine isotope stage (MIS) 7 inferred from other luminescence and ESR ages of sediments and shells. The ages obtained in shells from the Lagoon III deposits located landward of the Barrier III indicate deposition by the sea-level highstand of the substage MIS 5e, despite being older than the estimated age of similar to 120 ka of the latter. The younger shells from the seaward side of the Barrier III dated as of similar to 100 ka indicate deposits formed by the low-amplitude MIS 5c highstand, in agreement with luminescence ages of similar to 109, 104 and 101 ka obtained in outcrops on the shoreline. One shell dated as similar to 87 ka could indicate another highstand during MIS 5a. The presence of shells much older than the depositional systems indicate that marine deposits older than MIS 7 existed in the CPRS but were totally eroded by subsequent transgressions, and that shells can be preserved for periods of about 100-200 kyrs under certain conditions. Moreover, the ages younger than the highstand of MIS 5e on the seaward side of the Barrier III indicate that one (and possibly two) smaller amplitude highstands previously unrecognized in the CPRS left geological and fossil records in the study area.

AB  - Salt marshes are important ecosystems but their resilience to sea-level rise and possible increases in storm intensity is largely uncertain. The current paradigm is that a positive sediment budget supports the survival and accretion of salt marshes while sediment deprivation causes marsh degradation. However, few studies have investigated the combined impact of sea-level rise and increased storm intensity on the sediment budget of a salt marsh. This study investigates marsh resilience under the combined impact of various storm surge (0 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 2.0 m, 3.0 m and 4.0 m) and sea-level (+0 m, +0.3 m, +0.5 m, +0.8 m and +1.0 m) scenarios by using a sediment budget approach and the hydrodynamic model Delft3D. The Ribble Estuary, North-West England, whose salt marshes have been anthropogenically restored and have a high economic and environmental value, has been chosen as test case. We conclude that storm surges can positively contribute to the resilience of the salt marsh and estuarine system by promoting flood dominance and by triggering a net import of sediment. Conversely, sea-level rise can threaten the stability of the marsh by promoting ebb dominance and triggering a net export of sediment. Our results suggest that storm surges have a general tendency to counteract the decrease in sediment budget caused by sea-level rise. The timing of the storm surge relative to high or low tide, the duration of the surge, the change in tidal range and vegetation presence can also cause minor changes in the sediment budget.

AB  - Extreme storms present a major risk to coasts. Increasing populations worldwide, together with sea level rise, exacerbate concerns for coastal settlements, but the low frequency of extreme storms makes an assessment of risk difficult. In southeast Australia, the severest beach retreat on record relates to a series of extratropical cyclones in the 1970s, but the relatively short observational record hinders assessment of how frequent these events are. At Moruya in New South Wales, four decades of beach monitoring has provided new insights into response of beaches to extreme storms. We augment this recorded history with morphostratigraphic analysis of beach ridge evolution by using ground-penetrating radar and optically stimulated luminescence dating. We find an episode of extreme retreat over 550 years, proving that the 1970s extreme event is a recurrent phenomenon. Our high-precision morphostratigraphic analysis provides evidence with which to better plan coastal adaptation.

AB  - The detailed inundation mapping and vulnerability assessment is an essential component of risk reduction and rehabilitation planning in tsunami-prone regions. Integrated spatial analyses through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy logic operation, mainly Fuzzy PRODUCT and Fuzzy GAMMA (0.9), are used to assess tsunami vulnerability and inundation mapping in the Andaman region, which experienced the 2004-Great Indian Ocean Tsunami. The thematic layers of elevation, slope, shoreline distance, and vegetation density are created using SRTM DEM and Landsat-8 OLI (similar to 30 m spatial resolution). The tsunami wave heights are generated from TUNAMI-N2 Model using GEBCO bathymetry data. AHP evaluation process is applied to assign weights to the thematic layers, which are integrated using the weighted sum method. The input weight score of each thematic layer is transformed into a 0 to 1 scale using Fuzzy membership function to derive Fuzzy PRODUCT and Fuzzy GAMMA tsunami vulnerability classes, namely very low, low, medium, high, and very high, depending on correlation with tsunami run-up map. The weighted sum, Fuzzy PRODUCT, and Fuzzy GAMMA methods estimate similar to 1227 (26%), 225 (5%), and 844.33 (18%) km(2) areas as very high vulnerability. The Fuzzy GAMMA method closely compares with the observed-modeled inundation of similar to 14% in the Andaman region. The vulnerability is correlated with the inundation pattern and LULC changes to understand the change in vulnerability from 2004 to 2021. The results are discussed for the robustness of the observation and technique that can be used for tsunami disaster management and land-use planning.

AB  - Subsistence resources are critical for indigenous communities in the Kotzebue Sound region of NW Alaska. Global sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal erosion are likely to create unfavorable and hazardous conditions for coastal and estuarine settlements. It is unclear how SLR and erosion might affect coastal subsistence resources because of highly complex ecological interactions. This study integrates physical, anthropological, and survey data to assess coastal vulnerability and to identify areas of concern for local and regional planning and environmental protection. This study analyzes and integrates historical and projected physical coastal changes within the Kotzebue Sound region with (1) a coastal vulnerability index (CVI); (2) community-based participatory GIS maps of community subsistence resources; and (3) representative surveys of local communities to determine the importance of each type of resource. The results identify Kivalina and Deering as particularly vulnerable coastal locations among four studied villages. While the CVI is high in these locations, low erosion rates will not likely have any negative impact on fish and caribou-two of the most important subsistence resource species for these communities. Because of the higher number of identified subsistence resource species, Deering is more resilient than Kivalina to any potential negative coastal impacts. This methodology can be useful in other coastal areas where subsistence resources play a major part in people's lives.

AB  - Species specific hydrodynamic characterization is essential for assessing the suitability of various types of mangroves in coastal protection as the dissipation of wave energy within the mangroves is governed primarily by various aspects which are specific to the species to which they belong. In the present study a specific mangrove species was selected and its wave attenuation characteristics were studied with the help of scaled physical models under controlled wave and vegetation conditions in a laboratory wave flume. The plant was initially identified as Rhizophora Mucronata and the scaled models prepared had the same biomechanical properties as that of the parent plant. Effect of root soil was incorporated in scaled models as bottom friction. Wave heights were measured after the forest models to evaluate the wave attenuation. It was found that wave heights were following the exponential decay equation of Kobayashi et al. (1993) except for the cases which have incorporated bottom friction. For such cases exponential decay equation was modified by incorporating a new parameter 'd/D-50'. Drag coefficients (C-D), characteristic of the species were also determined without incorporating and with incorporating the effect of bottom friction of root soil. It is seen that drag coefficients are following an inverse relation with non-dimensional numbers (R-e and KC). Empirical relations were developed between C-D and a modified Keulegan Carpenter number (modified considering mangrove root submergence and mean particle size) for predicting the drag coefficients specific to Rhizophora Mucronata species for a variety of wave and water level conditions.

AB  - Coastal wetlands including salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. They are known for improving the quality of coastal water and provisioning coastal fisheries. However, this ecosystem is under potential threat due to urban coastal land reclamation, limited sediment supply, increased nutrient/eutrophication, and sea level rise. Therefore, restoration efforts to protect the degraded salt marsh habitat are considerably increasing worldwide. In this paper, we present an overview of salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. Published scientific literature in English language was collected by searching the most relevant keywords from popular search engines, namely, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Mendeley to get the information about salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. This study comprehensively reviewed data from 78 peer-reviewed papers. Results indicated that much of the salt marsh was restored through assisted abiotic strategies (e.g., recovery of tidal exchange, managed realignment, and sediment level amendment). A total of 214 indicators were found, spanning over six major ecological attributes such as structural diversity, ecosystem functions, physical conditions, species composition, external exchange, and absence of threat. Author keywords analysis revealed several hotspots for recent research (e.g., 16 s rRNA, fungi, microbial communities, carbon accumulation, and blue carbon). This paper proposes a model for restoring degraded salt marsh, as well as tracking their success. The information presented here will assist the marine ecosystem restoration practitioners in getting a comprehensive understanding of salt marsh restoration success evaluation.

AB  - The effective use of ecosystem engineers to conserve biodiversity requires an understanding of the types of resources an engineer modifies, and how these modifications vary with biotic and abiotic context. In the intertidal zone, oysters engineer ecological communities by reducing temperature and desiccation stress, enhancing the availability of hard substrate for attachment, and by ameliorating biological interactions such as competition and predation. Using a field experiment manipulating shading, predator access and availability of shell substrate at four sites distributed over 900km of east Australian coastline, we investigated how the relative importance of these mechanisms of facilitation vary spatially. At all sites, and irrespective of environmental conditions, the provision of hard substrate by oysters enhanced the abundance and richness of invertebrates, in particular epibionts (barnacles and oyster spat) and grazing gastropods. Mobile arthropods utilised the habitat provided by disarticulated dead oysters more than live oyster habitat, whereas the abundance of polychaetes and bivalves were much greater in live oysters, suggesting the oyster filter-feeding activity is important for these groups. In warmer estuaries, shading by oysters had a larger effect on biodiversity, whereas in cooler estuaries, the provision of a predation refuge by oysters played a more important role. Such knowledge of how ecosystem engineering effects vary across environmental gradients can help inform management strategies targeting ecosystem resilience via the amelioration of specific environmental stressors, or conservation of specific community assemblages.

AB  - The water quality deteriorated in the middle of the 1970s in the Albufera lake, a shallow Mediterranean coastal lagoon in the east coast of Spain. In few years, the water changed from an oligotrophic status to hypereutrophic as the lagoon received sewage and agrochemicals, lacking adequate sanitation facilities. For more than 40 years, the lake was used as a wastewater treatment plant given the urban development in the surrounding area. It was not until the early 1990s, 20 years after the hypereutrophic state was reached, when the first sanitation facility protecting the lake was implemented: a perimeter intercepting sewer carrying out the sewage to a waste water treatment plant. This paper describes the different engineering solutions and tools implemented to improve the water quality in the Albufera lagoon. We describe the measures and their effects on the water quality as well as their limits. Those are sanitation solutions as sewers, wastewaters treatment plants, stormwater detention tanks, and nature based solutions as constructed wetlands that have been used in these years. In addition, the role of agricultural activity in the water balance (quantity and quality), the importance of sediments management and the use of water quality models in environmental engineering have been assessed. Evidences of the improvement of environmental quality are the decrease of mean clorophyll a concentration from 800 mu g Chl a l(-1) in 1980s to less than 100 mu g Chl a l(-1) currently observed, the increase of water transparency and the recovery of macrophytes within the lake or the presence of winterbirds which disappeared years ago.

AB  - Ecological engineering approaches have been shown to enhance the abundance and species diversity of intertidal organisms living on urban shoreline infrastructure (i.e., bulkheads and seawalls). Ecological studies have long shown the overarching importance of temperature in driving the physiology and survival of these organisms, yet we often do not fully understand what these temperatures are on engineered surfaces, as they can be very different from air or water temperature. The current study used a heat budget model to estimate surface temperature on bulkheads of different construction materials and surface orientations as a potential factor controlling the abundance and distribution of algal and invertebrate species living on armored shorelines. A Land Surface Model previously adapted for mussel beds was modified to incorporate the physical and thermal properties of three construction materials commonly used in shoreline armoring: concrete, granite and steel. Hourly temperature, tide and solar elevation data for Boston, MA, USA were used to simulate temperatures on a total of twelve model surfaces representing each construction material with north, east, south, and west surface orientations, respectively, over a period of 5 years (2014-2018). A rapid species assessment of intertidal epibiota on bulkheads in Boston Harbor provided baseline data about ecological communities that might be targeted in enhancement efforts, and information on physiological sensitivities of key species was determined from published literature. Comparisons between these sensitivities and exposures estimated from the model showed that simulated surface temperatures can exceed the physiological limits of local species but that this depends on surface orientation and material properties of the structure. Results further highlight the influence of material properties (density, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity) of engineered structures on the incidence and severity of thermal extremes when exposed to direct solar radiation at low tide. Significant differences in the duration and intensity of high temperature values among model surfaces demonstrate that the potential effectiveness of choices in bulkhead construction materials designed to mitigate thermal extremes are likely most effective on south- and west-facing surfaces where incident solar radiation is highest. The ability to predict thermal extremes on existing or planned coastal development projects can improve and further refine ecological enhancement initiatives on shoreline infrastructure. Such collaborations would enable coastal zone managers, shorefront property owners, ecologists, and designers to co-design structures that create physiologically tolerable temperatures as a basis for ecological enhancement.

AB  - The sabellariid worms are important ecosystem engineers in coastal zones, due to their ability to construct sand reefs, modify environments and structure biological communities. This article describes the reproductive biology of Sabellaria wilsoni on a beach of the Amazon coast. Each month between May 2008 and April 2009, specimens were collected for morphometric and histological analyses for sexing and determination of gonadal maturity. In females, the number and diameter of the oocytes at different stages of vitellogenesis were also recorded. The results showed that the species is dioecious, with sexual reproduction, females larger than males, and a female-biased sex ratio (overall, 1.6 female: 1 male). Four distinct stages of gonadal maturation were identified in the males and females - (i) initial development, (ii) maturing, (iii) mature and (iv) spawning. Sexual maturity is attained rapidly, and reproduction is continuous, with two breeding peaks, one in the dry season, related to the increased intensity of hydrodynamic conditions and reef erosion; and the other in the rainy season, when the availability of space and nutrients increases. The reproductive strategy of the species reinforces the classification of the sabellariids as r-strategists, adapted to colonize habitats with unstable environmental conditions.

AB  - Nurse plants modify the environment beneath their canopies to create favourable habitats for propagule recruitment. Nurse plants are potentially valuable tools for ecological restoration-yet empirical tests, particularly in polluted environments, remain rare. The few studies that do exist find that nurse plants positively affect propagule recruitment in polluted environments. Yet most tests have focused on pollution-tolerant species in metal-contaminated environments. Biotic interactions are highly context dependent, however, such that extrapolations to other suites of species and pollutant types appear premature. We examined changes in intraspecific nurse effects across pollution regimes for a pollution-sensitive, macroalgal ecosystem engineer that is a target for intertidal restoration. In a manipulative field experiment, we out-planted propagules in the presence and absence of conspecific canopies at unpolluted control shores and shores that received a partly remediated (low-toxicity) sewage effluent. We then monitored the performance (survival and growth) of these propagules over time. Algal canopies facilitated the survival and early growth of propagules at control sites, but not at partially remediated sites where propagules performed poorly irrespective of canopy presence. Synthesis and applications. Using a pollution-sensitive, macroalgal ecosystem engineer, we show for the first time that nurse-plant effects can be contingent on pollution regime, and that exposure to pollution (even at low levels) can erode nurse effects. We caution that nurse plants are unlikely to be universal tools for ecological restoration, including systems where facilitative nurse effects naturally occur (in our case, macroalgal canopies on unpolluted rocky reefs). Management practitioners should carefully consider the disturbance (e.g. pollution) tolerance of target species, and test whether nurse effects are maintained under current disturbance regimes, before large-scale translocations are attempted.

AB  - Wetlands in the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP) have been suffering from a high rate of land loss. Sediment cores have been drilled into the wetlands to understand their growth and degradation and to provide subsurface information for the coastal protection and restoration projects. However, few three-dimensional (3D) stratigraphy models have been developed for the wetlands on a regional scale, due to difficulties in correlating large amount of spatial scattered subsurface data and integrated visualization of stratigraphic features and topobathymetric features. In this study, a 3D model was constructed in the Lower Barataria Bay (LBB) and the Lower Breton Sound (LBS), covering an area of 190km(2) and extending from 0.5 to -4m in elevation. Sediment composition (sand%, silt%, and clay%) was spatially interpolated, using a compositional kriging method, extended from ordinary kriging by a log-ratio transformation. Instead of visualizing three composition components independently, sediment composition was translated into sediment texture to be visualized as sediment types. Modeling results intuitively show spatial distribution of stratigraphic features and their spatial relationships with topobathymetric features such as marsh surface, river channel, and dredging channels. Results show a silty depositional package, which consists of crevasse splays and periodic overbank flooding deposits, made up the largest portion of the wetlands. A clayey blanket is observed to cover most part of the LBB and landward side of the LBS. A large area of clayey blanket in the seaward part of the LBS has apparently been eroded away, which is likely caused by coastal reworking processes.

AB  - Storm surges from tropical and extratropical storms frequently impact coastal communities globally. While the potential of natural and nature-based features for coastal defenses has gained increased attention as a viable option for coastal flood protection, the lack of in situ measurements of storm surge attenuation has delayed their widespread utilization. We present the findings of a 3-yr water level monitoring campaign that resulted in a large collection (52 flood events) of attenuation rates from marsh transects located in two natural preserves in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region. Results show that the overall marsh attenuated water levels, exhibiting values up to 0.02 cm/m at Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge (ES) and 0.03 cm/m at Magothy Bay Natural Preserve (MGB). In general, the greatest attenuation rates were observed at the marsh edge section. The reach close to the coastline revealed an amplification of the water level followed by water level attenuation toward the backside of the marsh. However, analyses of five major storms at ES demonstrated that, within each event, the ability of the upper marsh to attenuate water level decreased with higher inundation heights. Additionally, small spatial scales of the marsh platform, geomorphological features such as channels, elevated surrounding forests and levees seem to play a major role in reducing the attenuation rates provided by the marshes. These results indicate that, while this type of marshland would provide storm surge attenuation during low inundation heights, these ecosystems would be less effective attenuating higher water depths from extreme events.

AB  - The Humber Estuary Shoreline Management Plan provides a long-term strategy for investment in sustainable defences to reduce the risk to people and property from flooding in part of Eastern England. In addition to the estuary's economic importance with its ports, industry and the third of a million people living oil its floodplain, the Humber is of outstanding value for wildlife and its historic environment. The plan has to meet the needs of these activities and take account of rising sea level. It is based on extensive technical studies and modelling. The realignment of some embankments is being examined so that the creation of intertidal habitat will offset losses from coastal squeeze, increase the stability for some lengths of embankment and reduce extreme high flood levels in the tidal rivers. The 80 ha Paull Holme Strays managed realignment wetland was completed in the summer of 2003 and work is in progress oil another at Alkborough. Other such realignment will be developed as part of the implementation of the long term strategy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal fens like the nature reserve "Hutelmoor und Heiligensee" (north-eastern Germany) are important landscape elements along the southern Baltic coast, which exchange fresh water and brackish water with the Baltic Sea. These exchange processes can be understood as experiments with a natural tracer, which may be used to investigate the hydrologic behaviour of these fen systems. With the establishment of coastal protection measures such as dunes and dikes, the installation of surface drainage and, more recently, also nature conservation measures, the hydrologic regime of these coastal wetlands has constantly altered over the last centuries.The rehabilitated wetland "Hutelnnoor und Heiligensee" is suitable for an analysis of hydrologic change as it has been monitored over the time period since nature conservation measures started in the 1990s. Collected data sets included observation of groundwater levels and electrical conductivities, weather data as well as discharge at the outlet of the drainage catchment. In this article, as a second part of the dual publication, processes and quantified process magnitudes have been identified that govern the salt balance of the study area including its variability in space and time. It was detected that - over the period of rehabilitation - salt water entered the catchment with an episodic storm surge by wave overtopping of dunes in 1995. The intruded brackish water was then diluted, which was a slow process extending over decades. It was governed by local groundwater recharge from precipitation and the inflow of relatively fresh groundwater from the hinterland. It is concluded that salt inputs from the Baltic Sea provide a natural tracer of hydrological processes, which can be readily monitored via electrical conductivity measurements.

AB  - The capacity of coastal wetlands to stabilize shorelines and reduce erosion is a critical ecosystem service, and it is uncertain how changes in dominant vegetation may affect coastal protection. As part of a long-term study (2012-present) comparing ecosystem functions of marsh and black mangrove vegetation, we have experimentally maintained marsh and black mangrove patches (3 m x 3 m) along a plot-level (24 m x 42 m) gradient of marsh and mangrove cover in coastal wetlands near Port Aransas, TX. In August 2017, this experiment was directly in the path of Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 storm. This extreme disturbance event provided an opportunity to quantify differences in resistance between mangrove and marsh vegetation and to assess which vegetation type provided better shoreline protection against storm-driven erosion. We compared changes in plant cover, shoreline erosion, and accreted soil depth to values measured prior to storm landfall. Relative mangrove cover decreased 25-40% after the storm, regardless of initial cover, largely due to damage on taller mangroves (> 2.5 m height) that were not fully inundated by storm surge and were therefore exposed to strong winds. Evidence of regrowth on damaged mangrove branches was apparent within 2 months of landfall. Hurricane-induced decreases in mangrove cover were partially ameliorated by the presence of neighboring mangroves, particularly closer to the shoreline. Marsh plants were generally resistant to hurricane effects. Shoreline erosion exceeded 5 m where mangroves were absent (100% marsh cover) but was relatively modest (< 0.5 m) in plots with mangroves present (11-100% mangrove cover). Storm-driven accreted soil depth was variable but more than 2x higher in marsh patches than in mangrove patches. In general, mangroves provided shoreline protection from erosion but were also more damaged by wind and surge, which may reduce their shoreline protection capacity over longer time scales.
