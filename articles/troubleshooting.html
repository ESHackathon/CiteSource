and This paper presents data on the incidental catch of sea turtles in both the Brazilian exclusive economic zone and adjacent international waters (both areas are located mainly in the south-western Atlantic) by Brazilian commercial pelagic longliners targeting swordfish, tuna and sharks. Data were obtained by on-board observers for 311 trips carried out in 2001–2005, totalling 7385 sets and 11,348,069 hooks. A total of 1386 sea turtles were incidentally captured in the five years (some of them were considered dead at capture): 789 loggerheads ( and Caretta caretta and ), 341 leatherbacks ( and Dermochelys coriacea and ), 45 green turtles ( and Chelonia mydas and ), 81 olive ridleys ( and Lepidochelys olivacea and ) and 130 of unknown species. Taking into account the distribution of the fishing effort in the study area and the incidental catch of sea turtles, four regions were highlighted for the analyses: Zone 1 is located off the northern Brazilian coast; Zone 2 is located off the central Brazilian coast; Zone 3 is the region off the southern Brazilian coast; and Zone 4, located in the open sea almost totally within international waters, is the region around a chain of undersea mountains known as the Rio Grande Rise (Elevação do Rio Grande). There is no information on the origin (nesting areas) of the captured olive ridleys, but there is some evidence, obtained through genetic and demographic analyses, that loggerheads, leatherbacks and green turtles inhabiting the open ocean around Brazil originate from nesting areas in several countries. Together with the fact that the south-western Atlantic is fished by longliners again from several countries, this places the conservation of sea turtles in that part of the ocean in an international context. Some conservation actions carried out by Brazil concerning the interaction between pelagic longlines and sea turtles in the study area are described.","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14 and Oceanic juvenile loggerhead sea turtles, and Caretta caretta and , foraging in Azorean waters, are incidentally caught in drifting longlines that target swordfish, and Xiphias gladius and , and blue shark, and Prionace glauca and . Data were recorded during a longline gear modification experiment conducted in 2000. The results show that the captures are not uniformly distributed in relation to fishing effort, with 81% of the loggerheads (N = 232) caught in one-third of the sets (N = 93). The highest turtle catch rates were around the eastern group of islands, an area characterized by the presence of mesoscale eddies induced by bathymetric features. High catch rates coincided with the presence of the thermohaline front, between August and October, and when targeting blue shark. To investigate the causes of these differences we fitted a general linear model to evaluate the influence of mean depth, minimum depth, sea surface temperature (SST), soak area, soak time, moon phase and wind force on turtle and target species catch rates. These results revealed that mean depth and SST were most important for loggerhead catch rates, while minimum depth was the only significant variable for swordfish and mean depth, SST, wind force, moon phase and soak time influenced blue shark catches. The distribution of loggerhead sea turtles can be predicted by monitoring fishing areas in relation to bathymetry and SST. The impact of longline fishing could be greatly and quickly reduced by regulating the blue shark fishery and by increasing fishermen awareness for sea turtle conservation.","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14 and Heterodontus portusjacksoni and was obtained from the catches of commercial trawl, gillnet and longline fisheries operating in south-western Australian waters, in which this shark is an abundant bycatch species. Ninety per cent of the and H. portusjacksoni and caught by commercial trawling in a marine embayment were &lt;400 mm in total length, whereas 99 and 100%, respectively, of the individuals taken by commercial gillnet and longline outside that embayment were &gt;400 mm. Although the differences between the size compositions in the catches obtained by trawling vs both gillnetting and longlining, which were similar, are partly attributable to gear selectivity, they also reflect a use by juvenile and H. portusjacksoni and of protected nearshore waters as nursery areas and a tendency for larger juveniles and adults to occupy reef/rock habitats in a range of water depths. The fact that all but one of the numerous and H. portusjacksoni and &gt;800 mm were females is reflected in the ratio of females to males differing significantly from parity in the gillnet and longline samples. Yolked oocytes usually take one year to develop to ovulatory size. Ovulation occurs in late winter to early summer and hatching takes place a year later when the embryo is 180–220 mm. The claspers of males commence rapid growth at a total length of ~450 mm, coincident with the onset of clasper calcification and gonadal maturation. The rate of clasper growth relative to total length reached a maximum at ~570 mm and then declined precipitously as the claspers approached full calcification. Based on gonadal criteria, the and L and 50 and at maturity for females (805 mm) was nearly 40% greater than that for males (593 mm). Values of the deviance information criterion and marked overlap in their 95% confidence intervals demonstrate that the and L and 50 and of 581 mm derived for males using full clasper calcification as the index of maturity was equally valid as the above and L and 50 and derived for males at maturity using gonadal criteria. The capture of substantial numbers of juveniles by trawling and of females &lt; and L and 50 and at maturity by gillnetting and longlining may be having localized effects on the population structure of and H. portusjacksoni and in south-western Australian waters.","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14 and Chondrichthyans are usually caught incidentally in fisheries for species of high commercial value and then discarded on board or landed as by-products. On the coast of Chubut province and adjacent waters (43°00′S–44°56′S) a bottom trawl fishery has developed targeted at the Patagonian shrimp ( and Pleoticus muelleri and ) and common hake ( and Merluccius hubbsi and ). Since 2005, this fishery has been monitored by the On-board Observers Program of Chubut province (POBCh). With the aim of advancing towards an ecosystem approach, POBCh not only collects information about target species but also about all the species caught by the trawl nets of the province fisheries. From the information collected by this programme it was possible to identify and record the chondrichthyan species vulnerable to the fishing gear used by the coastal fleet that operates from Puerto Rawson. The composition of the fleet catch was characterized according to the target species during the 2005–2014 period. In the analysis of 3786 hauls, 23 species of chondrichthyans (seven species of sharks, 15 species of batoids and a single species of Holocephali) were identified. Seven species showed a frequency of occurrence greater than 10% ( and Callorhinchus callorynchus, Discopyge tschudii, Mustelus schmitti, Sympterygia bonapartii, Psammobatis normani, Squalus acanthias and and and Zearaja chilensis and ). Species spatial distribution was evaluated and five areas of species assemblages were established. Besides the aspects related to bycatch, these analyses have contributed to the knowledge of the chondrichthyan biodiversity in the provincial coast where the fleet operates, a region with incomplete and mostly dispersed and outdated information.","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14 and Relative to target species, priority conservation species occur rarely in fishery interactions, resulting in imbalanced, overdispersed data. We present Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs) as an intuitive extension of the Random Forest algorithm to handle rare event bias. Each Random Forest receives individual stratified randomly sampled training/test sets, then down-samples the majority class for each decision tree. Results are averaged across Random Forests to generate an ensemble prediction. Through simulation, we show that ERFs outperform Random Forest with and without down-sampling, as well as with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique, for highly class imbalanced to balanced datasets. Spatial covariance greatly impacts ERFs’ perceived performance, as shown through simulation and case studies. In case studies from the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery, giant manta ray and Mobula birostris and syn. and Manta birostris and and scalloped hammerhead and Sphyrna lewini and presence had high spatial covariance and high model test performance, while false killer whale and Pseudorca crassidens and had low spatial covariance and low model test performance. Overall, we find ERFs have 4 advantages: (1) reduced successive partitioning effects; (2) prediction uncertainty propagation; (3) better accounting for interacting covariates through balancing; and (4) minimization of false positives, as the majority of Random Forests within the ensemble vote correctly. As ERFs can readily mitigate rare event bias without requiring large presence sample sizes or imparting considerable balancing bias, they are likely to be a valuable tool in bycatch and species distribution modeling, as well as spatial conservation planning, especially for protected species where presence can be rare.","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14","2023/03/14",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["Report of the consultation on the management of fishing capacity, Shark fisheries and incidental catch of Seabirds in longline fisheries","Biology and Management of Dogfish Sharks","Bycatch and discards of shrimp trawling in the Saudi waters of the Arabian Gulf: ecosystem impact assessment and implications for a sustainable fishery management","First records of the megamouth shark Megachasma pelagios (Taylor, Compagno &amp;
