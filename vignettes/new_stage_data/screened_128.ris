AB  - Ecological restoration has become an overarching management paradigm for sustaining the health and resilience of forests across western North America. Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales (<25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts (>75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term (<25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire. Ecological restoration in forests across the western US has to carefully balance the budget of ecosystem carbon with competing objectives such as improved wildlife habitat, reduced risk of severe wildfire, and other ecosystem services.

AB  - The cost of suppressing fires is known to be highly significant and increasing over time as a result of the indirect effects of climate change and rising human impacts. Their quantification is an essential component of an environmental accounting system, capable of providing updated
information for policy design and implementation. The goal of this study was to provide an overview of the state-of-art of international literature on wildfire suppression costs. To this aim, a systematic literature review was carried out revealing that the largest amount of empirical data
on suppression costs and related measures derived from North American case studies. Conversely, information on direct wildfire suppression cost categories is usually incomplete or missing throughout Europe, especially in fire-prone Mediterranean countries, even though these areas have been,
and continue to be, severely impacted by wildfires, underlining the need to update research in this field, thereby supporting cost-effective fire management plans.

TI  - A meta-analysis of management effects on forest carbon storage
AU  - Kalies, Elizabeth L.
AU  - Haubensak, Karen A.
AU  - Finkral, Alex J.
AB  - Forest management can have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage, but those effects can vary significantly with management type and species composition. We used systematic review methodology to identify and synthesize effects of thinning and/or burning, timber harvesting, clear-cut, and wildfire on four components of ecosystem carbon: aboveground vegetation, soil, litter, and deadwood. We performed a meta-analysis on studies from the United States and Canada because those represented 85% of the studies conducted worldwide. We found that the most important variables in predicting effect sizes (ratio of carbon stored in treated stands versus controls) were, in decreasing order of importance, ecosystem carbon component, time since treatment, and age of control. Management treatment was the least important of all the variables we examined, but the trends we found suggest that thinning and/or burning treatments resulted in less carbon loss than wildfire or clear-cut. This finding is consistent with recent modeling studies indicating that forest management is unimportant to long-term carbon dynamics relative to the effects of large-scale natural disturbances (e.g., drought, fire, pest outbreak). However, many data gaps still exist on total ecosystem carbon, particularly in regions other than North America, and in timber production forests and plantations.

TI  - Does soil burn severity affect the post-fire runoff and interrill erosion response? A review based on meta-analysis of field rainfall simulation data

AU  - Keizer, J. J.
AB  - Soil burn severity has been widely used to describe the impacts of fire on soils and is increasingly being recognised as a decisive factor controlling post-fire erosion rates. However, there is no unique definition of the term and the relationship between soil burn severity and post-fire hydrological and erosion response has not yet been fully established. The objective of this work was to review the existing literature on the role of soil burn severity on post-fire runoff and erosion ratios. To this end, a meta-analysis was carried out of the runoff and inter-rill erosion data from field rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s) that compared burnt and unburnt conditions. In this study, 109 individual observations were analysed that covered a wide geographical range, various types of land cover (forest, shrubland, and grassland) and two types of fire types (wildfire and prescribed fire). The effect size of the post-fire runoff and erosion response was determined for four key factors: (i) soil burn severity; (ii) time-since-fire; (iii) rainfall intensity; and (iv) bare soil cover. Statistical meta-analysis showed that fire occurrence had a significant effect on the hydrological and erosive response. However, this effect was only significantly higher with increasing soil burn severity for inter-rill erosion, and not for runoff. This study furthermore highlighted the incoherencies between existing burn severity classifications, and proposed an unambiguous classification.

AU  - Koksal, Kubra

AU  - Bearman, Christopher
AB  - Globally, many residents of wildland-urban interface (WUI) communities are at risk of wildfire attack but do not undertake adequate preparations. Householder wildfire risk perception has been proposed as an important influence on risk mitigation preparatory actions. However, research findings have been inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis of 10 studies and found the average correlation between wildfire risk perception and risk mitigation actions to be small: r = 0.17. In order to investigate wildfire risk perception and mitigation further we conducted two studies of Australian WUI householders’ wildfire risk perceptions and mitigation actions in the context of their everyday life activities conceptualised as ‘household projects’. Study 1 involved 32 interviews. Both household wildfire safety project priority rankings (r = 0.47) and wildfire risk perception ratings (r = 0.44) were related significantly to number of completed wildfire preparation actions. Study 2 involved 127 householders completing an online survey, with 83 providing household wildfire safety project priority rankings. These rankings were related significantly to number of completed wildfire safety preparation actions (r = 0.38), but risk perception ratings were not related significantly (r = 0.08). Implications of viewing wildfire preparation actions as being situated in everyday life contexts are discussed.

AB  - ContextConsideration of human–environment dimensions of wildfire make ecosystem services (ES) a useful framework for understanding wildfire challenges and devising viable management strategies. Scientific literature on wildfire and ES is growing rapidly, but connections are disparate and evolving.ObjectivesWe review relationships between mountain wildfire and a comprehensive list of 50 relevant ES informed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Our conceptual framework is used to evaluate underlying mechanisms and the direction and scale of wildfire impacts on ES.MethodsWe focus the review on the Colorado Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, one of the best-studied landscapes in the world for understanding fire-ES relationships and evaluating how regional differences contribute to broader understanding of ES globally. We begin our review by considering key relationships, followed by a structured literature search of wildfire impacts with tabulated trends and findings.ResultsKey findings from the review: (1) current fire regimes mostly have negative impacts on ES, with some positive effects on cultural services, (2) changes to vegetation composition and structure are the most common mechanism, (3) mechanisms acting at local and landscape scales impact ES at broader scales, (4) intermediate services warrant attention and management resources, and (5) regional differences may provide opportunities for stronger global synthesis.ConclusionsFamiliarity with landscape legacies, current land use practices, and stakeholder values uniquely positions landscape ecologists to contribute to future studies of wildfire-ES connections. A framework that considers the complete suite of ES can guide researchers to seek collaborations that more completely characterize their regions.

TI  - Effects of fire disturbance on ant abundance and diversity: a global meta-analysis
AU  - Vasconcelos, Heraldo L.
AU  - Maravalhas, Jonas B.
AU  - Cornelissen, Tatiana
AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of fire on the abundance and alpha diversity of ants based upon data published over the past 70 years. Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 %, but had no effect on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire significantly decreased ant diversity in forests—especially in tropical forests—whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not. Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests, wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast, fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire, and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature of fire effects on ants.

TI  - Does forest harvesting emulate fire disturbance? A comparison of effects on selected attributes in coniferous-dominated headwater systems
AU  - Nitschke, Craig R.
AB  - The emulation of natural disturbances is seen by many as an important management paradigm for achieving sustainable ecosystem management. To successfully emulate natural disturbances, managers must first have an understanding of the complex interactions that occur to the biophysical and chemical attributes of an ecosystem for both the natural and the “emulating” disturbance. The management of riparian ecosystems is an important issue faced by managers since the type of harvesting treatment can have a significant influence on the aquatic component. The removal or retention of riparian forests can have a direct influence on water quality and quantity, particularly on the smaller systems that are found at the headwaters of catchments, but do these treatments invoke a similar response as wildfire? To determine if emulation occurs, the affects of forest harvesting treatments and wildfire on temperature, water chemistry, summer stream flow, and sedimentation in headwater systems were compared using a meta-analysis. A statistically significant difference was found for temperature response between partial/selective harvesting and wildfire, but not after clear-cut harvesting. Water chemistry showed statistically significant differences for 11 out of 14 tested attributes, with dissolved organic carbon exhibiting the most marked difference. A significant difference was identified between clear-cut harvesting and wildfire for summer stream flow but not between wildfire and partial/selective harvest systems. Forest harvesting operations were found to emulate sedimentation through forest roads but not harvest treatment. Partial/selective harvest systems may offer the greatest emulation congruency versus clear-cut harvest systems in terms of overall headwater response and recovery. Partial/selective harvest systems combined with prescribed burning may provide managers with the best solution when attempting to emulate wildfire in headwater systems and reduce the detrimental impact of perturbation on these systems.

TI  - A meta-analysis on the response of microbial biomass, dissolved organic matter, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil to fire in forest ecosystems
AU  - Wang, Qingkui
AU  - Zhong, Micai
AU  - Wang, Silong
AB  - The effects of fire on labile soil C and N in forest ecosystems are important for understanding C sequestration and N cycling not only because labile soil C and N are often variables that determine soil fertility but also because the role of soils as a source or sink for C is important on an ecosystem and on the regional level. In the current study, the literature on the effects of fire on soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C, and total N, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil was reviewed, and the results of a meta-analysis on literature data were reported. Overall, fire significantly increased the soil total N, microbial biomass N, dissolved organic C, and total N, but decreased soil organic C, microbial biomass C, respiration and N mineralization. Among the significant effects of different fire types, wildfire had the higher effects on the soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved total N and respiration of soil than prescribed fire. In addition, responses of soil organic C, total N and N mineralization to wildfire depended on forest type and natural zone. Positive responses of soil organic C, total N were found in broadleaved forests and Mediterranean zones, and negative responses in coniferous forests and temperate zones. Wildfire significantly decreased N mineralization in coniferous forests. The effects of fire on soil microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N mineralization generally decreased with time after the fire. In general, the effects of fire on soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and dissolved total N and N mineralization decreased with increasing soil depth. These results suggest that fire increases C and N availability and increases microbial activity, which consequently decreases the potential rates of C sequestration.

AU  - Thorn, Simon
AU  - Gustafsson, Lena
AB  - Abstract  Aim Large disturbances increasingly shape the world's forests. Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance‐interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally.   Insights First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications—i.e., from non‐additive effects– between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio‐ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date.   Conclusions Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.

TI  - Tamm Review: Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social objectives? A systematic review
AU  - Kalies, Elizabeth L.
AU  - Kent, Larissa L. Yocom
AB  - The prevailing paradigm in the western U.S. is that the increase in stand-replacing wildfires in historically frequent-fire dry forests is due to unnatural fuel loads that have resulted from management activities including fire suppression, logging, and grazing, combined with more severe drought conditions and increasing temperatures. To counteract unnaturally high fuel loads, fuel reduction treatments which are designed to reduce fire hazard and improve overall ecosystem functioning have been increasing over the last decade. However, until recently much of what we knew about treatment effectiveness was based on modeling and predictive studies. Now, there are many examples of wildfires burning through both treated and untreated areas, and the effectiveness of treatments versus no action can be evaluated empirically. We carried out a systematic review to address the question: Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social (saving human lives and property) objectives? We found 56 studies addressing fuel treatment effectiveness in 8 states in the western US. There was general agreement that thin+burn treatments had positive effects in terms of reducing fire severity, tree mortality, and crown scorch. In contrast, burning or thinning alone had either less of an effect or none at all, compared to untreated sites. Most studies focused on carbon storage agreed that treatments do not necessarily store more carbon after wildfire, but result in less post-wildfire emissions and less carbon loss in a wildfire due to tree mortality. Understory responses are mixed across all treatments, and the response of other ecological attributes (e.g., soil, wildlife, water, insects) to treatment post-wildfire represents an important data gap; we provide a detailed agenda for future research. Overall, evidence is strong that thin+burn treatments meet the goal of reducing fire severity, and more research is needed to augment the few studies that indicate treatments protect human lives and property.

TI  - Local community participation and volunteerism in wildfire area management: A systematic review
AU  - KETE, Sezin
AB  - Wildfires have caused considerable economic, ecological, and social damage in recent years. For this reason, decision-makers in wildfire management (WFM) have face increasingly difficult challenges. While decision support systems help decision-makers, it is clear that some deficiencies still persist. In this context, it is thought that the active role of local people involved in wildfire management can eliminate these deficiencies because they have experience and direct knowledge about fighting wildfires in Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) areas. Hence, their expertise can be utilized in future wildfire containment efforts. In this study, the author presents some general information about WUI, public participation, and the decision-making process and its relation to wildfires. In addition, the author will also examine previous studies on the participation of local people in wildfire management and investigate the decision-making processes regarding this issue by using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. The results of this study suggest that there should be a widespread adoption of the community-based integrated fire management (CBIFM) approach, instead of the top-down management approach commonly employed in wildfire management. The results strongly suggest that decision-makers should reach a consensus as to how the principle of participation in fire management should work by reviewing the socio-economic interests of the local community.
Orman yangınları son yıllarda çok fazla ekonomik, ekolojik ve sosyal zarara neden olmuştur. Bu nedenle Orman Yangını yönetiminde (OYY) karar vericilerin işi giderek zorlaşmaktadır. Gelişen karar destek sistemleri karar vericilere yardımcı olsa da hala bazı eksikliklerin olduğu aşikardır. Bu bağlamda, yerel halkın orman yangını yönetiminde aktif rol almasının, hem bilgi toplayabilmesi hem de Yabanıl Kentsel Arayüz (YKA) alanlarında orman yangınıyla doğrudan karşılaşması nedeniyle bu eksiklikleri giderebileceği ve orman yangınıyla mücadelede faydalı olabileceği düşünülmektedir. Bu çalışmada, YKA, Halkın katılımı ve karar verme süreci hakkında genel bilgiler ve bunların orman yangını ile ilişkileri sunulduktan sonra, yerel halkın orman yangını yönetimine katılımı ve bu konudaki karar verme süreçlerinin nasıl ilerlediğine dair son çalışmalar Sistematik İncelemeler ve Meta-Analiz için Tercih Edilen Raporlama Öğeleri (PRISMA) tekniği kullanılarak incelenmiştir. Çalışma sonucunda, orman yangını yönetiminde yukarıdan aşağıya yönetim yaklaşımı yerine Toplum Tabanlı Entegre Yangın Yönetimi (TEGY) yaklaşımının yaygınlaştırılması gerektiği ortaya çıkmıştır. Sonuçlar, karar vericilerin yerel toplumun sosyo-ekonomik çıkarlarını gözden geçirerek yangın yönetimine katılım ilkesinin nasıl işlemesi gerektiğine karar vermeleri gerektiğini kuvvetle önermektedir.

TI  - Airport sustainability through life cycle assessments: A systematic literature review
AU  - Bahman, Nahed
AB  - Abstract Anthropogenic climate change contributes to increased frequency and intensity of droughts, wildfires, storms, coastal sea level rise, and population displacements, in addition to causing lung and cardiovascular diseases from the emission of Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs). The aviation sector is estimated to contribute 2%–3% of global anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This excludes GHG emissions from airport operation and maintenance activities due to limited research in the area. This systematic literature review examined the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) carried out by previous studies on the environmental impacts of airport operation and maintenance activities. This allows to assess existing literature on the impacts of these activities; identify knowledge gaps in LCA based on the findings of the review; and propose areas for further research and improvement in mitigating the environmental impacts of airport operation and maintenance activities. A total of 11 papers were selected for thematic analysis and narrative synthesis following a systematic review process based on the research question which yielded a total of 263 peer‐reviewed research articles and dissertations on the topic. The findings of the review showed that knowledge gaps exist in the LCA of environmental impacts of Auxiliary Power Units (APU) and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) operations in the airport during aircraft turnaround time. Further research is suggested in the use of feasible and affordable alternative energy sources (electricity, compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and hydrogen) at airports to reduce the environmental impacts associated with petrol‐ and diesel‐powered GSE and gate operations at airports.

AU  - Bénichou, Noureddine
AB  - Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fires, a worldwide problem, are gaining more importance over time due to climate change and increased urbanization in WUI areas. Some jurisdictions have provided standards, codes and guidelines, which may greatly help planning, prevention and protection against wildfires. This work presents a wide systematic review of standards, codes and guidelines for the design and construction of the built environment against WUI fire hazard from North American, European, Oceanic countries, alongside with trans-national codes. The main information reviewed includes: the definition of WUI hazards, risk areas and related severity classes, the influence of land and environmental factors, the requirements for building materials, constructions, utilities, fire protection measures and road access. Some common threads among the documents reviewed have been highlighted. They include similar attempts at: (a) defining WUI risk areas and severity classes, (b) considering land factors including the defensible space (also known as ignition zones), (c) prescribing requirements for buildings and access. The main gaps highlighted in the existing standards/guidelines include lacks of detailed and widespread requirements for resources, fire protection measures, and lacks of taking into account environmental factors in detail. The main design and construction principles contained in the reviewed documents are largely based on previous research and/or good practices. Hence, the main contributions of this paper consist in: (a) systematically disseminate these guidance concepts, (b) setting a potential basis for the development of standards/guidelines in other jurisdictions lacking dedicated WUI fire design guidance, (c) highlighting gaps in existing standards/guidelines to be addressed by current and future research.

AB  - Analyses in the past decade and more recently, catastrophic events, including extreme temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, floods, and wildfires caused by climate change, have become too common worldwide. There is overwhelming evidence that country commitments expressed in National Determined Contributions (NDCs) can contribute to stabilising or reversing the course of impacts of climate change. With the multiplicity of NDC measures, compounded by their complexities and limited resources, multi-criteria decision-making tools can be used in making informed decisions about their development. Furthermore, while many countries are blessed with an abundance of sustainable resources and technologies to feed into NDCs, a major challenge is prioritising them as part of the national and global climate change mitigation and adaptation agenda. Many multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and tools have been developed over the years. However, their implementation in practice for prioritising NDC measures is still not well-known despite their high acceptance in academic literature. This study adopts a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature from the Web of Science and grey literature from the recently launched Technology Needs Assessment database to fully understand the MCDM tools used in evaluating NDC projects from academic versus practice perspectives. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method adopted, culminated in the identification of 464 peer-reviewed journal articles and 50 TNA reports used in the analysis. The results indicate amongst the many MCDM techniques in peer-reviewed literature, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is the most widely used in research, while simplified MCDM methods are the most used in practice.

AB  - Permanent grasslands are widely recognized for their role in protecting the landscape against soil erosion and flooding. However, this role has not yet been comprehensively quantified. Also, the degradation of grasslands is accelerating at an alarming pace, leading to erosion and runoff generation. This study aims to (i) quantify the erosion and flooding mitigation effect of permanent grasslands in the EU and the UK, compared to other land uses; (ii) review all soil erosion and runoff generating processes on permanent grasslands. First, a meta-analysis compared four erosion and flooding-related indicators: bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, runoff and soil loss between permanent grasslands, arable land and forests. The results show that permanent grassland soils had generally lower bulk density and higher hydraulic conductivity than arable soils, and generated less runoff and soil loss. Differences are less clear-cut in comparison with forests, although permanent grasslands had higher bulk density and runoff values. Secondly, a qualitative, in-depth review was performed to identify knowledge gaps related to the characteristics, importance and driving factors behind relevant soil erosion processes affecting grasslands in the EU. This identified six processes with appreciable knowledge gaps: trampling-induced erosion, gullying, piping, landsliding, snowmelt erosion, and avalanche erosion. Additionally, three processes were identified that promote runoff generation and soil erosion: compaction, hydrophobicity and wildfires.

AB  - Several traffic modeling tools are currently available for evacuation planning and real-time decision support during emergencies. This paper reviews potential traffic-modeling approaches in the context of wildland–urban interface (WUI) fire-evacuation applications. Existing modeling approaches and features are evaluated pertaining to fire-related, spatial, and demographic factors; intended application (planning or decision support); and temporal issues. This systematic review shows the importance of the following modeling approaches: dynamic modeling structures, considering behavioral variability and route choice; activity-based models for short-notice evacuation planning; and macroscopic traffic simulation for real-time evacuation management. Subsequently, the modeling features of 22 traffic models and applications currently available in practice and the literature are reviewed and matched with the benchmark features identified for WUI fire applications. Based on this review analysis, recommendations are made for developing traffic models specifically applicable to WUI fire evacuation, including possible integrations with wildfire and pedestrian models.

TI  - Walking on Fire: Perambulatory Fieldwork and Shared Interpretation of Date Palm Fires North of the Third Cataract of the Nile (Northern State, Sudan)
AU  - Ille, Enrico
AU  - Salah, Mohamed
AB  - A significant increase in date palm fires in Sudan Northern State since the mid-2000s has triggered different and partially contradictory assessments of why and how they have broken out. These assessments were not merely disinterested cause-effect analyses or differing environmental interpretations: they were profoundly intertwined with political conflicts and socio-economic changes in the region that did not relate just to planned hydropower dams and the presence of extractive activities, respectively posing an immediate threat of displacement and pollution. The ensuing debates have also discussed wider implications for the future of the region and its population, especially for the Nubian majority that considers it to be their ancestral homeland. This connects an investigation about date palm fires to broader political issues, such as the resource policies of the Sudanese Ingaz regime (1989-2019).In this article, we discuss the subsequent politics of information and evidence that had an essential impact on what data were gathered and made available, and which explanations were given credence by the actors involved. We started out from a set of questions guiding the reconstruction of the preconditions for the outbreak, spread and aftermath of the fires. Why was a place vulnerable to fire? What were the conditions that allowed the fire to happen? How did it actually break out (wildfire, accident or arson)? How did it spread? What conditions facilitated (or hindered) its spread? What was the response of those with an interest in extinguishing it? To what extent was the response successful in putting it out? What was the ultimate damage it caused? What did this event mean for the perception of and/or response to potential future fires? Our subsequent investigation was not defined by the need to identify a specific perpetrator or factor, but was rather aimed at producing a genealogy of circumstances and developments that influenced the way the fires gained ground. At the same time, we had to take into account the complexities of the landscapes and the changing status of date palms both in these landscapes and in human production planning.Parallel to our own investigation, we began to observe the formation of opinions about these fire events, and to record the responses to our becoming involved in the societal debate on which interpretation was convincing. This brought in aspects of our own positionality, especially regarding the politically loaded differentiation between “wild” and “man-made” fires, and between “accidental” and “intentional” fires. Accusations that the Sudanese central government had instigated a huge proportion of these fires were prominent among Nubian anti-dam activists, and the fact that one of us—Mohamed Salah—belongs to that group had implications for how we approached and analysed our research. The fact that we both opposed the Ingaz regime was also cause for reflection.In order to deal with the ensuing methodological complications, we referred to academic debates on research approaches to and methods for the study of spatio-temporal relationships with different environments and evidence-making within the framework of these relationships. We identified walking interviews, a form of perambulatory fieldwork, as an appropriate technique for thinking through these complications, as they combine the detachment process of the interview—as a conversation intended to create a temporary reflective distance from the flow of social practices in order to look at them—with exposure to the familiar, in the sense of paths that have been taken numerous times. After reflecting on the multiple disciplinary contexts in which this technique has been discussed—such as anthropology, memory studies, environmental sociology and human geography—we present examples of fire event case studies that used it as part of the research process. In our presentation of walking interviews, we also use and reflect on different techniques of visualisation and illustration, including geotagged photos in combination with edited transcripts or self-reflective comments. We then offer more systematic reviews of the interpretations that were put forward during these and other interviews during our research.As a result, our article indicates the different ways in which the affected date palm owners considered what exactly they had lost when their palms burned, and whether this may have been intentional. The complex answers to these questions highlighted both social and political processes around the palms. The economic and socio-cultural status of date palms has changed among the resident populations, especially since the second half of the twentieth century. Being intergenerationally linked to families through property relations and shared memories, palm trees and their changing status can simultaneously represent roots and the immovability of origin, or their loss. When one looks at the socio-ecological landscape and the place of date palm fires in it, one therefore finds several layers to the amount of damage done.At the same time, the ongoing political tensions meant that many of the interpretations suggested by date palm owners, activists and government officials had a political thrust, whether accusatory or defensive, often along the lines of pre-existing hostilities. However, we found that in spite of the tense, antagonistic dynamics in the region, these interpretations could not simply be inferred from the various standpoints and interests in these dynamics. Our open-ended conversations with date palm owners, who generally shared opposition to the then ruling party (the NCP), revealed multiple and differentiated processes of interpretation. The juxtaposition of their arguments with statements from a local NCP member attested to the existence of points of convergence amidst their political antagonism around common notions, such as “negligence” and “climate change.” A careful mapping of the boundaries of these shared ideas seems to us to be a valuable mediatory and methodological principle.In conclusion, we confirm the importance of exposure as a crucial element of environmental research, especially if it relates to issues that not only our interlocutors but also we ourselves are invested in, whether emotionally, politically, or otherwise. At the same time, this also requires a highly reflective and critical analysis of subsequent research materials and their sources in order to navigate the intricate methodological complications this type of research process generates.

AU  - Baker, Andy

AU  - Treble, Pauline C.
AB  - Cave drip water calcium ion concentration is a primary determinant of speleothem deposition and growth rate. The factors that determine drip water calcium ion concentrations are the soil and vadose zone CO2 concentrations, and the hydrogeochemical evolution of the water from soil to cave. Here, we use a systematic literature review of cave drip water calcium concentrations, combined with PHREEQC equilibrium modelling, to investigate the global relationship between calcium concentration and surface climate. Our results are discussed in the context of understanding the climatic and environmental controls on drip water calcium concentration, speleothem growth rates and proxies of past climate and environmental change. We use an empirical, global soil CO2 concentration–temperature relationship to derive PHREEQC modelled cave drip water calcium concentrations. The global mean modelled drip water calcium concentration is close to that observed, but it over-predicts at high and low temperatures, and significantly under-predicts at temperate conditions. We hypothesise that closed system hydrochemical evolution due to water saturation is an important control on carbonate dissolution at colder temperatures. Under warmer conditions, for example temperate climates with a dry and hot or warm summer, seasonally-limited water availability can lead to: <100% soil cover; water-limitations on microbial and root respiration; wildfire; and prior calcite precipitation, all of which limit drip water calcium concentrations. In temperate climates with no dry season, higher CO2 concentrations than modelled from soil values are necessary to explain the observed drip water calcium values, which we propose is from an additional source of CO2 from microbial activity and root respiration in the vadose zone during open system hydrochemical evolution.

AB  - BackgroundThe role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats has been demonstrated. Yet, the potential of habitat or corridor of their verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) for biodiversity remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the potential of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation should be considered. Moreover, how linear transportation infrastructure verges should be managed in order to favor biodiversity is a crucial question. The present work describes the protocol of the first systematic synthesis of evidence of the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat and/or corridor for biodiversity. Outcomes of the study will be useful for helping managers to improve their practices or for prioritizing actions of ecological restoration.MethodsThe subject population will include both flora and fauna of the temperate climate, either species or communities. Exposures to linear transportation infrastructure verges, interventions of verge management (mowing, pruning, etc.) and environmental disturbances (pollution, wildfires, etc.) will be included. Both temporal and spatial comparators will be considered. Relevant outcomes will include dispersal, species richness and abundance. The scientific literature on the topic of the review may turn out to be very heterogeneous. Various management types, biodiversity outcomes and study designs might be conceived. If any combination of these is covered by a sufficient number of studies, we will perform a meta-analysis. At the least, we will produce a systematic map and a narrative synthesis.

AB  - Abstract
People with disability experience multidimensional inequalities, which heighten their vulnerability to climate change. An understanding of the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of people with disability can be gained through considering how they have fared during the types of events associated with climate change, such as droughts, floods, heat waves, hurricanes, and wildfires. A systematic review was conducted to identify factors associated with climate change vulnerability and adaptive capacity of people with disability. Papers were sourced from 12 electronic databases, the Google search engine, the websites of 21 organizations, and the reference lists of included papers; 34 papers (relating to 28 studies) met the selection criteria. Most studies were located in the United States, and almost half were focused on hurricane events. Factors contributing to vulnerability included personal factors (e.g., female gender, uncoupled or living alone, nonwhite ethnicity, and low income), environmental factors (commonly, limited practical support from government agencies and disability organizations), bodily impairments (cognitive impairments, hearing impairments, progression of impairments, relapse/exacerbation of symptoms, and thermoregulation difficulties), and activity limitations and participation restrictions (limited preparedness, difficulties with evacuation, and difficulties reassembling individual accommodations and repairing or replacing adaptive equipment). Factors relating to their adaptive capacity included personal factors (e.g., formal education), environmental factors (practical support from mainstream organizations, disability organizations, family, and friends), and activities and participation (emergency planning, keeping an emergency pack, and seeking information). People with disability are vulnerable to climate change largely due to inequalities and their exclusion from adaptation and mitigation efforts.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review is to search for, gather, and synthesize studies on disaster education for children in the early childhood period. Studies that implemented and evaluated the results of a disaster education program for children aged 3 to 6 years old were examined. For the purpose of this study, the focus was on disasters caused by nature induced hazards (earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, flood, volcano eruption, storm, avalanche, tornado, landslide, hurricane, blizzard). A large number of diverse databases such as Emerald, ERIC, JSTOR, ProQuest, SAGE Journals Online, Science Direct, Scopus, SpringerLink, Taylor & Francis Online Journals, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library were searched using a wide range of keywords, resulting in the identification of seven studies from peer-reviewed journals. These studies were examined through thematic analysis. The results highlight the different strategies and materials that researchers utilized for teaching young children about disasters, as well as the various evaluation methods used to assess young children's disaster-related knowledge. Furthermore, it was found that across all examined studies, there was a positive impact of disaster education on children’s disaster related knowledge. It is hoped that this review will shed light on an underrated yet crucial research area, attracting more attention and providing a starting point for rapid improvement

TI  - Effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in mixed conifer forests
AU  - Abella, Scott R.
AU  - Springer, Judith D.
AB  - Mixed conifer forests of western North America are challenging for fire management, as historical fire regimes were highly variable in severity, timing, and spatial extent. Complex fire histories combined with site factors and other disturbances, such insect outbreaks, led to great variation in understory plant communities, and management activities influence future dynamics of both overstory and understory communities. This variation needs to be considered as part of ecosystem-scale efforts to influence future fires and restore the composition and structure of mixed conifer forests. We undertook a systematic review of published studies evaluating effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in western North American mixed conifer forests. Forty-one studies, published in 50 articles, met inclusion criteria and encompassed projects in seven states in the USA and British Columbia in Canada. Total understory plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density) commonly declined in the short term within 4years after treatment. This may result from damage to plants during tree cutting operations or fire, heavy loadings of slash, little change or even expansion of tree canopies after low-intensity treatments, herbivory, or drought. In contrast, all 7 studies measuring understories longer than 5years since treatment reported increases in understory metrics. Treatments in these long-term studies also persistently decreased tree canopy cover. Most or all native species endured (even if reduced in abundance) through cutting operations or fire. A model of understory response has emerged that treatments generally do not eliminate species, and often benefit species absent or uncommon in untreated forest. Groups of native species (e.g., Epilobium spp.) appear fire-dependent, because they are uncommon or absent in unburned mixed conifer forests and after tree cutting alone. Cutting and prescribed fire applied together resulted in the greatest invasion of non-native plants, but non-native cover was minimal compared to native cover. Few studies examined influences of intensity of tree cutting or severity of prescribed fire, but overstory–understory relationships suggest that treatments must substantially reduce overstory density from maximum values (which can exceed 3000stemsha−1 and 80m2 ha−1 basal area) and tree canopy cover to <30–50% cover to elicit appreciable responses from the forest understory. Few studies examined understory dynamics after wildfire relative to unburned forest, and further work is warranted because wildfire is a likely eventual outcome of passive management in these forests. Across a broad region from the southwestern United States into Canada, prescribed fire and tree cutting consistently increased disturbance-promoted native species in the short term and total understory abundance in the long term. Active management using tree cutting and fire will likely benefit both biodiversity conservation and fire management in current mixed conifer forests.

AB  - Importance: Climate change may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes by causing direct physiologic changes, psychological distress, and disruption of health-related infrastructure. Yet, the association between numerous climate change-related environmental stressors and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events has not been systematically reviewed.
Objective: To review the current evidence on the association between climate change-related environmental stressors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Evidence Review: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications from January 1, 1970, through November 15, 2023, that evaluated associations between environmental exposures and cardiovascular mortality, acute cardiovascular events, and related health care utilization. Studies that examined only nonwildfire-sourced particulate air pollution were excluded. Two investigators independently screened 20 798 articles and selected 2564 for full-text review. Study quality was assessed using the Navigation Guide framework. Findings were qualitatively synthesized as substantial differences in study design precluded quantitative meta-analysis.
Findings: Of 492 observational studies that met inclusion criteria, 182 examined extreme temperature, 210 ground-level ozone, 45 wildfire smoke, and 63 extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, dust storms, and droughts. These studies presented findings from 30 high-income countries, 17 middle-income countries, and 1 low-income country. The strength of evidence was rated as sufficient for extreme temperature; ground-level ozone; tropical storms, hurricanes, and cyclones; and dust storms. Evidence was limited for wildfire smoke and inadequate for drought and mudslides. Exposure to extreme temperature was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but the magnitude varied with temperature and duration of exposure. Ground-level ozone amplified the risk associated with higher temperatures and vice versa. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, were associated with increased cardiovascular risk that persisted for many months after the initial event. Some studies noted a small increase in cardiovascular mortality, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease after exposure to wildfire smoke, while others found no association. Older adults, racial and ethnic minoritized populations, and lower-wealth communities were disproportionately affected.
Conclusions and Relevance: Several environmental stressors that are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but data on outcomes in low-income countries are lacking. Urgent action is needed to mitigate climate change-associated cardiovascular risk, particularly in vulnerable populations.

AB  - Carbon (C)-informed forest management requires understanding how disturbance and management influence soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at scales relevant to landowners and forest policy and management professionals. The continued growth of data sets and publications allows powerful synthesis approaches to be applied to such questions at increasingly fine scales. Here, we report results from a synthesis that used meta-analysis of published studies and two large observational databases to quantify disturbance and management impacts on SOC stocks. We conducted this, the third in a series of ecoregional SOC assessments, for the Pacific Northwest, which comprises ~8% of the land area but ~12% of the U.S. forest sector C sink. At the ecoregional level, our analysis indicated that fundamental patterns of vegetation, climate, and topography are far more important controls on SOC stocks than land use history, disturbance, or management. However, the same patterns suggested that increased warming, drying, wildland fire, and forest regeneration failure pose significant risks to SOC stocks across the region. Detailed meta-analysis results indicated that wildfires diminished SOC stocks throughout the soil profile, while prescribed fire only influenced surface organic materials and harvesting had no significant overall impact on SOC. Independent observational data corroborated the negative influence of fire on SOC derived from meta-analysis, suggested that harvest impacts may vary subregionally with climate or vegetation, and revealed that forests with agricultural uses (e.g., grazing) or legacies (e.g., cultivation) had smaller SOC stocks. We also quantified effects of a range of common forest management practices having either positive (organic amendments, nitrogen [N]-fixing vegetation establishment, inorganic N fertilization) or no overall effects on SOC (other inorganic fertilizers, urea fertilization, competition suppression through herbicides). In order to maximize the management applications of our results, we qualified them with ratings of confidence based on degree of support across approaches. Last, similar to earlier published assessments from other ecoregions, we supplemented our quantitative synthesis results with a literature review to arrive at a concise set of tactics for adapting management operations to site-specific criteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although climate change is one of the biggest global health threats, individual-level and short-term data on direct exposure and health impacts are still scarce. Wearable electronic devices (wearables) present a potential solution to this research gap. Wearables have become widely accepted in various areas of health research for ecological momentary assessment, and some studies have used wearables in the field of climate change and health. However, these studies vary in study design, demographics, and outcome variables, and existing research has not been mapped.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aimed to map existing research on wearables used to detect direct health impacts and individual exposure during climate change-induced weather extremes, such as heat waves or wildfires.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework and systematically searched 6 databases (PubMed [MEDLINE], IEEE Xplore, CINAHL [EBSCOhost], WoS, Scopus, Ovid [MEDLINE], and Google Scholar). The search yielded 1871 results. Abstracts and full texts were screened by 2 reviewers (MK and IM) independently using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria comprised studies published since 2010 that used off-the-shelf wearables that were neither invasive nor obtrusive to the user in the setting of climate change-related weather extremes. Data were charted using a structured form, and the study outcomes were narratively synthesized.
RESULTS: The review included 55,284 study participants using wearables in 53 studies. Most studies were conducted in upper-middle-income and high-income countries (50/53, 94%) in urban environments (25/53, 47%) or in a climatic chamber (19/53, 36%) and assessed the health effects of heat exposure (52/53, 98%). The majority reported adverse health effects of heat exposure on sleep, physical activity, and heart rate. The remaining studies assessed occupational heat stress or compared individual- and area-level heat exposure. In total, 26% (14/53) of studies determined that all examined wearables were valid and reliable for measuring health parameters during heat exposure when compared with standard methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Wearables have been used successfully in large-scale research to measure the health implications of climate change-related weather extremes. More research is needed in low-income countries and vulnerable populations with pre-existing conditions. In addition, further research could focus on the health impacts of other climate change-related conditions and the effectiveness of adaptation measures at the individual level to such weather extremes.

AB  - Climate change and rapid population ageing pose challenges for communities and public policies. This systematic review aims to gather data from studies that present health indicators establishing the connection between climate change and the physical and mental health of the older population (≥ 65 years), who experience a heightened vulnerability to the impacts of climate change when compared to other age cohorts. This review was conducted according to the PICO strategy and following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Greenfile) were searched for articles from 2015 to 2022. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria,nineteen studies were included. The findings indicated that various climate change phenomena are associated with an elevated risk of mortality and morbidity outcomes in older adults. These included cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and mental diseases, along with physical injuries. Notably, the impact of climate change was influenced by gender, socioeconomic status, education level, and age-vulnerability factors. Climate change directly affected the health of older adults through ambient temperature variability, extreme and abnormal temperatures, strong winds, sea temperature variability, extreme El Niño-southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and droughts, and indirectly by air pollution resulting from wildfires. This review presents further evidence confirming that climate change significantly impacts the health and well-being of older adults. It highlights the urgency for implementing effective strategies to facilitate adaptation and mitigation, enhancing the overall quality of life for all individuals.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems host disproportionately high biodiversity and provide unique ecosystem services, yet they are being degraded at an alarming rate. Fires, which are becoming increasingly frequent and intense due to global change, can affect these ecosystems in many ways, but this relationship is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic review to characterize the literature on the effects of fires on stream ecosystems and found that (1) abiotic indicators were more commonly investigated than biotic ones, (2) most previous research was conducted in North America and in the temperate evergreen forest biome, (3) following a control-impact (CI) or before-after (BA) design, (4) predominantly assessing wildfires as opposed to prescribed fires, (5) in small headwater streams, and (6) with a focus on structural and not functional biological indicators. After quantitatively analyzing previous research, we detected great variability in responses, with increases, decreases, and no changes being reported for most indicators (e.g., macroinvertebrate richness, fish density, algal biomass, and leaf decomposition). We shed light on these seemingly contradicting results by showing that the presence of extreme hydrological post-fire events, the time lag between fire and sampling, and whether the riparian forest burned or not influenced the outcome of previous research. Results suggest that although wildfires and the following hydrological events can have dramatic impacts in the short term, most biological endpoints recover within 5-10 years, and that detrimental effects are minimal in the case of prescribed fires. We also detected that no effects were more often reported by BACI studies than by CI or BA studies, raising the question of whether this research field may be biased by the inherent limitations of CI and BA designs. Finally, we make recommendations to help advance this field of research and guide future integrated fire management that includes the protection of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term improvements in air quality and public health in the continental USA were disrupted over the past decade by increased fire emissions that potentially offset the decrease in anthropogenic emissions. This study aims to estimate trends in black carbon and PM<sub>2·5</sub> concentrations and their attributable mortality burden across the USA.
METHODS: In this study, we derived daily concentrations of PM<sub>2·5</sub> and its highly toxic black carbon component at a 1-km resolution in the USA from 2000 to 2020 via deep learning that integrated big data from satellites, models, and surface observations. We estimated the annual PM<sub>2·5</sub>-attributable and black carbon-attributable mortality burden at each 1-km<sup>2</sup> grid using concentration-response functions collected from a national cohort study and a meta-analysis study, respectively. We investigated the spatiotemporal linear-regressed trends in PM<sub>2·5</sub> and black carbon pollution and their associated premature deaths from 2000 to 2020, and the impact of wildfires on air quality and public health.
FINDINGS: Our results showed that PM<sub>2·5</sub> and black carbon estimates are reliable, with sample-based cross-validated coefficients of determination of 0·82 and 0·80, respectively, for daily estimates (0·97 and 0·95 for monthly estimates). Both PM<sub>2·5</sub> and black carbon in the USA showed significantly decreasing trends overall during 2000 to 2020 (22% decrease for PM<sub>2·5</sub> and 11% decrease for black carbon), leading to a reduction of around 4200 premature deaths per year (95% CI 2960-5050). However, since 2010, the decreasing trends of fine particles and premature deaths have reversed to increase in the western USA (55% increase in PM<sub>2·5</sub>, 86% increase in black carbon, and increase of 670 premature deaths [460-810]), while remaining mostly unchanged in the eastern USA. The western USA showed large interannual fluctuations that were attributable to the increasing incidence of wildfires. Furthermore, the black carbon-to-PM<sub>2·5</sub> mass ratio increased annually by 2·4% across the USA, mainly due to increasing wildfire emissions in the western USA and more rapid reductions of other components in the eastern USA, suggesting a potential increase in the relative toxicity of PM<sub>2·5</sub>. 100% of populated areas in the USA have experienced at least one day of PM<sub>2·5</sub> pollution exceeding the daily air quality guideline level of 15 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during 2000-2020, with 99% experiencing at least 7 days and 85% experiencing at least 30 days. The recent widespread wildfires have greatly increased the daily exposure risks in the western USA, and have also impacted the midwestern USA due to the long-range transport of smoke.
INTERPRETATION: Wildfires have become increasingly intensive and frequent in the western USA, resulting in a significant increase in smoke-related emissions in populated areas. This increase is likely to have contributed to a decline in air quality and an increase in attributable mortality. Reducing fire risk via effective policies besides mitigation of climate warming, such as wildfire prevention and management, forest restoration, and new revenue generation, could substantially improve air quality and public health in the coming decades.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) mobilization and accumulation in the environment is directly related to forest fires. Biomass burning accounts for about 13% of the total contribution of Hg from natural sources. The aim of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of how wildfires modify mercury compounds behaviour and the effects it has in the Hg cycle, based on a systematic bibliographic review and analysis. Systems dynamics is an adequate focus to analyze the mobilization of Hg due to wildfires, which meets all the requirements to be studied by multimedia modelling. The development and application for the first time of a dynamic multimedia model of Hg taking into account specifically the influences of wildfires is one of the novelties of this work. Different scenarios show that an increase in the number of fires will consequently increase the mercury emitted into the atmosphere, modifying its natural cycle, producing a long-term modification of Hg compositions and concentrations in the different media. Hg movement caused by wildfires can cause complications in living beings and alter the ecosystems. This study found that the Hg soil content could as well be an indicator to measure the impact of fire on the environment. This model can also be generalized to conduct additional studies under comparable conditions, helping to understand the importance of forest fires in global Hg cycles. Copyright © 2022.

TI  - Exploring the impacts of perceived locus of control on post‐traumatic stress disorder among disaster survivors: A systematic review
AU  - Güzel, Aysun
AU  - Tekin, Çiğdem Samancı
AU  - Yamaç, Sabriye Uçan
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: It was previously reported that perceived external locus of control may exacerbate depressive symptoms, is associated with anxiety, boosts stress and general mental distress and weakens resilience against traumatic situations or difficulties. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Those with a higher external locus of control are more prone to develop PTSD symptoms since the perceived external locus of control is among the predictors of PTSD. An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: It is known that nurses are deployed in clinical and fieldwork during disaster and assume key roles both interventional practices and psychosocial education. Thus, it is of particular importance for mental health nurses to be aware of the locus of control in themselves, their colleagues, and the community before, during and after disasters to be able to combat the risk/presence of PTSD.
ABSTRACT: AIM: The present systematic review explored the impacts of perceived locus of control on PTSD among individuals experiencing disasters.
METHOD: This is a systematic review study carried out through a search of the relevant research published in English over the period December 2021 to April 2022. Accordingly, we sought the studies to review on the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases using the keywords "Child, Children, Adolescent, Adolescence, Adult, Aged, Elderly, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, Internal-External Control, Locus of Control, Disasters, Natural Disasters."
RESULTS: A total of 1.011 studies were found in the five databases using the keywords above. Following the exclusions, the remaining six studies were recruited for this systematic review. The six studies in question addressed earthquakes (2), hurricanes (1), wildfires (1), SARS (1) and fireworks explosions (1). In the study with wildfire survivors, there was a weak significant association between external locus of control and PTSD among those directly exposed to the disaster (r = .15, p < .01). The study with survivors of the SARS epidemic demonstrated that those with a high perceived chance (external) locus of control suffered PTSD (p = .001). An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD.
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that perceived locus of control is related to PTSD in individuals experiencing a disaster. The additional evidence was that post-disaster PTSD among those with a high perceived external locus of control is stronger than those with a high perceived internal locus of control.

AB  - Few studies have focused on the effects of exposure to air pollutants from vegetation fire events (including forest fire and the burning of crop residues) among children. In this study we aimed to investigate the association between PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations and hospital visits by children to address respiratory disease, conjunctivitis, and dermatitis. We examined and compared these associations by the presence of vegetation fire events on a given day (burning, non-burning, and mixed) across the upper northern region of Thailand from 2014 through 2018. A vegetation burning was defined when a fire hotspot (obtained from NASA-MODIS) exceeded the 90th percentile of the entire region and PM<sub>10</sub> concentration was over 100 μg/m<sup>3</sup>. To determine the association between hospital visits among children with PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations on burning and non-burning days, we performed a time-stratified case-crossover analysis fitted with conditional logistic regression for each province. A random-effects meta-analysis was applied to pool province-specific effect estimates. The number of burning days ranged from 64 to 139 days across eight provinces. A 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>10</sub> concentration on a burning day was associated with a respiratory disease-related hospital visit at lag 0 (OR = 1.01 (95% CIs: 1.00, 1.02)). This association was not observed for hospital visits related to conjunctivitis and dermatitis. A positive association was also observed between PM<sub>10</sub> concentration on non-burning days and hospital visits related to respiratory disease at lag 0 (OR = 1.03 (95% CIs: 1.02, 1.04)). Hospital visits for conjunctivitis and dermatitis were significantly associated with PM<sub>10</sub> concentration at lag 0 on both non-burning and mixed days.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes, although less is known for wildfire smoke. This systematic review evaluated the association between maternal exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy and the risk of perinatal, obstetric, and early childhood health outcomes.
METHODS: We searched CINAHL Complete, Ovid/EMBASE, Ovid/MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant epidemiological observational studies indexed through September 2023. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full-texts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment was performed by pairs of independent reviewers.
RESULTS: Our systematic search yielded 28,549 records. After duplicate removal, we screened 14,009 studies, identifying 31 for inclusion in the present review. Data extraction highlighted high methodological heterogeneity between studies, including a lack of geographic variation. Approximately 56.5% and 16% originated in the United States and Brazil, respectively, and fewer in other countries. Among the studies, wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy was assessed using distance of residence from wildfire-affected areas (n = 15), measurement of air pollutant concentration during wildfires (n = 11), number of wildfire records (n = 3), aerosol index (n = 1), and geographic hot spots (n = 1). Pooled meta-analysis for birthweight and low birthweight were inconclusive, likely due to low number of methodologically homogenous studies. However, the reviewed studies provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of birthweight reduction, low birthweight, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified 31 studies evaluating the impacts of maternal wildfire smoke exposure on maternal, infant, and child health. Although we found suggestive evidence of harm from exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy, more methodologically homogenous studies are required to enable future meta-analysis with greater statistical power to more accurately evaluate the association between maternal wildfire smoke and adverse birth outcomes and other health outcomes.

AB  - The intensity and frequency of wildfires is increasing globally. The systematic review of the current evidence on long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure on human health has not been performed yet. To provide a systematic review and identify potential knowledge gaps in the current evidence of long-term impacts of non-occupational exposure to wildfire smoke and/or wildfire impacts on human health. We conducted a systematic search of the literature via MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus from the database inception to July 05, 2022. References from the included studies and relevant reviews were also considered. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and a validated quality assessment framework were used to evaluate the quality of observational studies. Study results were synthesized descriptively. A total of 36 studies were included in our systematic review. Most studies were from developed countries (11 in Australia, 9 in Canada, 7 in the United States). Studies predominantly focused on mental health (21 studies, 58.33%), while evidence on long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on health outcomes other than mental health is limited. Current evidence indicated that long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure were associated with mortality (COVID-19 mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and acute myocardial disease mortality), morbidity (mainly respiratory diseases), mental health disorders (mainly posttraumatic stress disorder), shorter height of children, reduced lung function and poorer general health status. However, no significant associations were observed for long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on child mortality and respiratory hospitalizations. The population-based high-quality evidence with quantitative analysis on this topic is still limited. Future well-designed studies considering extensive wildfire smoke air pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen oxides) and estimating risk coefficient values for extensive health outcomes (e.g., mortality, morbidity) are warranted to fill current knowledge gaps.

AU  - Ospina, Maria B.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal wildfire exposure (e.g., smoke, stress) has been associated with poor birth outcomes with effects potentially mediated through air pollution and psychosocial stress. Despite the recent hike in the intensity and frequency of wildfires in some regions of the world, a critical appraisal of the evidence on the association between maternal wildfire exposure and adverse birth outcomes has not yet been undertaken. We conducted a systematic review that evaluated the scientific evidence on the association between wildfire exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse birth outcomes.
METHODS: Comprehensive searches in nine bibliographic databases were conducted from database inception up to June 2020. Observational epidemiological studies that evaluated associations between exposure to wildfire during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Studies were assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Screening of retrieved articles, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Study results were synthesized descriptively.
RESULTS: Eight epidemiological studies conducted in four countries and involving 1,702,252 births were included in the review. The exposure to wildfire during pregnancy was assessed in individual studies by measurement of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (n = 2), PM<sub>10</sub> (n = 1), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)aerosol index (n = 1), heat spots (n = 1), and by proximity of maternal residence to wildfire-affected areas (n = 3). There is some evidence indicating that maternal wildfire exposure associates with birth weight reduction (n = 7) and preterm birth (n = 4), particularly when exposure to wildfire smoke occurred in late pregnancy. The association between wildfire exposure and small for gestational age (n = 2) and infant mortality (n = 1) was inconclusive.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that maternal exposure to wildfire during late pregnancy is linked to reduced birth weight and preterm birth. Well-designed comprehensive studies are needed to better understand the perinatal effects of wildfires.

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis on the response of soil C cycling and storage across soil profiles (organic layer, 0-5 cm, 0-10 cm, 0-20 cm, and 20-100 cm) to fire reported in 308 studies across 383 sites and examined the role of fire frequency, fire type, soil type, ecosystem type, and post-fire time in regulating the response of soil C dynamics to fire. Overall, we found soil C cycling and storage were more responsive to one fire and wildfire as compared to frequent fire and prescribed fire, respectively. Soil respiration significantly decreased by 22 ± 9% by one fire, but was not significantly affected by frequent fire across ecosystems. One fire significantly reduced soil C content in the organic, 0-10 cm, and 20-100 cm layers by 27 ± 16%, 10 ± 9%, and 33 ± 18%, respectively, while frequent fire significantly reduced soil C content at a depth of 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm by 29 ± 8% and 16 ± 12%, respectively. Soil C cycling and storage showed little response to frequent prescribed fire. In addition, the response of soil C cycling and storage varied among different soil and ecosystem types, with a stronger response being observed in forest than in grassland. Within 20 years post-fire, soil C cycling and storage tended to recover only after one fire but not after frequent fire. We also found that soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities were more responsive to one fire than frequent fire, which could indirectly affect the effects of fire on soil C cycling and storage. The results of our study have filled some critical gaps in previous meta-analyses in fire ecology.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewWildfire smoke is associated with human health, becoming an increasing public health concern. However, a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence on the health impacts of ambient wildfire smoke on children and adolescents, an exceptionally vulnerable population, is lacking. We conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on the association between wildfire smoke and health of children and adolescents.Recent FindingsWe searched for studies available in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from database inception up to October 11, 2022. Of 4926 studies initially identified, 59 studies from 14 countries were ultimately eligible. Over 33.3% of the studies were conducted in the USA, and two focused on multi-countries. The exposure assessment of wildfire smoke was heterogenous, with wildfire-specific particulate matters with diameters ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5, 22.0%) and all-source (22.0%) PM2.5 during wildfire period most frequently used. Over half of studies (50.6%) focused on respiratory-related morbidities/mortalities. Wildfire smoke exposure was consistently associated with enhanced risks of adverse health outcomes in children/adolescents. Meta-analysis results presented a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.12) for all-cause respiratory morbidity, 1.11 (95% Ci: 0.93-1.32) for asthma, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–1.03) for bronchitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05–1.23) for upper respiratory infection, whilst − 21.71 g for birth weight (95% CI, − 32.92 to − 10.50) per 10 µg/m3 increment in wildfire-specific PM2.5/all-source PM2.5 during wildfire event.SummaryThe majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with multiple adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents, with respiratory morbidities of significant concern. In-utero exposure to wildfire smoke may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term impacts on height. Higher maternal baseline exposure to wildfire smoke and poor family-level baseline birthweight respectively elevated risks in preterm birth and low birth weight associated with wildfire smoke. More studies in low- and middle-income countries and focusing on extremely young children are needed. Despite technological progress, wildfire smoke exposure measurements remain uncertain, demanding improved methodologies to have more precise assessment of wildfire smoke levels and thus quantify the corresponding health impacts and guide public mitigation actions.

AB  - Epidemiological studies consistently show an association between wildfire-related smoke exposure and adverse respiratory health. We conducted a systematic review of evidence in published literature pertaining to heterogeneity of respiratory effects from this exposure in North America. We calculated the within-study ratio of relative risks (RRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to examine heterogeneity of effect by population subgroup, and then summarized the RRRs using meta-analysis. We found evidence of a greater effect of wildfire smoke on respiratory health among females relative to males for asthma (RRR: 1.035, 95% CI: 1.013, 1.057) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RRR: 1.018, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.032). There was evidence of a lower relative risk for all respiratory outcomes among youth compared to adults (RRR: 0.976, 95% CI: 0.963, 0.989). We also found wildfire smoke effects stratified by income, race, education, health behaviors, access to care, housing occupancy, geographic region, and urban/rural status. However, data were insufficient to quantitatively evaluate effect modification by these characteristics. While we found evidence that certain demographic subgroups of the population are more susceptible to respiratory health outcomes from wildfire smoke, it is unclear whether this information can be used to inform policy aimed to reduce health impact of wildfires.

AU  - Kennedy, Gerard A.
AB  - Wildfires present a serious risk to humans as well as to the environment. Wildfires cause loss of lives, economic losses, expose people to personal as well as collective trauma, and compromise the mental health of survivors. Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent following a traumatic event; however, their prevalence is not well established amongst those confronted by natural disasters such as wildfires. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the empirical findings pertaining to wildfires and the prevalence of sleep disturbances in the general community affected by this natural disaster. We searched EBSCO, PsychINFO, Medline, SpringerLink, CINAHL Complete, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library between January 2012 and March 2021. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings from this systematic review suggest that sleep disturbances, assessed one to ten months following the fires, are highly prevalent in wildfire survivors, with insomnia (ranging between 63-72.5%) and nightmares (ranging between 33.3-46.5%), being the most prevalent sleep disturbances reported in this cohort. Results also highlight the significant associations between sleep disturbances and post-traumatic symptoms following the trauma of wildfires. There is a possible link between sleep disturbance prevalence, severity of, and proximity to fires.

AU  - Isaza, Daniel F. Gomez

AU  - Franklin, Craig E.
AB  - Climate and land-use changes are expected to increase the future occurrence of wildfires, with potentially devastating consequences for freshwater species and ecosystems. Wildfires that burn in close proximity to freshwater systems can significantly alter the physicochemical properties of water. Following wildfires and heavy rain, freshwater species must contend with complex combinations of wildfire ash components (nutrients, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and metals), altered light and thermal regimes, and periods of low oxygen that together can lead to mass mortality events. However, the responses of aquatic fauna to wildfire disturbances are poorly understood. Here we provide a systematic review of available evidence on how aquatic animals respond to and recover from wildfire disturbance. Two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) were used to identify key literature. A total of 83 studies from across 11 countries were identified to have assessed the risk of wildfires on aquatic animals. We provide a summary of the main ecosystem-level changes associated with wildfires and the main responses of aquatic fauna to such disturbances. We pay special focus to physiological tools and biomarkers used to assess how wildfires impact aquatic animals. We conclude by providing an overview of how physiological biomarkers can further our understanding of wildfire-related impacts on aquatic fauna, and how different physiological tools can be incorporated into management and conservation plans and serve as early warning signs of wildfire disturbances.

AB  - Earth's rapidly warming climate is propelling us towards an increasingly fire-prone future. Currently, knowledge of the extent and characteristics of animal mortality rates during fire remains rudimentary, hindering our ability to predict how animal populations may be impacted in the future. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a global systematic review of the direct effects of fire on animal mortality rates, based on studies that unequivocally determined the fate of animals during fire. From 31 studies spanning 1984-2020, we extracted data on the direct impacts of fire on the mortality of 31 species from 23 families. From these studies, there were 43 instances where direct effects were measured by reporting animal survival from pre- to post-fire. Most studies were conducted in North America (52%) and Oceania (42%), focused largely on mammals (53%) and reptiles (30%), and reported mostly on animal survival in planned (82%) and/or low severity (70%) fires. We found no studies from Asia, Europe or South America. Although there were insufficient data to conduct a formal meta-analysis, we tested the effect of fire type, fire severity, fire regime, animal body mass, ecological attributes and class on survival. Only fire severity affected animal mortality, with a higher proportion of animals being killed by high than low severity fires. Recent catastrophic fires across the globe have drawn attention to the plight of animals exposed to wildfire. Yet, our systematic review suggests that a relatively low proportion of animals (mean predicted mortality [95% CI] = 3% [1%-9%]) are killed during fire. However, our review also underscores how little we currently know about the direct effects of fire on animal mortality, and highlights the critical need to understand the effects of high severity fire on animal populations.

AB  - Knowledge of how disturbances such as fire shape habitat structure and composition, and affect animal interactions, is fundamental to ecology and ecosystem management. Predators also exert strong effects on ecological communities, through top-down regulation of prey and competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their ubiquity, ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor, hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators world-wide. We found 160 studies spanning 1978-2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes (Hedges' g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas, or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations, taxonomic families and study designs, but most were located in North America and Oceania (59% and 24%, respectively), and largely focussed on felids (24%) and canids (25%). Half (50%) of the studies reported responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life-history traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red foxes Vulpes vulpes mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers Coluber constrictor negatively, with variances overlapping zero only slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context-specific management of predator-fire relationships is required.

AB  - Wildfires are increasing in frequency, size, and intensity, and increasingly affect highly populated areas. Wildfire smoke impacts cardiorespiratory health; children are at increased risk due to smaller airways, a higher metabolic rate and ongoing development. The objective of this systematic review was to describe the risk of pediatric respiratory symptoms and healthcare visits following exposure to wildfire smoke. Medical and scientific databases and the grey literature were searched from inception until December 2020. Included studies evaluated pediatric respiratory-related healthcare visits or symptoms associated with wildfire smoke exposure. Prescribed burns, non-respiratory symptoms and non-pediatric studies were excluded. Risk of bias was evaluated using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation Risk of Bias Rating Tool. Data are presented narratively due to study heterogeneity. Of 2138 results, 1167 titles and abstracts were screened after duplicate removal; 65 full text screens identified 5 pre-post and 11 cross-sectional studies of rural, urban and mixed sites from the USA, Australia, Canada and Spain. There is a significant increase in respiratory emergency department visits and asthma hospitalizations within the first 3 days of exposure to wildfire smoke, particularly in children < 5 years old.

AU  - James, P. M. A.
AB  - ContextThe mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a native bark beetle whose outbreaks leads to widespread conifer forest mortality. Of particular concern to forest and wildfire managers is the influence of MPB outbreaks on wildfire via spatial legacies left in impacted forest stands. There is, however, limited consensus in the literature regarding how MPB outbreaks affect wildfire across western North America.ObjectivesThis meta-analysis aims to (1) summarize available evidence regarding MPB-wildfire interactions, and (2) identify environmental and methodological indicators associated with various wildfire responses (i.e., amplified, neutral, or dampened) post-outbreak.MethodsWe include peer-reviewed publications focusing on MPB outbreaks and subsequent wildfire activity in forests across western Canada and the USA between 2000 and 2021. A classification scheme was used to examine attributes of each publication to assess which indicators contribute most to their associated wildfire response.ResultsWe found that spatial scale, forest fuels, and weather are main drivers of variation in wildfire response post-outbreak. Metrics of forest fuels and inclusion of weather data on a stand-scale are related to amplified fire responses, whereas dampened responses correspond to landscape-scale analyses. Furthermore, red-stage stands are associated with amplified fire response, whereas other stages are associated with dampened response—supporting current conceptual models of the importance of outbreak stage on wildfire.ConclusionsAdvancing our understanding regarding drivers of wildfire responses post-MPB outbreak is key to developing accurate, and comparative research studies. These findings provide crucial information for wildfire, and forest management agencies, especially in forests newly exposed to this disturbance interaction under climate change.

AU  - Liu, Jia C.

AU  - Uhl, Sarah A.
AU  - Bravo, Mercedes A.
AU  - Bell, Michelle L.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Climate change is likely to increase the threat of wildfires, and little is known about how wildfires affect health in exposed communities. A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future.
METHOD: We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research.
RESULTS: We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. EPA regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies.

AB  - Disturbances alter biodiversity via their specific characteristics, including severity and extent in the landscape, which act at different temporal and spatial scales. Biodiversity response to disturbance also depends on the community characteristics and habitat requirements of species. Untangling the mechanistic interplay of these factors has guided disturbance ecology for decades, generating mixed scientific evidence of biodiversity responses to disturbance. Understanding the impact of natural disturbances on biodiversity is increasingly important due to human-induced changes in natural disturbance regimes. In many areas, major natural forest disturbances, such as wildfires, windstorms, and insect outbreaks, are becoming more frequent, intense, severe, and widespread due to climate change and land-use change. Conversely, the suppression of natural disturbances threatens disturbance-dependent biota. Using a meta-analytic approach, we analysed a global data set (with most sampling concentrated in temperate and boreal secondary forests) of species assemblages of 26 taxonomic groups, including plants, animals, and fungi collected from forests affected by wildfires, windstorms, and insect outbreaks. The overall effect of natural disturbances on α-diversity did not differ significantly from zero, but some taxonomic groups responded positively to disturbance, while others tended to respond negatively. Disturbance was beneficial for taxonomic groups preferring conditions associated with open canopies (e.g. hymenopterans and hoverflies), whereas ground-dwelling groups and/or groups typically associated with shady conditions (e.g. epigeic lichens and mycorrhizal fungi) were more likely to be negatively impacted by disturbance. Across all taxonomic groups, the highest α-diversity in disturbed forest patches occurred under moderate disturbance severity, i.e. with approximately 55% of trees killed by disturbance. We further extended our meta-analysis by applying a unified diversity concept based on Hill numbers to estimate α-diversity changes in different taxonomic groups across a gradient of disturbance severity measured at the stand scale and incorporating other disturbance features. We found that disturbance severity negatively affected diversity for Hill number q = 0 but not for q = 1 and q = 2, indicating that diversity-disturbance relationships are shaped by species relative abundances. Our synthesis of α-diversity was extended by a synthesis of disturbance-induced change in species assemblages, and revealed that disturbance changes the β-diversity of multiple taxonomic groups, including some groups that were not affected at the α-diversity level (birds and woody plants). Finally, we used mixed rarefaction/extrapolation to estimate biodiversity change as a function of the proportion of forests that were disturbed, i.e. the disturbance extent measured at the landscape scale. The comparison of intact and naturally disturbed forests revealed that both types of forests provide habitat for unique species assemblages, whereas species diversity in the mixture of disturbed and undisturbed forests peaked at intermediate values of disturbance extent in the simulated landscape. Hence, the relationship between α-diversity and disturbance severity in disturbed forest stands was strikingly similar to the relationship between species richness and disturbance extent in a landscape consisting of both disturbed and undisturbed forest habitats. This result suggests that both moderate disturbance severity and moderate disturbance extent support the highest levels of biodiversity in contemporary forest landscapes.

AB  - In this narrative review, we summarize the literature and provide updates on recent studies of air pollution exposures and child lung function and lung function growth. We include exposures to outdoor air pollutants that are monitored and regulated through air quality standards, and air pollutants that are not routinely monitored or directly regulated, including wildfires, indoor biomass and coal burning, gas and wood stove use, and volatile organic compounds. Included is a more systematic review of the recent literature on long-term air pollution and child lung function because this is an indicator of future adult respiratory health and exposure assessment tools have improved dramatically in recent years. We present "summary observations" and "knowledge gaps." We end by discussing what is known about what can be done at the individual/household, local/regional, and national levels to overcome structural impediments, reduce air pollution exposures, and improve child lung function. We found a large literature on adverse air pollution effects on children's lung function level and growth; however, many questions remain. Important areas needing further research include whether early-life effects are fixed or reversible; and what are windows of increased susceptibility, long-term effects of repeated wildfire events, and effects of air quality interventions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Wildland fires degrade air quality and adversely affect human health. A growing body of epidemiology literature reports increased rates of emergency departments, hospital admissions and premature deaths from wildfire smoke exposure.
OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to characterize excess mortality and morbidity events, and the economic value of these impacts, from wildland fire smoke exposure in the U.S. over a multi-year period; to date no other burden assessment has done this.
METHODS: We first completed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature and then performed photochemical air quality modeling for the years 2008 to 2012 in the continental U.S. Finally, we estimated the morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of wildland fires.
RESULTS: Our models suggest that areas including northern California, Oregon and Idaho in the West, and Florida, Louisiana and Georgia in the East were most affected by wildland fire events in the form of additional premature deaths and respiratory hospital admissions. We estimated the economic value of these cases due to short term exposures as being between $11 and $20B (2010$) per year, with a net present value of $63B (95% confidence intervals $6-$170); we estimate the value of long-term exposures as being between $76 and $130B (2010$) per year, with a net present value of $450B (95% confidence intervals $42-$1200).
CONCLUSION: The public health burden of wildland fires-in terms of the number and economic value of deaths and illnesses-is considerable.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to summarize the evidence of health impacts of occupational exposure to wildland fires. The authors searched 3 databases for relevant articles and screened the results. After full-text review, articles were included based on pre-determined criteria. The authors identified 32 relevant articles. Occupational exposure to wildland fires affects lung function in the short term and may increase the risk of hypertension in the long term. Exposure to wildland fires is also associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. There was insufficient evidence to comment on most longer-term risks, and in particular on respiratory disease or cancer risks. Further research is required to understand whether occupational exposure to wildland fires results in clinically significant impacts on respiratory function, and to further clarify the relationship between occupational exposure and blood pressure, mental health, and cancer outcomes.

AB  - Exposure to smoke emitted from wildfire and planned burns (i.e., smoke events) has been associated with numerous negative health outcomes, including respiratory symptoms and conditions. This rapid review investigates recent evidence (post-2009) regarding the effectiveness of public health messaging during smoke events. The objectives were to determine the effectiveness of various communication channels used and public health messages disseminated during smoke events, for general and at-risk populations. A search of 12 databases and grey literature yielded 1775 unique articles, of which 10 were included in this review. Principal results were: 1) Smoke-related public health messages are communicated via a variety of channels, but limited evidence is available regarding their effectiveness for the general public or at-risk groups. 2) Messages that use simple language are more commonly recalled, understood, and complied with. Compliance differs according to socio-demographic characteristics. 3) At-risk groups may be advised to stay indoors before the general population, in order to protect the most vulnerable people in a community. The research included in this review was observational and predominantly descriptive, and is therefore unable to sufficiently answer questions regarding effectiveness. Experimental research, as well as evaluations, are required to examine the effectiveness of modern communication channels, channels to reach at-risk groups, and the 'stay indoors' message.

TI  - A systematic review of wild burro grazing effects on Mojave Desert vegetation, USA.
AU  - Abella, Scott R.
T2  - Environmental management
AB  - Wild burros (Equus asinus), protected by the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act on some federal lands but exotic animals many ecologists and resource mangers view as damaging to native ecosystems, represent one of the most contentious environmental management problems in American Southwest arid lands. This review synthesizes the scattered literature about burro effects on plant communities of the Mojave Desert, a center of burro management contentions. I classified 24 documents meeting selection criteria for this review into five categories of research: (i) diet analyses directly determining which plant species burros consume, (ii) utilization studies of individual species, (iii) control-impact comparisons, (iv) exclosure studies, and (v) forage analyses examining chemical characteristics of forage plants. Ten diet studies recorded 175 total species that burros consumed. However, these studies and two exclosure studies suggested that burros preferentially eat graminoid and forb groups over shrubs. One study in Death Valley National Park, for example, found that Achnatherum hymenoides (Indian ricegrass) was 11 times more abundant in burro diets than expected based on its availability. Utilization studies revealed that burros also exhibit preferences within the shrub group. Eighty-three percent of reviewed documents were produced in a 12-year period, from 1972 to 1983, with the most recent document produced in 1988. Because burros remain abundant on many federal lands and grazing may interact with other management concerns (e.g., desert wildfires fueled by exotic grasses), rejuvenating grazing research to better understand both past and present burro effects could help guide revegetation and grazing management scenarios.

TI  - Spotted Owls and forest fire: a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the evidence
AU  - Lee, Derek E.
AB  - Abstract  Forest and Spotted Owl management documents often state that severe wildfire is a cause of recent declines in populations of Spotted Owls and that mixed‐severity fires (5–70% of burned area in high‐severity patches with >75% mortality of dominant vegetation) pose a primary threat to Spotted Owl population viability. This systematic review and meta‐analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially recent mixed‐severity fires with representative patches of high‐severity burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from post‐fire logging. Meta‐analysis of mean standardized effects (Hedge's d ) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a significant positive foraging habitat selection for low‐severity burned forest. Multi‐level mixed‐effects meta‐regressions (hierarchical models) of Hedge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction was positively correlated with the percent of high‐severity fire in owl territories; and positive selection for foraging in low‐ and moderate‐severity burned forest, with high‐severity burned forest used in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta‐analysis of variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in estimates of occupancy, demography, and survival, and lower variation in estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low‐severity burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by mixed‐severity fire, as 83% of all studies and 60% of all effects found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl, mixed‐severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for Spotted Owls.

AU  - Wu, Jun
AB  - Background The frequency and severity of wildfires have been sharply increasing due to climate change, which largely contributes to ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution. We conducted a systematic review focusing on the short-term relationships between PM attributable to wildfires (wildfire-specific PM) and diverse respiratory endpoints, with a comparison between the effects of wildfire-specific PM vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM. Methods A comprehensive online search for the literature published from 2000 to 2022 was conducted through PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and EMBASE. We applied search terms related to wildfire smoke and respiratory health outcomes. Results In total, 3196 articles were retrieved, and 35 articles were included in this review. Most studies focused on the associations of wildfire-specific PM with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) with respiratory emergency department visits or hospitalizations, with a time-series or case-crossover study design. Studies were mostly conducted in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Positive associations of wildfire-specific PM with respiratory morbidity were observed in most studies. Studies that focused on respiratory mortality were limited. Females can be more vulnerable to the respiratory impacts of wildfire PM, while the evidence of vulnerable subpopulations among different age groups was inconclusive. Few studies compared the effects of wildfire-specific vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM, and some reported higher levels of toxicity of wildfire-specific PM, potentially due to its distinct chemical and physical compositions. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most studied diseases, and both were adversely affected by wildfire-specific PM. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first review that systematically summarized the associations of wildfire-specific PM exposure with adverse respiratory outcomes and compared associations of wildfire-specific vs. all-source/non-wildfire PM. Further investigations may add to the literature by examining the impacts on respiratory mortality and the effects of specific PM components from different types of wildfires.

AU  - Grau‐Andrés, Roger

AU  - Pausas, Juli G.
AB  - Abstract  Aim Global change factors, such as warming, heatwaves, droughts and land‐use changes, are intensifying fire regimes (defined here as increasing frequency or severity of fires) in many ecosystems worldwide. A large body of local‐scale research has shown that such intensified fire regimes can greatly impact on ecosystem structure and function through altering plant communities. Here, we aim to find general patterns of plant responses to intensified fire regimes across climates, habitats and fire regimes at the global scale.   Location Worldwide.   Time period Studies published 1962–2023.   Major taxa studied Woody plants, herbs and bryophytes.   Methods We carried out a global systematic review and meta‐analysis of the response of plant abundance, diversity and fitness to increased fire frequency or severity. To assess the context dependency of those responses, we tested the effect of the following variables: fire regime component (fire frequency or severity), time since the last fire, fire type (wildfire or prescribed fire), historical fire regime type (surface or crown fire), plant life form (woody plant, herb or bryophyte), habitat type and climate.   Results  Intensified fire regimes reduced overall plant abundance (Hedges' d = −0.24), diversity ( d = −0.27), and fitness ( d = −0.69). Generally, adverse effects of intensified fire regimes on plants were stronger due to increased severity than frequency, in wildfires compared to prescribed fires, and at shorter times since fire. Adverse effects were also stronger for woody plants than for herbs, and in conifer and mixed forests than in open ecosystems (e.g. grasslands and shrublands).    Main conclusions Intensified fire regimes can substantially alter plant communities in many ecosystems worldwide. Plant responses are influenced by the specific fire regime component that is changing and by the biotic and abiotic conditions.

TI  - Air pollution from biomass burning in India
AU  - Tripathi, Sachchida N.
AU  - Yadav, Shweta
AU  - Sharma, Konika
AB  - Air pollution is the most difficult challenge India is facing today, and anthropogenic biomass burning (ABB) is one of the major and least understood sources, leading to serious health and climate implications by affecting air quality, visibility, atmospheric chemistry, the Earth’s radiation budget and biogeochemical cycling. Scientific understanding of the composition, chemistry and regional dynamics of biomass burning (BB) emissions is still limited, thus constraining the implementation of appropriate research and policy interventions. The broad categories, associated complex emissions and spatio-temporal variations of ABB in India are discussed here. Major types of ABB that are prevalent year-round all over India include BB for cooking, heating purposes and open waste burning. Moreover, crop residue burning (CRB) in the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) during pre- (April–May) and post-monsoon (October–November) seasons, CRB in South India during January–February, forest fires in Central India and slash-and-burn agriculture in Northeast India during March–May are the other dominant sources that are active during specific months and in specific regions. Over the IGP, CRB along with other episodic ABB events and stagnant meteorology result in severe air quality and poor visibility (<∼300 m) with reported daily mean PM2.5 concentrations shooting up to 15 times higher than Central Pollution Control Board standards. When compared with wheat residue burning, higher fire counts and emissions are reported during paddy residue burning events. During winters, BB’s contribution to 37% of the aerosol oxidative potential in Delhi indicates its health implications. Meta-analysis of data obtained from representative source apportionment studies on PM10 shows >24% BB contribution in Assam, Ahmedabad, Kanpur and Visakhapatnam, 20%–24% in Patiala and Kolkata, and 10%–14% in Delhi. With regard to PM2.5, BB contributions of >24% in Ahmedabad and Agra, and 15%–19% in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata are reported, while with regard to PM1, BB contributed 19%–24% in Kanpur, Patiala and Assam and <10% in Delhi. Observed spatio-temporal variations in ABB sources and composition over India call for region-specific solutions through airshed-based management.

TI  - A systematic review of empirical evidence for landscape-level fuel treatment effectiveness
AU  - McKinney, Shawn T.
AU  - Abrahamson, Ilana
AU  - Jain, Theresa
AU  - Anderson, Nathaniel
AB  - BackgroundAdverse effects of wildfires can be mitigated within fuel treatments, but empirical evidence of their effectiveness across large areas is needed to guide design and implementation at the landscape level. We conducted a systematic literature review of empirically based studies that tested the influence of landscape-level fuel treatments on subsequent wildfires in North America over the past 30 years to evaluate how treatment type and configuration affect subsequent wildfire behavior or enable more effective wildfire response.ResultsWe identified 2240 papers, but only 26 met our inclusion criteria. Wildfire sizes ranged from 96 to 186,874 ha and total treated area ranged from 8 to 53,423 ha. Total treated area within a wildfire perimeter was highly correlated with wildfire area (r = 0.89, n = 93 wildfires), and the average proportion of wildfire area that was treated was 22%. All studies demonstrated wildfire behavior changes within treatment boundaries (i.e., site-level effect), but only 12 studies provided evidence that treatments influence wildfires outside of treatment boundaries (i.e., landscape-level effect). These 12 landscape-level papers showed effects on fire severity, fire progression, and fire extent, but were dissimilar in design and analysis approaches, constraining the ability to generalize about the type and configuration of fuel treatments to maximize effectiveness.ConclusionsIt is clear that the state of knowledge based on empirical evidence is at its infancy. This is likely because of the vast challenges associated with designing and implementing sampling designs that account for combinations of spatial and temporal configurations prior to wildfire occurrence. We also suspect part of the reason empirical evidence is lacking is because the distinction between site-level and landscape-level effects is not well recognized in the literature. All papers used the term landscape, but rarely defined the landscape, and some specified identifying landscape-level effects that were truly site-level effects. Future research needs to develop innovative ways to interpret the role of fuel treatments at the landscape level to provide insight on strategic designs and approaches to maximize fuel treatment effectiveness.

AB  - Depression is a common disease with a high prevalence among children and adolescents. Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution can increase the risk of depression. However, studies examining the relationship between air pollution and depression in children and adolescents are still in their nascent stages. We conducted a systematic review of current studies to investigate how air pollution and air quality issues relating to wildfires affect depression in children and adolescents aged 6 to 19. Our study found that both wildfire-related air exposure and air pollution may be associated with an increased risk of depression among children and teenagers. Ozone exerts a short-term impact on depression in young populations, whereas fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and NO2 have a long-term impact. Heterogeneity exists across studies, necessitating further investigation. Attention should be paid to the effects of air pollution and wildfires on the mental health of children and adolescents.

AU  - Barros, Bela
AU  - Oliveira, Marta
AU  - Morais, Simone
AB  - This review systematically gathers and provides an analysis of pollutants levels emitted from wildfire (WF) and their impact on short-term health effects of affected populations. The available literature was searched according to Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (PECOS) database defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a meta-analysis was conducted whenever possible. Data obtained through PECOS characterized information from the USA, Europe, Australia, and some Asian countries; South American countries were seldom characterized, and no data were available for Africa and Russia. Extremely high levels of pollutants, mostly of fine fraction of particulate matter (PM) and ozone, were associated with intense WF emissions in North America, Oceania, and Asia and reported to exceed several-fold the WHO guidelines. Adverse health outcomes include emergency department visits and hospital admissions for cardiorespiratory diseases as well as mortality. Despite the heterogeneity among exposure and health assessment methods, all-cause mortality, and specific-cause mortality were significantly associated with WF emissions in most of the reports. Globally, a significant association was found for all-cause respiratory outcomes including asthma, but mixed results were noted for cardiovascular-related effects. For the latter, estimates were only significant several days after WF emissions, suggesting a more delayed impact on the heart. Different research gaps are presented, including the need for the application of standardized protocols for assessment of both exposure and adverse health risks. Mitigation actions also need to be strengthened, including dedicated efforts to communicate with the affected populations, to engage them for adoption of protective behaviors and measures.

We describe methodological issues in estimating the causal effects of wildfire smoke exposures on health and quantify their importance, emphasizing the role of nonlinear and lagged effects. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the health effects of wildfire smoke exposure, finding positive impacts on all-cause mortality and respiratory hospitalizations but less consistent evidence on cardiovascular morbidity. We conclude by highlighting priority areas for future research, including leveraging recently developed spatially and temporally resolved wildfire-specific ambient air pollution data to improve estimates of the health effects of wildfire smoke exposure.

AB  - Net nitrogen mineralization (<i>N</i><sub>min</sub>) and nitrification regulate soil N availability and loss after severe wildfires in boreal forests experiencing slow vegetation recovery. Yet, how microorganisms respond to postfire phosphorus (P) enrichment to alter soil N transformations remains unclear in N-limited boreal forests. Here, we investigated postfire N-P interactions using an intensive regional-scale sampling of 17 boreal forests in the Greater Khingan Mountains (Inner Mongolia-China), a laboratory P-addition incubation, and a continental-scale meta-analysis. We found that postfire soils had an increased risk of N loss by accelerated <i>N</i><sub>min</sub> and nitrification along with low plant N demand, especially during the early vegetation recovery period. The postfire N/P imbalance created by P enrichment acts as a "N retention" strategy by inhibiting <i>N</i><sub>min</sub> but not nitrification in boreal forests. This strategy is attributed to enhanced microbial N-use efficiency and N immobilization. Importantly, our meta-analysis found that there was a greater risk of N loss in boreal forest soils after fires than in other climatic zones, which was consistent with our results from the 17 soils in the Greater Khingan Mountains. These findings demonstrate that postfire N-P interactions play an essential role in mitigating N limitation and maintaining nutrient balance in boreal forests.

TI  - Fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage

AB  - Temperate forest soils store globally significant amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Understanding how soil pools of these two elements change in response to disturbance and management is critical to maintaining ecosystem services such as forest productivity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water resource protection. Fire is one of the principal disturbances acting on forest soil C and N storage and is also the subject of enormous management efforts. In the present article, we use meta-analysis to quantify fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage. Across a combined total of 468 soil C and N response ratios from 57 publications (concentrations and pool sizes), fire had significant overall effects on soil C (-26%) and soil N (-22%). The impacts of fire on forest floors were significantly different from its effects on mineral soils. Fires reduced forest floor C and N storage (pool sizes only) by an average of 59% and 50%, respectively, but the concentrations of these two elements did not change. Prescribed fires caused smaller reductions in forest floor C and N storage (-46% and -35%) than wildfires (-67% and -69%), and the presence of hardwoods also mitigated fire impacts. Burned forest floors recovered their C and N pools in an average of 128 and 103 years, respectively. Among mineral soils, there were no significant changes in C or N storage, but C and N concentrations declined significantly (-11% and -12%, respectively). Mineral soil C and N concentrations were significantly affected by fire type, with no change following prescribed burns, but significant reductions in response to wildfires. Geographic variation in fire effects on mineral soil C and N storage underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and the role of fire type in mediating C and N shifts (especially in the forest floor) indicates that averting wildfires through prescribed burning is desirable from a soils perspective.

AB  - <p>There is a growing recognition that there needs to be a shift from firefighting to wildfire prevention (through fuel and landscape management and engagement with stakeholders) of which disaster risk reduction plays a major role. In the Netherlands, where flood and water has been centrally managed from 1798, there has been a shift from fighting against water (disaster management) to flood risk reduction and living with water. The same approach is needed in integrated fire management and thus there are lessons that can be learnt from this for society, agencies and government. Integrated fire management which consists of science-based decision making by multidisciplinary teams through cooperation and collaboration of parties involved and affected. Fire science is multi-disciplinary and needs to be addressed in a multi-disciplinary manner. Challenges faced in both sectors are similar in terms of scale, governance and engaging with society. A systematic literature review lead to the identification of lessons from Dutch water management and Room for the River Programme that may be applied to integrated fire management. In the Netherlands there is a recognition that (flood) risk management should be a programmed, flexible process of continuous improvement of management practices by active learning about current interventions and drivers of change. The expected results will provide guidance on how to improve prevention of wildfires within Integrated Fire Management.</p>

TI  - How to measure the economic health cost of wildfires – A systematic review of the literature for northern America
AU  - Dittrich, Ruth
AU  - McCallum, Stuart
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the economic health cost from smoke exposure from wildfires in the past 20 years, particularly in the north-western USA that is reflected in an emergent literature. In this review, we provide an overview and discussion of studies since 2006 on the health impacts of wildfire smoke and of approaches for the estimation of the associated economic cost. We focus on the choice of key variables such as cost estimators for determining the economic impact of mortality and morbidity effects. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion and guidance on the functioning, advantages and challenges of BenMAP-CE, freely available software of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that has been used in a growing number of studies to assess cost from wildfire smoke. We highlight what generates differences in outcomes between relevant studies and make suggestions for increasing the comparability between studies. All studies, however, demonstrate highly significant health cost from smoke exposure, in the millions or billions of US dollars, often driven by increases in mortality. The results indicate the need to take health cost into account for a comprehensive analysis of wildfire impacts.

TI  - How Does Fire Suppression Alter the Wildfire Regime? A Systematic Review
AU  - Hai, Jiaying
AU  - Zhang, Ling
AU  - Gao, Cong
AU  - Wang, Han
AU  - Wu, Jiansheng
AB  - Fire suppression has become a fundamental approach for shaping contemporary wildfire regimes. However, a growing body of research suggests that aggressive fire suppression can increase high-intensity wildfires, creating the wildfire paradox. Whether the strategy always triggers the paradox remains a topic of ongoing debate. The role of fire suppression in altering wildfire regimes in diverse socio-ecological systems and associated research designs demands a deeper understanding. To reconcile these controversies and synthesize the existing knowledge, a systematic review has been conducted to screen 974 studies on the relationship between fire suppression and wildfire regimes. The rigorous screening process led to the selection of 37 studies that met our stringent criteria for inclusion. The selected literature was quantitatively analyzed in terms of study areas, study design and methods, and the impact of fire suppression on wildfire regimes. Several critical findings were revealed: 1. Numerous studies have focused on northern mid- and high-latitude biomes, neglecting tropical savannas where wildfires are frequent and intense. Further exploration in these regions is imperative. 2. Existing studies have predominantly employed methods such as difference analysis, regression analysis, and scenario simulations. Appropriate methods could be selected based on the study area, data availability, and understanding of fire regimes. 3. Despite the consensus that fire suppression reduces the total burned area, the emergence of the wildfire paradox remains controversial, with approximately equal amounts of the literature supporting and contradicting the wildfire paradox. A noteworthy pattern was observed: the wildfire paradox is more likely to occur in fuel-limited systems, specific vegetation types, and smaller scale and longer term studies. This systematic review highlights that the occurrence of the wildfire paradox is intricately tied to ecosystem feedback mechanisms for suppression and the research scale adopted. It is necessary to incorporate a comprehensive and multi-scale assessment of how local wildlands respond to suppression into wildfire management policy-making processes. This assessment will ensure a more informed and effective wildfire management strategy adapted to local conditions.

AB  - Wildfires are known to be one of the main causes of soil erosion and land degradation, and their impacts on ecosystems and society are expected to increase in the future due to changes in climate and land use. It is therefore vital to mitigate the increased hydrological and erosive response after wildfires to maintain the sustainability of ecosystems and protect the values at risk downstream from the fire-affected areas. Soil erosion mitigation treatments have been widely applied after wildfires but assessment of their effectiveness has been limited to local and regional-scale studies, whose conclusions may depend heavily on site-specific conditions. To overcome this limitation, a meta-analysis approach was applied to investigations of post-wildfire soil erosion mitigation treatments published in peer-reviewed journals. A meta-analysis database was compiled that consisted of 53 and 222 pairs of treated/untreated observations on post-fire runoff and erosion, respectively, extracted from 34 publications indexed in Scopus. The overall effectiveness of mitigation treatments, expressed as the quantitative metric ‘effect size’, was determined for both the runoff and erosion observations, and further analyzed for four different types of treatments (cover-based, barriers, seeding, and chemical treatments). The erosion observations involving cover-based treatments were analyzed for differences in effectiveness between 3 different types of mulch materials (straw, wood-based, and hydromulch) as well as between different application rates of straw and wood materials. Finally, the erosion observations were also analyzed for the overall effectiveness of post-fire year, burn severity, rainfall amount and erosivity, and ground cover. The meta-analysis results show that all four types of treatments significantly reduced post-fire soil erosion, but that only the cover and barrier treatments significantly reduced post-fire runoff. From the three different cover treatments, straw and wood mulches were significantly more effective in mitigating erosion than hydromulch. In addition, the effectiveness of both straw and wood mulches depended on their application rates. Straw mulching was less effective at rates below than above 200 g m−2, while mulching with wood materials at high rates (1300 to 1750 g m−2) produced more variable outcomes than lower rates. Results also suggest that the overall effectiveness of the treatments was greatest shortly after fire, in severely burned sites, providing or promoting the development of ground cover over 70%, and that it increased with increasing rainfall erosivity. It can be concluded that, in overall terms, the application of the studied post-fire erosion mitigation treatments represented a better choice than doing nothing, especially in sites where erosion is high. However, the meta-analysis highlights under-representation of studies on this topic outside of the USA, Spain and Portugal. It was also observed that most of the studies were conducted at hillslope scale and tested mulching (namely straw, wood and hydromulch) and/or barriers, while larger scales and other treatments were scarcely addressed. Further efforts need to be made in testing, from field and modeling studies, combinations of existing and/or emerging erosion mitigation treatments to ensure that the most adequate measures are applied after fires.

AB  - Global environmental and social change are pushing wildfire activity and impact beyond known trajectories. Here, we conducted a targeted review to distill five wildfire challenges that we argue form opportunities for their governance (research aim 1). We exemplified our arguments by drawing from the case of Cyprus (research aim 2), a small island country in the south-east European Mediterranean Basin at risk of extreme wildfire impact. Findings indicate that burning for social and ecological resource benefits, innovative management paradigms and anticipatory governance systems offer actionable solutions to the wildfire paradox and the limits of suppression. Local adaptive institutions and a reconceptualisation of wildfire as a risk and process beyond technocratic interpretations are necessary to account for broader social conditions shaping wildfire regimes and community impact. Governance systems that accommodate collective action have proven suitable to address multiple wildfire complexities linked with different socio-economic systems and values. A systematic literature review, policy review, and qualitative data collection on wildfire management in Cyprus track back to the initial framing. Our case study offers insights for tackling wildfires with actionable steps through overarching governance systems, and illustrates the potential for change in thinking of and acting on wildfire in flammable landscapes globally.

AB  - We assessed how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests through a systematic review of the international empirical research literature. We found that drought, precipitation variability, extreme precipitation and flooding, and extreme heat were the climatic stressors to which responses were most frequently documented. Individuals and households received the most research attention, followed by national government, civil society, and local government. Europe and North America were the geographic foci of more research than other regions. Behavioral responses were more reported than technical and infrastructural responses and institutional responses. Within these types of responses, actors used a wide variety of practices such as replanting, altering species composition, and adopting or changing technology. Adaptation efforts in early planning and advanced implementation received some attention, but early implementation and expanding implementation were most reported. While connections between responses and risk reduction were discussed, there is limited evidence of risk reduction. Our review contributes to the scholarly and practical understanding of how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests. The review also identifies opportunities for future research on adaptation to other climatic stressors, such as wildfires and tree pests and pathogens, adaptation in other geographic areas, especially Oceania, and adaptation by actors beyond the individual and household level and through institutional adaptation efforts.

AB  - Abstract California has large and diverse biomass resources and provides a pertinent example of how biomass use is changing and needs to change, in the face of climate mitigation policies. As in other areas of the world, California needs to optimize its use of biomass and waste to meet environmental and socioeconomic objectives. We used a systematic review to assess biomass use pathways in California and the associated impacts on climate and air quality. Biomass uses included the production of renewable fuels, electricity, biochar, compost, and other marketable products. For those biomass use pathways recently developed, information is available on the effects—usually beneficial—on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and there is some, but less, published information on the effects on criteria pollutants. Our review identifies 34 biomass use pathways with beneficial impacts on either GHG or pollutant emissions, or both—the “good.” These included combustion of forest biomass for power and conversion of livestock‐associated biomass to biogas by anaerobic digestion. The review identified 13 biomass use pathways with adverse impacts on GHG emissions, criteria pollutant emissions, or both—the “bad.” Wildfires are an example of one out of eight pathways which were found to be bad for both climate and air quality, while only two biomass use pathways reduced GHG emissions relative to an identified counterfactual but had adverse air quality impacts. Issues of high interest for the “future” included land management to reduce fire risk, future policies for the dairy industries, and full life‐cycle analysis of biomass production and use.

AU  - Kalies, Elizabeth L.
AB  - We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of forest thinning and burning treatments on restoring fire behavior attributes in western USA pine forests. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), with co-occurring species, are adapted to a disturbance regime of frequent surface fires, but extended fire exclusion and other factors have led to historically uncharacteristically dense stands and high fuel loadings, supporting high-severity fires. Treatments to begin to reverse these changes and reduce fuel hazards have been tested experimentally and observations of wildfire behavior in treated stands have also been reported. Using a systematic review methodology, we found 54 studies with quantitative data suitable for meta-analysis. Combined treatments (thinning+burning) tended to have the greatest effect on reducing surface fuels and stand density, and raising modeled crowning and torching indices, as compared to burning or thinning alone. However, changes in canopy base height and canopy bulk density were not consistently related to treatment intensity, as measured by basal area reduction. There are a number of qualifications to the findings. First, because it is not feasible to subject treated areas to severe fire experimentally, inferences about potential fire behavior rely on imperfect modeling techniques. Second, research has not been carried uniformly over the ranges of the pine forests, although we found no significant differences in treatment effects between regions or forest types. Overall, however, meta-analysis of the literature to date strongly indicates that thinning and/or burning treatments do have effects consistent with the restoration of low-severity fire behavior.

TI  - Post-fire effects on DOC concentrations in streams: A meta-analysis
AU  - Polack Huaman, Jessenia
AB  - Forest fires affects extensive areas each year around the world. An important percentage of those areas represent forested watersheds which provide water supply for different communities, from the microbial till the industrial scale. Forest fires can have an effect in erosion, runoff rates, loss of vegetation cover, rainfall interception, water repellence, among others, which affect the water quality in the streams. The change in the dynamic of a burned watershed produce variation in the DOC concentration, among other water quality parameters, which has a direct impact in the drinking water treatment. This meta-analysis explores post-fire effects in DOC concentrations, during the years after the fire. More than 50 watersheds were identified in the collection of the information. Changes in concentrations were documented primarily within the first 5 years after the fire. The studies were published between 2001 and 2020. We found that percentage of area burned, and fire severity have stronger effect on DOC concentrations. The study documents strong heterogeneity in responses to post-fire effects and DOC concentrations.

AU  - Prieto-Benítez, Samuel
AU  - Méndez, Marcos
AB  - Human land use, through forest management and conversion of natural habitats into agroecosystems, has often resulted in loss of biodiversity. Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected.

AB  - Forest soils have significant potential to mitigate climate change through their ability to store large amounts of organic carbon. However, forests are increasingly subject to natural disturbances such as windthrow, wildfire or disease outbreaks, which threaten the permanence of this large carbon stock. In response to increasing disturbances and ongoing climate change, forests are expected to lose their ability to return to pre-disturbance conditions involving a reorganization of tree species composition and stand structure. If tipping points are crossed, even a complete vegetation shift and conversion to non-forest ecosystems is possible. Here we aimed to assess the sensitivity of forest soil carbon to disturbance and its recovery with contrasting successional trajectories by combining two field studies on soil carbon stocks in windthrown forest stands and a global meta-analysis on the effects of different disturbance agents. Our results along an altitudinal gradient in Switzerland show that mountain forests with high carbon stocks in thick organic layers were particularly sensitive to disturbance by windthrow, losing up to 90% of their carbon stored belowground. In contrast, low-elevation forest soils with thin organic layers and smaller carbon stocks were barely affected. These results are consistent with our meta-analysis, which shows that disturbance-induced carbon losses increase with the size of initial carbon stocks. Boreal and high-elevation forests with large soil carbon stocks are highly sensitive to severe and long-lasting carbon losses due to damage from storms, wildfire, insects, and harvesting, while in most temperate and tropical forests soil carbon stocks recover more rapidly and losses are smaller. Results from a disturbance chronosequence in Austria also suggest that vegetation shifts following forest damage can strongly influence the recovery of soil carbon stocks after disturbance. Disturbed sites that remained in a non-forest, grass-dominated state for three decades accumulated about a third more soil carbon than sites that regenerated with trees. In addition to high litter inputs from herbaceous fine roots at grass-dominated sites, we relate this difference to changes in microbial community structure and function. In conclusion, our results underline that the magnitude and duration of soil carbon losses after disturbance depend on the forest type and site specific soil properties. Moreover, vegetation shifts during succession significantly modify the re-accumulation of soil carbon after disturbance.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things application communication is an emerging concept that effectuates the foreknowledge of innovative technologies. With the accelerated advancements in IoT applications, the importance of this technology became more impactful and persistent. Moreover, this technology has demonstrated useful contributions across various domains, ranging from general to specific applications. Examples include wildfire monitoring, coastal area monitoring, deforestation monitoring, and sensitive military operations, where human access is limited or not feasible. These examples underscore the technology’s importance in scenarios where direct human involvement is challenging or impossible. Although this technology offers numerous benefits, it is essential to note that it also faces several challenges. Among these, Quality of Service (QoS) is a key concern, which limits its useability in various applications. Unfortunately, most researchers in the present literature have overlooked this important factor without giving it considerable attention. To fill this gap, we are presenting a systematic review of the present literature associated with the QoS metrics of this emerging technology from 2015 to 2023 to highlight their contributions and limitations. Based on the systematic review, we highlight the open challenges of this technology to set a roadmap for futuristic research. Finally, we compared each portion of this work with the previously published review articles to confirm the essence of this work, along with an explanation of why this survey is needed and in-time.

TI  - Fire effects on anurans: What we know so far?
AU  - dos Anjos, Amanda Gomes
AU  - Solé, Mirco
AU  - Benchimol, Maíra
AB  - Fire is a powerful environmental disturbance with the ability to shape many biomes worldwide. However, global warming, land-use changes and other anthropogenic factors have strongly altered natural fire regimes worldwide. Despite the growing number of studies evaluating the effects of fire on biodiversity, little is understood about how burn affects certain groups that are particularly sensitive to climatic extremes, such as anurans. Here, we conducted a global and systematic literature review of studies assessing anurofauna responses to fire disturbances. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and theoretical information criteria to assess how fire affects anuran assemblages. We analyzed 68 studies, widely distributed in the globe, which examined the fire effects on abundance, richness and/or species behavior. In total, 191 species were considered, being Gastrophryne carolinensis and Lithobates catesbeianus the most evaluated. We reveal a lack of general anurofauna response to fire, as species and assemblages were either negatively or positively affected by burns. We observed that the fire treatments (Prescribed fire, Wildfire and without fire) and the biome where the study was conducted did not explain the variation in species abundance. Most studies were conducted in biomes classified as Temperate Forests, followed by Tropical Savannas and Tropical Forests. We highlight that future studies should consider factors associated to fire (e.g. fire treatment, fire properties), research design and species biology to explain patterns of species persistence and community structure. Although fire plays a key role in shaping several natural ecosystems, we have recently witnessed drastic changes in natural burning regimes all over the world, which imply leading to severe population reductions and even species extinctions. Given this scenario, government authorities should urgently support and invest in scientific studies that evaluate, monitor and test fire management practices in natural ecosystems and therefore establish mitigation actions to preserve the biota constantly threatened by the imbalance of this environmental disturbance.

AB  - Wildfires occur repeatedly every year and have a negative impact on natural ecosystems. Anticipation of wildfires is very necessary, therefore a prediction model is needed that can produce predictions with a good level of accuracy. One approach to develop probabilistic prediction models is Bayesian inference. The purpose of this research is to review the methods that can be used in developing probabilistic prediction models using the Bayesian approach. The methodology used is Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which can be used to provide a comprehensive review of Bayesian inference research in developing probabilistic prediction models. The research strategy used was the Boolean Technique applied to database sources including Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ArXiv. The articles used have novelty and ease of explanation of Bayesian methods, especially predictions in the field of climate so that articles are selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that probabilistic models can provide more accurate results than deterministic models. The Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method is a widely used method because it is easy to implement and develop so that the prediction results can be more accurate. The development of probabilistic prediction models with a Bayesian approach has great potential to grow as seen from the development of the number of research publications over the past 5 years. The research position of probabilistic prediction models with Bayesian approaches in the field of climate is dominated by the research community in China with the main problems related to hydrology.

AB  - There is an increasing rise in the number of publications addressing social vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation (SVRA) aspects of natural hazards and climate change. Despite the abundance of research in this field, a systematic understanding of how these studies are theoretically grounded is lacking.In this study, we conducted a systematic review of 4432 articles that address SVRA across a range of disciplinary fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, geography, mathematics) and natural hazards (e.g. floods, droughts, landslides, storm surges, wildfires, tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcano eruptions). We investigate the extent to which these studies explicate the frameworks, theoretical constructs or theories they rely on.Our findings indicate that about 90% of the studies under consideration do not explicitly refer to a theoretical underpinning. Overall, theories focusing on individuals' SVRA were more frequent than those focusing on systems, society, groups, and networks. Furthermore, the uptake of theories varied according to the hazard investigated and field of knowledge, being more frequent in wildfire and flood studies and articles published in social science journals.We argue that the abundance of empirical material in SVRA research that lacks explicit theoretical grounding is objectionable. As a result, SVRA research seems to spin in circles: researchers repeatedly conduct similar analyses in different geographical settings with inconsistent or incommensurable findings. Thus, we recommend making theoretical considerations salient to foster more transparent, comparable, and robust empirical research on SVRA.

TI  - Insuring homes against extreme weather events: a systematic review of the research
AU  - Lucas, C.

T2  - Climatic Change
AB  - Home insurance for extreme weather events is a significant security mechanism not only for individual households but for global finance. As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, home insurance has been identified by governments as a critical tool for climate adaptation and disaster resilience. However, the growing research literature on the interactions between household insurance and extreme climatic events has not previously been systematically reviewed. In this paper, we analyse 175 original peer-reviewed empirical research papers on this subject, published between 2009 and 2018. We identify areas of research focus, themes, spatial and temporal patterns, and knowledge gaps, and examine policy implications of these findings. We find that an overall focus on flood insurance leaves unanswered questions about the different insurantial challenges posed by storms and wildfire. We suggest existing technocratic and calculative insurance narratives obscure the political and moral assumptions embedded within them, and that these assumptions warrant further investigation in the context of socially legitimate insurance against the impact of extreme weather events.

TI  - Hyperspectral Remote Sensing of Forest Fire Breakouts: A Review
AU  - Dahiya, Pooja
AU  - Rathi, Kavita
AB  - Ecosystems, human lives, and property are all seriously threatened by wildfires, hence effective monitoring and management techniques are required. Hyperspectral remote sensing has emerged as a promising tool for detecting and monitoring forest fire breakouts due to its ability to capture detailed spectral information across a wide range of wavelengths. However, despite its potential, several challenges hinder its widespread application in this domain. Challenges include the complexity of spectral data analysis, limited spatial resolution, and the need for robust algorithms for fire detection and monitoring. Existing works in hyperspectral remote sensing of forest fires have made strides in addressing these challenges but are often limited in scope or lack comprehensive analyses. Thus, there is a pressing need for a systematic review that consolidates existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and proposes avenues for future research. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of hyperspectral remote sensing techniques for forest fire breakout detection and monitoring. We discuss the key challenges, methodologies, and findings from previous studies, and highlight areas requiring further investigation. By synthesizing existing literature, this review aims to guide researchers and practitioners towards more effective strategies for forest fire management and mitigation.

AB  - Climate change is intensifying global wildfire activity, and people and wildlife are increasingly exposed to hazardous air pollution during large-scale smoke events. Although wildfire smoke is considered a growing risk to public health, few studies have investigated the impacts of wildfire smoke on wildlife, particularly among species that are vulnerable to smoke inhalation. In this review, we synthesized research to date on how wildfire smoke affects the health and behavior of wildlife. After executing a systematic search using Web of Science, we found only 41 relevant studies. We synthesized findings from this literature and incorporated knowledge gained from fields outside wildlife science, specifically veterinary medicine and air pollution toxicology. Although studies that directly investigated effects of smoke on wildlife were few in number, they show that wildfire smoke contributes to adverse acute and chronic health outcomes in wildlife and influences animal behavior. Our review demonstrates that smoke inhalation can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, respiratory distress, neurological impairment, respiratory and cardiovascular disease, oxidative stress, and immunosuppression in wildlife, including terrestrial and aquatic species, and these health effects can contribute to changes in movement and vocalization. Some species also use smoke as a cue to engage in fire-avoidance behaviors or to conserve energy. However, our review also highlights significant gaps in our understanding of the impacts of wildfire smoke on wildlife. Most notably, the lack of robust air pollution measurements in existing studies limits meta-analyses and hinders construction of dose-response relationships, thereby precluding predictions of health outcomes and behaviors under different air quality conditions, especially during extreme smoke events. We recommend that future studies leverage existing data sets, infrastructure, and tools to rapidly advance research on this important conservation topic and highlight the potential value of interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and atmospheric chemists.

TI  - Systematic Investigation of the Effect of Wildfire Events and Risks on Property Values
AU  - Ma, Qiuhua
AB  - Wildfires frequency and severity have been increasing in the western United States over the past few decades. Previous hedonic studies investigating wildfire examined the effect of occurrence and risk independently, overlooking the potentially confounding influence. Further, these studies find mixed and/or inconsistent results, which are complicated by a variety of data availability issues as well as varied econometric modeling decisions made by analysts. This analysis applies spatial econometrics modeling strategies in a hedonic pricing model framework to examine the joint effect of both past fire occurrence and current risk on property values in Santa Fe County, New Mexico. Overall, variations in data and econometric modeling techniques yield 2,000 regression results for hedonic models. Using hedonic results as primary estimates, I then employ an internal meta-analysis to investigate what factors explain variation in wildfire effects.

TI  - Developing Social Capital as a Response to the Wildfire Problem
AU  - Prante, Tyler
AB  - This research analyzes the use of natural resource management techniques that attempt to build social capital. As an application, a primary focus is on the policy response to wildfire. The principal research is segmented into 3 related chapters. First, meta-analysis is used to statistically summarize the literature of Coasean bargaining experiments. Results from this analysis suggest that the social dimensions characterizing an experiment impact bargaining behavior on a magnitude similar to that of variables that describe transaction costs. This result suggests an increased focus in future experimental work on the impact of social dimension characteristics is warranted. Next, revealed preference analysis is applied to a unique forest management program in New Mexico. The Collaborative Forest Restoration Program includes stakeholders actively in the creation and implantation of management on federal forested lands. Statistical analysis of the funding pattern from the program reveals that developing social capital and maintaining forest health stand out among a set of potentially divergent goals, while implementing projects that span multiple land jurisdictions is argued to be a missed opportunity for developing social capital. Finally, experimental economics is used to analyze the effectiveness of a set of potential policy tools to induce private spending on wildfire risk mitigation. The policy tools considered here are shown to have the opposite impact, reducing private spending. When success is assessed alternatively by the probability of engaging in risk mitigation, these policy tools have the desired effect. Given the potential to crowd out private expenditure and the sensitivity to the specific mitigation objective, the implementation of these policy tools takes on greater significance.

Landscape fires include wildfires and land management fires and are associated with hundreds of thousands of deaths per year globally through the contribution to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other sources of air pollution. In this chapter, we describe different exposure assessment techniques that are used to estimate health outcomes from global to regional scales, including atmospheric models, remote sensing, and ground station observations. We then evaluate various methodological approaches used in the epidemiologic literature to assess mortality and respiratory and cardiovascular disease outcomes associated with smoke pollution exposure in adult populations, excluding occupational settings. We describe current gaps in the literature, which include understudied health outcomes, medically and socially vulnerable populations, geographic disparities in health studies, and co-occurring exposures. We conclude with a discussion of interventions to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with wildfire smoke pollution exposure, such as reducing landscape fire risk or limiting smoke exposure in indoor settings. In summation, we here present a contemporary overview of the literature regarding the complex, dynamic issue of landscape fire smoke exposure evaluation, epidemiology, and adult health outcomes.

These sagebrush rangelands comprise a unique biome spanning 11 states, support over 350 wildlife species, and provide important ecosystem services that include stabilizing the economies of western communities. Impacts to sagebrush ecosystem processes over large areas due to the annual grass-wildfire cycle necessitated the development of a coordinated, science-based strategy for improving efforts to achieve long-term protection, conservation, and restoration of sagebrush rangelands, which was framed in 2015 under the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy (IRFMS). Central to this effort was the development of an Actionable Science Plan (Plan) that identified 37 priority science needs (Needs) for informing the actions proposed under the 5 topics (Fire, Invasives, Restoration, Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse, Climate and Weather) that were part of the collective focus of the IRFMS. Notable keys to this effort were identification of the Needs co-produced by managers and researchers, and a focus on resulting science being “actionable.”Substantial investments aimed at fulfilling the Needs identified in the Plan have been made since its release in 2016. While the state of the science has advanced considerably, the extent to which knowledge gaps remain relative to identified Needs is relatively unknown. Moreover, new Needs have likely emerged since the original strategy as results from actionable science reveal new questions and possible (yet untested) solutions. A quantifiable assessment of the progress made on the original science Needs can identify unresolved gaps and new information that can help inform prioritization of future research efforts.This report details a systematic literature review that evaluated how well peer-reviewed journal articles and formal technical reports published between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, addressed nine needs (hereinafter, “Needs”) identified under the Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse topic in the Plan. The topic outlined research Needs broadly focused on understanding sagebrush rangelands and population dynamics important for the conservation and management of sage-grouse and other sagebrush-reliant wildlife species. We established the level of progress towards addressing each Need following a standardized set of criteria, and developed summaries detailing how research objectives nested within Needs identified in the Plan (‘Next Steps’) were either addressed well, partially addressed or remain outstanding (in other words, addressed poorly) in the literature through 2020. Our searches resulted in the inclusion of 333 science products that at least partially addressed a Need identified in the Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse topic. The Needs that were well and partially addressed included:development of biome-wide mapping techniques that provide regularly updated grassland and shrubland vegetation layers (Need 4);generation of spatially explicit greater sage-grouse habitat suitability and population models (Need 5);identification of greater sage-grouse seasonal habitats (Need 6);identification of thresholds for the extent of threats, especially conifer expansion, above which greater sage-grouse and other sagebrush-obligate species cannot persist (Need 8); andstudies of sagebrush community dynamics as those relate to management and restoration of sagebrush rangelands (Need 9).Needs addressed poorly included:investigations of factors conducive and restrictive to greater sage-grouse movement patterns and population connectivity (Need 1);investigations of livestock and other large ungulate (for example, feral horse) grazing effects on greater sage-grouse populations and habitats (Need 2);identification of thresholds of disturbance (especially renewable energy developments) below which greater sage-grouse and other sagebrush reliant species are not impacted (Need 3); andstudies of habitat relationships for sagebrush-reliant species other than greater sage-grouse, songbirds, and small mammals (Need 7).The information provided in this assessment will assist updating the Plan along with other science strategies.

During public health crises, clear, accurate, and actionable information must be disseminated to multiple audiences swiftly, even as the science and context may be evolving quickly. The challenges for effectively reaching linguistically diverse audiences are multiplied by public health crises. In this chapter, we provide context and theory for understanding potential pitfalls in communicating during public health emergencies and review relevant theoretical frameworks and the research evidence to guide effective communication efforts to mitigate disparities in access to health information and resultant inequities in health outcomes.

Record temperatures in 2020, as reported in 2021 by the international collaboration, Lancet Countdown, which monitors the health consequences of a changing climate, resulted in increased person-days of heatwave exposure, with serious health consequences, compared with the annual average for the 1986–2005 baseline.1 The world temperature increased 1.2°C compared with the preindustrial period (1850–1900), and the past 7 years have been the hottest 7 years on record.1Heatwaves and rising mean temperatures present major health problems, especially for populations with limited physiological ability or socioeconomic means to respond or adapt to them. Also in 2020, 84 disasters from floods, droughts, wildfires, and storms affected more than 50 million people. Moreover, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are now 50% higher than in the preindustrial era.2 Although energy-related emissions decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, emissions have risen again in 2021.3Importantly, the effects of CECs are ubiquitous, ranging from their effects on an individual's internal biology to their effects on a society's external systems. Sexual maturation, fertility, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, lactation, and menopause (Fig. 1) are subject to short- and long-term negative effects from CECs.FIG. 1. Effects of CECs on women's reproductive health (sexual maturation, fertility, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause). CECs, climate and environmental changes; GDM, gestational diabetes; LBW, low birth weight; PTB, preterm birth.Sexual Maturation and FertilityIn recent years, the global average age for menarche has been declining.4 Importantly, CECs could alter the age of menarche by disrupting food availability, nutritional factors, or through increased toxin/pollutant release.4 Perturbations in the timing of menarche may further affect mental health, fertility-related conditions, cardiovascular disease, and bone health.5 Moreover, an inverse association between mortality and the timing of menarche has been suggested.6The significant amount of pollutants discharged into the environment due to increasing industrial and agricultural activities is a serious threat for human health. Moreover, several of these synthetic chemicals with long half-life times are classified as potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and can affect women's reproductive health.7In addition to the impact of CECs on diet and nutrition, exposure to EDCs has also been associated with early menarche.4 These reproductive toxicants in air pollution can also cause defects during gametogenesis leading to impaired fertility.4 Air pollution may further aggravate asthma,8 which is associated with difficulties in conception.9 EDCs may also adversely affect the ovarian reserve in women and high levels of EDCs have been linked to a decline in ovarian function, infertility, and earlier menopause.10Pregnancy OutcomesPregnant women have been included among the groups most vulnerable to heat stress as the physiological and anatomical changes that occur during pregnancy pose particular challenges to thermoregulation.11 A recent systematic review including a total of almost 33 million births found a significant association between heat, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and stillbirth in the United States.12 It has also been reported that pregnant women who are exposed to higher air pollution levels may be at greater risk for miscarriage, gestational diabetes, PTB, and stillbirths.12,13 Maternal metabolites and metabolic pathways, perturbed by air pollution exposures, may also lead to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes; thus, they can be considered mediators in the causal pathways.14Moreover, prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) has an impact on pregnancy outcomes and the offspring's development and lifelong health, and natural disasters contribute to PNMS.15 PTB and neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring have been associated with PNMS,15 and it is now recognized that maternal stress may be passed on, both intergenerationally and transgenerationally through epigenetic mechanisms.16CECs also affect the distribution of arthropod-borne, foodborne, and waterborne diseases. Arboviral infections transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue, chikungunya viruses, and Zika, may have detrimental effects during pregnancy and may contribute to PTB.17 Zika virus has also been associated with congenital fetal brain abnormalities, including microcephaly.17 Moreover, increased temperatures and rainfall increase the length of the transmission season for parasites with deleterious effects in pregnancy such as Plasmodium falciparum. Pregnant women infected with malaria show not only higher rates of miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death, PTB, LBW neonates, and neonatal death, but also have a higher risk for severe anemia and maternal death.18 Higher temperatures may further increase the risk of cholera and other infections caused by Vibrio bacteria as well as leptospirosis with negative clinical consequences.Lactation and BreastfeedingIn contrast with infant formula, which has a standardized composition, human milk composition changes dynamically throughout the day and throughout gestation. Importantly, human milk can contain environmental pollutants,19 and pollutants with lipophilic properties may have serious effects when absorbed in the neonate digestive track; the presence of heavy metals in human breast milk has been associated with abnormal immune function in the neonate and allergy, endocrine disorders, neurodevelopment delay, and neuropsychiatric disorders later in life.20However, it is important to note that the American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization still recommend breastfeeding for at least the first 6 months of life. Breastfeeding is not only beneficial for the mother and neonate but also for the environment, minimizing the impact on the earth's resources. Specifically, breastfeeding uses less water or land resources, produces no carbon emissions, and generates minimal or zero waste. To put things in perspective, breastfeeding for 6 months saves an estimated 95–153 kg CO2 equivalents per baby compared with infants fed with formula.21 In the United Kingdom alone, the carbon emission savings gained by supporting mothers to breastfeed has been equated to taking between 50,000 and 77,500 cars off the road each year.22MenopauseCECs increase the exposure of women to EDCs resulting in a decline in ovarian function and earlier menopause.10 Specifically, individuals with higher levels of EDCs experience menopause 1.9–3.8 years earlier than women with lower levels of these chemicals.23 EDC-exposed women are also up to six times more likely to be menopausal than nonexposed women of same age.23 Interestingly, CECs may also affect menopause by exacerbating and increasing the duration of symptoms, specifically hot flashes.24ConclusionsThe current climate crisis is threatening global health and disproportionally affects disadvantaged communities. The literature in this space is increasing and opportunities for novel research exist. Importantly, CECs not only negatively impact many stages of a woman's reproductive life but also impact the health of future generations. The impact of CECs on reproductive health can no longer be ignored. Interventions to mitigate CECs are critical to ensuring the future health of women and children worldwide.DisclaimerThe contents of this article represent the authors' views and do not constitute an official position of the National Institutes of Health or the U.S. Government.References1.

TI  - SP39 What fascial plain blocks can and cannot do
T2  - Invited speakers
A2  - Lönnqvist, Per-Arne
AB  - <h3>Background</h3> The first brachial plexus block is often attributed to Halsted who during skin infiltration anesthesia with cocaine, dissected the brachial plexus and placed cocaine directly on to the nerve structures.<sup>1</sup> This was of cause associated with excellent precision but represented a quite awkward technique to produce a peripheral nerve block. Development of better syringes and needles produced a change of practice, instead using landmarks and fascial pops and clicks as well as searching for paresthesia to determine where to inject the local anesthetic. However, this reduced the precision and the success rate to an extent that did not impress many surgical colleagues and was often associated with prolonged paresthesia-induced nerve injury-like sequalae. Nerve stimulator guidance provided a real improvement that increased success rate and reduced the risk for nerve injury. Further, the report by Kapral in 1994 of ultrasound guided regional anesthesia represented a seminal breakthrough that allowed, not only orientation of the needle tip immediately close to the target nerve structures, but also visualization of the local spread of the injected local anesthetic.<sup>2</sup> If not optimal, then the needle tip can be re-localized and the injection repeated until a satisfactory spread is achieved. In a way this represents going full circle from Halstead, thus, allowing perfect visualization of both nerve structures and the spread of local anesthetic. In a sense peripheral regional anesthesia was perfected by ultrasound guidance, especially if occasionally used as a combined technique with nerve stimulation then visualization with ultrasound is difficult (e.g. deep blocks or obese patients). However, as peripheral regional anesthesia became ‘perfected’, a new concept was launched simultaneously in Ireland and Australia in 2007- the landmark-based fascial plane block called the TAP (Transverse Abdominis Plane) block.<sup>3,4</sup> This new concept hinges on the idea of injecting a large volume of local anesthetics in an anatomical fascial plane that contain the nerves of interest. After introducing ultrasound guidance to perform this block, the TAP and many other fascial plane blocks were invented by the dozen and has spread like wildfire. One can wonder where this popularity really come from, since replacing the high-precision techniques of ultrasound guided proper peripheral nerve blocks, with injecting a large volume of local anesthetics in a fascial plane, not seeing the actual nerve structures or adequate spread of the local anesthetic, defy logic. One cannot help wondering if this is merely because many fascial plane blocks do not require much skill or knowledge, especially regarding ultrasound visualization.<sup>5</sup> In summary, when performing the different fascial plane blocks, you will inject your LA in a defined fascial plane but not close to all the nerve structures that you would like to block and, thus, you will rely on a random but favorable spread of the LA to get a reasonable block. Are all fascial plane blocks basically the same? The answer to this is obviously no. Some fascial plane blocks have a quite clear mode of action and does anesthetize well defined nerve structures. Examples of such blocks are the rectus sheath and PECS II blocks where the injection is made close to target nerves that are well known to innervate the area of surgery. Thus, these blocks are in a sense close to the situation of the ilio-inguinal, ilio-hypogastric nerve block, where the injection is done very close to the nerves even if you cannot fully visualize both nerves (e.g. in the obese patient). The Trans-muscular Quadratus Lumborum Block (TQLB) also represents a technique where the injection is made very close to relevant nerve structures and where relatively consistent spread is also seen to the caudal parts of the thoracic paravertebral space (thereby creating a lower Thoracic ParaVetebral Block; TPVB), which partly explain its effect.<sup>6</sup> Other fascial plane blocks rely on being lucky, getting a favorable spread involving all relevant nerve structures, e.g. the TAP, QL I and II blocks. Other fascial plane block, especially the Erector Spinae Plane block (ESPB), or its close relative retrolaminar nerve block, have no defined mode of action, at least regarding how they supposedly produce any analgesic effect in front of the mid-axillary line. Furthermore, since you do not inject close to the nerve structure/structures at hand, it is not surprising that the quality of the nerve block achieved is not as dense as compared to what you achieve with an ultrasound guided proper peripheral nerve block with the injection being performed immediately close to the nerve structures. What fascial plane blocks can do: 1. Meta-analyses show that fascial plane blocks add moderately improved analgesia as compared to placebo or established clinical routine analgesic regimens.<sup>7,8</sup> 2. Provide equipotent analgesia when compared to proper regional anesthetic blocks for surgery associated with limited tissue trauma but not for more major open surgery (e.g. laparoscopic vs. open cholecystectomy).<sup>9,10</sup> 3. Produce rapid and high plasma levels, as well as prolonged elimination half-life, of local anesthetics when compared to intravenous administration.<sup>11</sup> This is caused by very rapid uptake of the local anesthetic from the site of injection by the lymphatic system.<sup>12</sup> 4. Produce local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) both in adults and children.<sup>13–16</sup> 5. Provide equipotent postoperative analgesia as compared to intravenous lidocaine in renal transplant patients.<sup>17</sup> 6. Provide worse postoperative analgesia, with a higher failure rate, when compared to proper peripheral nerve blocking techniques in association with breast surgery.<sup>18,19</sup> What fascial plane blocks cannot do: 1. Provide successful surgical anesthesia on its own, as proper regional anesthesia nerve blocking techniques can (e.g. spinal, epidural, brachial plexus, ankle blocks etc). Thus, they are best employed as part of multimodal analgesia with other systemic analgesics, rather than as sole anesthetic techniques.<sup>20</sup> 2. Spread through substantial anatomical barriers, e.g. ligament structures, in a sufficient and reliable way.<sup>12,21,22</sup> 3. Provide reliable anesthesia of the anterior part of the thorax.<sup>23,24</sup> Of cause, the above is not a fully comprehensive review of the vast literature but do provide a relevant summary of the current situation in the opinion of the author. For more in-depth critical reading, two previous communications by the author are recommended.<sup>25,26</sup> Even proponents of fascial plane blocks, in this case the ESPB, suggest that a large part of its overall moderate effect may just be due to the systemic analgesic effects of the absorbed local anesthetic (11) and this interpretation is repeated by Bryne et al.<sup>24</sup> In summary, the situation may possibly be best illustrated by a quote from a previous Editorial on fascial plane blocks: ‘…, just because fascial planes exist in most parts of the body, it does not mean that injecting local anesthetics into these fascial planes always produces relevant blockade of local nerve structures to the degree that it will produce clinically relevant intra- and postoperative analgesia.’.<sup>25</sup> <h3>References</h3> Halsted WS.

But, what selective pressures led to seed dormancy? A recent study provides a major analysis of the factors driving this trait at the global scale (Zhang et al., 2022). Using c. 12 000 species and 10 million records across the globe, they conclude that dormancy is a strategy for plants living under ‘seasonal/unpredictable’ environments; and suggest that bet-hedging could be the major mechanism behind the pattern. To reach their conclusions the authors relate the proportion of species with dormant seeds in a grid-cell global map against climate variables related to annual precipitation, temperature and seasonality. Then they showed that the most significant variables were those related to climate seasonality that they equate with unpredictable climates (although seasonal climates usually are highly predictable in their seasonal cycles). The mechanism by which an unpredictable environment selects for seed dormancy is via the bet-hedging strategy, that is, spreading germination over a number of years to reduce year-to-year variation in fitness but taking advantage of exceptionally good years for establishment (Cohen, 1966; Philippi, 1993). However, actual unpredictability (i.e. interannual variability; Cowling et al., 2005) was not tested by Zhang et al. (2022). Furthermore, it is difficult to think of a mechanism for the selection of dormancy as an adaptive response to seasonality as such (i.e. predictable intra-annual variation); here nondormancy would appear to be equally adaptive if the same seasonal conditions suitable for germination are repeated every year. There may be some correlation between seasonality and unpredictability but, from a biological point of view, they are quite different constraints and select for different plant strategies. Note that in all of these studies (and here as well, unless otherwise stated), seed dormancy refers to inherent (also called primary or organic) dormancy, which is dormancy driven by seed characteristics, and includes physical, physiological and morphological dormancy (Baskin & Baskin, 2014). Once this dormancy is broken (or if the seeds produced are nondormant), seeds still do not germinate until the hydrothermal conditions are suitable. Overcoming this additional, environmentally imposed dormancy is controlled by when the wet season actually starts or local temperatures reaching certain thresholds, but this imposed dormancy is not considered in current broad-scale studies. The importance of climatic variables, including seasonality, as correlates of (inherent) dormancy aligns well with other recent global studies focused on Fabaceae (Rubio de Casas et al., 2017; Wyse & Dickie, 2018) and on germination responses at the European scale (Carta et al., 2022). Another recent analysis of seedbank data for 2000 species across the globe (Gioria et al., 2020) considered binary variables related to habitat type, habitat openness (yes/no) and disturbance (yes/no) in addition to climate, and came up with a different conclusion. They concluded that habitat-related variables (disturbance and canopy openness), but not climate, affected the ability of seed plants to form persistent seed banks, and concluded that dormancy, the prerequisite for seedbanks, is a bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments. Overall, these studies suggest that the mechanism selecting for seed dormancy is the bet-hedging strategy for dealing with unpredictable environments. Although this is notable in some ecosystems (especially arid regions; Cohen, 1966, Philippi, 1993, Venable, 2007), here we draw attention to the fact that there are other selective pressures unrelated to climate-associated bet-hedging that have shaped seed dormancy in many species across the globe but are not recognized in these recent studies. Our own contributions have been centred on seed germination in fire-prone environments, and hence have an emphasis on fire vs climate. The best-bet strategy A large part of the world has a seasonal climate with a dry season during which the vegetation is highly flammable (mediterranean, savanna, warm temperate, and dry boreal ecosystems). In these ecosystems, wildfires are frequent. Fire intervals are usually shorter than lifespan of the dominant species; thus, they act as a selective force shaping survival and reproductive traits of plants (Keeley et al., 2012). Among the adaptive traits is fire-released seed dormancy (see reviews in Keeley, 1991, Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Fires provide both a mechanism for dormancy release (proximate cause) and conditions (postfire) optimal for germination and establishment (low competition, high resource availability, low predation, low pathogen load) that increase fitness and allow maintenance of the population (ultimate cause). Thus, fires create a unique window of opportunity for recruitment, especially among weakly competitive, shade-intolerant plants. That is, fire is worth waiting for! In order to benefit from postfire conditions, seeds of many species have acquired the ability to survive the passage of fire and detect presence of the fire gap to initiate germination. Seeds possess two means of detecting a fire event in order to break dormancy and prime the seeds for germination: they are sensitive either to heat or chemicals produced during the combustion of organic matter (collectively called ‘smoke’, although it may include ash and charcoal). Species with these mechanisms exhibit two syndromes: heat-released dormancy and smoke-released dormancy (Pausas & Lamont, 2022). The first is associated mainly with physical dormancy and the latter with physiological dormancy, although some seeds may respond to both fire cues (heat may increase permeability to by-products of combustion). There are 100s of articles that provide experimental evidence among many species of the fitness benefits (enhanced germination and seedling establishment) when their seeds are subjected to smoke or heat intensities compatible with fire (reviewed in Pausas & Lamont, 2022). In most cases, these species accumulate seeds in the soil during their entire lifespan, and recruitment occurs in a single cohort after fire (postfire seeder species; Figs 1, 2, Supporting Information Fig. S1). That is, postfire recruitment occurs in a single pulse after fire. Here selection does not favour spreading the risk of recruitment failure over many years (bet-hedging) but, instead, maximizes germination in a single year when conditions are optimal, thus following the first substantial rains after fire. We call this strategy the best-bet strategy (Table 1) or environmental matching (sensu Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Although this strategy entails risks, it has adaptive advantages when fires are sufficiently frequent and predictable to occur within the interval between plant maturation and senescence (Pausas & Keeley, 2014). In these ecosystems, seed-dormancy release is not just a fail-safe response to unpredictable seasonal climates but also a routine response following a stochastic disturbance expected within the lifespan of most species in the plant community.

The first two are recruitment from the soil seed bank, the third from a canopy seed bank (serotinous pine). Photos: J. G. Pausas (top and middle) and S. Greenler (bottom).

Fig. 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Schematic representation of the dynamics of seed recruitment for plants lacking seed dormancy (nondormant; top panel), and for plants with dormant seeds following the bet-hedging strategy (middle panel) and the best-bet strategy (bottom panel). The figure shows the moment of flowering (red asterisk; spring), the germination (black bars; autumn), the seed bank in autumn (empty bars), the recruitment 2 months later (green bars) and the fire (flame; summer). As an example, the seasons are considered as in the Northern Hemisphere, and vertical dotted lines are the end of the year. Under the bet-hedging strategy plants germinate every year, but only produce a significant recruitment in the years with the appropriated conditions (here indicated as wet year). Plants under the best-bet strategy do not germinate until a fire (the heat or the smoke) release their dormancy and then most of the seedbank germinates – thus, they maximize the germination in a single (optimal) year.

Main characteristics of the evolutionary strategies that select for seed dormancy and seed banks (bet-hedging, best-bet) and a strategy that selects for seed dormancy unrelated to seed bank (spatial bet-hedging), together with the nondormant strategy.

Fire-released dormancy is prominent in ecosystems that are seasonal and have dense, woody vegetation that limits recruitment of nondormant seeds. Under such conditions, fires are intense (crown-fire ecosystems) and create extensive gaps for recruitment. Prime examples include mediterranean, warm temperate and subtropical shrublands distributed all over the world (Menges & Kohfeldt, 1995; Bradstock et al., 2012; Keeley et al., 2012; Pausas et al., 2021). Fire-released dormancy also is present, but less important, in grassy ecosystems with scattered woody shrubs and trees (surface-fire regimes) such as Brazilian savannas (Zirondi et al., 2019). Fire-released dormancy is almost absent in deserts, extremely cold environments and rainforests; in some of these ecosystems, seed dormancy may be common but unlinked to fire (nonfire-released dormancy), and thus is more aligned to the bet-hedging strategy. For Helianthemum, a large genus in Cistaceae, loss of hard-seededness and heat-released dormancy are notable only among a few recently evolved species that now occupy fire-free habitats, such as gypsum outcrops, deserts and saline wetlands (Pausas & Lamont, 2022). Serotiny (delayed seed release and dispersal) also is a strategy to accumulate seeds over the years, in this case held in closed cones or fruits stored in the plant crown (Lamont et al., 2020). It occurs mainly among conifers (in the Northern Hemisphere), and in a range of families in the Southern Hemisphere (Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, Casuarinaceae, Bruniaceae, and more rarely among Asteraceae, Anacardiaceae and Ericaceae). Fire again is the mechanism for cone/fruit opening and for creating the appropriate environment for dispersal and for suitable recruitment conditions of the dispersed seeds. Consequently, serotinous species recruit mostly after fire and not during the interfire period. Thus, serotiny (via pyriscence, fire-induced seed release) may also be viewed as an example of accumulating a seed bank as best-bet strategy. The importance of fire does not mean that climate is unimportant in shaping seed dormancy in fire-prone ecosystems. For instance, summer temperatures determine the heat thresholds for dormancy release to ensure seed bank persistence – by avoiding germination before a fire (Zomer et al., 2022). Under a warming climate, summer temperatures may cross thresholds for dormancy release and stimulate germination under suboptimal conditions, thus depleting the seedbank and jeopardizing the postfire recruitment. In that sense, species with heat-released dormancy may be more sensitive to climate change than species with smoke-released dormancy. In addition, final germination not only depends on (inherent) dormancy release, but also on the hydrothermal conditions for germination (imposed-dormancy release), and this makes seed-bank species sensitive to climatic change. For instance, higher temperatures may maintain imposed dormancy for longer, resulting in reduced postfire germination, despite receiving the appropriate stimulus for dormancy release (e.g. fire; Arnolds et al., 2015). Furthermore, many species with seed dormancy that form the seed bank have dry fruits that are dispersed at relatively short distances (myrmecochory, autochory) and thus their potential migration in a rapidly warming planet is limited. Long-distance seed dispersal ‘Bet-hedging’ and ‘best-bet’ are two strategies that select for seed dormancy in order to accumulate a seed bank and thus delay germination until conditions become more suitable. There is a further driver that selects for seed dormancy that does not imply the formation of seed banks. Many seeds have acquired seed dormancy to facilitate long-distance dispersal and thus spread germination across the landscape. The clearest example is dispersal by vertebrate frugivores (endozoochory by birds, bats, mammals and reptiles; Levey et al., 2002, Traveset et al., 2007). Frugivores consume the fruit pulp and defaecate or regurgitate the seeds far from the mother plant. This means that seeds need to resist passage through the gut and remain intact until arriving at a new microsite for germination. In such a way, plants benefit from long-distance dispersal to a potentially optimal microsite, often including the faecal material acting as fertilizer (Dinerstein & Wemmer, 1988; Traveset et al., 2007). Thus, seeds of fleshy fruited species typically are dormant, and scarification through the gut releases their dormancy (chemical and/or mechanical scarification, and more rarely removal of inhibitors in the pulp; Traveset et al., 2007). Although bet-hedging spreads germination of seeds accumulated in the seed bank over time, this strategy spreads the annual seed crop across space and thus it could be viewed as a spatial bet-hedging strategy (Table 1). Concluding remarks Climate is by no means the only driver of seed dormancy, nor is bet-hedging the only mechanism that shapes dormancy. Correlative studies based on climate datasets are unlikely to capture the diversity of adaptive strategies plants acquired to maximize their fitness; disturbances and species interactions also need to be considered. Despite the ubiquitous presence of fire across the globe (Archibald et al., 2013) and through geological time (Scott, 2018), recent seed dormancy reviews (noted above) fail to consider fire as drivers for the evolution of seed dormancy. However, fire-prone ecosystems are hotspots of seed dormancy that allow seed banks to accumulate in both the soil and the canopy (Keeley, 1991; Lamont et al., 2020; Pausas & Lamont, 2022). We need to overcome the ‘fire blindness’ syndrome (sensu Pausas & Lamont, 2018) that still seems to prevail in much ecological research. Further studies are needed to understand and quantify the relative importance of the different strategies in various ecosystems across the globe. An interesting test of climate vs disturbance as selective factors would be to compare dormancy in closed forests that seldom burn with species in adjacent regularly burnt shrublands under the same climate. We predict that dormancy and seedbanks would be largely restricted to the fire-prone ecosystems. More research also is needed to understand the environmental conditions that maintain and release imposed dormancy (once inherent dormancy is released or does not apply) as changes in climate cues could be the key to plant success under a changing climate.

Impacts to sagebrush ecosystem processes over large areas due to the annual grass-wildfire cycle necessitated the development of a coordinated, science-based strategy for improving efforts to achieve long-term protection, conservation, and restoration of sagebrush rangelands, which was framed in 2015 under the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy (IRFMS). Central to this effort was the development of an Actionable Science Plan (Plan) that identified 37 priority science needs (hereinafter, “Needs”) for informing the actions proposed under the five topics (Fire, Invasives, Restoration, Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), Climate and Weather) that were part of the collective focus of the IRFMS. Notable keys to this effort were identification of the Needs co-produced by managers and researchers, and a focus on resulting science being “actionable.”Substantial investments aimed at fulfilling the Needs identified in the Plan have been made since its release in 2016. While the state of the science has advanced considerably, the extent to which knowledge gaps remain relative to identified Needs is relatively unknown. Moreover, new Needs have likely emerged since the original strategy as results from actionable science reveal new questions and possible (yet untested) solutions. A quantifiable assessment of the progress made on the original science Needs can identify unresolved gaps and new information that can help inform prioritization of future research efforts.This report details a systematic literature review that evaluated how well peer-reviewed journal articles and formal technical reports published between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, addressed four Needs identified under the Climate and Weather topic in the Plan. The topic outlined research Needs broadly focused on understanding the potential effects of climate change on vegetative resilience to inform restoration of sagebrush rangelands. We established the level of progress towards addressing each Need following a standardized set of criteria, and developed summaries detailing how research objectives nested within Needs identified in the Plan (hereinafter, “Next Steps”) were either addressed well, partially addressed or remain outstanding (that is, addressed poorly) in the literature through 2020. Our searches resulted in the inclusion of 92 science products that at least partially addressed a Need identified in the Climate and Weather topic. The Needs that were well and partially addressed included:studies of the complex set of climatic relationships that influence sagebrush rangeland restoration and seeding success;the identification of seed collection areas across the range of environmental variability inhabited by target restoration species; anddevelop predictive models to assess targeted restoration species’ responses to mid-century climatic conditions.The Need addressed poorly was the identification of native plant species, genotypes and ecotypes, and seed mixes that may be resilient to a changing climate. The information provided in this assessment will assist updating the Plan, and can inform updates of other relevant science planning documents as needed.

Increased wildfire is threatening the existence of sagebrush ecosystems and the wildlife species that depend upon them (Baker, 2006; Coates et al., 2016). Increased wildfire in sagebrush ecosystems is often driven by invasive annual grasses, especially cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum (L.). Invasion can initiate a trajectory toward a "grass-fire cycle", in which cheatgrass increases fine fuel loadings that promote fire, and native plant species do not recover quickly after fire, leading frequently burned sites to transition to monocultures of cheatgrass (Brooks et al., 2004). Although cheatgrass has been extensively studied in the sagebrush steppe, less attention has been given to the organisms that would have filled the interspaces that cheatgrass replaces, namely, biological soil crusts ("biocrusts"). Semi-arid environments are characterized by sparse cover of vascular plants and substantial cover of biocrusts (Belnap & Lange, 2001). Biocrusts contain organisms that live on the soil surface and include lichens, mosses, and light algal crusts (including cyanobacteria). Although biocrusts were included in some of the first descriptions of the vegetation in the region (Flowers, 1934), biocrusts are rarely included in contemporary studies of sagebrush ecosystems. Comprehensive community studies have concluded consistent negative relationships between abundance of biocrusts and annual invasive grasses, specifically cheatgrass (Condon & Pyke, 2018a,b; Daubenmire, 1970). We postulate that biocrusts, and particularly lichens, facilitate a pattern of small, infrequent, low intensity fire given their association with reduced fine fuels (cheatgrass). Observations of the response of biocrusts to fire as a sole disturbance are rare. For example, grazing by livestock is the primary land use in sagebrush ecosystems and biocrusts are lost to the compound disturbances of grazing and fire (Condon & Pyke, 2018a). Researchers face great challenges in identifying sites for study where fire is not coupled with grazing, perhaps because cattle preferentially use burned areas (Clark et al., 2014). Conversations in the literature speak to the difficulty in separating the effects of these disturbances on biocrusts (O'Connor & Germino, 2020; Root et al., 2020). We surveyed a wildfire in October of 2021 outside of Boise, Idaho, that burned 15–20 acres of intact biocrusts the previous month (personal communications Rosentreter, October 20, 2021; Condon & Coates, 2022). This small fire occurred on private land and was not named. The area had not experienced grazing by livestock since 1984 and prior to the fire, it was free of other anthropogenic disturbances. Herbivores found onsite, which may cause ground disturbance, include Paiute ground squirrel (Urocitellus mollis), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus leporid), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and American badger (Taxidea taxus) (personal communications Mason, October 20, 2021). The dominant shrub onsite is Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and Young, and the occurrence of shrubs was patchy. We sampled 20, randomly placed, 0.25 m2 quadrats within the burn perimeter to estimate the susceptibility of biocrusts by morphogroup to fire (sensu Eldridge & Rosentreter, 1999). Percent char (organic material visibly browned/blackened by fire) was estimated ocularly within each quadrat as a representation of fire intensity. Quadrats were physically tossed into the burned area but tossed again if they fell upon areas with vehicle tracks from fire-fighting efforts. We avoided areas where burning shrubs sterilized the soil, which was a rare condition. Biocrusts and vascular plants were surveyed via point-vertex intercept at 40 points per quadrat. Vascular plants were split into categories of annual forbs and perennial grasses. Other functional groups of vascular plants were not detected within the fire perimeter at the time of sampling, although cheatgrass occurs onsite. Pictures from the site show intact biocrusts and no evidence that the lichens had burned (Figure 1). Char was restricted to mosses and perennial grasses, primarily Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl.), a shallow-rooted native that is typically dormant by early summer. Sandberg's bluegrass was already showing evidence of resprouting at the time of our survey (Figure 1). FIGURE 1Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Intact biocrusts within the burn perimeter. (a) Overview of the burned area. (b) Close-up of the soil surface with a glove for scale. (c) Close-up for the soil surface with a mallet for scale. White patches are crustose lichens. The green and reddish-brown patches are mosses. Patches with the most char are primarily the perennial grass, Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl.) and some of the mosses. Perennial grasses were already resprouting at the time of the photograph (October 20, 2021). All photographs by L.A. Condon. Surveyed quadrats were representative of the burned area and were divided into categories of fire intensity: low (5% percent char or less, 13 quadrats), moderate (12%–20% percent char, 4 quadrats), and high (95%–98% percent char, 3 quadrats). From our char estimates, we believe that most of the fire burned at low intensity. We did not have any quadrats with char values between 21% and 94%. Across the site, light algal crusts, vascular plants, lichens, and mosses were observed with increasing abundance (cover), in that order (Figure 2). Considering lichens specifically, crustose lichens were found in the greatest abundance followed by cup lichens (Figure 2). Crustose lichens are completely appressed to the soil surface and provide continuous cover. Cup lichens have thalli of scales (squamules) and are frequently found with mosses. Abundance of morphogroups was analyzed with non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination using a Sørenson distance measure. Final stress for the ordination was low, 7.06 for a three-dimensional solution (Figure 3). The ordination was rotated to align with our explanatory variable of interest, percent char, which was used to represent fire intensity. We do not interpret Axis 2 because it did not include any additional information that is not included in our discussion of Axis 1 or 3. Char was significantly correlated with Axis 1 (r = 0.468, r2 = 0.219) and directly opposed cover of crustose lichens (r = −0.832, r2 = 0.692). Axis 3 was significantly correlated with tall mosses (r = 0.770, r2 = 0.592) and perennial grasses (r = 0.513, r2 = 0.263). On this axis, cover of these groups directly opposed cover of more ruderal groups: short mosses (r = −0.777, r2 = 0.604) and light algal crusts (LAC, r = −0.636, r2 = 0.404). Cover of bare ground was also significantly negatively correlated with this axis (Bare ground, r = −0.460, r2 = 0.212). While Axis 1 appeared to represent a gradient of fire intensity, Axis 3 represented a gradient of biocrust succession from more ruderal groups to later successional groups as one moves up the axis. These ruderal groups are described in greater detail in Rosentreter (2020) and may be the result of small-scale ground disturbances caused by squirrels or badgers. FIGURE 2Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Boxplots show median values, 1st and 3rd quartiles and whiskers extending out to the largest values within 1.5 times the distance between the 1st and 3rd quartiles. (a) low intensity fire (5% percent char or less, 13 quadrats) (b) moderate intensity fire (12%–20% percent char, 4 quadrats) (c) high intensity fire (95%–98% percent char, 3 quadrats). Lichens include the following groups: Crustose, Cup Lichen, Fruticose and Gelatinous. Mosses include StMoss (short moss) and TlMoss (tall moss). Other abbreviations are as follows: AnnForb (annual forb), LAC (light algal crust), and PerGra (perennial grass). FIGURE 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of the abundance of biocrust morphogroups after fire. Increment R2 for Axis 1 = 0.266, Axis 2 = 0.068, and Axis 3 = 0.601, for a cumulative R2 of 0.935. Blue dots represent the centroids of biocrust morphogroups. We observed that the lichen components of biocrusts, particularly crustose lichens (at this site Diplochistes muscorum (Scop.) R. Sant), were largely unaffected by fire alone, corroborating other work in the region. Warren et al. (2015) found that the overall impact of fire on biocrusts in an early seral juniper woodland was minimal, even though trees were killed by fire and cover of mosses was reduced. Mosses, specifically tall mosses are often susceptible to fire in the sagebrush steppe (Condon & Gray, 2020; Condon & Pyke 2018a,b), and early successional, short mosses can be stimulated by fire and other disturbances (Condon & Pyke, 2018b). Although the cover of lichens appeared to be lower in the quadrats with the highest fire intensity (Figure 2c), this is likely due to quadrats with relatively high cover of lichens not having enough char to be classified as burning at high intensity (Figure 2a–c). This suggests there was little lichen cover in the high-intensity quadrats before fire, unlike the quadrats with high moss cover, which did show char on the mosses. This further suggests that where lichens are abundant, fire severity may be lower relative to sites with higher moss or grass cover, as fire intensity and residence time are reduced (sensu Brooks, 2008, Figure 3). These findings highlight the need to identify and conserve biocrusts where they are intact, especially where reducing the impacts of fire is of interest. In the Great Basin, USA, understanding the responses of biocrusts to fire, especially by morphogroup, is timely. Increasing loss of sagebrush habitat from fire throughout the region has led to a plan by the Bureau of Land Management to construct an extensive network of fuel breaks, with over 17,000 km of linear fuel breaks planned for the Great Basin region (BLM, 2020). Suggestions for preserving intact sagebrush habitats and sagebrush obligate wildlife species include prioritizing fire suppression efforts (Baker, 2006). This highlights the question of how to best configure and implement fuel breaks in a way that minimizes negative impacts on habitat, including the potential to facilitate cheatgrass invasion, while maximizing their capacity to reduce fire spread (Shinneman et al., 2019). Some fuel reduction treatments have been shown to minimize damage to biocrusts, which is useful given known negative relationships between biocrusts and cheatgrass (Condon & Gray, 2020; Condon & Pyke, 2018a). The information presented here suggests that sites with higher lichen cover could help reduce fire intensity, making fuel breaks more effective under certain conditions. Moreover, other research has shown that similar environments with higher pre-fire cover of biocrusts were more likely to have lower post-fire cover of cheatgrass (Shinneman & Baker, 2009), another desirable attribute to enhance fuel break functionality. We demonstrate that fire had differing effects on morphogroups of biocrusts, as crustose lichens were observed to be free of char. Mosses demonstrated char, suggesting that they may have experienced a reduction in cover, but they were not lost from the site, following fire. This finding could benefit studies on the restoration of biocrusts, because biocrusts may not need to be reintroduced to a site following fire. Studies related to the physiology of morphogroups and their susceptibility to fire would add to our understanding of this phenomena. Studies on the effects of fire on biocrusts could benefit from the inclusion of disturbance history and plant community identity, as the composition of biocrusts differs amongst plant communities (Condon & Pyke, 2020c). Although it has been asserted that biocrusts are highly susceptible to wildfire in a recent meta-analysis (Palmer et al., 2020), the current study (where fire is the sole disturbance, albeit some inferred disturbance by small rodents) and those cited here examining compound disturbances with fire, suggest that disturbances that are compounding with fire have a greater effect on cover of morphogroups compared with fire alone. The study presented here demonstrates the complex nature of this topic, necessitating more research. Such research would be timely considering the potential benefits to land management efforts to minimize the spread of wildfire and reduce the loss of sagebrush habitat and dependent wildlife (Coates et al., 2016).

In the developing world, access to electricity remains a challenge in the most interior rural areas, where incomes are low and grid connection costs are prohibitive. In both developing and developed economies, the rise of extreme weather events has made the resilience of power systems a concern. Wildfires, for example, are becoming widespread. The United States saw over 71,000 wildfires burn 10 million acres and more than 12,000 buildings in 2017 alone. This specific economic burden—in terms of the impact of wildfires on the U.S. economy—is estimated to be between $71.1 billion and $347.8 billion annually. In addition, there is a social cost incurred by vulnerable populations who (i) may be unable to evacuate from the location of a disaster or (ii) may not have access to mitigating strategies for failed power systems. In this tutorial, we examine the role of microgrids in electricity access and resilience through a systematic review. With respect to electricity access, we investigate the impact of electricity provision through microgrids on outcomes in rural areas of developing countries. For electricity resilience, we assess the effectiveness of microgrids in providing support to power grids in the aftermath of a disaster. We find that microgrids can provide significant benefits in both settings.Funding: This work is funded by the National Science Foundation [Grant CMMI-2053856].

AB  - “Hope is often misunderstood. People tend to think that it is simply passive wishful thinking: I hope something will happen but I'm not going to do anything about it. This is indeed the opposite of real hope, which requires action and engagement.”― Jane Goodall, The Book of Hope (2021) With the release of The Lancet’s Countdown on Health and Climate Change in October, 2021, and the coincident UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), sobering statistics across 44 indicators have made it clear that climate change is increasingly affecting our health—and that the situation is dire indeed. As Dr Goodall describes in her new book, in order to have real hope in the midst of climate change, we have some work to do. As a translational research journal the overarching goal of our daily work is, simply put, to publish science that improves human health. What this means vis-à-vis climate health research is that we aim to better understand how climate and changing environments interface with our physiologies, and to identify therapies and interventions to counter negative effects due to our changing planet. As outlined in “Hot weather and heat extremes: health risks” from The Lancet’s Heat and Health series published on Aug 21, 2021, one way in which our bodies deal with heat stress is by vasodilation, which helps transfer internal body heat to the external environment by increasing blood flow to the skin. This process requires increased cardiac output and oxygen demand. If prolonged and intense, the process can sometimes lead to serious cardiovascular events. As evidenced in a 2016 systematic review and meta-analyses published in EBioMedicine, the elderly face particularly high risk not only for heat-induced cardiovascular effects, but also negative cerebrovascular and respiratory outcomes. Another way the body responds to heat is by sweating, whereby thermosensitive neurons in the hypothalamus instruct the sweat glands to release stored fluids and salts. This process, in turn, transfers heat energy away from the body via evaporation, resulting in a cooling of core body temperature. However, loss of fluid and subsequent dehydration can lead to further strain on the heart, as well as increase acute kidney injury and kidney failure in some vulnerable individuals. After prolonged heat exposure or exertion in hot temperatures, the body can lose its ability to thermoregulate and heatstroke can ensue. Heatstroke is a very serious condition that can lead to permanent damage to the brain, heart, and kidney, and even death. As with many health conditions, awareness of the dangers of heat exposure and the implementation of behavioural guidelines (such as taking breaks from exertion and staying hydrated during heatwaves) are effective methods for modifying some of these risks. However, research is urgently needed to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of heat dysregulation and its effects on the body, and to identify novel therapeutic targets and optimal cooling methods for patients in acute heat crisis. Increased environmental heat causes plants to release more allergy-inducing pollen, and can create conditions that lead to unhealthy ozone levels. Dust and wildfires, brought on by intensified droughts due to climate change, can also release fine, inhalable particulate matter (PM2•5) that can infiltrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. Fossil fuel combustion itself can directly contribute to fine particulate matter pollution and is attributable to an estimated 10•2 million premature deaths annually, according to a recent study in Environmental Research. These increases in allergens and pollutants intensify lung irritation, asthma-related symptoms, and have been linked to higher risk of lung cancer and death from cardiovascular complications. PM2•5 exposure has long been linked to severe outcomes during infectious disease outbreaks, and evidence is emerging that this association could also hold true for air pollution and COVID-19 disease severity. The developing fetus is also susceptible to both excess heat exposure and air pollution, with each factor contributing to an increased risk for adverse outcomes, including preterm birth and low birthweight, as outlined in a systematic review published in JAMA Network Open. The effects of heat and pollutants on pregnancy are likely to involve complex and multifactorial mechanisms that are not yet well understood. However, some studies have suggested decreased uterine blood flow and increased proinflammatory cytokine release as possible contributing factors from heat stress, and direct fetal toxicity and inflammation among other factors mediating air pollutant effects. A recent study in Molecular Psychiatry, for example, found that prenatal exposure to PM2•5 might affect neurodevelopment and behaviour in autistic children via long-term effects on mitochondrial respiration. Changes in temperature and environmental conditions can also contribute to increased incidence of infectious diseases by expanding the seasonal and geographic range of insect-vectored pathogens and by affecting migratory patterns of both people and insects. Research studies aimed at predicting spread of vector-borne illnesses, such as this 2016 EBioMedicine paper modelling Zika virus outbreak potential in Europe, are needed to inform public health risks of new climate-related epidemics. At EBioMedicine, we put our hope in science to help us navigate a changing climate. We aim to publish work that helps us understand mechanisms of climate-related and environment-related health outcomes, and that provides new insights for climate-adaptive therapies or novel mitigations. We will consider research, review articles, and commentary all along the intersection of climate and human health, and encourage a cross-disciplinary collaborative research approach to help achieve our common goals.

The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the epidemiological evidence that assesses the associations between wildfire smoke and health outcomes in the perinatal period and childhood. The primary pollutant assessed in this body of research is particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM 2.5 ) from wildfire sources. First, we focus on pregnancy and discuss the unique characteristics of the perinatal period and present a summary of studies of wildfire exposure in pregnancy and effects on maternal and newborn outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and mental health outcomes. We discuss the various methods used to access exposure and ascertain the outcomes and covariate adjustment in epidemiologic analyses. Second, we focus on exposure to wildfire smoke during childhood and review what is known on the effects of wildfire smoke on child health outcomes including health-service use, respiratory symptoms, and asthma. Our chapter concludes by highlighting the gaps in the literature and directions for future research and policy. This area of study on wildfire exposure and health effects during pregnancy and childhood is in a nascent stage and our knowledge in this is expected to change drastically over the next several years.

AB  - AbstractThis article considers the development of a framework to collaboratively identify and address the most pressing needs for application of climate change research to the preservation of cultural heritage in Norway. Its focus is on historic wooden buildings, at increased risk from fire and flood due to climate change. Drawing from the field of translational research, the MICHON project identified the need for targeted, systematic knowledge networks in preparedness planning for cultural heritage environments. This was developed through a combination of desk-based research and extensive collaboration with Norwegian municipalities, fire brigades and local communities. The process has included evaluation of policy and practice in diverse case sites to frame a networking methodology that builds on Lean Construction and the backwards planning method. The interaction between researcher and practitioner has been at the forefront of the project and the iterative design has already shown transformative impacts to both practice and research.Sammendrag«‘Cycles of change’; forsterking av samhandling og kommunikasjon i norske kommuner for å styrke arbeidet med beredskap for kulturminner ved akutte hendelser»Artikkelen tar for seg utviklingen av et rammeverk for å identifisere og adressere de viktigste behovene for anvendelse av klimaendringsforskning for bevaring av kulturarv i Norge. Fokuset er på historiske trebygninger, med økt risiko for brann og flom på grunn av klimaendringene. Med translasjonell forskning som metodisk utgangspunkt, identifiserte MICHON-prosjektet behovet for målrettede, systematiske kunnskapsnettverk i beredskapsplanlegging for kulturmiljøer, i tillegg til gjennomføring av øvelser. Dette er utviklet gjennom en kombinasjon av litteraturgjennomgang og omfattende samarbeid med norske kommuner, brannvesen og lokalsamfunn. Prosessen har inkludert evaluering av politikk og praksis på ulike områder for å lage et rammeverk for en nettverksmodell og som bygger på metodene for samarbeid som Lean Construction og bakoverplanlegging. Samspillet mellom forskning og praksis har vært utforsket i prosjektet, og den iterative fremgangsmåten har allerede vist gode effekter på tvers av fagfelt.Résumé«Cycles de changement: renforcer la collaboration et la communication dans les municipalités norvégiennes pour améliorer la préparation du patrimoine face aux événements extrêmes»Cet article envisage le développement d'un cadre permettant d’identifier et de répondre de manière collaborative aux besoins les plus urgents pour mettre en application la recherche sur le changement climatique, pour la préservation du patrimoine culturel en Norvège. Il se concentre sur les bâtiments historiques en bois, exposés à un risque accru d'incendie et d'inondation en raison du changement climatique. S'inspirant du domaine de la recherche translationnelle, le projet MICHON a identifié le besoin d’avoir des réseaux de savoirs ciblés et systématiques dans la planification de la préparation de l’environnement du patrimoine culturel. Il a été mis au point grâce à une association de recherches documentaires et d'une collaboration étendue aux municipalités norvégiennes, aux pompiers et aux communautés locales. Le processus a inclus l'évaluation de la politique et de la mise en œuvre dans divers sites étudiés pour élaborer une méthodologie de mise en réseau qui s'appuie sur une gestion allégée (Lean) et une méthode de rétroplanning. L'interaction entre le chercheur et le praticien a été au premier plan du projet et la conception itérative a déjà produit des transformations à la fois sur la pratique et la recherche.Zusammenfassung„Zyklen des Wandels: Verbesserung der Zusammenarbeit und Kommunikation in norwegischen Gemeinden zur Stärkung der Vorsorge bei Extremereignissen im Bereich Kulturgut“Dieser Artikel befasst sich mit der Entwicklung eines Rahmens zur gemeinsamen Identifizierung und Bewältigung der dringendsten Bedürfnisse bei der Anwendung der Klimawandelforschung zur Erhaltung des kulturellen Erbes in Norwegen. Der Schwerpunkt liegt auf historischen Holzgebäuden, die aufgrund des Klimawandels einem erhöhten Risiko durch Feuer und Überschwemmungen ausgesetzt sind. Ausgehend vom Bereich der translationalen Forschung wurde im Rahmen des MICHON-Projekts der Bedarf an gezielten, systematischen Wissensnetzwerken für die Bereitschaftsplanung im Bereich des kulturellen Erbes ermittelt. Dies wurde durch eine Kombination aus Sekundärforschung und umfassender Zusammenarbeit mit norwegischen Gemeinden, Feuerwehren und den Gemeinschaften vor Ort entwickelt. Der Prozess umfasste die Bewertung von Politik und Praxis an verschiedenen Fallbeispielen, um eine Netzwerkmethodik zu entwickeln, die auf Lean Construction und der Methode der Rückwärtsplanung aufbaut. Die Interaktion zwischen Forschern und Praktikern stand im Vordergrund des Projekts, und das iterative Design hat bereits transformative Auswirkungen sowohl auf die Praxis als auch auf die Forschung gezeigt.Resumen“Ciclos de cambio: Mejorando la colaboración y la comunicación en los municipios noruegos para fortalecer la prevención de riesgos del patrimonio ante fenómenos extremos”Este artículo examina el desarrollo de un marco para identificar y abordar en colaboración, las necesidades más apremiantes en cuanto a la aplicación de la investigación sobre el cambio climático a la conservación del patrimonio cultural en Noruega. Se centra en los edificios históricos de madera, expuestos a un mayor riesgo de incendio e inundación debido al cambio climático. Basándose en el campo de la investigación traslativa, el proyecto MICHON identificó la necesidad de redes de conocimiento específicas y sistemáticas relativas a un plan de preparación de emergencia para entornos de patrimonio cultural. Esto se desarrolló mediante una combinación de investigación documental y una amplia colaboración con municipios noruegos, cuerpos de bomberos y comunidades locales. El proceso ha incluido una evaluación de las políticas y la prácticas en diferentes emplazamientos para delimitar una metodología de trabajo en red basada en ‘Lean Construction’ y el método de planificación retrospectiva. La interacción entre los investigadores y los profesional practicantes ha estado al frente del proyecto y este proceso de diseño iterativo ya ha mostrado efectos transformadores tanto en la práctica como en la investigación.摘要“周期变化：挪威市政当局为强化遗产的极端事件预防能力而加强合作与交流”本文探讨了一个框架制定，以共同确定和满足挪威在文化遗产保护方面应用气候变化研究的最迫切需求。文章的关注点是历史悠久的木质建筑，由于气候变化，这些建筑面临火灾和洪水的风险越来越大。MICHON项目借鉴了转化型研究的经验，确定了在文化遗产环境的防灾规划中建立有针对性且系统的知识网络的必要性。通过案头研究以及与挪威市政当局、消防队和当地社区的广泛合作，该项目得到了发展。这一过程包括对不同案例场所的政策和实践进行评估，以构建一种基于精益建设和逆向策划法的网络方法。研究人员与实践者之间的互动一直是该项目的重中之重，而迭代设计已显现出对实践和研究的变革性影响Keywords: disaster preparednesscultural heritagepreventive workinterdisciplinary planningnetworkbackwards planning AcknowledgmentsThe authors sincerely thank the cooperative municipalities in the MICHON project, for sharing knowledge and making time to prioritise this matter.

It now smells like rotten eggs.”2 Although the gas responsible for that smell, hydrogen sulfide, is not regulated in South Africa, its noxious odor was a reminder that levels of other pollutants might also be high.3Smog blankets Johannesburg on a sunny day in 2019. The capital city is located in South Africa’s Highveld—a high-altitude inland area that is the country’s industrial heartland.3 Image: © iStock.com/Rich Townsend.It is hard to capture the spatial and temporal variations in air pollution at specific spots in Johannesburg. The region’s sparse monitoring system measures the total mass of particulate matter in the air but not the composition or size of specific particles. “We really don’t know exactly what’s in it,” says Kristy Langerman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Johannesburg. “But I can speculate and say it’s from traffic as well as some domestic burning and dust.”In the coming years, Langerman and other air pollution experts may get some answers, thanks to an upcoming U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite mission, which has become a collaboration with the Italian Space Agency (ASI). The mission will deploy the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument to capture information about the size and composition of particulates in the atmosphere. MAIA is anticipated to launch in late 2024, according to sources interviewed for this story.Nothing Straightforward about Data CollectionOne of those sources, David Diner, is a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and principal investigator on the MAIA project. As NASA’s first competitively selected Earth-observing mission to include epidemiologists on the scientific team, Diner says the project will help support studies of health effects from short-term, long-term, and gestational exposures to various air pollutants.For some localities, the information MAIA will provide could be revolutionary. Studies are showing that fine particulate matter (particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5) may cause detrimental health effects at levels lower than originally thought.4,5 The World Health Organization (WHO) has dropped its annual average particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 exposure guideline from 10 micrograms per meter cubed10 μg/m3 to 5 micrograms per meter cubed5 μg/m3.6 In the United States, the Biden administration convened a scientific panel in 2022 to discuss lowering the U.S. annual average exposure standard for particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 from 12 micrograms per meter cubed12 μg/m3 to as low as 8 micrograms per meter cubed8 μg/m3.7According to several epidemiologists working with MAIA—such as Beate Ritz from the University of California, Los Angeles—public health officials in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) might not have as much influence as those who advise the U.S. president or the WHO. “Many government leaders will say, ‘What you see in the West does not apply to us; our situation is different,’” says Ritz. “But with MAIA’s data, hopefully, health researchers in those countries will be able to finally pressure their governments into action.”Pros and Cons of Satellite DataMore than two decades ago, Diner helped design the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), which monitors how aerosols and clouds affect climate.8 MISR was designed to view Earth from nine fixed angles and in four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared), with a spatial resolution of a few hundred meters. Its data offer a detailed picture of how the abundance of atmospheric particulate matter varies in space and time, among other outputs.9 MAIA will add to that by using a specialized digital camera that can be pointed at selected view angles and record light in 14 spectral bands.MISR images over India in 2016. Left, the vertical viewing camera captured the Himalayas, which tend to concentrate pollution to the south. New Delhi was under such thick haze that aerosol optical depths, right, were not calculated because the algorithm classified the haze as a cloud.33 Image: Courtesy of MISR Team, NASA/GSFC/LaRC/JPL.Diner explains that the additional spectral bands will yield greater insight into particle composition. For instance, the shortest (ultraviolet) bands are sensitive to particles containing certain types of minerals and organic matter; the visible and near-infrared spectra are primarily sensitive to fine particles. Shortwave infrared bands will provide information about coarser particles, such as dust grains and volcanic ash. Additional bands measure polarization, providing another means of understanding particle properties.“We’re basically looking at scattered sunlight and using the characteristics of that sunlight—its variation with wavelength and angle—to infer the physical and optical properties of the particles that are scattering the light,” says Diner. The shape of particles—whether spherical, like liquid droplets, or irregular, like dust grains—affects how they scatter sunlight, he explains. “All of these factors together make this multi-angle method, in conjunction with the multispectral and polarimetric measurements, pretty powerful for helping to identify specific pollutants.”Nevertheless, it is tricky to translate satellite data into accurate estimates of what humans breathe at ground level. “Satellite-based particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 data are not direct measurements,” explains Meredith Fowlie, an energy economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “They are noisy estimates, and it requires a lot of scientific modeling, assumptions, and statistical modeling to construct the [ground-level] PM measures.”Joel D. Kaufman, a professor of environmental health at the University of Washington and editor-in-chief of Environmental Health Perspectives, takes it a step further. “Even when the satellite estimates can get pollution concentrations correct at a 1 by 1 kilometer1×1km resolution—which is much better than no data at all—they are missing the finer scale of important pollutant gradients that exist over tens of meters from important sources,” he says. “Sources like roadways and waste incineration can be important at this scale.”MAIA will acquire multiple-angle imagery of selected target areas both along the orbit path as well as across it. Image: Courtesy of NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.Diner and the MAIA team acknowledge the trade-offs between satellite and surface-based approaches. “With certain pollutants, the spatial variability is quite significant, and so a straight interpolation could, itself, lead to substantial errors,” he says. But there are simply not enough ground-based monitors in many parts of the world—especially in LMICs—to determine what residents are exposed to on a daily basis, he explains.Target AreasThe mission will target 11 primary areas—regions surrounding Los Angeles, Atlanta, Boston, Barcelona, Rome/Bologna, Addis Ababa, Johannesburg/Pretoria, Tel Aviv/Haifa, Delhi, Beijing, and Taipei/Kaohsiung—and approximately two dozen secondary sites.10 The group will use data from both satellite- and ground-based instruments to generate pollution maps. But not every target city has a network of speciation monitors for determining chemical species and amounts of collected particles.MAIA researchers will use the speciation monitors already in place in the primary target areas in the United States, Spain, and Italy, Diner says. And thanks to a grassroots program called the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN), which works to put air pollution monitors in international locations, three other cities (Pretoria, Tel Aviv, and Beijing) received speciation monitors before the MAIA project started.11 Additional monitors are now sited in Johannesburg, Addis Ababa, Haifa, Delhi, Taipei, and Kaohsiung. The MAIA team is putting aerosol mass and optical depth monitors (another type of filter-based sampler) in several other primary target cities.“The result will be that each primary target area will have at least two speciation monitors capable of collecting particulate matter on filters, which are then analyzed in the lab for sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, and dust,” Diner says. Aethalometers, which measure airborne black carbon concentrations in real time, have been placed in Addis Ababa, Delhi, and Beijing. Such ground-based measurements are essential to MAIA’s approach for converting the satellite measurements into reliable estimates of pollution concentrations. The U.S. Department of State has assisted with the shipment and operation of many of these sensors, and the U.S. Agency for International Development is supporting the ground-based measurements and chemical analyses in MAIA’s primary target areas in Africa.The MAIA team is supporting other creative solutions to the scarcity of monitors. For instance, Addis Ababa is the primary target area with the fewest air quality monitors, so MAIA researchers have installed a network of PurpleAir monitors—low-cost sensors that measure total particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 and provide citizen scientist and community groups with measures of local air quality.12Amid visible smog, children play in the street in Addis Ababa on 3 February 2019, a car-free day promoted to help reduce air pollution. MAIA will bring new ground-based monitors to the city to complement satellite data.

Such modeling can account for wind movement, trapping by cold air, and other local weather phenomena.13 The resulting estimates will help fill in spatial and temporal gaps in the satellite coverage.14 “It’s really three points on the triangle,” Diner says. “The satellite, the surface monitors, and the model [are] all working together.”The newly minted NASA-ASI collaboration means that more of Italy will potentially be studied than had been proposed in the original MAIA mission. Massimo Stafoggia, an epidemiologist with the Lazio Regional Health Service in Rome and long-time MAIA team member, says the central part of the country, including Rome and the Po Valley—which, due to traffic, industry, and geography, has the highest levels of particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 in all of Europe—will remain one of the mission’s target areas. But, he says, ASI researchers now hope to study some secondary target areas in the north and in the south—including Taranto, home to one of Europe’s largest steel factories.“There is a large population living very, very close to that plant,” Stafoggia says, “and because of that, it’s a very hot topic in that area.” He is involved in several longitudinal population-based air pollution studies, including some where investigators have tried to estimate the components of particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 that residents are breathing in certain cities.15 “But,” he says, “I am pretty sure that the data made available [from] MAIA will be much more accurate.”Collaborating with EpidemiologistsDiner says he has learned a great deal from working with the team’s epidemiologists to design the mission so its data will best support research on health effects. “When we were choosing our target areas, I would have thought to look only at the most polluted places,” he says. “But the epidemiologists said, ‘No, we want to look at clean places, too, because when you look at a 10 micrograms per meter cubed10-μg/m3 change in an aerosol or particulate matter concentration where it’s relatively clean, it’s a much bigger change than in a place that’s very polluted.’ So they want to see the whole range.” Diner says MAIA will fly over each area at least three times per week.MAIA team members who specialize in remote sensing helped Diner select the spectral bands. The team epidemiologists weighed in on other constraints. For instance, if there are two targets that could be observed in one area as the satellite passes overhead, which one would they prioritize?Yang Liu, who studies air pollution at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, leads the group that is integrating instrument data with atmospheric chemistry and spatial statistical models. The operational algorithm they create will translate the satellite signals into concentrations of the same pollutants collected by the speciation monitors, at a resolution of 1 kilometer squared1 km2.16,17Epidemiologists will compare those maps with local records to study health effects associated with particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 exposure in the short and long terms, as well as during pregnancy.18 An estimated 4.1 million4.1 million deaths globally are attributed to particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5,19 and investigators have shown links between exposure to fine particles and “everything from simple asthma exacerbation20 to heart attacks21 to cancer,22” says Liu. “In recent years, it has been linked to cognitive changes23 and birth defects.24 It has such a broad spectrum of impacts.”Birth outcomes are among the health effects that MAIA researchers will study. Preeclampsia and low birthweight are some of the pregnancy and childbirth concerns already linked to air pollution.27 Image: © iStock.com/FatCamera.Short-term exposures (daily to monthly) are perhaps the easiest to study. Liu says investigators in the Atlanta region will use MAIA data to generate pollution estimates, then compare those to emergency department visits for problems such as asthma attacks and cardiovascular disease. Long-term (multiyear) exposures will be compared with hospital or physician office visits for cardiovascular disease. Pregnancy-related exposures will be studied by comparing hospital or physician office visits for preeclampsia, low-birthweight infants, and other pregnancy and childbirth concerns with particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 levels in the preceding 12 months. Given that adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, and birth outcomes have already been linked to air pollution,25–27 these studies can confirm whether MAIA findings regarding particulate matter begin subscript 2.5 end subscriptPM2.5 constituents are indeed valid for health effects studies in places without ground-based monitors.Electronic medical records simplify health studies, and Liu will have little trouble getting digital emergency department records in Georgia. However, not all hospitals in LMICs are set up to keep digital records.28 In South Africa, for instance, public hospitals have struggled to adopt them,29 so MAIA researcher Janine Wichmann, an epidemiologist at the University of Pretoria, will use records from private hospitals. This will skew the cohort toward more affluent patients, she says, “but at least, perhaps, one can then compare it to, say, European or U.S. studies.”For pregnancy studies, MAIA researchers will need access to birth certificates. Ritz says MAIA-affiliated researchers in countries without electronic recordkeeping, such as India and Ethiopia, will have to gather paper birth certificates. “You have to have special outreach efforts,” she says.Keeping It LocalWichmann and her colleagues are pleased that the MAIA team has made partnering with local researchers a priority. “Parachute science is my pet peeve,” says Rebecca Garland, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Pretoria, referring to studies conducted by outside researchers without involving local expertise or sharing findings. “Parachute scientists don’t engage with local researchers or stakeholders, so their work, and thus their results, aren’t always relevant or needed. Even if it is cool science, if it is not a priority of the local stakeholders it won’t have any impact. As these [parachute] researchers are working alone, they don’t know the actual gaps or priorities.”Once the MAIA data are available, Garland, Langerman, and Wichmann hope to see a more complete picture of how different pollutants move through the province at different times of the year. This will be important for establishing policies that protect health, Garland says. Many countries around the world have no air quality standards at all.30 South Africa adopted air quality limits for eight priority pollutants in 2004 and began setting up a network of air monitors.31 That was a good start, says Wichmann, but more still needs to be done—South Africa’s air quality standards are less stringent than WHO guidelines. For instance, the WHO guideline for sulfur dioxide is an average of 40 micrograms per meter cubed40 μg/m3 over 24 hours, compared with the South African standard of 125 micrograms per meter cubed125 μg/m3. “On the vast majority of days, the WHO standard is being exceeded [in the province],” says Wichmann. “But according to South African officials, there’s no pollution problem.”SPARTAN monitors are improving ground-based air monitor coverage in the MAIA primary target areas. Here, Siyabonga Simelane, a PhD student at the University of Johannesburg, stands with a new monitor installed by SPARTAN in the capital city (visible in the background). Image: Courtesy Kristy Langerman/University of Johannesburg.Wichmann is dubious that any amount of data will trigger South African regulatory agencies to rethink the nation’s air quality standards. The country’s economy is struggling, she says, and politicians tend to think that the economy should take precedence over environmental standards.Another epidemiologist on the MAIA project, Bart Ostro, from the University of California, Davis, offers a more optimistic view. He has seen officials change their outlook on air pollution once they are presented with analysis of local data. For example, in the 1990s, Ostro helped health researchers in Chile and Thailand determine that the particulate matter they were measuring was associated with a multitude of health effects.32“I was told later that [this research] had had a very important role in awakening scientists and politicians to the air pollution issue in these countries,” Ostro says. “Conducting studies in people’s own countries can really be a wake-up call.”Nancy Averett writes about science and the environment from Cincinnati, OH.

This human feedback, obtained from geo-tagged big textual data on the X (formerly known as Twitter) platform, is used to explore the effects of stay-at-home orders on indoor air quality ( IAQ ) perceptions globally. This analysis covers the first year of the pandemic and juxtaposes these insights with the baseline data from 2019. In this pilot study, we utilized transformer models, specifically the robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach ( RoBERTa ) algorithm, a pre-trained model based on the X data, for sentiment analysis. Results indicate an increase in negative perceptions of IAQ among occupants in 2020 compared to the 2019 baseline. The research emphasizes the untapped potential of social media analytics in shaping and refining environmental health strategies, particularly in the context of indoor environments. Findings underscore a pressing need for architects, planners, and policy-makers to prioritize IAQ in design considerations, especially in light of changing global dynamics like pandemics.

AB  - This special issue of Heart, Lung and Circulation could not be timelier and more critical. Clinicians, educators, and policymakers need implementable evidence-based strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of health care. For decades, experts have tried to warn us of the challenges of global warming and climate change. The influential Lancet Rockefeller Report heralded the Anthropocene Era where the impact of humans on the planet has left an indelible footprint on the planet [[1]Davidson P.M. Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission report: a call to action for human health.Int J Nurs Stud. Jan. 2016; 53: 1-2Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. Unfortunately, until recent times, much of the discussion of climate change has been in lofty, academic, nebulous and esoteric terms, leaving gaps for sceptics, propaganda and misinformation. Recent bushfires, floods and a global pandemic have lifted words off the page and created a burning platform for climate action. Current geopolitical instability and the devastating impact of a global pandemic have accentuated the urgency for focus and action. There is a growing awareness that human and planetary health are intricately interconnected, and that human health is reliant on the health of our planet. Consequently, each one-degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a 6% increase in cardiovascular disease and we are also aware of the impact of air pollution and the associated risks of hospitalisation, myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality [[2]Kang Y. Tang H. Zhang L. Wang S. Wang X. Chen Z. et al.Long-term temperature variability and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases: a large, representative cohort study in China.Environ Pollut. 2021; 278116831Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar,[3]Verhoeven J.I. Allach Y. Vaartjes I.C.H. Klijn C.J.M. de Leeuw F.-E. Ambient air pollution and the risk of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.Lancet Planet Health. 2021; 5: e542-e552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar]. Bushfires cause smoke pollutants and impact air quality, contributing to premature death and increased cardiovascular and respiratory-related hospitalisations, whilst also destroying ecosystems [[4]Nguyen H.D. Azzi M. White S. Salter D. Trieu T. Morgan G. et al.The summer 2019-2020 wildfires in east coast Australia and their impacts on air quality and health in New South Wales, Australia.Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021; 18: 3538Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar]. Moreover, major environmental disasters such as earthquakes and floods are stressor events that can adversely contribute to cardiovascular disease [[5]Aoki T. Fukumoto Y. Yasuda S. Sakata Y. Ito K. Takahashi J. et al.The great East Japan earthquake disaster and cardiovascular diseases.Eur Heart J. 2012; 33: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar]. The impact of climate change on human health is illustrated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Figure 1 [[6]Centers for Disease Control and PreventionClimate Effects on Health. 2022.https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/default.htmGoogle Scholar]. Increasingly, it is also recognised that social determinants of health contribute to climate change impacts, and it is often those who are most vulnerable that are most impacted by environmental factors. In light of increasing temperatures, at-risk populations, individuals older than 65 years, and those younger than one year of age, have been exposed to many more heat waves and suffered adverse health outcomes [[7]Romanello M. Di Napoli C. Drummond P. Green C. Kennard H.

Moreover, changes in our ecosystem are affecting the spread of infectious diseases, and the risk of emerging threats. As Redfern and colleagues recommend in their editorial, a “whole-of-planet effort” is needed to make significant reductions to meet the challenges of climate change and decades of inaction [[8]Redfern J. Gregory A.T. Raman J. Figtree G.A. Singleton A. Denniss A.R. Ferguson C.

The reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have made for some sobering headlines, increasing focus on decreasing carbon emissions; this has gained attention from both the public and private sectors [[9]Khan N. Our final warning: Intergovernmental panel on climate change and primary care.Br J Gen Pract. 2022; 72: 271Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar]. Decreasing carbon emissions will require a multifaceted, multi-sectoral strategy addressing not just policy but organisational cultures and individual behaviours. Health care contributes significantly to carbon emissions, yet this is not commonly recognised or discussed by health care professions, let alone addressed, in their undergraduate and postgraduate curriculae [[10]Quitmann C.

Research by Malik and colleagues demonstrates that 7% of Australia’s carbon footprint is attributed to health care and that nearly half of this contribution (approximately 3% of this total) can be attributed to hospitals [[12]Malik A.

Nurses comprise the single largest health workforce in our health system. We are in a unique position to help address reducing carbon emissions and achieve the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals that lie at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—a shared blueprint, adopted in 2015, “for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future” (www.sdgs.un.org/goals) [[14]Rosa W.E.

Inglis and colleagues have provided eight priorities for action in their call to action published on behalf of the Cardiovascular Nursing Council of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, in this issue [[16]Inglis S.C.

These priorities are 1) individual counselling to empower self-care in climate-related disasters and highlight the need for an ‘emergency action plan’; 2) case management for those experiencing environmental disasters with access to specialist social work and psychology services; 3) improving educational resources; 4) increasing partnerships to improve understanding of the health impacts of climate change; 5) First Nations peoples’ leadership; 6) maximising the potential of telehealth; 7) responsible and sustainable logistics; and, 8) policy and advocacy [[16]Inglis S.C.

Bardsley K. et al.Cardiovascular nursing and climate change: a call to action from the CSANZ Cardiovascular Nursing Council.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 16-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. To date, many of our attempts to address climate change have been reactive and not focussed on prevention. We must plan, organise, and adapt health care delivery to reduce the environmental impact through the implementation of environmentally sustainable health systems. This includes rapidly implementing what works, and de-implementing or reducing what causes harm to the environment. Further, in designing new health care interventions we must increasingly consider the environmental impact of interventions and the carbon cost. So how can cardiovascular health professionals reduce their carbon footprint? This is more than reducing the number of single-use coffee cups. There is an urgency about this; however, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are actionable steps we can all take to reduce carbon emissions and help to achieve Paris Agreement goals—the legally binding international treaty of climate change adopted in late 2015 (unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement). Achieving these targets will require both collaboration and political will, particularly given the complexity of the health care system. Firstly, hospitals consume a large amount of energy and emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Hospitals should consider switching to renewable energy, although this may only be achievable through intersectoral partnerships. In Australia, there is significant state and federal investment in the bricks and mortar of hospitals; it is critical that these are designed to be carbon-neutral and sustainable. This should be part of strategic planning, with governing boards bearing the responsibility for monitoring and accountability. Another important contributor is the use of medical equipment and devices in health care. Imaging machinery, for example, requires high amounts of energy. It is therefore critical that energy requirements play a role in decision-making when designing and planning new health care facilities to ensure efficient and effective use and sustainable operating models. Reducing the environmental impact of diagnosis and treatment is an important, key challenge—particularly in the context of increasing multi-morbidity. This may mean more judicious use of medical imaging and diagnostic procedures, increased virtual care, and models that address multi-morbidity and assess health care within a values-based framework [[17]Wise S. Hall J. Haywood P. Khana N. Hossain L. van Gool K. Paying for value: options for value-based payment reform in Australia.Aust Health Rev. 2022; 46: 129-133Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. Recycling and minimising single-use items or unnecessary waste is not straightforward. For example, many single-use items are often used in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory or operating room. Szirt and colleagues provide some practical strategies in this issue to help address environmental sustainability in this setting [[18]Szirt R. Monjur M.R. McGovern L. Charlesworth K. O’Connor S. Weaver J.C. et al.Environmental sustainability in the cardiac catheter laboratory.Heart Lung Circ. 2023; 32: 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar]. There is a need to reconsider the single-use nature of many items in health care, currently required for safety (to minimise transmission of infectious disease) and by regulation. Whilst sterilisation procedures have advanced, sterilisation itself uses energy and is a contributor to carbon emissions. On average, each health worker contributes 13 kg of waste (per staffed bed, per day), with non-sustainable items ending up in landfill or being incinerated [[19]Cook C. Demorest S.L. Schenk E. Nurses and climate action.Am J Nurs. Apr. 2019; 119: 54-60Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar]. We can do better. Personal responsibility is vital, although we need to collaborate to achieve policy and system change. Virtual care or telehealth offers promise through the transformation of high-resource clinical facilities to lower-resource home-based care. Although the carbon footprint of data storage is an important factor to consider, cloud-based data storage can help reduce overall power use. There should also be closer examination of the environmental impacts of routine health care activities, such as laundry and travel. There is a fine balance to strike between the benefits of hygiene maintenance and infection prevention achieved by changing all patients’ bedsheets on a daily basis and the considerable costs of the associated power-consumption. Travel comes in many forms—patients travelling to hospital or clinic appointments, transportation of health care consumables, and domestic and international air travel to-and-from scientific meetings. The global COVID-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for virtual working and virtual care, and it is important to consider sustainability as a factor in decision making in these new models of care provision. There is an increase in specialisation in health care, and this is juxtaposed with the increase in complex multimorbidity. As the population ages, and multimorbidity becomes an increasingly defining feature of general health status, we may need to question the sustainability of super-specialised clinics for single conditions when this can often result in multiple hospital visits for those patients with more than one (potentially related) condition, such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure and diabetes mellitus. Peak bodies, such as the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, need to consider the sustainability of in-person meetings and the viability of hybrid meetings for those individuals wishing to minimise their carbon footprint. No single discipline or institution holds the panacea for reducing the carbon footprint of health care. There is need for cross-disciplinary collaboration and partnership in developing carbon emission reduction strategies and sustainable interventions. This means health professionals sharing their expertise and working together with designers, architects, procurement and waste personnel, infectious diseases experts, logistics officers, and health service planners. We must all recognise our critical contributions to health care sustainability at all levels: our society, our health care organisations, and by our own individual actions. There is much we can do as individuals, and this comes down to factors such as our personal choices in food consumption, travel and energy use. Engaging in political advocacy around issues of climate change and advocating for those individuals and communities at highest risk is also important. These strategies will all help to shift us from mere rhetoric to action and these choices, although they seem small, can be cumulative and impactful. Addressing climate change also means looking beyond our shores and considering health within a global ecosystem [[20]Patz J.A. Frumkin H. Holloway T. Vimont D.J. Haines A. Climate change: challenges and opportunities for global health.JAMA. 2014; 312: 1565-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar]. While the contribution of low-income countries to carbon emissions is relatively low, the economic and associated health impacts of increasing temperatures are considerable for them [[21]Acevedo S. Mrkaic M. Pugacheva E. Topalova P. The unequal burden of rising temperatures: how can low-income countries cope? International Monetary Fund Blog. 2022.https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2017/09/27/the-unequal-burden-of-rising-temperatures-how-can-low-income-countries-copeGoogle Scholar]. For many of Australia and New Zealand’s global neighbours in the Pacific, the threats of climate change are very real, and they need our help and assistance. This special issue has cast an important spotlight on the relationship between environment and climate and health, which not only affects planetary health but also, more specifically, impacts our cardiovascular health. Fostering a focus on research and collaboration that not only prevents but also mitigates the impact of climate change on health will be critical in preparing health professionals of the future. The cataclysmic impacts of recent years, including bushfires and floods in the context of a global pandemic, have forced us to refocus and recalibrate our efforts. Experts tried to warn us of these looming threats for decades but, for the most part, we have been caught by surprise and, consequently, there has been death and suffering which will likely be evident for many years to come. Sometimes, when viewing the magnitude of the problem, it is hard to see a path forward, but we can draw on successful programs, such as decreasing tobacco usage, to see how we can change and make a difference. This special issue provides a path forward and a platform for action—it is now up to us all, individually and collectively, to act. None to declare.

AB  - In November 2022, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) took place in Egypt, bringing together global leaders to discuss the issue of climate change. The conference marked a shift in the focus of climate negotiations, with greater emphasis placed on adaptation and resilience strategies rather than on mitigation. The outcome of COP27 was the creation of a loss-and-damage fund to support countries most affected by the climate crisis. The message from the conference was clear, which was as follows: it is no longer possible to focus only on preventing serious consequences of climate change, and it is therefore necessary to invest in adaptation efforts, with special attention to the needs of the most vulnerable people. Anthropogenic climate change is altering the pattern, severity, and frequency of diseases that we see as frontline clinicians. It is increasingly contributing to heat-related illnesses, water- and vector-borne diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, accidental and nonaccidental trauma, and mental health disorders.1Sorensen C.J. Salas R.N. Rublee C. et al.Clinical implications of climate change on US emergency medicine: challenges and opportunities.Ann Emerg Med. 2020; 76: 168-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar Heat waves, floodings, and wildfires are intensifying, resulting in disruption in health care delivery and surges in acute care demand.2Salas R.N. Solomon C.G. The climate crisis—health and care delivery.N Engl J Med. 2019; 381: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar The effects are disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as specific racial and ethnic groups, those living in poverty, those at extremes of age, and those with chronic medical conditions. In the United States alone, the health costs related to climate change and air pollution are already estimated to far exceed $800 billion per year and are expected to increase further.3De Alwis D. Limaye V.S. The Costs of Climate Inaction: The Economic Burden of Fossil Fuels and Climate Change on Health in the United States. MSCCH, NRDC and WHPCA, 2021Google Scholar For years, physicians across specialties have recognized the link between climate and human health and have engaged in related research, advocacy, policy, and education. The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, which was founded in 2016, now has membership participation of 46 national medical societies—including the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)—representing over 70% of US physicians.4Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health Summary 2022.https://medsocietiesforclimatehealth.org/aboutGoogle Scholar It is becoming standard for physicians, and emergency physicians specifically, to recognize climate change as an important global health issue. However, many experience significant constraints in engaging in climate action at a personal and professional level.5Kotcher J. Maibach E. Miller J. et al.Views of health professionals on climate change and health: a multinational survey study.Lancet Planet Health. 2021; 5: e316-e323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar As we enter an era in which climate change adaptation and resilience are becoming exceedingly important, what can emergency physicians do within the purview of their clinical practice to improve climate health outcomes in their communities? Taking advantage of targeted quality patient education in the emergency department (ED) is a low-cost and high-yield way for emergency physicians to improve climate-related health outcomes. In 2018, ACEP released a policy statement emphasizing the important role of emergency medicine in addressing climate crisis. Among 6 action items, ACEP highlighted our role in “educat(ing) patients on appropriate precautions in extreme weather, avoidance of exacerbation triggers, early identification of exacerbations, and temporizing measures when needed.”6American College of Emergency PhysiciansImpact of climate change on public health and implications for emergency medicine.Ann Emerg Med. 2018; 72: e49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar Oftentimes, encounters in the ED are the only contact that at-risk populations have with the health care system. Therefore, these brief encounters are invaluable opportunities to provide high-quality education relevant to the acute patient presentation and prevent mild climate-related illnesses from turning into life-threatening disease exacerbations, infections, or injuries. Within this framework, emergency physicians ought to adhere to the following aspects: (1) understand how the communities they serve are being affected by climate change, (2) identify climate-related ED presentations and patients most at risk from severe health effects of climate change,7Balbus J.M. Malina C. Identifying vulnerable subpopulations for climate change health effects in the United States.J Occup Environ Med. 2009; 51: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar,8Crimmins A.

Emergency medicine has long capitalized on opportunities to deliver preventive services to reduce the burden of disease and injury in populations at risk. For instance, patient-physician conversations are a common practice for public health conditions, such as tobacco cessation,9Pelletier J.H. Strout T.D. Baumann M.R.

In 2019, the American Medical Association passed a resolution supporting teaching on climate change in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education settings.12American Medical AssociationResolution #A19-302: Climate Change Education Across the Medical Education Continuum. Adopted June 2019.https://www.psr.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ama-climate-change-education-policy-2019.pdfGoogle Scholar Since that time, frameworks that integrate climate change into residency training have been proposed13Philipsborn R.P. Sheffield P. White A. et al.Climate change and the practice of medicine: essentials for resident education.Acad Med. 2021; 96: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and a new generation of physicians trained in climate change and health have emerged as leaders in their communities, utilizing and operationalizing the ever-growing scientific evidence that supports the rapid action for health.14Lemery J. Balbus J. Sorensen C.J. et al.Training clinical and public health leaders in climate and health.Health Aff (Millwood). 2020; 39: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar Yet, our response to incorporating topics of climate change into the training of emergency physicians at the bedside represents a profound opportunity for growth and improved patient care. Within the Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) statements proposed by the American Board of Emergency Medicine, KSAs PE0 (“Prevention and Education”) states that emergency physicians should be able to “lead or participate in programs that educate patients and the community about injury and illness prevention; identify preventive measures to avoid/delay illness or prevent trauma; (and) educate patients regarding preventive measures to improve lifestyle, avoid/delay illness, or prevent trauma, and to optimize patient outcomes.”15American Board of Emergency MedicineKnowledge Skills and Abilities. Approved February 2021.https://www.abem.org/public/resources/emergency-medicine-milestones-ksasGoogle Scholar Incorporating brief climate-focused patient education discussions is a valuable opportunity for supervising faculty to evaluate trainees on their bedside communication and professionalism while weaving threads of climate education into a busy clinical teaching shift. Consider the following cases. Both are clinical presentations that are being amplified by climate change. Both are also scenarios in which taking advantage of a teachable moment may improve patient health resilience and prevent climate-related life-threatening illnesses. Although not comprehensive, our goal is to enhance patient care, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. A 76-year-old woman presented to the ED in July with dizziness. The patient had a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. She lived by herself in an apartment with no air conditioning in the suburbs of Chicago. The workup was reassuring and symptoms improved after rehydration and cooling. The patient was discharged home with a diagnosis of heat exhaustion. Heat illness ranges from mild disorders such as heat exhaustion to life-threatening conditions such as heat stroke. Providers and patients should be aware that there is no specific environmental temperature at which heat stroke tends to occur and precautions should be taken even with temperatures as low as 86 °F (30 °C) especially in areas with high relative humidity.16People’s Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care MedicineExpert consensus on standardized diagnosis and treatment for heat stroke.Mil Med Res. 2016; 3: 1PubMed Google Scholar People who are most at risk for heat stroke and who should be considered for patient education include those with chronic diseases, housing insecurity, substance abuse, psychiatric disease, at extremes of ages, and outdoor workers. Medications such as beta blockers, diuretics,17Hausfater P. Megarbane B.

Samples of patient education can be found in Appendix E1 (English language) and Appendix E2 (Spanish language) (available at http://www.annemergmed.com). A 14-year-old boy with type I diabetes mellitus presented to the ED with abdominal pain and fatigue. A couple of weeks ago, his home in Virginia lost power after a hurricane made landfall in the United States. The patient was diagnosed with severe hyperglycemia without diabetic ketoacidosis as a result of expired insulin and inability to obtain a new prescription in a timely manner. After receiving intravenous fluids and subcutaneous insulin, he was discharged with a refill of his medications. Morbidity and mortality after extreme weather events amplified by climate change such as hurricanes and floods are complex and oftentimes difficult to quantify. Short-term health effects of extreme weather events include unintentional blunt and thermal injuries, drownings, and exposure to carbon monoxide and accidental chemical releases. These typically account for the majority of deaths reported after weather events. However, this can represent a gross underestimation,19Santos-Lozada A.R. Howard J.T. Use of death counts from vital statistics to calculate excess deaths in Puerto Rico following hurricane Maria.JAMA. 2018; 320: 1491-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar as a substantial portion of morbidity and mortality happens weeks to months after weather events from profound disruptions in environmental and social infrastructures.20Waddell S.L.

Crowding and time constraints of a busy ED often make spending additional time at the patient’s bedside challenging. Additionally, the spectrum of languages and reading comprehension experienced across EDs as well as competing priorities can make it difficult to find a one-size-fits-all patient education model. Better evidence is needed to optimize the organization and delivery of patient education,25Pétré B. Margat A. Servotte J.C. et al.Patient education in the emergency department: take advantage of the teachable moment.Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract. 2020; 25: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar especially for rapidly evolving public health threats, such as climate change. Yet, there is much we already know that can be better disseminated and acted upon to reduce the demand for care and potentially improve outcomes that matter most to patients. Given the scale in which climate change is already affecting human health and the need for rapid adaptation and improved resilience, considering all manners of patient counseling seems prudent. In addition to provider-patient conversations and traditional written discharge instructions, EDs may consider alternative forms of educating their patients on how climate is affecting their health, such as pictographic illustration26Hill B. Perri-Moore S. Kuang J. et al.Automated pictographic illustration of discharge instructions with glyph: impact on patient recall and satisfaction.J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2016; 23: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and short videos. In conclusion, in emergency medicine, we have the unique privilege of interfacing with patients who often have limited means of accessing medical care and face multiple barriers to achieving optimal health. It, therefore, falls under our purview to share the evidence and individualized education to address gaps in awareness and understanding. The potential to reduce adverse clinical outcomes far outweighs our small effort. It is a service to our patients and each other as we attempt to reduce acute care demands and keep our communities healthy. As stakeholders across disciplines and sectors work to limit the adverse effects of global warming, we as clinicians and educators can adapt and promote climate resilient development right in our EDs. Discharge instructions that link climate hazards to health is just one example by which planetary health is integrated with bedside education.

AB  - <jats:p>Wildfire prediction plays a vital role in the management and conservation of forest ecosystems. By providing detailed risk assessments, it contributes to the reduction of fire frequency and severity, safeguards forest resources, supports ecological stability, and ensures human safety. This study systematically reviews wildfire prediction literature from 2003 to 2023, emphasizing research trends and collaborative trends. Our findings reveal a significant increase in research activity between 2019 and 2023, primarily driven by the United States Forest Service and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The majority of this research was published in prominent journals such as the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Forest Ecology and Management, Remote Sensing, and Forests. These publications predominantly originate from Europe, the United States, and China. Since 2020, there has been substantial growth in the application of machine learning techniques in predicting forest fires, particularly in estimating fire occurrence probabilities, simulating fire spread, and projecting post-fire environmental impacts. Advanced algorithms, including deep learning and ensemble learning, have shown superior accuracy, suggesting promising directions for future research. Additionally, the integration of machine learning with cellular automata has markedly improved the simulation of fire behavior, enhancing both efficiency and precision. The profound impact of climate change on wildfire prediction also necessitates the inclusion of extensive climate data in predictive models. Beyond conventional studies focusing on fire behavior and occurrence probabilities, forecasting the environmental and ecological consequences of fires has become integral to forest fire management and vital for formulating more effective wildfire strategies. The study concludes that significant regional disparities in knowledge exist, underscoring the need for improved research capabilities in underrepresented areas. Moreover, there is an urgent requirement to enhance the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, such as machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning, and to intensify efforts in identifying and leveraging various wildfire drivers to refine prediction accuracy. The insights generated from this field will profoundly augment our understanding of wildfire prediction, assisting policymakers and practitioners in managing forest resources more sustainably and averting future wildfire calamities.</jats:p>

TI  - Does restoration fire enhance the regeneration of deciduous trees in boreal forests? : A systematic review
AU  - Matheis, Miriam
AB  - The prevalent non-intervention policy of protected areas leads, particular in combination with the suppression of forest fires, to increasingly denser forests. This favours shade-tolerant species and outcompete deciduous pioneer species. The latter can be seen as key species in boreal forests and contribute greatly to the forests’ biodiversity. Prescribed fire is considered to serve as a management tool to mimic natural disturbance and enhance the regeneration of deciduous trees. However, the effectiveness of prescribed fires has hardly been evaluated in this regard. A systematic review (SR) was conducted in order to find evidence for the effects of fire on deciduous tree regeneration. A protocol defining all steps, from the search string and the inclusion criteria to the data synthesis in a meta-analysis, was developed. A total of 2135 articles have been consecutively screened on title, abstract and based on the full-text. Data of 37 articles that have passed the screening on full-text have been entered in a systematic map. Seventeen articles were analysed in a meta-analysis. Effect sizes (Hedges g) were calculated for each study and their heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q) was evaluated in several moderator- analyses. Most of the included studies were conducted in North America, investigating post-fire regeneration of either oak (Quercus spp.) or aspen (Populus spp.) forests. Eurasian studies are clearly underrepresented. The study revealed higher response effects of aspen and birch (Betula spp.) and a smaller but still significant effect for oak and hickory (Carya spp.). The combination of fire with a thinning-treatment showed the highest effects and was significant for aspen and birches in comparison to non-fire comparators. However, there was no evidence found that the fire effect is enduring over longer time periods or that fire actually could ensure the long term persistence of aspen in the forest.

AB  - Planetary health and human health are interconnected. Increased anthropogenic activity, including deforestation, urbanisation, modern agricultural and animal breeding practices, overuse of fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotic, production of synthetic chemicals and plastics, and the use of fossil fuels and biomass for energy, have altered the Earth's environment.1, 2 More than 350,000 chemicals have been introduced to human lives without any concern on their health impacts and more than 120,000 of them have been even inappropriately reported.3 99% of the global population breathe polluted air that exceeds the guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Globally, 7.8% of all deaths in 2019 were attributed to outdoor air pollution, with this fraction exceeding 12% in some countries. In 2019, there were 455,000 reported deaths attributed to asthma, predominantly occurring in low- and middle-income countries due to the difficulties associated with under-diagnosis and under-treatment. These countries also have a high prevalence of exposure to outdoor and indoor pollutants, including active or passive tobacco smoke.4-6 Asthma development and evolution follow a complex interplay between the individual genetic background and environmental exposures, such as indoor and outdoor air pollutants, infectious agents, allergens, irritants, or occupational factors.7-9 As physicians and scientists, we have seen first-hand how increasing outdoor and indoor air pollution impacts respiratory health, tried to understand the molecular changes driving the environmental-driven asthma symptoms and have used this knowledge to treat patients with asthma. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is the world leader in allergy and asthma science and education. The key opinion leaders of the environmental health world gathered around the EAACI initiative to evaluate the impact of outdoor and indoor pollution on patients with asthma and to provide recommendations for prevention, patient care and mitigation of the impact of short-term exposure to outdoor and indoor pollutants, including environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and active smoking on asthma-related outcomes. The impact of extreme temperatures was also evaluated (Figure 1). Several systematic reviews (SR) were conducted.10-12 Multiple studies have shown an association between outdoor air pollutants and poor early life lung growth, development of allergic sensitization, acutely impaired lung function, respiratory tract infections, and numerous asthma-related outcomes, such as new-onset asthma, asthma exacerbations and deterioration of asthma control, lung function decline, increased use of asthma medication and of healthcare resources, including visits to emergency department and hospital admissions. However, epidemiological studies have often yielded inconsistent findings, and not all studies have found significant associations,13 which may be related to both variations in statistical, measurement, and modelling methodologies between studies as well as differences between countries and/or regions in the concentrations and composition of outdoor air pollution. The recent SR published by EAACI showed that following short-term exposure to outdoor pollutants referenced by the current WHO Air Quality Guideline as single or mixed pollutants (particulate matter [PM] 2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO, and heavy traffic) there is an increase in the risk of asthma-related adverse outcomes, especially for hospital admissions and emergency department visits.10 Unfortunately, there was low to very low certainty evidence that interventions aiming to reduce the level of outdoor pollutants may decrease asthma exacerbations. A large-scale human biomonitoring survey conducted in Europe between 2014 and 2021 identified at least 46 pesticides and their metabolites in adults and children across five European countries, with at least two pesticides detected in 84% of the samples collected. Exposure to outdoor pesticides such as fumigants may increase the risk of new-onset asthma in agricultural workers, while exposure to 1,3-dichloropropene may increase the risk of asthma-related emergency department visits.10 It has to be noted here that the focus of these EAACI guidelines was asthma-related outcomes and multiple effects of pesticides and pollution on other diseases remain to be further analysed. Global temperatures and the frequency and severity of climate change events such as heatwaves, cold spells, accompanied by wildfires, sand and dust storms, and thunderstorms have all increased over recent decades.1, 13 As per the SR conducted, heatwaves and cold spells may increase the likelihood of asthma-related emergency visits and hospital admissions, potentially contributing to higher asthma mortality rates.10 Among the environmental conditions, indoor factors are of particular interest because globally people spend more than 80% of their time indoors. Health effects following exposure to indoor air pollutants may be experienced immediately after exposure or years later. There is a clear impact of indoor air pollutants on the risk of new-onset asthma and numerous asthma-related outcomes, such as exacerbations and deterioration of asthma control, lung function decline, increased use of asthma medication and healthcare resources, including visits to emergency department and hospital admissions, and increased mortality. Ninety-four studies were included in the SRs evaluating the impact of indoor pollutants: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), cleaning agents, damp/mould and indoor pesticides. There is moderate certainty evidence that exposure to damp/mould increases the risk of new-onset wheeze.11 Exposure to cleaning agents may be associated with a higher risk of new-onset asthma and with asthma severity, while exposure to pesticides and VOCs may increase the risk of new-onset asthma.10 As the level of certainty is low or very low for most of the available evidence on the impact of indoor pollutants on asthma-related outcomes more rigorous research in the field is warranted. Tobacco consumption is the single largest avoidable health risk, and the most relevant cause of premature death in the European Union (EU), responsible for nearly 700,000 deaths every year. Around 50% of smokers die on average 14 years earlier. Despite considerable progress made in recent years with the tobacco-banning policies, the number of smokers in the EU is still high: 26% of the overall population and 29% of young Europeans aged 15–24 smoke.4-6 It has become evident that a considerable part of the increase in asthma prevalence worldwide is due to maternal smoking in pregnancy or due to early-life exposure of children to ETS acting through epigenetic transgenerational effects.14-17 The recently published SR of 67 longitudinal studies proved with moderate certainty evidence that prenatal ETS increases the risk of recurrent wheeze and may increase the risk of new-onset asthma and low lung function.12 Postnatal ETS increases the risk of new-onset asthma and recurrent wheezing and may impact lung function. Another SR of 24 longitudinal studies showed that ETS increases the risk of severe asthma exacerbations and impairs asthma control and lung function.12 Active smoking increases the risk of severe asthma exacerbations and suboptimal asthma control and may impact asthma-related quality-of-life and lung function.12 There is no high-quality evidence from the SRs on the causal relationship between exposure to pollutants and adverse asthma-related outcomes. This calls for better quality research to explore the causal association within the frame of unbiased exposomic research.2, 9, 18, 19 Increasing the quality of the evidence should involve the implementation of standardized methods for assessing and documenting both short- and long-term exposure, while distinguishing between household, occupational or environmental sources of pollutants. Nevertheless, this extensive research evidence indicates the need to avoid being exposed to severely polluted environments and to be prepared for any asthma unfavourable outcome in settings with heavy pollution. To support the healthcare professional caring for patients with asthma, EAACI prepared a Guideline on the impact of outdoor pollution exposure on asthma-related outcomes using the GRADE approach.20 Recommendations are provided in a framework supporting rational decisions for healthcare professionals and patients to individualize and improve asthma management and for policymakers and regulators as an evidence-informed reference to help setting legally binding standards and goals for outdoor air quality at international, national, and local levels. For clinicians, this evidence guides their asthma management strategies toward achieving optimal asthma control. It involves assessing exposure risks and impacts, customizing interventions based on the type of pollutant and considering co-exposures. Shared decision-making with the patient helps select the most suitable interventions. A personalized approach is also suggested when advising asthma patients about occupational exposure risks. Collaborating with patient representatives for raising awareness, educating, and advising patients—especially those belonging to the most susceptible and vulnerable groups—is also strongly recommended. Smart home or workplace-based asthma services that reduce or eliminate environmental asthma triggers, ingenious urban planning, green technology, and e-mobility incentives are all excellent tools to achieve optimal air quality. The current EAACI guidelines for asthma management are expected to significantly improve the efforts of healthcare professionals towards better asthma care. By offering patient-tailored solutions, these guidelines aim to enhance asthma-related outcomes. Multilevel, multi-sectoral adaptation, and mitigation actions are vital to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and provide safe housing. National, regional and international asthma programs should develop a strategic plan to document the outdoor and indoor pollution, implement adaptation and mitigation strategies and assess improvements. These programs must prioritize addressing environmentally-triggered asthma in underserved and disproportionately affected populations within their strategic plans and activities. Additionally, healthcare education programs at all levels should incorporate environmental health strategies. None. None. The authors declare no conflict of interest related to this manuscript.

This chapter provides a conceptual framework and vocabulary related to characterizing human exposures to smoke, focusing on inhalation exposure at individual and population levels. We briefly describe fundamental concepts of exposure assessment relevant to air pollution from biomass burning. Studying exposure requires knowledge of both the receptors (e.g., how the stressor acts on the human body, relevant periods of susceptibility) and the ways in which the stressor presents at this interface (e.g., fate and transport of chemical agents, social patterns that affect exposures and access to mitigation, time and activity patterns). We present considerations for quantifying exposure to air pollution, specifically for developing geospatial assessments of exposure, the types of exposure metrics, and associated reporting error and uncertainty. An area of active research is to what extent PM 2.5 exposure from smoke is associated with various types of health outcomes as compared with fossil fuel combustion emissions and all other sources and if similar populations are susceptible. Finally, we discuss research needs for quantifying exposure to fire pollution. REFERENCES Abdo , M. , Ward , I. , O'Dell , K. , Ford , B. , Pierce , J. R. , Fischer , E. V. , et al. ( 2019 ).

AB  - Fires in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas is a worldwide problem, which is gaining more importance over time due to climate change and constructions in the WUI areas. Standards and guidelines may greatly help the activities of planning, prevention and protection against wildfires. Some countries/States/local communities can already rely on existing standards and guidelines, while other areas, even if potentially subject to wildfires, not. This work presents a systematic review of standards and guidelines belonging to selected countries/States/local communities in the Western world, namely: North American countries (USA, Canada), European countries (France, Italy), Oceanic countries (Australia, New Zealand), and trans-national codes. The main information reviewed includes: hazard definition and severity classes, land factors (vegetation, defensible space and topographic factors), building materials and construction requirements, utilities (resources, firefighters, planning, outreach), fire protection measures, environmental factors (weather, fire history), and access requirements. A comparative analysis regarding the main similarities/differences between all the considered standards and guidelines was performed after the review process. This comparative analysis may be useful for the further development and/or revision of (novel) standards/guidelines for planning, preventing and protecting against fires in WUI areas.

AB  - First posted February 14, 2023 For additional information, contact: Director, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center777 NW 9th Street, Suite 400Corvallis, OR 97330 Loss and degradation of sagebrush rangelands due to an accelerated invasive annual grass-wildfire cycle and other stressors are significant management, conservation, and economic issues in the western United States. These sagebrush rangelands comprise a unique biome spanning 11 states, support over 350 wildlife species, and provide important ecosystem services that include stabilizing the economies of western communities. Impacts to sagebrush ecosystem processes over large areas due to the annual grass-wildfire cycle necessitated the development of a coordinated, science-based strategy for improving efforts to achieve long-term protection, conservation, and restoration of sagebrush rangelands, which was framed in 2015 under the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy (IRFMS). Central to this effort was the development of an Actionable Science Plan (Plan) that identified 37 priority science needs (Needs) for informing the actions proposed under the 5 topics (Fire, Invasives, Restoration, Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse, Climate and Weather) that were part of the collective focus of the IRFMS. Notable keys to this effort were identification of the Needs co-produced by managers and researchers, and a focus on resulting science being “actionable.”Substantial investments aimed at fulfilling the Needs identified in the Plan have been made since its release in 2016. While the state of the science has advanced considerably, the extent to which knowledge gaps remain relative to identified Needs is relatively unknown. Moreover, new Needs have likely emerged since the original strategy as results from actionable science reveal new questions and possible (yet untested) solutions. A quantifiable assessment of the progress made on the original science Needs can identify unresolved gaps and new information that can help inform prioritization of future research efforts.This report details a systematic literature review that evaluated how well peer-reviewed journal articles and formal technical reports published between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, addressed six needs (hereinafter “Needs”) identified under the Invasives topic in the Plan. The topic outlined research Needs related to the control of invasive plant species in sagebrush rangelands, with a special emphasis on invasive annual grasses. We established the level of progress towards addressing each Need following a standardized set of criteria, and developed summaries detailing how research objectives nested within Needs identified in the Plan (“Next Steps”) were either addressed well, partially addressed, or remain outstanding (that is, addressed poorly) in the literature through 2020. Our searches resulted in the inclusion of 198 science products that at least partially addressed a Need identified in the Invasives topic. The Needs that were well and partially addressed included:studies of natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the distribution and spread;methods of preventing, eradicating and controlling invasive plant species;development of mapping techniques that provide regularly updated annual grass and fine fuel projections; andassessment of the efficacy of potential cheatgrass biocontrol agents.Needs that were addressed poorly included (1) investigations of livestock grazing as a tool for managing invasive plants and (2) investigations of cheatgrass die-offs and identification and subsequent study of potential biocontrol agents associated with those die-offs. The information provided in this assessment will assist updating the Plan along with other science strategies.

AB  - Despite recent research, a systematic approach to understanding wildfire governance is lacking. This article addresses this deficit by systematically reviewing governance theories and concepts applied so far in the academic literature on wildfires as a step toward achieving their more effective and holistic management. We engage our findings with the wider governance literature to unlock new thinking on wildfires as a process and outcome. This comparative approach enables us to propose a novel framework for analyzing wildfire governance based on four pillars: (1) actor participation in decision-making and decision taking; (2) actor collaboration and coproduction across and within levels, scales, and networks; (3) path dependencies and local place-based dynamics of wildfire incidence and comprehension; and (4) actor adaptation to and anticipation of wildfire risk to fashion effective institutions that address the global wildfire challenge. We show how this framework can help specify a suite of bespoke analytical and policy practitioner approaches to facilitate preemptive and restorative wildfire strategies via new networks between communities, states, and wider society, thus providing the basis for more equitable and sustainable governance of wildfire risks and impacts.

The importance of the kidney and renal physiology in the context of physical activity and exercise can be easily overlooked. However, over the past 3 decades, research has uncovered the relevance of the kidney in regulating physiological responses to exercise and has also shed light on how exercise can alter the pathophysiology associated with kidney diseases (Fig. 1). The American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology has played a sentinel role in disseminating a vast array of key studies in this field, ranging from preclinical studies that identified an altered skeletal muscle physiological response to exercise in chronic azotemia in the late 1980s (1) to more recent concepts that have used environmental and exercise physiology to better understand impairments in the oxygen cascade in patients with kidney diseases (2, 3). In support of this, we encourage submissions to the Call for Papers on “Exercise and the Kidney in Health and Disease.” Details can be found at https://journals.physiology.org/ajprenal/exercise-and-the-kidney-in-health-and-disease.Figure 1.Current and future perspectives for exercise and the kidney in health and disease. Figure created with BioRender.Download figureDownload PowerPointInitial work in this field has characterized the acute effects of exercise on renal physiology that include a blood flow shunting away from the kidney to meet the metabolic demand of the working skeletal muscle, transient decreases in glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate), and antidiuretic hormone-mediated reductions in urine flow rate, and increases in proteinuria (4). This work has since evolved to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of acute kidney injury associated with exercising or performing physical work in the heat and participating in more extreme sporting events such as marathons (4–6). Advances in this area have a translational impact on occupational health and safety for groups such as firefighters, agricultural workers, and miners and for athlete safety with the increased uptake of extreme exercise events such as Ironman triathlons and ultramarathons. In addition, it has also provided some insight into the largely unknown pathophysiology of Mesoamerican nephropathy (6). Considering the record-breaking heat waves recorded in 2022, coupled with the increase in air pollution from more severe and frequent wildfires, there is a need for studies that ascertain the effects on renal function of performing activities of daily living and occupational and recreational activities under such conditions. Identifying renal protective interventions for activity in these environmental conditions is equally as important. This area of research is critical given that electrolyte imbalances and dehydration are leading causes of hospitalization during these events, particularly in the most vulnerable populations such as older individuals and those with cardiovascular and kidney diseases.With irrefutable evidence linking physical inactivity with noncommunicable chronic disease, an important line of research in this field has been aimed at understanding the role of exercise in preventing renal dysfunction and chronic kidney disease and to counteract the adverse effects of poor diet on renal function. In this regard, a recent review published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology proposed exercise to protect against age- and disease-related impairments in the renal molecular clock (7), which could have profound implications for the prevention and management of hypertension. In the context of diet, recent preclinical work has demonstrated the renal protective effects of exercise in the setting of a high-fructose diet (8). A novel experimental clinical trial published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology revealed the association of a high-sodium diet with tubular damage (9). It is currently unknown if physical activity or exercise may offer renal protection against sodium-induced kidney damage, making this area ripe for future research. Another area in need of future research, with significant clinical impact, includes elucidating whether exercise has a renal protective effect against the nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressant regimens and current cancer therapies.Finally, most of the research in this field has been aimed at studying exercise physiology in the context of renal disease and implementing exercise interventions to improve physiological outcomes across the spectrum of kidney diseases (10–12). In this regard, the American Journal Physiology-Renal Physiology has published leading studies that have advanced our understanding of pulmonary and cardiovascular physiological responses to exercise in patients with kidney disease (13, 14). Those studies also highlight exercise as a useful physiological stressor to uncover disease-related pathophysiology and identify new therapeutic targets (15). The American Journal Physiology-Renal Physiology has also published a wealth of preclinical and clinical studies that have identified abnormalities in skeletal muscle structure and function in the setting of kidney disease (16–18). All these studies are essential in addressing exercise intolerance, a hallmark symptom of the disease (19). The beneficial effects and mechanistic underpinnings of exercise as an adjunct therapy to improve cardiovascular and immune health have also been well documented and have helped guide clinical recommendations for exercise prescription (16–18). More recent studies have commenced investigations into mechanisms of the synergistic effects of novel diet strategies and exercise in this patient population (20, 21). There has been some controversy within the field as it pertains to the effects of exercise on renal physiology in kidney disease. Previous preclinical evidence demonstrated that voluntary wheel running exacerbated kidney injury in rats with impaired renal function, likely due to physiological shunt of blood flow away from the kidney during exercise (22). This has led to speculations regarding the safety of exercise for individuals with chronic kidney disease. However, these concerns have not translated in clinical trials where there is currently no evidence to suggest that exercise is detrimental to kidney function in chronic kidney disease. Despite the substantial scientific advancements in this field, more research is required to better understand the effects of exercise on renal physiology in kidney disease toward establishing if exercise can slow its progression. Indeed, data from the National Institutes of Health Common Fund Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC) Consortium initiative may provide some valuable contributions to this area (23).In summary, the importance of mechanistic studies at the nexus of exercise and renal physiology in health and disease should not be overlooked. Research in this area has a broad reach with the potential to significantly impact health in the setting of performance, occupational activities, climate crises, and clinical disease. We have made considerable scientific progress in this field; however, there is still potential for numerous new discoveries in this area. In a call to action for research in this field, we encourage readers to submit their science to the Call for Papers on “Exercise and the Kidney in Health and Disease” to the American Journal Physiology-Renal Physiology (submission deadline: May 31, 2023).GRANTSThis work was supported by American Heart Association Grant 19CDA3470002 (to D.L.K.) and National Institutes of Health Grants DK116196, DK096373, and HL148044 (to M.L.S.S.-L.).DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.Danielle Kirkman and Maria Luisa Sequeira-Lopez are editors of American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology and were not involved and did not have access to information regarding the peer-review process or final disposition of this article.

AB  - Loss and degradation of sagebrush rangelands due to an accelerated invasive annual grass-wildfire cycle and other stressors are substantial management, conservation, and economic issues in the western United States.These sagebrush rangelands comprise a unique biome spanning 11 states, support over 350 wildlife species, and provide important ecosystem services that include stabilizing the economies of western communities.Impacts to sagebrush ecosystem processes over large areas due to the annual grass-wildfire cycle necessitated the development of a coordinated, science-based strategy for improving efforts to achieve long-term protection, conservation, and restoration of sagebrush rangelands, which was framed in 2015 under the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy (IRFMS).Central to this effort was the development of an Actionable Science Plan (Plan) that identified 37 priority science needs (Needs) for informing the actions proposed under the 5 topics (Fire, Invasives, Restoration, Sagebrush and Sage-Grouse, Climate and Weather) that were part of the collective focus of the IRFMS.Notable keys to this effort were identification of the Needs co-produced by managers and researchers, and a focus on resulting science being "actionable."Substantial investments aimed at fulfilling the Needs identified in the Plan have been made since its release in 2016.While the state of the science has advanced considerably, the extent to which knowledge gaps remain relative to identified Needs is relatively unknown.Moreover, new Needs have likely emerged since the original strategy as results from actionable science reveal new questions, and possible (yet untested) solutions.A quantifiable assessment of the progress made on the original science Needs can identify unresolved gaps and new information that can help inform prioritization of future research efforts.This report details a systematic literature review that evaluated how well peer-reviewed

<jats:title>Purpose</jats:title>
<jats:p>Wildfire is one of the most important natural disturbances in forest and multi-vegetation ecosystems, directly or indirectly affecting the structural processes and functions of forest ecosystems with varying degrees. Wildfire releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other substances by destroying vegetation, making itself an important topic for the study of global change and environmental impacts. Therefore, a deeper understanding of this topic is particularly crucial for managing forest ecosystems.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>This paper was based on a literature search of the Web of Science database for international forest wildfire research, utilizing bibliometric and quantity statistical analysis methods.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>The results show that forest wildfire research has been rapidly growing over the last 20 years, with the number of relevant articles generally increasing yearly at an average annual growth rate of about 22.45%. The US tops the list in terms of total and independent publications, with a total of 3111 articles (49.88%). The key journals publishing on this topic include 12 journals, Stephens S.L., Bergeron Y., and Lindenmayer D.B. are the key contributing authors to the field, and research institutions are primarily concentrated in the US Forest Service. Keyword co-occurrence analysis shows that current forest wildfire research is focused on seven main areas. This paper systematically reviewed the progress and hotspots of international forest wildfire research in recent decades, mainly focusing on occurrences, severity, management, and warning techniques for wildfires, as well as the impact of climate change and human activities on wildfires.</jats:p>
</jats:sec><jats:sec>
<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
<jats:p>The study concludes that research trends in this field have undergone a significant evolution in recent decades. The future forest wildfire research moves towards a combination of typical mechanisms and large-scale effects across spatial and temporal scales, deep integration of aerospace and earth observations and precise simulations, discipline fusion, and couplings research. We believe that this study provides a comprehensive and systematic overview for future forest wildfire observation, prediction, management, and investigation of ecological effects.</jats:p>

AU  - Guzel, Aysun

T2  - Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: It was previously reported that perceived external locus of control may exacerbate depressive symptoms, is associated with anxiety, boosts stress and general mental distress and weakens resilience against traumatic situations or difficulties. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Those with a higher external locus of control are more prone to develop PTSD symptoms since the perceived external locus of control is among the predictors of PTSD. An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: It is known that nurses are deployed in clinical and fieldwork during disaster and assume key roles both interventional practices and psychosocial education. Thus, it is of particular importance for mental health nurses to be aware of the locus of control in themselves, their colleagues, and the community before, during and after disasters to be able to combat the risk/presence of PTSD., ABSTRACT: AIM: The present systematic review explored the impacts of perceived locus of control on PTSD among individuals experiencing disasters., METHOD: This is a systematic review study carried out through a search of the relevant research published in English over the period December 2021 to April 2022. Accordingly, we sought the studies to review on the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases using the keywords "Child, Children, Adolescent, Adolescence, Adult, Aged, Elderly, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, Internal-External Control, Locus of Control, Disasters, Natural Disasters.", RESULTS: A total of 1.011 studies were found in the five databases using the keywords above. Following the exclusions, the remaining six studies were recruited for this systematic review. The six studies in question addressed earthquakes (2), hurricanes (1), wildfires (1), SARS (1) and fireworks explosions (1). In the study with wildfire survivors, there was a weak significant association between external locus of control and PTSD among those directly exposed to the disaster (r = .15, p < .01). The study with survivors of the SARS epidemic demonstrated that those with a high perceived chance (external) locus of control suffered PTSD (p = .001). An internal locus of control is considered important in preventing PTSD, although an external locus of control appears to be a variable that causes/increases the prevalence of PTSD., CONCLUSION: It was concluded that perceived locus of control is related to PTSD in individuals experiencing a disaster. The additional evidence was that post-disaster PTSD among those with a high perceived external locus of control is stronger than those with a high perceived internal locus of control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With an increase in wildfire activity across the globe and growing numbers of personnel involved each year, it is necessary to explore the health impacts of occupational exposure to wildfires and the practices and policies that can be implemented to mitigate these effects. The aim of this work is to (1) identify the impact occupational exposure to wildfires has on health outcomes including physical, mental, and social wellbeing; (2) examine the characteristics and effectiveness of mitigation strategies or policies to reduce negative health impacts as reported by current literature and reports; and (3) develop a program of research to address and understand the health impacts of occupational exposure to wildfires based on gaps in the literature and stakeholder priorities., METHODS: This scoping study will be conducted in two phases: (1) scoping literature review and (2) modified Delphi process. The literature review will follow a methodologically rigorous scoping review approach that includes (a) identifying the research question (and protocol development), (b) identifying literature (an iterative process), (c) selecting relevant studies, (d) extracting data into tables, and (e) synthesizing, summarizing, and reporting results. Alongside this, a modified Delphi process will be conducted to define priorities for wildland fire occupational health research. A partnership with the British Columbia (BC) Wildfire Service will enable exploring the appropriateness of identified mitigation strategies and health risks for the BC context., DISCUSSION: This two-phase approach will provide an in-depth review of the literature of the health impacts of occupational exposure to wildfires and identify mitigation strategies or policies implemented to protect workers and reduce negative health impacts. It is anticipated that these findings may provide recommendations for "quick wins" or initial action that can be implemented within the BC context to reduce negative health outcomes, and inform gaps in context-specific research that needs to be addressed through a strategic, collaborative research program over the next 5 years., SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Open Science Framework osf.io/ugz4.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Wildland fires dramatically affect forest ecosystems, altering the loss of their biodiversity and their sustainability. In addition, they have a strong impact on the global carbon balance and, ultimately, on climate change. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies on remotely sensed methods and data used for estimation of forest burnt area, burn severity, post-fire effects, and forest recovery patterns at the global level by using the PRISMA framework. In the study, we discuss the results of the analysis based on 329 selected papers on the main aspects of the study area published in 48 journals within the past two decades (2000-2020). In the first part of this review, we analyse characteristics of the papers, including journals, spatial extent, geographic distribution, types of remote sensing sensors, ecological zoning, tree species, spectral indices, and accuracy metrics used in the studies. The second part of this review discusses the main tendencies, challenges, and increasing added value of different remote sensing techniques in forest burnt area, burn severity, and post-fire recovery assessments. Finally, it identifies potential opportunities for future research with the use of the new generation of remote sensing systems, classification and cloud performing techniques, and emerging processes platforms for regional and large-scale applications in the field of study.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Pines (Pinus, with 120 species) and oaks (Quercus, with at least 400 species), the two principal forest forming genera of the Northern Hemisphere occur in fire affected landscapes over a large geographical area from 120 degrees W to 150.E long, and from 10 degrees to 60 degrees N lat. We compiled studies of 116 such sites of which 75 sites had data of bark thickness. Taking a meta-analysis approach, here we have compared the absolute and relative bark thickness (bark thickness per unit stem diameter) of oak species sharing mixed stands to generalize adaptational significance of bark in relation to fire. For the meta-analysis we considered only natural forests with adequate evidences of fire history. We gave importance to relative bark thickness, which is less sensitive to tree size than absolute thickness while comparing species. At 100 cm girth the average absolute bark thickness was significantly higher for Diploxylon pines (3.65 cm) than for oaks (2.2 cm) and Haploxylon pines (1.65 cm). On an average, the relative bark thickness was higher for the fire adapted Diploxylon pines (6.3%) than for Quercus species, (4.4%). The resource allocation efficiency was higher in pine species than for oak species, emphasizing the importance of bark characters in their persistence and range expansion. The difference between species of two principal forest genera in relative bark thickness and hence success in fire affected landscapes across a wide geographical range strongly testifies its adaptational significance to fire.

TI  - Effects of fire on the aggregate stability of clayey soils: A meta-analysis
AU  - Thomaz, E. L.
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB  - Fire is a natural phenomenon that affects the Earth's biogeochemical cycle. Wildland fires are increasing in frequency and magnitude, possibly owing to climate change. In addition, fire is applied as a tool in agroecosystem management. However, several detrimental effects on soil properties, particularly on soil aggregate stability, might occur. A general explanation is that "the effects of fire on soil aggregate stability in soil with high clay content, calcium carbonate, and Fe and Al oxides as the principal cementing substances cause gradual improvement in aggregate stability, following fire-heating severity." In short, the higher the fire severity, the higher is the aggregate stability. A meta-analysis was conducted for assessing the laboratory and field studies to verify this concept. The Scopus (R) platform was used to search for the literature related to "soil aggregate stability" AND fire OR heating AND clay OR "clayey soil." A total of 10 studies were selected with 16 soil types, 244 burned or heated samples, and 160 control samples. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Metaanalysis was delineated according to the following assumptions: a) field and laboratory studies were tested as two independent subgroups, and a pooled effect was subsequently calculated; b) a random-effects model was used; c) mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for continuous variables. Laboratory and field measurements showed dissimilar effects on soil aggregate stability and evidenced positive effects in the laboratory experiments compared with those in the field. Aggregate stability measured in the laboratory increased by 2.80% after heating. Fire effects measured in the field did not show a significant increase in soil aggregate stability (-0.16%). The overall effects of combined subgroups showed an aggregate stability improvement of 1.49% (confidence intervals 0.80% to 2.17%). However, the weight of the results from the laboratory studies played an important role in the overall effect. The soil clay content was found to be inversely associated with aggregate stability, i.e., the lower the clay content the higher the aggregate stability in soil subjected to fire heating. In conclusion, the aggregate stability of clayey soils rich in Al and Fe oxides does not necessarily improves following fire heating.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Management in fire-prone ecosystems relies widely upon application of prescribed fire and/or fire surrogate (e.g., forest thinning) treatments to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function. The literature suggests fire and mechanical treatments proved more variable in their effects on understory vegetation as compared to their effects on stand structure. The growing body of work comparing fire and thinning effects on understory vegetation offers an opportunity to increase the generality of conclusions through meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine if there were consistent responses of understory vegetation to these treatments in North American forests that historically experienced frequent surface fire regimes (<20 years fire return interval, FRI). Means and standard errors were extracted from 32 papers containing data on the response of four understory functional groups (herbaceous, shrub, non-native, and total) to thinning and burning treatments to calculate effect sizes. Lack of replication and inconsistent reporting of results hindered our ability to include many studies in this analysis. For each response variable (species richness and percent cover), we compared three treatment pairs: burn vs control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood to account for variation by site. The most consistent effect of the treatments was the increase in non-native species following mechanical thinning and reduction in shrub cover following a burn. These differences suggest the two treatments may not be surrogates in the short-term (less than 5 years). Increase of non-native species due to disturbance is well established but it is not clear if burning and thinning consistently have differential impacts. Response of non-native plants to disturbance is likely a complex function of a variety of site and landscape factors that cannot be evaluated by the current literature. We conclude that prescribed fire and thinning treatments can be used successfully to restore understory species richness and cover, but they can create different conditions and these potentially different outcomes need to be considered in the planning of a fuels reduction treatment. We discuss management options to reduce negative effects of the treatments and we suggest managers use current decision-making frameworks prior to designing an intervention.

AB  - 1. Fire is an inherently evolutionary process, even though much more emphasis has been given to ecological responses of plants and their associated communities to fire.
2. Here, we synthesize contributions to a Special Feature entitled Fire as a dynamic ecological and evolutionary force' and place them in a broader context of fire research. Topics covered in this Special Feature include a perspective on the impacts of novel fire regimes on differential forest mortality, discussions on new approaches to investigate vegetation -fire feedbacks and resulting plant syndromes, synthesis of fire impacts on plant- fungal interactions, and a meta-analysis of arthropod community responses to fire.
3. We conclude by suggesting pathways forward to better understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of fire. These include developing ecological and evolutionary databases for fire ecology, integrating hierarchical genetic structure or phylogenetic structure, and developing new experimental frameworks that limit context-dependent outcomes.

T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - An increasing number of publications focus on social vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation (SVRA) towards natural hazards and climate change. Despite this proliferation of research, a systematic understanding of how these studies are theoretically grounded is lacking. Here, we systematically reviewed 4432 articles that address SVRA in various disciplinary fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, geography, mathematics) for various hazards, including floods, droughts, landslides, storm surges, wildfires, tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcano eruptions. We focus on the extent to which these studies explicate the frameworks, theoretical constructs or theories they rely on. Surprisingly, we found that about 90% of the reviewed studies do not explicitly refer to a theoretical un-derpinning. Overall, theories focusing on individuals' SVRA were more frequently used than those focusing on systems, society, groups, and networks. Moreover, the uptake of theories varied according to the hazard investigated and field of knowledge, being more frequent in wildfire and flood studies and articles published in social science journals. Based on our analysis, we propose a reflexive handling of theories to foster more transparent, comparable, and robust empirical research on SVRA.

AB  - Disaster management is a critical area that requires efficient methods and techniques to address various challenges. This comprehensive assessment offers an in-depth overview of disaster management systems, methods, obstacles, and potential future paths. Specifically, it focuses on flood control, a significant and recurrent category of natural disasters. The analysis begins by exploring various types of natural catastrophes, including earthquakes, wildfires, and floods. It then delves into the different domains that collectively contribute to effective flood management. These domains encompass cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis and cloud computing, providing scalable and reliable infrastructure for data storage, processing, and analysis. The study investigates the potential of the Internet of Things and sensor networks to gather real-time data from flood-prone areas, enhancing situational awareness and enabling prompt actions. Model-driven engineering is examined for its utility in developing and modeling flood scenarios, aiding in preparation and response planning. This study includes the Google Earth engine (GEE) and examines previous studies involving GEE. Moreover, we discuss remote sensing; remote sensing is undoubtedly a valuable tool for disaster management, and offers geographical data in various situations. We explore the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Spatial Data Management for visualizing and analyzing spatial data and facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation during floods. In the final section, the focus shifts to the utilization of machine learning and data analytics in flood management. These methodologies offer predictive models and data-driven insights, enhancing early warning systems, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies. Through this in-depth analysis, the significance of incorporating these spheres into flood control procedures is highlighted, with the aim of improving disaster management techniques and enhancing resilience in flood-prone regions. The paper addresses existing challenges and provides future research directions, ultimately striving for a clearer and more coherent representation of disaster management techniques.

AU  - Deepa, R.
AU  - Kumar, V.
AU  - Sundaram, S.
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
AB  - Climate extremes pose significant risks to human health, agriculture, and water resources. These extremes are defined as long-term, unusual events that fall into the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function derived from observations at a certain location (e.g., drought and wildfire). The quantification of future climate risks is based on climate model predictions. Here, we present a review of literature focusing on extreme climate projections in the latest generation of climate models, namely, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) from 2020 to the present. We highlight the extreme events that could cause potential societal risks, including precipitation (the 90th percentile of the cumulative frequency distribution of daily precipitation), temperature (the 10th or 90th percentile of daily temperature within a reference period), droughts (meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural), floods, heat waves, and compound/concurrent extremes. Regionally, the precipitation extremes are projected to increase in North Africa (Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya), followed by drying in South Africa. Heatwaves will increase in a warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) in Asia (Indo-Gangetic Plain) and Afghanistan. The rise in heat stress intensity in Asia will augment the climate risks to agriculture under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. On a global scale, land areas are projected to face severe drought specifically in higher biomass regions, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Future droughts bring hazards to Europe and the Amazon River basin with severe aridification over Australia, the Middle East, South and North Africa, and Central Asia. The CMIP6 model projections on a regional and global scale over the US Southwest predict intense drought and hot dry summers. The study supplements the discussion section by providing insights on sources of uncertainty in extreme event projections, the role of emergent constraints in uncertainty reduction, and the impact of extremes on water resources, agriculture, and human health.

AB  - We assessed the occupancy dynamics of 275 California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) territories in 4 study areas in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1993 to 2011. We used Landsat data to develop maps of canopy cover for each study area, which we then used to quantify annual territory-specific habitat covariates. We modeled the relationships between territory extinction and colonization using predictor variables of habitat, disturbance (logging, fire), climate, and elevation. We found that forests with medium (40-69%) and high (>= 70%) canopy cover were the most important predictors of territory occupancy in all study areas, and that both canopy cover categories were positively correlated with occupancy. We used analysis of deviance to estimate the amount of variation explained by the habitat covariates (primarily medium and high canopy cover) and found that these covariates explained from 35% to 67% of the variation in occupancy. Climatic covariates were not correlated with occupancy dynamics and explained little of the variation in occupancy. We also conducted a post hoc analysis in which we partitioned canopy cover into 10% classes, because our original partitioning into 3 classes may have lacked sufficient resolution to identify canopy cover levels where occupancy changed abruptly. In this post hoc analysis, occupancy declined sharply when territories contained more area with <40% canopy cover, and the amount of 50-59% and 60-69% canopy cover had a more positive association with occupancy than did 40-49% canopy cover. Our results suggest that some fuels treatments intended to reduce fire risk and improve forest resilience could be located within Spotted Owl territories without adversely impacting territory occupancy if such treatments do not consistently reduce canopy cover below 50%. We suggest that future work quantify components of forest structure (e.g., large tree density, vertical complexity) known to be selected by owls and relate these characteristics to occupancy and fitness metrics.

TI  - The statistical power of post-fire soil-hydraulic property studies: Are we collecting sufficient infiltration measurements after wildland fires

AB  - Infiltration and associated soil-hydraulic properties, such as field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs), sorptivity (S), or saturated soil-water content (theta(s)) are measured after wildland fires to assess risks of water-related hazards and water supply impairment. Yet the statistical power of these data to distinguish between burned and unburned infiltration is seldom assessed, despite the typically small number of total measurements (N). Here, parametric and nonparametric statistical approaches are used to assess the primary influences on the statistical power and whether the N is sufficient to achieve a representative power of 0.9. About half of the studies examined did not achieve a power >= 0.9 at the as-sampled N, suggesting the need for post-fire infiltration studies to collect more measurements. Effect size was the primary control on power, and therefore the N needed to achieve a given power. Because effect size tends to decrease with time since fire, N generally needs to increase with time since fire in infiltration studies. Power estimates were similar for parametric and nonparametric analyses. Comparisons between infiltration methods suggested that steady state rainfall simulation produced a greater power for a given N, relative to both tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters. The greater power of the steady state rainfall simulation method was the result of smaller variability, compared to the tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters. The substantial variability of post-fire tension infiltrometer measurements may complicate using these data in meta-analyses. This work further suggests that synthesis or meta-analysis studies of post-fire soil-hydraulic properties may be more robust if data are weighted by statistical power. The differences in statistical power between infiltration measurement methods require further demonstration for a broader range of datasets before extrapolation beyond the datasets considered here.
