AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified several psychosocial risks and problem behaviors among vulnerable individuals. Given that gambling has high addictive  potential, it is important to consider the underlying mechanisms of problem  gambling. This study examined psychosocial factors associated with pandemic-time  problem gambling.Cross-sectional data were gathered via an online survey of  18-75-year-old Finnish, Swedish, and British respondents (n = 2,022) who reported  having gambled at least occasionally during the pandemic. Measures included  problem gambling, loneliness, COVID-19 worry, social support, and psychological  resilience. Control variables included gender, age, and education. Structural  equation modeling was used as an analytical technique.Loneliness was found to be  associated with problem gambling. While COVID-19 worry was not directly  associated with problem gambling, it predicted higher loneliness, which in turn  was associated with problem gambling. Evidence was not found regarding the  protective role of resilience or social support in problem gambling. However,  social support was found to be associated with higher problem gambling severity.  Male gender and younger age were associated with problem gambling.The results  bring insight into underlying vulnerabilities regarding problem gambling during  the pandemic. More focus should be placed on the quality and sources of social  support, as well as on how psychosocial risk and protective factors might work  differently among different populations of gamblers.

AB  - Aim: To study the prevalence and patterns of problematic gaming and gambling during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association with psychiatric traits and  major types of anxiety categories. Method: 1067 young adults participated in both  wave 3 (2018) and wave 4 (2021) of the SALVe Cohort. Associations with  psychiatric symptoms and anxiety were examined using logistic regression and  Chi-square tests. Results: Problematic gaming decreased by 1.3 percentage points  to 23.2% since the start of the pandemic, while problematic gambling increased by  0.9 percentage points to 6.5% in w4. Average time spent playing video games/day  decreased from 2.2 h (w3) to 1.7 h (w4), while increases in gaming activity were  associated with worsened feelings of loneliness (p = 0.002), depression (p &lt;  0.001), and anxiety (p &lt; 0.01) during the pandemic. Predictors for problematic  gaming at w4 were previous problematic gaming and social anxiety (p = &lt; 0.001  and 0.01, respectively). Moreover, previous problem gambling also predicted  problem gambling at w4 p &lt; 0.001. All anxiety categories were associated with  both problematic gaming and gambling when adjusted for age and sex. However,  after adjusting for depression and insomnia, social anxiety was associated with  problematic gaming (p &lt; 0.001), while panic was associated with problem  gambling (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, problematic gaming has decreased  since the start of the pandemic, while problem gambling has increased. Worsened  feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic are  associated with increased gaming. Moreover, the association between problematic  gaming and gambling and anxiety is independent of depression and sleep problems.

T2  - Frontiers in psychiatry
AB  - The predominant gambling policy to respond to the adverse consequences of excessive gambling has been the Reno Model, which places the responsibility for  gambling-caused problems on gamblers themselves. The newly implemented Japanese  gambling policy, which shares basic premises with the Reno Model, focuses on the  individual pathology of gamblers. However, this model lacks other critical  perspectives: environmental and structural factors. To fully understand the harms  caused by gambling; it is important to also pay attention to the negative  consequences for affected others. In this brief report, we explore family  members' experiences of gambling problems within the specific context of the  Japanese gambling policy. Interviews with family members reveal self-stigma of  being bad parents which elicits shame and efforts to maintain secrecy, as well as  public stigma involving labeling, isolation, risks of status loss, social  exclusion and discrimination. The focus on individual pathology in Japanese  legislation as well as in public and professional perception, reinforces  self-blame, anxiety, and remorse on the part of affected family members. When  contrasted with the lived experiences of gamblers' family members, the  inconsistencies and unreasonableness of the individual pathology paradigm in  Japanese gambling policy become evident. It is necessary to shift the focus of  gambling policies from individual to socio-political-cultural factors,  investigating how these factors influence gambling-caused harm, especially in the  Japanese context.

AB  - Empathy plays an essential role in determining how we understand and respond to others' emotional experiences. Previous studies have mainly focused on the  influencing factors of physical pain and monetary loss empathy, as well as on  their effects on subsequent feelings. However, little is known about social pain  empathy and its influence on subsequent feelings, and the role of personal trait  empathy. In this study, we performed Cyberball Games and gambling tasks to  explore the effect of social exclusion empathy on subsequent feelings for  gambling outcomes (others' losses and gains) by analyzing the brain activity of  excluded and non-excluded players at the gambling outcome feedback stage. It was  found that both feedback-related negativity (FRN) and theta-band oscillatory are  more negative for loss outcome than gain for the excluded players, while these  effects cannot be found for the non-excluded players. Furthermore, we only  observed a larger P300 amplitude in the gain outcome than that of loss,  regardless of the players' role. More interestingly, we found state social pain  empathy is negatively correlated with the d-FRN amplitude under non-excluded  conditions, while trait empathy is positively correlated with P300 amplitude  regardless of the players' role. These results provide insight into the different  roles of state social pain empathy and trait empathy on subsequent gambling  outcomes. Furthermore, different from previous studies, the current results show  that d-FRN could reflect the state empathy discrepancy rather than the biomarker  of state empathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairment or distress caused by gambling disorder can be subjectively assessed via quality of life. The aim of this study was to develop a  new patient-reported outcome instrument to explore the health-related quality of  life (HRQoL) in gambling disorders, the Gambling quality-of-life scale (GQoLS),  and to document its psychometric properties. METHODS: A previous qualitative  study had been conducted using focus groups of problem gamblers to identify areas  of HRQoL impacted by gambling. The seven domains identified served as the basis  for the hypothetical structure of GQoLS. Draft items were generated from the  patient's speeches to illustrate each of these domains. Cognitive debriefing  interviews were realized to obtain a final hypothetical GQoLS. A validation study  was then carried out to determine the final version of GQoLS and its psychometric  properties (structural validity, construct validity, internal consistency).  RESULTS: The final GQoLS was composed of 21 items, with a total mean score of  38.3 (±13.6). Structural validity found a major dimension and four other minor  dimensions. The five dimensions were: "emotion", "lifestyle", "loneliness",  "taboo" and "preoccupation". GQoLS was moderately to strongly correlated with  PGSI and EQ-5D visual analogic scale. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.92.  CONCLUSION: GQoLS is the first HRQoL instrument specific to patients with a  gambling disorder and developed from the patient's perspective. GQoLS presents  good psychometric properties. GQoLS can be used in clinical research to  demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention on outcomes that are relevant  from the patient's perspective.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 outbreak profoundly influenced human lives on different levels. This narrative review aims to present recent data relating to  the COVID-19 pandemic and internet use and internet-based addictive behaviours  [problematic Internet use (PIU), Internet addiction, Internet gaming disorder,  problem gambling or gambling disorder, social media addiction including  smartphone use disorder, problematic pornography use, and compulsive buying].  RECENT FINDINGS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of Internet use and  Internet-based addictive behaviours increased in all age groups. The COVID-19  pandemic and related containment measures were been associated with increased  levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in the general population, especially  among children and adolescents, which are the vulnerable groups for the  development of mental disorders during the crisis. Furthermore, the fear  resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' measures, high levels of uncertainty  regarding the future, and financial insecurity increased levels of loneliness,  PIU, and Internet addiction. SUMMARY: Longitudinal researches focused on the  negative impacts of Internet use in prolonged stress situations on mental health,  vulnerable groups, and quality of life (QoL) are needed to help clinicians and  policymakers to reduce adverse consequences. Prevention programs for Internet use  and Internet-based addictive behaviours must be customized to meet the needs of  children, adolescents, and adults. Also, treatment programs must be tailored to  the needs of patients with different Internet-based addictions.

AB  - The Dark Web (i.e., the anonymous web or Darknet) contains potentially harmful COVID-19-related information and content such as conspiracy theories and forged  certificates. The Dark Web may particularly attract individuals who are  suspicious about the pandemic, but there is no research concerning the use of the  Dark Web as a COVID-19 information source. In this study, we investigated the  role of COVID-19 skepticism, online activities, and loneliness in the use of the  Dark Web platforms as a COVID-19 information source. The data (N = 3000) were  gathered in April 2021 from 18 to 75-year-old respondents from Finland  (n = 1000), Sweden (n = 1000) and the United Kingdom (n = 1000). The respondents  were asked how often they had utilized Dark Web platforms (for example via  TOR-network) as a COVID-19 information source during the pandemic. Self-reported  measures of institutional trust, anti-vaccine stances, restriction obedience,  online activities, and loneliness were used as predictors in the logistic  regression model. Age, gender, and education were also included in the model. The  Dark Web use was more prevalent in the UK and Sweden. There was an association  between anti-vaccine stances and active Dark Web use in the UK and Sweden, while  low institutional trust predicted use among Finnish respondents. In all  countries, restriction disobedience was related to Dark Web use as a COVID-19  information source. Frequent online gambling, increased social media use, and  loneliness predicted Dark Web use, and these associations were even stronger  among frequent Dark Web users than occasional users. Younger age and male gender  were also associated with Dark Web use. The unregulated nature of the Dark Web  makes it a risky alternative to COVID-19 information, attracting individuals who  are suspicious about the pandemic and overall active online users. Misleading  information and availability of forged certificates on the Dark Web challenge  official health policies, posing significant risks for both individual and public  health.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to determine whether 21-hour continuous wakefulness decreases performance in the Iowa Gambling Task and examine the effect of the  interaction between a weak emotional stressor and prolonged continuous  wakefulness on the decision-making process, as measured by the Iowa Gambling  Task. Approximately half of 38 healthy college students were in the sleep  deprivation condition (they performed the task at 4:30 a.m.); the remainder were  in the daytime condition (they performed the task during the day). The  participants in each sleep condition were further divided into non-exposed and  exposed to an emotional stressor via a social exclusion procedure before the  task, with the Iowa Gambling Task score as the dependent variable. In the sleep  deprivation condition, performance in the final block of the task was  significantly worse in the group with an emotional stressor than the group  without. There was no main effect of sleep conditions or emotional stressors on  the task performance in either block. The results of this study suggest that even  21 hours of continuous wakefulness, which can occur in daily work life, may  prevent appropriate learning in people exposed to an emotional stressor, even if  the stress caused due to it is low.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Online platforms enable real-time trading activities that are similar to those of gambling. This study aimed to investigate the associations of  traditional investing, real-time stock trading, and cryptocurrency trading with  excessive behavior and mental health problems. STUDY DESIGN: This was a  cross-sectional population-based survey. METHODS: The participants were Finnish  people aged 18-75 years (N = 1530, 50.33% male). Survey asked about monthly  regular investing, real-time stock-trading platform use, and cryptocurrency  trading. The study had measures for excessive behavior: gambling (Problem  Gambling Severity Index), gaming (Internet Gaming Disorder Test), internet use  (Compulsive Internet Use Scale), and alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders  Identification Test). Psychological distress (Mental Health Inventory), perceived  stress (Perceived Stress Scale), COVID-19 anxiety, and perceived loneliness were  also measured. Background factors included sociodemographic variables, instant  loan taking, and involvement in social media identity bubbles (Identity Bubble  Reinforcement Scale). Multivariate analyses were conducted with regression  analysis. RESULTS: Within the sample, 22.29% were categorized into monthly  regular investors only, 3.01% were investors using real-time stock-trading  platforms, and 3.59% were cryptomarket traders. Real-time stock-trading platform  use and cryptocurrency trading were associated with younger age and male gender.  Cryptomarket traders were more likely to have an immigrant background and have  taken instant loans. Both real-time stock-trading platform use and cryptomarket  trading were associated with higher excessive behavior. Cryptomarket traders  especially reported higher excessive gambling, gaming, and internet use than  others. Cryptomarket traders reported also higher psychological distress,  perceived stress, and loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: Regular investing is not a risk  factor for excessive behavior. However, rapid online trading platforms and  applications were significantly more commonly used by participants reporting  excessive behavior and mental health problems. The strong association between  cryptomarket trading and excessive behavior in particular underlines the need to  acknowledge the potential risks related to real-time trading platforms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Growing empirical evidence suggests that adolescents have a relatively greater propensity to develop problematic video gaming or gambling  habits. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this study are to estimate the  prevalence of potential pathological gambling and video game use among adolescent  students and to evaluate their risk factors. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional  multi-informant study based on an online survey. It will include a sample of  adolescents attending secondary schools located in Brescia, northern Italy, their  schoolteachers, and parents. The survey includes extensive data on adolescents'  (1) demographic, social, economic, and environmental characteristics; (2)  behavioral, emotional, and social problems and adaptive functioning; (3)  emotional and social loneliness; (4) perception of the reasons to use social  networks; (5) video game habits and pathological use of video gaming; and (6)  gambling behaviors. RESULTS: This protocol was approved by the Institutional  Ethics Board of the Spedali Civili of Brescia (Italy). We expect to collect data  from 793 or more adolescent students, as determined by our sample size  calculation. CONCLUSIONS: This multisite project will make a substantial  contribution to (1) the implementation of a system for identifying pathological  gambling and pathological video game use among adolescents, allowing for  interventions aimed at improving adolescents' financial, emotional, and social  well-being; and (2) the identification of distinct profiles of gamblers and  pathological video gamers that will contribute to setting up effective targeted  prevention measures. Understanding the causes and impact of gambling and  pathological video gaming on adolescents is a public health issue. INTERNATIONAL  REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/33376.

AB  - Loneliness is a public health concern with detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social  anxiety (SA), cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting SA might be adopted to  reduce loneliness. However, whether SA and loneliness share the same underlying  neurocognitive mechanisms is still an elusive question. The current study aimed  at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social  avoidance in SA are evident in loneliness. We used a prestratified approach  involving 42 (21 females) participants with high loneliness (HL) and 40 (20  females) participants with low loneliness (LL) scores. During fMRI, participants  completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in  social situations and responses to social feedback. Univariate and multivariate  analyses of behavioral and neural data replicated known task effects. However,  although HL participants showed increased SA, loneliness was associated with a  response pattern clearly distinct from SA. Specifically, contrary to expectations  based on SA differences, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal  subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala  responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social  feedback in both groups. Moreover, while explorative analyses revealed reduced  pleasantness ratings, increased striatal activity, and decreased  striatal-hippocampal connectivity in response to negative computer feedback in HL  participants, these effects were diminished for negative social feedback. Our  findings suggest that, unlike SA, loneliness is not associated with withdrawal  from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for SA should be  adjusted when targeting loneliness.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Loneliness can cause  serious health problems. Adapting well-established cognitive-behavioral therapies  targeting social anxiety might be promising to reduce chronic loneliness given a  close link between both constructs. However, a better understanding of behavioral  and neurobiological factors associated with loneliness is needed to identify  which specific mechanisms of social anxiety are shared by lonely individuals. We  found that lonely individuals show a consistently distinct pattern of behavioral  and neural responsiveness to social decision-making and social feedback compared  with previous findings for social anxiety. Our results indicate that loneliness  is associated with a biased emotional reactivity to negative events rather than  social avoidance. Our findings thus emphasize the distinctiveness of loneliness  from social anxiety and the need for adjusted psychotherapeutic protocols.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Loneliness and a low sense of mastery are associated with excessive gambling, but the underlying processes of these relationships remain  unstudied. Because psychological distress can increase vulnerability to excessive  gambling, we investigated its mediating role in these relationships among young  people. To meet the need for cross-country research, we also observed how these  relationships occur in four countries with different cultures. DESIGN, SETTING,  AND PARTICIPANTS: Demographically balanced cross-sectional survey data were  collected from 15-25-year-olds in Finland (n = 1200; 50% male), the United States  (n = 1212; 49.8% male), South Korea (n = 1192; 49.6% male), and Spain (n = 1212;  51.2% male). MEASUREMENTS: Excessive gambling was measured with the South Oaks  Gambling Screen, psychological distress was assessed with the 12-item General  Health Questionnaire, loneliness was measured with the three-item Loneliness  Scale, and low sense of mastery was assessed with the Pearlin Mastery Scale.  Associations were examined first using zero-inflated negative binomial regression  analyses with excessive gambling as the outcome. In addition, path analyses were  performed to study how loneliness and low sense of mastery relate to excessive  gambling, with psychological distress as the mediating variable. FINDINGS:  Loneliness and low sense of mastery were associated indirectly with excessive  gambling via psychological distress in all country samples. Low sense of mastery  was also directly associated with excessive gambling. There was a direct  association between loneliness and excessive gambling only in samples from South  Korea and Spain. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress is an important factor in  understanding how loneliness and sense of mastery relate to gambling.

TI  - Suicidality and gambling among young adults in Great Britain: results from a cross-sectional online survey.
AU  - Wardle, Heather
AU  - McManus, Sally
T2  - The Lancet. Public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide rates in young people have increased in England and Wales since 2010. There are a range of possible explanations for this increase, and  problem gambling has been suggested as a potential risk factor. We aimed to  examine the association between suicidality (suicidal thoughts and suicide  attempts) and problem gambling specifically for young adults in Great Britain,  where gambling has become more widely available and normalised in the past two  decades. METHODS: We analysed data from the Emerging Adults Gambling Survey: a  cross-sectional, online, non-probability sample survey of young adults aged 16-24  years living in Great Britain, who were selected from a YouGov online panel.  Participants were eligible if they had not taken part in any other YouGov survey  on gambling in the past year. We examined associations between problem gambling  (defined as a score of 8 or higher on the Problem Gambling Severity Index [PGSI])  and suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in the year before survey completion  in a series of regression models, with and without adjustment for  sociodemographic factors, alcohol use, video gaming, anxiety, loneliness, and  impulsivity. FINDINGS: 3549 eligible participants completed the survey between  June 25 and Aug 16, 2019. 24 (37·0% [95% CI 25·6-50·2]) of 62 men who had  attempted suicide in the past year had survey scores that were indicative of  problem gambling, compared with 38 (3·6% [2·6-5·0]) of 1077 men who had not  attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts in the past year. 13 (14·5%  [8·5-23·6]) of 85 women who had attempted suicide in the past year had survey  scores that were indicative of problem gambling, compared with 25 (2·0%  [1·4-3·0]) of 1184 women who had not attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts  in the past year. The adjusted odds ratio for attempted suicide was 9·0  (4·1-19·7) in men with scores that indicated problem gambling and 4·9 (2·0-12·0)  in women with scores that indicated problem gambling, compared with participants  of the same gender with PGSI scores of 0. INTERPRETATION: Problem gambling  appears to be associated with suicide attempts in both young men and young women.  This association persisted after adjusting for anxiety, impulsivity, life  satisfaction, and other factors, which suggests that other mechanisms, such as  the severity and multiplicity of harms experienced, or gambling to cope with life  stressors, might underpin this relationship. Young people with problem-gambling  behaviours should be considered at risk for suicidality. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.

AB  - Stressors caused by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) contribute to increased addictive behaviors in the general population worldwide. Little is known,  however, about addictive behaviors of people who have recovered a long time ago,  even years, from substance use disorder (SUD). The goal of the present research  was to examine the craving for drug use and addictive behaviors (tobacco and  alcohol consumption, viewing of pornography, gambling, and shopping online) of  people who recovered from SUD, before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19  pandemic.Methods: During one week of isolation imposed in Israel following the  outbreak of COVID-19 in April, 2020, a self-report questionnaire was distributed  to a convenience sample of 113 people who had recovered from SUD, aged 22-69, 78%  men.Results Fifty-one percent of participants reported craving drugs during the  isolation period and engaging in addictive behaviors. Significant differences  were found in tobacco and alcohol consumption, gambling, and viewing of  pornography online, before and after the outbreak of the pandemic, especially in  participants who reported having engaged in these addictive behaviors to some  extent before the outbreak. A hierarchical linear regression showed a significant  explained variance (R(2)=44%, p<.001), with stronger feelings of loneliness and  shorter length of time free from drug use being associated with stronger craving  for drugs.Conclusions: The drug addiction treatment establishment should pay  close attention and strengthen communication with people who recovered from SUD.  It is necessary to develop real-time anti-craving and anti-replacement addiction  interventions to prevent relapses.

T2  - Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to investigate the associations between skipping breakfast and various health risk behaviours and mental health in university  students in 28 countries. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, 21,972  university students with a median age of 20 years from 28 countries in Africa,  the Americas and Asia, replied to self-reported measures of breakfast  consumption, health compromising behaviours, mental health measures and  protective factors. RESULTS: In adjusted logistic regression analysis, infrequent  and/or frequent breakfast skipping was associated with inadequate fruit and  vegetable intake, frequent soft drink intake, not avoiding fat and cholesterol,  current binge drinking, current tobacco use, gambling, not always wearing a  seatbelt, inadequate physical activity, inadequate tooth brushing, not seeing a  dentist in the past year and having been in a physical fight. In addition,  infrequent and/or frequent breakfast skipping was associated with depression,  lower happiness, posttraumatic stress disorder, loneliness, short sleep, long  sleep, sleep problem, restless sleep, sleep problem due to traumatic event, and  poor academic performance. DISCUSSION: We found evidence that skipping breakfast  was associated with 10 of 15 health risk behaviours, all of nine poor mental  health indicators and poor academic performance.

T2  - Child abuse & neglect
AB  - BACKGROUND: International interest in adverse childhood experiences (ACE) is on the rise. In China, recent research has explored the effects of ACEs on  health-related outcomes, but little is known about how ACEs impact the  psychological functioning of rural Chinese youth as they make transition to  adulthood. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to assess the prevalence and  psychological consequences of ACEs among a group of rural Chinese young adults.  PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: 1019 rural high school graduates from three different  provinces of China participated in this study. METHODS: A web-based survey was  used to assess ten conventional ACEs and seven other novel ACEs using the  Childhood Experiences Survey. Using validated brief measures, six indicators of  psychological functioning were assessed: anxiety, depression, perceived stress,  posttraumatic stress, loneliness, and suicidality. Descriptive and correlational  analyses of all ACEs were performed, and multivariate regressions were conducted  to test associations between ACEs and study outcomes. RESULTS: Three-fourths of  Chinese youth endorsed at least one of ten conventional ACEs. The most prevalent  ACEs were physical abuse (52.3 %) and domestic violence (43.2 %). Among seven new  adversities, prolonged parental absence (37.4 %) and parental gambling problems  (19.7 %) were most prevalent. Higher conventional ACEs scores were significantly  associated with poorer psychological functioning, and each type of new adversity  was associated with one or more psychological problems. CONCLUSION: ACEs were  prevalent among rural Chinese young adults and had deleterious effects on their  psychological well-being. Further work is needed to address ACEs by developing  culturally appropriate assessment practices, interventions, and policy responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the ever-growing and technologically advancing world, an increasing amount of social interaction takes place through the Web. With this  change, loneliness is becoming an unprecedented societal issue, making youth more  susceptible to various physical and mental health problems. This societal change  also influences the dynamics of addiction. OBJECTIVE: Employing the cognitive  discrepancy loneliness model, this study aimed to provide a social psychological  perspective on youth addictions. METHODS: A comprehensive survey was used to  collect data from American (N=1212; mean 20.05, SD 3.19; 608/1212, 50.17% women),  South Korean (N=1192; mean 20.61, SD 3.24; 601/1192, 50.42% women), and Finnish  (N=1200; mean 21.29, SD 2.85; 600/1200, 50.00% women) youths aged 15 to 25 years.  Perceived loneliness was assessed with the 3-item Loneliness Scale. A total of 3  addictive behaviors were measured, including excessive alcohol use, compulsive  internet use, and problem gambling. A total of 2 separate models using linear  regression analyses were estimated for each country to examine the association  between perceived loneliness and addiction. RESULTS: Loneliness was significantly  related to only compulsive internet use among the youth in all 3 countries  (P<.001 in the United States, South Korea, and Finland). In the South Korean  sample, the association remained significant with excessive alcohol use (P<.001)  and problem gambling (P<.001), even after controlling for potentially confounding  psychological variables. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal existing differences  between youths who spend excessive amounts of time online and those who engage in  other types of addictive behaviors. Experiencing loneliness is consistently  linked to compulsive internet use across countries, although different underlying  factors may explain other forms of addiction. These findings provide a deeper  understanding in the mechanisms of youth addiction and can help improve  prevention and intervention work, especially in terms of compulsive internet use.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Participation in gambling is rising in older adults. Indeed, in the coming years, engagement in gambling as a social activity is expected to increase more sharply  in the elderly than in any other age group. Due to their exposure to powerful  age-specific risk factors such as isolation, inactivity and failing health, older  people are highly vulnerable to gambling-related problems. This study aimed to  explore the existence of empirical clusters related to gambling habits in a  sample of elderly participants from the general population. The sample included  n = 361 participants, age range 50-90 years (mean 73.8, SD 8.4). Empirical  clusters were identified through a two-step clustering analysis based on a broad  set of indicators, including sociodemographic features, psychopathological state,  substance use, life events, gambling preferences and scores on screening measures  of gambling severity. The prevalence of GD in the study was 1.4%. Two clusters  were identified: (a) cluster 1 (labeled as "low risk of gambling problems",  n = 265, 73.4%), which included the higher proportion of non-gamblers or  individuals who engage only in non-strategic gambling, women, widowed, and lower  levels of education (no individual into this group met criteria for GD); and (b)  cluster 2 (labeled as "higher risk of gambling problems", n = 96, 26.6%), which  included the higher proportion of men, who reported both non-strategic and  strategic gambling preferences (all participants diagnosed of GD were grouped  into this cluster), older age, longer history of gambling, higher gambling  severity, higher use of substances and worse psychopathological state. The  elderly constitute a heterogeneous group with regard to gambling phenotypes. The  results of this study may prove particularly useful for developing reliable  screening tools able to identify older patients at a high risk of gambling  problems, and for designing effective prevention and intervention programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: International students comprise an ethnic minority subpopulation who may be at increased risk for the development of gambling  problems. This study aimed to explore the psychosocial factors associated with  gambling problems in international and domestic university students in Australia.  METHODS: One hundred seventy-three (n = 173) university students (127 domestic,  45 international) completed measures of gambling participation, problem gambling,  psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, perceived social support, loneliness,  gambling-related cognitive distortions) and English language difficulties.  RESULTS: Gambling participation, but not problem gambling status, was lower in  international than domestic students. Only anxiety and cognitive distortions were  associated with problem gambling in domestic students; and only cognitive  distortions were associated with problem gambling in international students.  International student status failed to moderate the relationships between any  psychosocial factor and problem gambling status. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC  SIGNIFICANCE: Future research is required to elucidate problem gambling risk and  protective factors in this ethnic minority subgroup, with a view to guide  culturally sensitive initiatives.

AB  - The aim of the 25 and Up (25Up) study was to assess a wide range of psychological and behavioral risk factors behind mental illness in a large cohort of Australian  twins and their non-twin siblings. Participants had already been studied  longitudinally from the age of 12 and most recently in the 19Up study (mean age =  26.1 years, SD = 4.1, range = 20-39). This subsequent wave follows up these twins  several years later in life (mean age = 29.7 years, SD = 2.2, range =  22-44).  The resulting data set enables additional detailed investigations of genetic  pathways underlying psychiatric illnesses in the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study  (BLTS). Data were collected between 2016 and 2018 from 2540 twins and their  non-twin siblings (59% female, including 341 monozygotic complete twin-pairs, 415  dizygotic complete pairs and 1028 non-twin siblings and singletons). Participants  were from South-East Queensland, Australia, and the sample was of predominantly  European ancestry. The 25Up study collected information on 20 different mental  disorders, including depression, anxiety, substance use, psychosis, bipolar and  attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder, as well as general demographic  information such as occupation, education level, number of children,  self-perceived IQ and household environment. In this article, we describe the  prevalence, comorbidities and age of onset for all 20 examined disorders. The  25Up study also assessed general and physical health, including physical  activity, sleep patterns, eating behaviors, baldness, acne, migraines and  allergies, as well as psychosocial items such as suicidality, perceived stress,  loneliness, aggression, sleep-wake cycle, sexual identity and preferences,  technology and internet use, traumatic life events, gambling and cyberbullying.  In addition, 25Up assessed female health traits such as morning sickness,  breastfeeding and endometriosis. Furthermore, given that the 25Up study is an  extension of previous BLTS studies, 86% of participants have already been  genotyped. This rich resource will enable the assessment of epidemiological risk  factors, as well as the heritability and genetic correlations of mental  conditions.

AB  - Extending classic anthropological "idioms of distress" research, we argue that intensive online videogame involvement is better conceptualized as a new global  idiom, not only of distress but also of wellness, especially for emerging adults  (late teens through the 20s). Drawing on cognitive anthropological cultural  domain interviews conducted with a small sample of U.S. gamers (N = 26 free-list  and 34 pile-sort respondents) (Study 1) and a large sample of survey data on  gaming experience (N = 3629) (Study 2), we discuss the cultural meaning and  social context of this new cultural idiom of wellness and distress. Our analysis  suggests that the "addiction" frame provides a means for gamers to communicate  their passion and commitment to online play, even furthering their enthusiasm for  the hobby and community in the process, but also a way for players to express and  even resolve life distress such as depression and loneliness. The American  Psychiatric Association (APA) has recently included "Internet gaming disorder"  (IGD) as a possible behavioral addiction, akin to gambling, warranting further  consideration for eventual formal inclusion in the next iteration of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Our study leads us  to suggest that clinicians only sparingly use IGD as a clinical category, given  that medical and gamer understandings of "addictive" play differ so markedly.  This includes better distinguishing positive online gaming involvement-also  sometimes framed by gamers as "addictive"-from other play patterns more clearly  entailing distress and dysfunction.

T2  - The British journal of developmental psychology
AB  - We investigated, using a cross-lagged design, the longitudinal association of bullying involvement and peer problems with affective decision-making in  adolescence (ages 11 and 14 years) in 13,888 participants of the Millennium  Cohort Study. Affective decision-making (risk-taking, quality of decision-making,  risk adjustment, deliberation time, and delay aversion) was measured with the  Cambridge Gambling Task, bullying involvement (bully, bully-victim, victim, or  'neutral' status) with self-report measures, and peer problems with the  parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In general, peer  problems were associated with decision-making in the unadjusted model but not  after controlling for confounding. However, bullying involvement was related to  decision-making even after adjustment. Compared to 'neutral' males, bullies and  bully-victims improved over time in risk adjustment, and bully-victims in  deliberation time, too. In both sexes, bullies showed more risk-taking compared  to their 'neutral' counterparts. It seems that bullies are more sensitive to  reward (or less sensitive to punishment) than those not involved in bullying. The  finding that male bullies show improvement in decision-making warrants further  research. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? In  adults, decision-making deficits and social exclusion or rejection are linked In  youth, only two studies have explored this link with gambling tasks measuring  real-world difficulties in decision-making. Both studies were cross-sectional and  small-scale. What does this study add? We explore this link in adolescence, using  a large, general population longitudinal sample and the Cambridge Gambling Task.  Bullies were more sensitive to reward (or less sensitive to punishment) than  those not involved in bullying. Male bullies improved over time in risk  adjustment, a finding that warrants further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Problem gambling is characterized by high stigma and self-stigma, making relevant measurement of the burden of the disorder complex.  The aim of our qualitative study was to describe health-related quality of life  (HRQOL) impacted by problem gambling from the patients' perspective. METHODS: We  conducted 6 focus groups with 25 current or lifetime at-risk problem gamblers to  identify key domains of quality of life impacted by problem gambling. A content  analysis from the focus groups data was conducted using Alceste(©) software,  using descendant hierarchical classification analysis, to obtain stable classes  and the significant presences of reduced forms. The class of interest, detailing  the core of impacted quality of life, was described using a cluster analysis.  RESULTS: Thematic content analysis identified three stable classes. Class 1  contained the interviewers' speech. Class 3 was composed of the vocabulary  related to gambling practice, games and gambling venues (casino, horse betting,  etc.). Class 2 described the core of impact of gambling on quality of life and  corresponded to 43% of the analyzed elementary context units. This analysis  revealed seven key domains of impact of problem gambling: loneliness, financial  pressure, relationships deterioration, feeling of incomprehension, preoccupation  with gambling, negative emotions, and avoidance of helping relationships.  CONCLUSIONS: We identified, beyond objective damage, the subjective distress felt  by problem gamblers over the course of the disorder and in the helping process,  marked in particular by stigma and self-stigma. Four impacted HRQOL areas were  new and gambling-specific: loneliness, feeling of incomprehension, avoidance of  helping relationships, and preoccupation with gambling. These results support the  relevance of developing, in a next step, a specific HRQOL scale in the context of  gambling.

AB  - ABSTRACTOlder adults represent the highest proportion of gamblers (Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation [OLG], 2012). Unpartnered older adults may be more  socially isolated and lonely (Dykstra & de Jong Gierveld, 2004), thus more likely  to be at risk for problem gambling (McQuade & Gill, 2012). We examined whether  gambling to socialize or from loneliness and going to the casino with  friends/family mediate the relation between marital status and problem gambling.  Data from a random sample of older adults at gambling venues across Southwestern  Ontario indicated that gambling with family/friends and gambling due to  loneliness mediated the relationship between marital status and problem gambling.  Relative to those married, unpartnered older adults were less likely to gamble  with family/friends, more likely to gamble due to loneliness, and had higher  problem gambling. Prevention and treatment initiatives should examine ways to  decrease loneliness and social isolation among older adults and offer alternative  social activities.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Two studies tested whether social exclusion can increase gambling behavior. In Study 1, participants were asked to relive a socially painful instance, a  physically painful instance or a control condition and were then presented with a  real online gambling device (i.e., a slot machine). The results revealed that  participants who relived a socially painful instance played longer on the  gambling device. In Study 2, we induced actual feelings of social disconnection  and manipulated slot machine anthropomorphization. The results revealed a  significant interaction between inclusionary status and anthropomorphism in  predicting gambling. More specifically, excluded participants gambled longer when  presented with an anthropomorphized slot machine. However, the gambling behavior  of excluded and included participants was no different when participants were  reminded that slot machines are inanimate objects. Finally, positive and negative  game experience mediated the influence of both inclusionary status and  anthropomorphism on gambling. Overall, this research identifies another potential  vulnerability produced by experiences of social exclusion, namely, gambling  behavior. Implications for pathological gambling and future research directions  are outlined.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To combine social genomics with cultural approaches to expand understandings of the somatic health dynamics of online gaming, including in the  controversial nosological construct of internet gaming disorder (IGD). METHODS:  In blood samples from 56 U.S. gamers, we examined expression of the conserved  transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), a leukocyte gene expression profile  activated by chronic stress. We compared positively engaged and problem gamers,  as identified by an ethnographically developed measure, the Positive and Negative  Gaming Experiences Scale (PNGE-42), and also by a clinically derived IGD scale  (IGDS-SF9). RESULTS: CTRA profiles showed a clear relationship with PNGE-42, with  a substantial linkage to offline social support, but were not meaningfully  associated with disordered play as measured by IGDS-SF9. CONCLUSIONS: Our study  advances understanding of the psychobiology of play, demonstrating via novel  transcriptomic methods the association of negatively experienced internet play  with biological measures of chronic threat, uncertainty, and distress. Our  findings are consistent with the view that problematic patterns of online gaming  are a proxy for broader patterns of biopsychosocial stress and distress such as  loneliness, rather than a psychiatric disorder sui generis, which might exist  apart from gamers' other life problems. By confirming the biological correlates  of certain patterns of internet gaming, culturally-sensitive genomics approaches  such as this can inform both evolutionary theorizing regarding the nature of  play, as well as current psychiatric debates about the appropriateness of  modeling distressful gaming on substance addiction and problem gambling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Problematic and pathological gambling have been linked to depression. Despite a high demand for treatment and negative financial consequences, only a  small fraction of problematic and pathological gamblers seek professional help.  The existing treatment gap could be narrowed by providing low-threshold,  anonymous internet-based interventions. The aim of the present study was to  examine the acceptance and efficacy of an online-intervention for depression  ("Deprexis") in a sample of problematic and pathological slot-machine gamblers.  We hypothesized that the intervention group would show a greater reduction in  both depressive and gambling-related symptoms compared to a wait-list control  group. METHOD: A total of 140 individuals with self-reported gambling and mood  problems were randomly allocated either to the intervention group or to a  wait-list control group. After 8 weeks, all participants were invited for  re-assessment. The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) served as the primary  outcome assessment. Problematic gambling was measured with the Pathological  Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS) and the  South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS). The trial is registered with the German  Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS00013888). RESULTS: ITT analyses showed that  the intervention led to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms as well as  gambling-related symptoms compared to the control group, with moderate to strong  effect sizes. PP analyses failed to yield significant results due to high rates  of non-completion and limited statistical power. Moderator analyses indicated  that Deprexis was particularly beneficial in reducing problematic gambling for  those scoring high on baseline gambling-related symptoms and for those who gamble  due to loneliness. DISCUSSION: Results of the present study suggest that Deprexis  might be a useful adjunct to traditional interventions for the treatment of  problematic gambling. The potential of internet-based interventions that are more  targeted at issues specific to gambling should be evaluated in future studies.  TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Registry for Clinical Studies DRKS00013888.

AB  - Background To inform clinical treatment and preventative efforts, there is an important need to understand the pathways to late-life gambling disorder. Aims  This study assesses the association between age-related physical health, social  networks, and problem gambling in adults aged over 65 years and assesses the  mediating role of affective disorders in this association. Methods The sample  comprised 595 older adults (mean age: 74.4 years, range: 65-94 years; 77.1%  female) who were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to assess physical  frailty, geriatric pain, loneliness, geriatric depression, geriatric anxiety, and  problem gambling. Results Pathway analysis demonstrated associations between  these variables and gambling problems, providing a good fit for the data, but  that critically these relationships were mediated by both anxiety and depression  symptoms. Conclusions This study indicates that late-life problem gambling may  develop as vulnerable individuals gamble to escape anxiety and depression  consequent to deteriorating physical well-being and social support. When  individuals develop late-life problem gambling, it is recommended that the  treatment primarily focuses upon targeting and replacing avoidant coping  approaches.

AB  - Loneliness and adapting to an unfamiliar environment can increase emotional vulnerability in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) university  students. According to Blaszczynski and Nower's pathways model of problem and  pathological gambling, this emotional vulnerability could increase the risk of  problem gambling. The current study examined whether loneliness was associated  with problem gambling risk in CALD students relative to their Australian peers.  Additionally, differences in coping strategies were examined to determine their  buffering effect on the relationship. A total of 463 female and 165 male  university students (aged 18-38) from Australian (38%), mixed Australian and CALD  (23%) and CALD (28%) backgrounds responded to an online survey of problem  gambling behaviour, loneliness, and coping strategies. The results supported the  hypothesis that loneliness would be related to problem gambling in CALD students.  There was no evidence of a moderating effect of coping strategies. Future  research could test whether the introduction of programs designed to alleviate  loneliness in culturally diverse university students reduces their risk of  developing problem gambling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although gambling disorder is prevalent and functionally impairing, no FDA-approved medications exist for its treatment. The ability of clinical  trials to detect the benefits of active treatment has been hindered by an  unusually high placebo response. Virtually nothing is known about baseline  clinical characteristics that might predict placebo response in those with  gambling disorder. METHODS: Participants (N = 152) assigned to placebo were  pooled from multiple double-blind trials of gambling disorder. Participants were  classified as placebo responders or non-responders based on a cut-off of 35%  reduction in symptom severity on the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale. Baseline  group differences were characterized using t tests and equivalent non-parametric  tests as appropriate. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of individuals assigned to  placebo showed a significant clinical response. Compared with non-responders,  placebo responders remained in treatment for significantly longer, were more  likely to report "enjoyment" as a trigger for gambling, and were less likely to  state that "boredom" or "loneliness" triggered their gambling. Placebo responders  and non-responders did not differ significantly in age, sex, age at symptom  onset, baseline symptom severity, comorbidities, or likelihood of having received  a previous treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of placebo response for gambling  disorder appear markedly different from those reported for other mental  illnesses.

AB  - AIMS: To adapt the four-dimensional Gambling Motives Questionnaire-Revised (GMQ-R) to measure the motivation for engaging in electronic gaming, and to  validate the internal structure and investigate the criterion validity of the new  Electronic Gaming Motives Questionnaire (EGMQ). DESIGN AND SETTING: The GMQ-R was  adapted to measure motivation for playing video games and the new instrument was  tested on a sample of Norwegian conscripts selected randomly from the pool of  conscripts who started their military service between 2013 and 2015.  PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was administered to all those who had played  video games during the last 6 months and consisted of 853 gamers (86.8% men, mean  age = 19.4 years). MEASUREMENTS: All participants completed the EGMQ, as well as  other measures of gaming behaviour, gaming problems, boredom, loneliness and  depression. FINDINGS: The confirmatory factor analyses showed that the proposed  EGMQ (measuring enhancement, coping, social and self-gratification motives)  displayed satisfactory fit and internal consistency. Hierarchical regression  analyses showed that gender emerged as a significant predictor (P < 0.001) of all  the dependent variables (variety, hours weekly gaming, loss of control and gaming  problems) and the first step explained between 1 and 6.1% of the variance in the  gaming behaviours. In the second step the four motivational dimensions explained  an additional 5.8-38.8% of the variance. Coping and self-gratification predicted  gaming problems (P < 0.001) and coping alone predicted loss of control  (P < 0.001). The four motivational dimensions were also predicted differentially  by indicators of psychosocial wellbeing, indicating divergent validity of the  four motives. CONCLUSIONS: The four-dimensional Electronic Gaming Motives  Questionnaire is a valid instrument for measuring motives for gaming.

AB  - Online gambling has gained popularity in the last decade, leading to an important shift in how consumers engage in gambling and in the factors related to problem  gambling and prevention. Indebtedness and loneliness have previously been  associated with problem gambling. The current study aimed to characterize online  gamblers in relation to indebtedness, loneliness, and several in-game social  behaviors. The data set was obtained from 584 Internet gamblers recruited online  through gambling websites and forums. Of these gamblers, 372 participants  completed all study assessments and were included in the analyses. Questionnaires  included those on sociodemographics and social variables (indebtedness,  loneliness, in-game social behaviors), as well as the Gambling Motives  Questionnaire, Gambling Related Cognitions Scale, Internet Addiction Test,  Problem Gambling Severity Index, Short Depression-Happiness Scale, and UPPS-P  Impulsive Behavior Scale. Social variables were explored with a latent class  model. The clusters obtained were compared for psychological measures and three  clusters were found: lonely indebted gamblers (cluster 1: 6.5%), not lonely not  indebted gamblers (cluster 2: 75.4%), and not lonely indebted gamblers (cluster  3: 18%). Participants in clusters 1 and 3 (particularly in cluster 1) were at  higher risk of problem gambling than were those in cluster 2. The three groups  differed on most assessed variables, including the Problem Gambling Severity  Index, the Short Depression-Happiness Scale, and the UPPS-P subscales (except the  sensation seeking subscore). Results highlight significant between-group  differences, suggesting that Internet gamblers are not a homogeneous group.  Specific intervention strategies could be implemented for groups at risk.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of women problem gamblers, focusing on the meaning of gambling to them, how and why these  women continue to gamble or stop gambling, and their needs and concerns. In order  to effectively help women problem gamblers, practical in-depth knowledge is  necessary to develop intervention programs for prevention, treatment, and  recovery among women problem gamblers. METHODS: The hermeneutic phenomenology  approach was used to guide in-depth interviews and team interpretation of data.  Sixteen women gamblers who chose to live in the casino area were recruited  through snowball sampling with help from a counseling center. Participants were  individually interviewed from February to April 2013 and asked to tell their  stories of gambling. Transcribed interviews provided data for interpretive  analysis. RESULTS: In the study analysis one constitutive pattern was identified:  moving beyond addiction by recognizing the two faces of gambling in their life.  Four related themes emerged in the analysis-gambling as alluring; gambling as  'ugly'; living in contradictions; and moving beyond. CONCLUSION: Loneliness and  isolation play a critical role in gambling experiences of women gamblers in  Korea. In other words, they are motivated to gamble in order to escape from  loneliness, to stop gambling for fear of being lonely as they get older, and to  stay in the casnio area so as not to be alone. The need for acceptance is one fo  the important factors that should be considered in developing intervention  program for women.

AB  - Problem gambling rates in older adults have risen dramatically in recent years and require further investigation. Limited available research has suggested that  social needs may motivate gambling and hence problem gambling in older adults.  Un-partnered older adults may be at greater risk of problem gambling than those  with a partner. The current study explored whether loneliness mediated the  marital status-problem gambling relationship, and whether gender moderated the  mediation model. It was hypothesised that the relationship between being  un-partnered and higher levels of loneliness would be stronger for older men than  older women. A community sample of Australian men (n = 92) and women (n = 91)  gamblers aged from 60 to 90 years (M = 69.75, SD = 7.28) completed the UCLA  Loneliness Scale and the Problem Gambling Severity Index. The results supported  the moderated mediation model, with loneliness mediating the relationship between  marital status and problem gambling for older men but not for older women. It  appears that felt loneliness is an important predictor of problem gambling in  older adults, and that meeting the social and emotional needs of un-partnered men  is important.

AB  - Research suggests that individuals with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) do not have difficulty generating alternatives to social problems but  choose more negative solutions, suggesting a deficit in decision-making. However,  studies report no significant differences in risky decision-making on a  performance-based task among individuals with and without NSSI histories. A  limitation of these studies is that decision-making was only assessed at  baseline. As individuals with a history of NSSI typically self-injure when  experiencing negative emotions, decision-making ability may become impaired  specifically in the presence of these emotions. The aim of the current study was  to investigate decision-making ability among individuals with and without NSSI  histories both at baseline and following a distressing social exclusion task. We  compared individuals with (n=48) and without (n=72) NSSI histories on the Iowa  Gambling Task, a behavioral measure of risky decision-making, before and after  exclusion or inclusion on the Cyberball task. Results indicated no significant  group differences in performance regardless of condition. When participants were  grouped by racial/ethnic minority status, results indicated that non-Hispanic  White individuals with a history of NSSI exhibited deterioration in risky  decision-making ability following social exclusion. Potential explanations for  these findings and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use has been identified as a serious public health problem. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the prevalence  and correlates of AAS use among Norwegian adolescents. METHODS: In 2012, a  nationally representative sample of 2,055 17-year-old adolescents (963 males and  1,088 females) participated in a survey. The response rate was 70.4%. In addition  to questions about AAS use, participants completed the Parental Monitoring Scale,  the Family Relations/Cohesion Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification  Test C, the Mini-International Personality Item Pool-Five-Factor Model, the  Eysenck Narrow Impulsiveness Subscale, the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking,  the Short-Form Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. They also answered questions  about demography, gambling, smoking, snus, and narcotic use. Descriptive  statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The  lifetime prevalence of AAS use was 0.30% (0.52% in males and 0.09% in females),  while current prevalence was 0.25%. Moreover, 19.39% of the sample reported  having an acquaintance who used or had used AAS. Having an acquaintance who used  or had used AAS was significantly related to snus use, depression, aggression,  extraversion, and conscientiousness in both univariate and multivariate logistic  regression analyses. Conclusions/Importance: Our findings suggest a high  prevalence of AAS use among Norwegian adolescents and denote the significance of  social, personality, and health factors in adolescents' exposure to AAS milieu.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Problem gambling not only impacts those directly involved, but also the concerned significant others (CSOs) of problem gamblers. The aims of this  study were to investigate the proportion of male and female CSOs at the  population level; to investigate who the CSOs were concerned about; and to  investigate sociodemographic factors, gender differences, gambling behaviour, and  health and well-being among CSOs and non-CSOs. METHODS: The data (n = 4484) were  based on a cross-sectional population study. Structured telephone interviews were  conducted in 2011-2012. The data were weighted based on age, gender and  residency. The respondents were defined as CSOs if they reported that at least  one of their significant others (father, mother, sister/brother, grandparent,  spouse, own child/children, close friend) had had gambling problems. Statistical  significance was determined by chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests, and logistic  regression analysis. RESULTS: Altogether, 19.3% of the respondents were  identified as CSOs. Most commonly, the problem gambler was a close friend (12.4%)  of the CSO. The percentage of close friends having a gambling problem was larger  among male CSOs (14.4%) compared with female CSOs (10.3%; p ≤ 0.001), while the  percentage of partners with gambling problem was larger among females (2.6%) than  among males (0.8%; p ≤ 0.001). In the best fitting model, the odds ratio (95% CI)  of being a male CSO was 2.03 (1.24-3.31) for past-year gambling problems, 1.46  (1.08-1.97) for loneliness and 1.78 (1.38-2.29) for risky alcohol consumption.  The odds ratio (95% CI) of being a female CSO was 1.51 (1.09-2.08) for past-year  gambling involvement, 3.05 (1.18-7.90) for past-year gambling problems, 2.21  (1.24-3.93) for mental health problems, 1.39 (1.03-1.89) for loneliness and 1.97  (1.43-2.71) for daily smoking. CONCLUSIONS: CSOs of problem gamblers often  experience cumulating problems such as their own risky gambling behaviour, health  problems and other addictive disorders. The clearest gender difference was seen  in smoking by CSO. In order to develop efficient and targeted support and  services for CSOs, it is necessary to understand the correlates related to  different subgroups of CSOs.

AU  - Shen, Qiang

AU  - Ma, Qingguo
T2  - Behavioural brain research
AB  - In the past decade, considerable amounts of studies have explored the neural underpinnings of empathic response toward the positive and negative feelings of  others, such as pain and social exclusion, in the field of neuroeconomics. In  addition, empathic response of observing other's financial gains and losses have  recently started to gain increasing attention in this interdisciplinary field.  However, the effects of inequality-averse social preference on individuals'  response toward other's gains and losses have not yet been clearly characterized.  This work conducted an electrophysiological study with a simple gambling task to  explore how inequality aversion matters in modulating neural temporal dynamics  toward self and others' gains and losses using scalp-recorded event-related  potentials (ERPs). The electrophysiological data demonstrated increased amplitude  of P300 toward self's monetary gains and losses independent of advantageous and  disadvantageous status. Intriguingly, subjects in the high pay group evoked more  pronounced gain loss disparity of feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude  toward others than themselves. Meanwhile, such a pattern was not observed among  the subjects in the low pay group. Therefore, the current double dissociation  results of FRN and P300 may indicate that advantageous status enhances subjects'  empathic response toward others' pecuniary outcome, giving a direct  electrophysiological evidence for the economic modeling on inequality aversion  behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the socio-demographic characteristics of non-problem gamblers, problem gamblers and pathological  gamblers, to investigate the association between gambling related factors and  perceived health and well-being among the three subgroups of gamblers, and to  analyse simultaneously socio-demographic characteristics, gambling related  factors and perceived health and well-being and the severity of disordered  gambling (problem gamblers and pathological gamblers). METHODS: The data were  collected through a nationwide telephone survey in 2011. Participants were  selected through a random population sample of 15-74-year-old Finns. From that  sample, persons with any past-year gambling involvement (N = 3451) were selected  for a subsample for the descriptive and inferential analysis in the present  paper. Gambling was assessed using the South Oaks Gambling Screen. Statistical  significance was determined by chi-squared tests. The odds ratio and effect size  were computed by using multivariate-adjusted multinomial logistic regression  analysis. RESULTS: The most significant socio-demographic characteristics (male  gender, young age, education ≤ 12 years), gambling related factors (slot machine  gambling, internet gambling) and perceived health and well-being (feeling lonely,  smoking daily, risky alcohol consumption, mental health problems) explained 22.9  per cent of the variation in the severity of disordered gambling. CONCLUSION:  Male gender and loneliness were found to be associated with problem gambling in  particular, along with smoking and risky alcohol consumption. Mental health  problems and risky alcohol consumption were associated with pathological  gambling. These identified associations between disordered gambling, mental  health problems and risky alcohol consumption should be taken into consideration  when implementing screenings of disordered gambling.

AU  - Dowling, N. A.

AB  - The most commonly applied conceptual approach for excessive Internet use has been as a behavioral addiction, similar to pathological or problem gambling. In order  to contribute to the understanding of Internet dependence as a disorder  resembling problem gambling, the current study aimed to examine the relationship  between problem gambling and Internet dependence and the degree to which  psychological factors associated with problem gambling are relevant to the study  of Internet dependence. The factors of depression, anxiety, student stressors,  loneliness, and social support were examined in a sample of university students  from several Australian universities. The findings revealed that there is no  overlap between the populations reporting problem gambling and Internet  dependence, but that individuals with these disorders report similar  psychological profiles. Although requiring replication with larger community  samples and longitudinal designs, these preliminary findings suggest that problem  gambling and Internet dependence may be separate disorders with common underlying  etiologies or consequences. The implications of the findings in relation to the  conceptualization and management of these disorders are briefly discussed.

T2  - Social cognitive and affective neuroscience
AB  - Ostracism is ubiquitous across the lifespan. From social exclusion on the playground, to romantic rejection, to workplace expulsion, to social disregard  for the aged, ostracism threatens a fundamental human need to belong that  reflexively elicits social pain and sadness. Older adults may be particularly  vulnerable to ostracism because of loss of network members and meaningful  societal roles. On the other hand, socioemotional selectivity theory suggests  that older adults may be less impacted by ostracism because of an age-related  positivity bias. We examined these hypotheses in two independent studies, and  tested mechanisms that may account for age differences in the affective  experience of ostracism. A study of 18- to 86-year-old participants in the  Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences program showed an age-related  decrease in the impact of ostracism on needs satisfaction and negative  affectivity. A study of 53- to 71-year-old participants in the Chicago Health,  Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) showed that ostracism diminished  positive affectivity in younger (<60 years) but not older adults. Age group  differences in response to ostracism were consistent with the positivity bias  hypothesis, were partly explained by age differences in the impact of physical  pain, but were not explained by autonomic nervous system activity, computer  experience, or intimate social loss or stressful life experiences.

AB  - Until recently knowledge was limited with respect to clinically relevant excessive reward-seeking behaviour such as pathological gambling, excessive  shopping, and excessive working which meet diagnostic criteria of dependent  behaviour. To date there is no consistent concept for diagnosis or treatment of  excessive reward-seeking behaviour, and its classification is uncertain. However,  the high number of subjects seeking treatment emphasises the importance of a  clear conceptualisation of the so-called behavioural addictions and their  successful treatment. Excessive reward-seeking behaviour may be used to regulate  negative emotions. We suggest that, comparable to drug addiction, excessive  reward-seeking behaviour can alleviate negative mood states and may be used as an  (inadequate) stress coping strategy at the expense of active coping strategies.  In the course of a pathological development, behavioural addiction may become the  only available behavioural resource to cope with challenging developmental steps  or social stress factors such as loneliness or anxiety.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between severity of gambling problems and psychosocial functioning in older adults. Twenty-one current pathological  gamblers and 10 current problem gamblers over 60 years of age completed the  Addiction Severity Index (ASI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Brief Symptom  Inventory (BSI), UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and Social Provisions Scale  (SPS). Compared with problem gamblers, pathological gamblers reported increased  severity of gambling and family/social problems on the ASI; scored higher on the  GDS, BSI, and UCLA-LS; and scored lower on the SPS. Although they were not  seeking treatment at the time of the interview, three fourths of pathological  gamblers and 30% of problem gamblers were interested in gambling treatment. These  results suggest that severity of gambling problems is associated with increased  psychosocial distress in older adults and that a significant proportion of older  adults with a gambling disorder may be cognizant of their gambling problem and  interested in treatment.

AB  - Four experiments tested the idea that social exclusion leads to (unintentionally) self-defeating behavior. Exclusion was manipulated by telling some people that  they were likely to end up alone later in life. This randomly assigned feedback  caused people to take irrational, self-defeating risks (Experiments 1 and 2),  choose unhealthy, rather than healthy, behaviors (Experiment 3), and  procrastinate longer with pleasurable activities rather than practicing for an  upcoming test (Experiment 4). A control group, who heard that their future would  be marred by frequent accidents, did not show these self-defeating patterns.  Thus, the effect goes beyond just hearing bad news. Emotional distress did not  significantly mediate these effects across 3 different mood measures.

AB  - Gender differences in pathological gambling disorder (PGD) have received little investigation. This study was constructed to detail the demographic and  phenomenological differences in men and women with PGD. We assessed gender  differences in 131 subjects with PGD who were evaluated in terms of demographic  characteristics, clinical features of PGD, and treatment history. Seventy-eight  (60%) subjects were women, and 53 (40%) were men. Men had an earlier age of onset  of gambling behavior, while women progressed to pathological gambling sooner  after beginning to gamble. In terms of gambling behavior, men were more likely to  engage in blackjack, cards, sporting events, and the track, whereas women played  slot machines and bingo. Women reported that loneliness was the major trigger to  gambling, while men were more likely to gamble secondary to sensory stimuli.  Although men were as likely as women to have filed bankruptcy because of  gambling, women were more likely to have written bad checks and men were more  likely to have lost significant savings. Both groups were equally likely to seek  treatment, but Gamblers Anonymous (GA) and outpatient therapy were reported  equally ineffective in reducing gambling symptoms. There appear to be some gender  differences in the clinical features of PGD, and these differences may have  treatment implications.

AB  - With recent introduction of poker machines in Australia, there have been claims of increases in the number of women with gambling-related problems. Research in  the United States indicates, however, that men have a higher incidence of  pathological gambling. The aims of this study were to ascertain among game  machine users in a major city in Australia whether (a) more women than men  exhibited symptoms of pathological gambling, (b) women reported higher guilt  associated with their gambling, and (c) gamblers' self-assessment on several mood  states was predictive of pathological gambling. A modified version of the South  Oaks Gambling Screen was administered to 104 users of game machines (44 men, 60  women) sampled from patrons at gaming venues in Melbourne, Australia. Data  indicated no significant sex difference in the proportion of pathological  gamblers or in gambling-related guilt. Self-assessment of Happiness, Propensity  for Boredom, and Loneliness, significantly predicted scores on the South Oaks  Gambling Screen, with Unhappiness a significant independent predictor of  pathological gambling. This may suggest that gambling acts to fill a need in the  lives of unhappy people or that individuals who lack control over their gambling  report higher unhappiness. Further research is needed to discover this  relationship.
