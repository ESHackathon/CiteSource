AB  - Older adults represent the highest proportion of gamblers (Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation [OLG], 2012). Unpartnered older adults may be more socially isolated and lonely (Dykstra & de Jong Gierveld, 2004), thus more likely to be at risk for problem gambling (McQuade & Gill, 2012). We examined whether gambling to socialize or from loneliness and going to the casino with friends/family mediate the relation between marital status and problem gambling. Data from a random sample of older adults at gambling venues across Southwestern Ontario indicated that gambling with family/friends and gambling due to loneliness mediated the relationship between marital status and problem gambling. Relative to those married, unpartnered older adults were less likely to gamble with family/friends, more likely to gamble due to loneliness, and had higher problem gambling. Prevention and treatment initiatives should examine ways to decrease loneliness and social isolation among older adults and offer alternative social activities.

AB  - Online gambling has gained popularity in the last decade, leading to an important shift in how consumers engage in gambling and in the factors related to problem gambling and prevention. Indebtedness and loneliness have previously been associated with problem gambling. The current study aimed to characterize online gamblers in relation to indebtedness, loneliness, and several in-game social behaviors. The data set was obtained from 584 Internet gamblers recruited online through gambling websites and forums. Of these gamblers, 372 participants completed all study assessments and were included in the analyses. Questionnaires included those on sociodemographics and social variables (indebtedness, loneliness, in-game social behaviors), as well as the Gambling Motives Questionnaire, Gambling Related Cognitions Scale, Internet Addiction Test, Problem Gambling Severity Index, Short Depression-Happiness Scale, and UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. Social variables were explored with a latent class model. The clusters obtained were compared for psychological measures and three clusters were found: lonely indebted gamblers (cluster 1: 6.5%), not lonely not indebted gamblers (cluster 2: 75.4%), and not lonely indebted gamblers (cluster 3: 18%). Participants in clusters 1 and 3 (particularly in cluster 1) were at higher risk of problem gambling than were those in cluster 2. The three groups differed on most assessed variables, including the Problem Gambling Severity Index, the Short Depression-Happiness Scale, and the UPPS-P subscales (except the sensation seeking subscore). Results highlight significant between-group differences, suggesting that Internet gamblers are not a homogeneous group. Specific intervention strategies could be implemented for groups at risk.

AB  - Two studies tested whether social exclusion can increase gambling behavior. In Study 1, participants were asked to relive a socially painful instance, a physically painful instance or a control condition and were then presented with a real online gambling device (i.e., a slot machine). The results revealed that participants who relived a socially painful instance played longer on the gambling device. In Study 2, we induced actual feelings of social disconnection and manipulated slot machine anthropomorphization. The results revealed a significant interaction between inclusionary status and anthropomorphism in predicting gambling. More specifically, excluded participants gambled longer when presented with an anthropomorphized slot machine. However, the gambling behavior of excluded and included participants was no different when participants were reminded that slot machines are inanimate objects. Finally, positive and negative game experience mediated the influence of both inclusionary status and anthropomorphism on gambling. Overall, this research identifies another potential vulnerability produced by experiences of social exclusion, namely, gambling behavior. Implications for pathological gambling and future research directions are outlined.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of women problem gamblers, focusing on the meaning of gambling to them, how and why these women continue to gamble or stop gambling, and their needs and concerns. In order to effectively help women problem gamblers, practical in-depth knowledge is necessary to develop intervention programs for prevention, treatment, and recovery among women problem gamblers. Methods: The hermeneutic phenomenology approach was used to guide in-depth interviews and team interpretation of data. Sixteen women gamblers who chose to live in the casino area were recruited through snowball sampling with help from a counseling center. Participants were individually interviewed from February to April 2013 and asked to tell their stories of gambling. Transcribed interviews provided data for interpretive analysis. Results: In the study analysis one constitutive pattern was identified: moving beyond addiction by recognizing the two faces of gambling in their life. Four related themes emerged in the analysis-gambling as alluring; gambling as 'ugly'; living in contradictions; and moving beyond. Conclusion: Loneliness and isolation play a critical role in gambling experiences of women gamblers in Korea. In other words, they are motivated to gamble in order to escape from loneliness, to stop gambling for. fear of being lonely as they get older, and to stay in the casino area so as not to be alone. The need for acceptance is one of the important factors that should be considered in developing intervention program for women.

AB  - Problem gambling rates in older adults have risen dramatically in recent years and require further investigation. Limited available research has suggested that social needs may motivate gambling and hence problem gambling in older adults. Un-partnered older adults may be at greater risk of problem gambling than those with a partner. The current study explored whether loneliness mediated the marital status-problem gambling relationship, and whether gender moderated the mediation model. It was hypothesised that the relationship between being un-partnered and higher levels of loneliness would be stronger for older men than older women. A community sample of Australian men (n = 92) and women (n = 91) gamblers aged from 60 to 90 years (M = 69.75, SD = 7.28) completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Problem Gambling Severity Index. The results supported the moderated mediation model, with loneliness mediating the relationship between marital status and problem gambling for older men but not for older women. It appears that felt loneliness is an important predictor of problem gambling in older adults, and that meeting the social and emotional needs of un-partnered men is important.

AB  - Background and aims: Loneliness and a low sense of mastery are associated with excessive gambling, but the underlying processes of these relationships remain unstudied. Because psychological distress can increase vulnerability to excessive gambling, we investigated its mediating role in these relationships among young people. To meet the need for cross-country research, we also observed how these relationships occur in four countries with different cultures. Design, setting, and participants: Demographically balanced cross-sectional survey data were collected from 15-25-year-olds in Finland (n = 1200; 50% male), the United States (n = 1212; 49.8% male), South Korea (n = 1192; 49.6% male), and Spain (n = 1212; 51.2% male). Measurements: Excessive gambling was measured with the South Oaks Gambling Screen, psychological distress was assessed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, loneliness was measured with the three-item Loneliness Scale, and low sense of mastery was assessed with the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Associations were examined first using zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses with excessive gambling as the outcome. In addition, path analyses were performed to study how loneliness and low sense of mastery relate to excessive gambling, with psychological distress as the mediating variable. Findings: Loneliness and low sense of mastery were associated indirectly with excessive gambling via psychological distress in all country samples. Low sense of mastery was also directly associated with excessive gambling. There was a direct association between loneliness and excessive gambling only in samples from South Korea and Spain. Conclusions: Psychological distress is an important factor in understanding how loneliness and sense of mastery relate to gambling.

AB  - Individuals use online communities for social networking and to find similar others. These communities can be attractive for individuals who are dissatisfied with their offline relationships. This article reports two studies analyzing the daily participation in online gambling-communities. In Study 1, self-reported measures were used to examine the role of loneliness, excessive gambling, and Internet use in daily online gambling-community participation. In Study 2, a gambling-related vignette experiment was used to analyze how characteristics of online behavior predict daily online gambling-community participation. Both studies are based on three samples collected among Finnish (N = 1200 and N = 230) and U.S. (N = 1212) adolescents and young adults. In Finland and the U.S., daily online gambling-community participation was more likely among compulsive Internet users and individuals who gambled excessively. In Finland, loneliness moderated the effect between gambling problems and daily gambling-community participation, but in the U.S., loneliness had no moderating effect. Preferring pro-gambling to antigambling content also predicted more likely daily online gambling-community participation. Online gambling-communities are attractive for young individuals who experience gambling problems and are interested in gambling overall.

AB  - Loneliness and adapting to an unfamiliar environment can increase emotional vulnerability in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) university students. According to Blaszczynski and Nower's pathways model of problem and pathological gambling, this emotional vulnerability could increase the risk of problem gambling. The current study examined whether loneliness was associated with problem gambling risk in CALD students relative to their Australian peers. Additionally, differences in coping strategies were examined to determine their buffering effect on the relationship. A total of 463 female and 165 male university students (aged 18-38) from Australian (38%), mixed Australian and CALD (23%) and CALD (28%) backgrounds responded to an online survey of problem gambling behaviour, loneliness, and coping strategies. The results supported the hypothesis that loneliness would be related to problem gambling in CALD students. There was no evidence of a moderating effect of coping strategies. Future research could test whether the introduction of programs designed to alleviate loneliness in culturally diverse university students reduces their risk of developing problem gambling.

AB  - The predominant gambling policy to respond to the adverse consequences of excessive gambling has been the Reno Model, which places the responsibility for gambling-caused problems on gamblers themselves. The newly implemented Japanese gambling policy, which shares basic premises with the Reno Model, focuses on the individual pathology of gamblers. However, this model lacks other critical perspectives: environmental and structural factors. To fully understand the harms caused by gambling; it is important to also pay attention to the negative consequences for affected others. In this brief report, we explore family members' experiences of gambling problems within the specific context of the Japanese gambling policy. Interviews with family members reveal self-stigma of being bad parents which elicits shame and efforts to maintain secrecy, as well as public stigma involving labeling, isolation, risks of status loss, social exclusion and discrimination. The focus on individual pathology in Japanese legislation as well as in public and professional perception, reinforces self-blame, anxiety, and remorse on the part of affected family members. When contrasted with the lived experiences of gamblers' family members, the inconsistencies and unreasonableness of the individual pathology paradigm in Japanese gambling policy become evident. It is necessary to shift the focus of gambling policies from individual to socio-political-cultural factors, investigating how these factors influence gambling-caused harm, especially in the Japanese context.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to compare the socio-demographic characteristics of non-problem gamblers, problem gamblers and pathological gamblers, to investigate the association between gambling related factors and perceived health and well-being among the three subgroups of gamblers, and to analyse simultaneously socio-demographic characteristics, gambling related factors and perceived health and well-being and the severity of disordered gambling (problem gamblers and pathological gamblers).
   Methods: The data were collected through a nationwide telephone survey in 2011. Participants were selected through a random population sample of 15-74-year-old Finns. From that sample, persons with any past-year gambling involvement (N = 3451) were selected for a subsample for the descriptive and inferential analysis in the present paper. Gambling was assessed using the South Oaks Gambling Screen. Statistical significance was determined by chi-squared tests. The odds ratio and effect size were computed by using multivariate-adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The most significant socio-demographic characteristics (male gender, young age, education <= 12 years), gambling related factors (slot machine gambling, internet gambling) and perceived health and well-being (feeling lonely, smoking daily, risky alcohol consumption, mental health problems) explained 22.9 per cent of the variation in the severity of disordered gambling.
   Conclusion: Male gender and loneliness were found to be associated with problem gambling in particular, along with smoking and risky alcohol consumption. Mental health problems and risky alcohol consumption were associated with pathological gambling. These identified associations between disordered gambling, mental health problems and risky alcohol consumption should be taken into consideration when implementing screenings of disordered gambling.

AB  - AIMS - The aims were to compare past-year at-risk and problem gambling (ARPG) and other at-risk behaviours (computer gaming, risky alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking) by age and gender, and to explore how ARPG is associated with risky alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, poor mental health and loneliness in males and females. DESIGN - Data from respondents aged 15-28 (n = 822) were derived from a cross-sectional random sample of population-based data (n = 4484). The data were collected in 2011-2012 by telephone interviews. The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI, score >= 2) was used to evaluate ARPG. Prevalence rates for risk behaviours were compared for within gender-specific age groups. Regression models were gender-specific. RESULTS - The proportion of at-risk and problem gamblers was higher among males than females in all age groups except among 18-21-year-olds, while frequent computer gaming was higher among males in all age groups. The odds ratio (95% CI) of being a male ARPGer was 2.57 (1.40-4.74) for risky alcohol consumption; 1.95 (1.07-3.56) for tobacco smoking; 2.63 (0.96-7.26) for poor mental health; and 4.41 (1.20-16.23) for feeling lonely. Likewise, the odds ratio (95% CI) of being a female ARPGer was 1.19 (0.45-3.12) for risky alcohol consumption; 4.01 (1.43-11.24) for tobacco smoking; 0.99 (0.18-5.39) for poor mental health; and 6.46 (1.42-29.34) for feeling lonely. All 95% CIs of ARPG correlates overlapped among males and females. CONCLUSIONS - Overall, past-year at-risk and problem gambling and computer gaming seem to be more common among males than females; however, for risky alcohol consumption similar gender differences were evident only for the older half of the sample. No clear gender differences were seen in correlates associated with ARPG.

AB  - This study explores how partners of persons with gambling problems experience the family's everyday life, focusing on family relations and parenting. Problem gambling creates a serious impact on household finances, social life and health, emotional and relational issues. Between 6 and 10 persons are directly affected by a person's gambling problems. Despite this, research exploring how daily life and relations in the family is affected is scarce. A qualitative method was used to acquire a deeper understanding of partners' experiences of everyday life, relations and parenting. In-depth interviews were carried out with nine female partners of problem gamblers. All nine women had been responsible for minor children. A thematic analysis was used to systemize the participants' experiences. The results determined how living with a partner with a gambling problem is a lonely project. Partners of problem gamblers take on a lot of responsibility for daily life activities, household finances and parenting but experience little support from their partner. A general lack of knowledge and recognition of gambling as a problem, increases the loneliness, shame and burden. Despite gambling having a tremendous impact on daily life and relations, families receive little support. Taking over responsibility and becoming the one in charge, can be understood as ways of reclaiming dignity and gaining power albeit within limits. This duality needs to be considered when providing support to families.

AB  - Loneliness is a public health concern with detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social anxiety (SA), cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting SA might be adopted to reduce loneliness. However, whether SA and loneliness share the same underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is still an elusive question. The current study aimed at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social avoidance in SA are evident in loneliness. We used a prestratified approach involving 42 (21 females) participants with high loneliness (HL) and 40 (20 females) participants with low loneliness (LL) scores. During fMRI, participants completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in social situations and responses to social feedback. Univariate and multivariate analyses of behavioral and neural data replicated known task effects. However, although HL participants showed increased SA, loneliness was associated with a response pattern clearly distinct from SA. Specifically, contrary to expectations based on SA differences, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social feedback in both groups. Moreover, while explorative analyses revealed reduced pleasantness ratings, increased striatal activity, and decreased striatal-hippocampal connectivity in response to negative computer feedback in HL participants, these effects were diminished for negative social feedback. Our findings suggest that, unlike SA, loneliness is not associated with withdrawal from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for SA should be adjusted when targeting loneliness. Significance Statement Loneliness can cause serious health problems. Adapting well-established cognitive-behavioral therapies targeting social anxiety might be promising to reduce chronic loneliness given a close link between both constructs. However, a better understanding of behavioral and neurobiological factors associated with loneliness is needed to identify which specific mechanisms of social anxiety are shared by lonely individuals. We found that lonely individuals show a consistently distinct pattern of behavioral and neural responsiveness to social decision-making and social feedback compared with previous findings for social anxiety. Our results indicate that loneliness is associated with a biased emotional reactivity to negative events rather than social avoidance. Our findings thus emphasize the distinctiveness of loneliness from social anxiety and the need for adjusted psychotherapeutic protocols.

AB  - Gambling participation among older people has grown over the years. Elders constitute a large and fast-growing population in Italy, but little empirical evidence describes gambling patterns among older Italian adults and the problem gambling (PG)'s psychosocial determinants, so a range of questions which are crucial to orient prevention strategies remain unanswered. The present study aims to investigate habits, representations, levels of engagement in gambling among Italian elders and the role of loneliness, social support and well-being in explaining their problem with gambling. A convenience sample of 165 participants (mean age: 66.93; SD = 5.73; women: 43.1%) was involved. Gambling activities, habits, representations and PG rates were examined. A group "at moderate risk/problem gambling'' (scoring 47 on PGSI, n = 40) and a control group (scoring 0 on PGSI, n = 40) were selected from the whole sample, balanced on socio-demographic characteristics; a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the two groups on the target psychosocial variables. 11.5% of the sample was found to meet the PGSI criteria for PG; 26.7% for moderate risk; 11.5% for problem gambling; 50.3% were classified as no-problem gamblers. Scratch cards were the main form of gambling among all groups; the chance to make more money and to distract oneself from other problems were the main reasons to gamble. Finally, the group "at moderate risk/problem gambling,'' compared to the control group, expressed higher loneliness, as well as lower perceived social support and well-being.

AB  - Background and aims: Problem gambling is characterized by high stigma and self-stigma, making relevant measurement of the burden of the disorder complex. The aim of our qualitative study was to describe health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impacted by problem gambling from the patients' perspective. Methods: We conducted 6 focus groups with 25 current or lifetime at-risk problem gamblers to identify key domains of quality of life impacted by problem gambling. A content analysis from the focus groups data was conducted using Alceste (c) software, using descendant hierarchical classification analysis, to obtain stable classes and the significant presences of reduced forms. The class of interest, detailing the core of impacted quality of life, was described using a cluster analysis. Results: Thematic content analysis identified three stable classes. Class 1 contained the interviewers' speech. Class 3 was composed of the vocabulary related to gambling practice, games and gambling venues (casino, horse betting, etc.). Class 2 described the core of impact of gambling on quality of life and corresponded to 43% of the analyzed elementary context units. This analysis revealed seven key domains of impact of problem gambling: loneliness, financial pressure, relationships deterioration, feeling of incomprehension, preoccupation with gambling, negative emotions, and avoidance of helping relationships. Conclusions: We identified, beyond objective damage, the subjective distress felt by problem gamblers over the course of the disorder and in the helping process, marked in particular by stigma and self-stigma. Four impacted HRQOL areas were new and gambling-specific: loneliness, feeling of incomprehension, avoidance of helping relationships, and preoccupation with gambling. These results support the relevance of developing, in a next step, a specific HRQOL scale in the context of gambling.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of research on Internet Abuse (IA) and its relationship with other disorders. It suggests that it is important to differentiate between IA and Internet-enabled pathologies such as sexual paraphilias and pathological gambling which are performed online. Those who develop IA are drawn to the socially interactive aspects of the Internet, and find their social interactions are enhanced online compared to offline. A comprehensive model proposed by Caplan suggests that those who lack self-presentational skills develop a preference for online over face-to-face communication which leads them to use online communication compulsively which in turn leads to IA. This may explain the increased vulnerability for IA among those who are chronically lonely and socially anxious. Criticisms of this research are discussed.

AB  - Aim: To study the prevalence and patterns of problematic gaming and gambling during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association with psychiatric traits and major types of anxiety categories. Method: 1067 young adults participated in both wave 3 (2018) and wave 4 (2021) of the SALVe Cohort. Associations with psychiatric symptoms and anxiety were examined using logistic regression and Chi-square tests. Results: Problematic gaming decreased by 1.3 percentage points to 23.2% since the start of the pandemic, while problematic gambling increased by 0.9 percentage points to 6.5% in w4. Average time spent playing video games/day decreased from 2.2 h (w3) to 1.7 h (w4), while increases in gaming activity were associated with worsened feelings of loneliness (p = 0.002), depression (p < 0.001), and anxiety (p < 0.01) during the pandemic. Predictors for problematic gaming at w4 were previous problematic gaming and social anxiety (p = < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively). Moreover, previous problem gambling also predicted problem gambling at w4 p < 0.001. All anxiety categories were associated with both problematic gaming and gambling when adjusted for age and sex. However, after adjusting for depression and insomnia, social anxiety was associated with problematic gaming (p < 0.001), while panic was associated with problem gambling (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, problematic gaming has decreased since the start of the pandemic, while problem gambling has increased. Worsened feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic are associated with increased gaming. Moreover, the association between problematic gaming and gambling and anxiety is independent of depression and sleep problems.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the differences in gambling exposure and onset of gambling problems among male and female gamblers by comparing their demographic and behavioral profiles. This study utilized data from the gambling section of the First Brazilian National Alcohol Survey and Related Behaviors. Interviews were conducted with 3007 participants who were recruited after screening for at-risk gambling behaviors. Individuals who tested positive for at-risk gambling behaviors completed the Gambling Progression Questionnaire comprising items on games of chance, and were evaluated using the DSM-IV pathological gambling criteria. The participants' "lifetime gambling exposure" was 12.5%, with 4% having experienced gambling problems during their lifetime. Majority of the male at-risk gamblers (78%) reported that they began gambling in their 20 s and took approximately 3 years to start experiencing gambling-related problems. Contrastingly, female at-risk gamblers started gambling in their 30 s and they took about 12 years to start experiencing gambling-related problems. The present results show that men were 2.3 times more at risk of gambling exposure and 3.6 times more likely to experience gambling-related problems. Male at-risk male gamblers seemed to be lonelier and to have a low socioeconomic status, while women seemed to have lower income and social insertion. Considering these significant differences, more studies evaluating gender differences in gambling behavior are necessary.

AB  - Empathy plays an essential role in determining how we understand and respond to others' emotional experiences. Previous studies have mainly focused on the influencing factors of physical pain and monetary loss empathy, as well as on their effects on subsequent feelings. However, little is known about social pain empathy and its influence on subsequent feelings, and the role of personal trait empathy. In this study, we performed Cyberball Games and gambling tasks to explore the effect of social exclusion empathy on subsequent feelings for gambling outcomes (others' losses and gains) by analyzing the brain activity of excluded and non-excluded players at the gambling outcome feedback stage. It was found that both feedback-related negativity (FRN) and theta-band oscillatory are more negative for loss outcome than gain for the excluded players, while these effects cannot be found for the non-excluded players. Furthermore, we only observed a larger P300 amplitude in the gain outcome than that of loss, regardless of the players' role. More interestingly, we found state social pain empathy is negatively correlated with the d-FRN amplitude under non-excluded conditions, while trait empathy is positively correlated with P300 amplitude regardless of the players' role. These results provide insight into the different roles of state social pain empathy and trait empathy on subsequent gambling outcomes. Furthermore, different from previous studies, the current results show that d-FRN could reflect the state empathy discrepancy rather than the biomarker of state empathy.

KW  - qualitative methodology
AB  - Gambling addiction is characterized both by loss of control with respect to gambling and such behaviour leading to problems in the different areas of the addict's life. This is therefore included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) as one of the criteria for a diagnostic assessment. Aim: to describe and analyse the different elements comprising the complex problems accompanying this addiction that may result in social exclusion. Method: a qualitative methodology was selected, as the best fit for the interests of the study. The life history technique was chosen, as an assessment instrument enabling an understanding of the true magnitude of the problem from the perspective of the persons affected. Results: in general, it was discovered that addiction has many consequences beyond the obvious financial issues. We cannot ignore the implications of this behaviour on other levels: family, work, legal and social, which may in the medium term be considered far more serious factors than mere financial loss. Conclusion: it is easy to recognize that the serious problems caused by gambling addiction are capable of destroying the lives of the addict and of their family. Anything goes, though they may have to risk their job, home, family, friendships, social status and dignity.

AB  - Background: In the ever-growing and technologically advancing world, an increasing amount of social interaction takes place through the Web. With this change, loneliness is becoming an unprecedented societal issue, making youth more susceptible to various physical and mental health problems. This societal change also influences the dynamics of addiction.
   Objective: Employing the cognitive discrepancy loneliness model, this study aimed to provide a social psychological perspective on youth addictions.
   Methods: A comprehensive survey was used to collect data from American (N=1212; mean 20.05, SD 3.19; 608/1212, 50.17% women), South Korean (N=1192; mean 20.61, SD 3.24; 601/1192, 50.42% women), and Finnish (N=1200; mean 21.29, SD 2.85; 600/1200, 50.00% women) youths aged 15 to 25 years. Perceived loneliness was assessed with the 3-item Loneliness Scale. A total of 3 addictive behaviors were measured, including excessive alcohol use, compulsive internet use, and problem gambling. A total of 2 separate models using linear regression analyses were estimated for each country to examine the association between perceived loneliness and addiction.
   Results: Loneliness was significantly related to only compulsive internet use among the youth in all 3 countries (P<.001 in the United States, South Korea, and Finland). In the South Korean sample, the association remained significant with excessive alcohol use (P<.001) and problem gambling (P<.001), even after controlling for potentially confounding psychological variables.
   Conclusions: The findings reveal existing differences between youths who spend excessive amounts of time online and those who engage in other types of addictive behaviors. Experiencing loneliness is consistently linked to compulsive internet use across countries, although different underlying factors may explain other forms of addiction. These findings provide a deeper understanding in the mechanisms of youth addiction and can help improve prevention and intervention work, especially in terms of compulsive internet use.

AB  - With recent introduction of poker machines in Australia, there have been claims of increases in the number of women with gambling-related problems. Research in the United States indicates, however, that men have a higher incidence of pathological gambling. The aims of this study were to ascertain among game machine users in a major city in Australia whether (a) more women than men exhibited symptoms of pathological gambling, (b) women reported higher guilt associated with their gambling, and (c) gamblers' self-assessment on several mood states was predictive of pathological gambling. A modified version of the South Oaks Gambling Screen was administered to 104 users of game machines (44 men, 60 women) sampled from patrons at gaming venues in Melbourne, Australia. Data indicated no significant sex difference in the proportion of pathological gamblers or in gambling-related guilt. Self-assessment of Happiness, Propensity for Boredom, and Loneliness, significantly predicted scores on the South Oaks Gambling Screen, with Unhappiness a significant independent predictor of pathological gambling. This may suggest that gambling acts to fill a need in the lives of unhappy people or that individuals who lack control over their gambling report higher unhappiness. Further research is needed to discover this relationship.

AB  - Problem gamblers often engage in few social activities other than gambling and post-treatment, can be left with considerable unstructured time and inadequate social skills. As relapse often occurs when the gambler is alone, removing or cutting back on gambling is unlikely to be a successful treatment strategy if recreational and social alternatives are unavailable. The Re(Making) Meaning project provided a structured re-engagement program for 30 participants considered at risk of relapse. In this nine-month, 18-event life-style enhancement project, offered as an adjunct to individual counselling, participants completed a range of gambling and social measures at commencement, 6 months, and 12 months. Substantial positive change in the Temptation to Gamble Scale, Work and Social Adjustment Scale, Self-Esteem, Anxiety, and Loneliness scales were achieved. It is recommended that this proof of concept study of leisure substitution for problem gambling is replicated in a controlled study to determine its relative effectiveness.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between severity of gambling problems and psychosocial functioning in older adults. Twenty-one current pathological gamblers and 10 current problem gamblers over 60 years of age completed the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and Social Provisions Scale (SPS). Compared with problem gamblers, pathological gamblers reported increased severity of gambling and family/social problems on the ASI; scored higher on the GDS, BSI, and UCLA-LS; and scored lower on the SPS. Although they were not seeking treatment at the time of the interview, three fourths of pathological gamblers and 30% of problem gamblers were interested in gambling treatment. These results suggest that severity of gambling problems is associated with increased psychosocial distress in older adults and that a significant proportion of older adults with a gambling disorder may be cognizant of their gambling problem and interested in treatment.

AB  - Background. Impairment or distress caused by gambling disorder can be subjectively assessed via quality of life. The aim of this study was to develop a new patient-reported outcome instrument to explore the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in gambling disorders, the Gambling quality-of-life scale (GQoLS), and to document its psychometric properties. Methods. A previous qualitative study had been conducted using focus groups of problem gamblers to identify areas of HRQoL impacted by gambling. The seven domains identified served as the basis for the hypothetical structure of GQoLS. Draft items were generated from the patient's speeches to illustrate each of these domains. Cognitive debriefing interviews were realized to obtain a final hypothetical GQoLS. A validation study was then carried out to determine the final version of GQoLS and its psychometric properties (structural validity, construct validity, internal consistency). Results. The final GQoLS was composed of 21 items, with a total mean score of 38.3 (+/- 13.6). Structural validity found a major dimension and four other minor dimensions. The five dimensions were: "emotion", "lifestyle", "loneliness", "taboo" and "preoccupation". GQoLS was moderately to strongly correlated with PGSI and EQ-5D visual analogic scale. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.92. Conclusion. GQoLS is the first HRQoL instrument specific to patients with a gambling disorder and developed from the patient's perspective. GQoLS presents good psychometric properties. GQoLS can be used in clinical research to demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention on outcomes that are relevant from the patient's perspective.

AB  - Background and Objectives International students comprise an ethnic minority subpopulation who may be at increased risk for the development of gambling problems. This study aimed to explore the psychosocial factors associated with gambling problems in international and domestic university students in Australia. Methods One hundred seventy-three (n = 173) university students (127 domestic, 45 international) completed measures of gambling participation, problem gambling, psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, perceived social support, loneliness, gambling-related cognitive distortions) and English language difficulties. Results Gambling participation, but not problem gambling status, was lower in international than domestic students. Only anxiety and cognitive distortions were associated with problem gambling in domestic students; and only cognitive distortions were associated with problem gambling in international students. International student status failed to moderate the relationships between any psychosocial factor and problem gambling status. Conclusions and Scientific Significance Future research is required to elucidate problem gambling risk and protective factors in this ethnic minority subgroup, with a view to guide culturally sensitive initiatives.

AB  - Ostracism (being excluded and ignored) can have a negative effect on basic, fundamental needs as well as on higher-order cognitive processes. Decision-making is one such cognitive process that is composed of both unconscious (Type I) and deliberative (Type II) processes. The present studies utilized multiple assessments of the effect of ostracism on Type I and Type II risky decision-making. In two studies, we manipulated ostracism using different paradigms (i.e., Cyberball and Atimia) and then participants completed multiple behavioral measures of risky decision-making. Results indicated ostracism, compared to inclusion, increased risky decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task and Game of Dice Task, but not the Balloon Analogue Risk Task. These results indicate ostracism likely affects risky decision-making processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - LOISIR & SOCIETE-SOCIETY AND LEISURE

AB  - This report is based on two empirical studies on women within the 'new gambling culture' in Australia. One group is representing a range of cultural diversity with non-English speaking backgrounds; the informants are community spokespersons and counsellors for the women. Personal notions of karma and predestination, as well as structural changes in the society such as industrial downsizing affect the gambling behaviour of some cultural groups, possibly encouraging the development of gambling addiction.
   The second Dart of the study comprises the narratives of gambling experiences by ten self-selected problem gamblers. Many components of their self-descriptions showed common accounts: loss and attempted regain of identity, escape from domestic abuse including rape; from social isolation, loneliness and boredom. Sadly, however, the flight to freedom produced a paradox. Becoming addicted and in serious financial debt seriously restricted the women's autonomy. The conclusion is that more research exposure is needed for individuals to be able to recognise their behaviour in context and gain or regain their sense of autonomy.

AB  - Background: Problem gambling not only impacts those directly involved, but also the concerned significant others (CSOs) of problem gamblers. The aims of this study were to investigate the proportion of male and female CSOs at the population level; to investigate who the CSOs were concerned about; and to investigate sociodemographic factors, gender differences, gambling behaviour, and health and well-being among CSOs and non-CSOs.
   Methods: The data (n = 4484) were based on a cross-sectional population study. Structured telephone interviews were conducted in 2011-2012. The data were weighted based on age, gender and residency. The respondents were defined as CSOs if they reported that at least one of their significant others (father, mother, sister/brother, grandparent, spouse, own child/children, close friend) had had gambling problems. Statistical significance was determined by chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests, and logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Altogether, 19.3% of the respondents were identified as CSOs. Most commonly, the problem gambler was a close friend (12.4%) of the CSO. The percentage of close friends having a gambling problem was larger among male CSOs (14.4%) compared with female CSOs (10.3%; p <= 0.001), while the percentage of partners with gambling problem was larger among females (2.6%) than among males (0.8%; p <= 0.001). In the best fitting model, the odds ratio (95% CI) of being a male CSO was 2.03 (1.24-3.31) for past-year gambling problems, 1.46 (1.08-1.97) for loneliness and 1.78 (1.38-2.29) for risky alcohol consumption. The odds ratio (95% CI) of being a female CSO was 1.51 (1.09-2.08) for past-year gambling involvement, 3.05 (1.18-7.90) for past-year gambling problems, 2.21 (1.24-3.93) for mental health problems, 1.39 (1.03-1.89) for loneliness and 1.97 (1.43-2.71) for daily smoking.
   Conclusions: CSOs of problem gamblers often experience cumulating problems such as their own risky gambling behaviour, health problems and other addictive disorders. The clearest gender difference was seen in smoking by CSO. In order to develop efficient and targeted support and services for CSOs, it is necessary to understand the correlates related to different subgroups of CSOs.

AB  - Gender differences in pathological gambling disorder (PGD) have received little investigation. This study was constructed to detail the demographic and phenomenological differences in men and women with PGD. We assessed gender differences in 131 subjects with PGD who were evaluated in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical features of PGD, and treatment history. Seventy-eight (60%) subjects were women, and 53 (40%) were men. Men had an earlier age of onset of gambling behavior, while women progressed to pathological gambling sooner after beginning to gamble. In terms of gambling behavior, men were more likely to engage in blackjack, cards, sporting events, and the track, whereas women played slot machines and bingo. Women reported that loneliness was the major trigger to gambling, while men were more likely to gamble secondary to sensory stimuli. Although men were as likely as women to have filed bankruptcy because of gambling, women were more likely to have written bad checks and men were more likely to have lost significant savings. Both groups were equally likely to seek treatment, but Gamblers Anonymous (GA) and outpatient therapy were reported equally ineffective in reducing gambling symptoms. There appear to be some gender differences in the clinical features of PGD, and these differences may have treatment implications. Copyright (C) 2002 by WB. Saunders Company.

AB  - Gambling is a relatively common activity in the Nordic countries, while the incidence and prevalence of problem gambling is relatively stable in this context. Social networks and relationships (e.g., gambling activities among family members and peers) have been put forward as relevant factors to consider when monitoring the epidemiological pathways in regard to gambling and problem gambling. The research on gambling and functional or qualitative aspect of networks and relationships (here labelled psychosocial factors), is however an important emerging area, warranting a synthesis of the evidence. We systematically reviewed the evidence on psychosocial risk factors in relation to gambling and problem gambling in Nordic gambling research. Included articles were identified through systematic searches in 10 scientific databases, covering the time period January 2000-July 2019. Following a systematic screening procedure, the final data set consisted of 21 original studies applying various statistical, interview or narrative methods. The review highlights both less researched psychosocial phenomena and also synthesises the evidence on the most commonly featured psychosocial factors in the included publications - loneliness and social support - evidencing conflicting findings in relation to gambling activities and problem gambling. Although few studies carried evidence to corroborate causal inferences, the risk factors and related epidemiological pathways we identify highlight focal areas that should be considered in both future prevention research and practice, broadening the arena for prevention strategies targeting new health challenges.

AB  - Background: To inform clinical treatment and preventative efforts, there is an important need to understand the pathways to late-life gambling disorder. Aims: This study assesses the association between age-related physical health, social networks, and problem gambling in adults aged over 65 years and assesses the mediating role of affective disorders in this association. Methods: The sample comprised 595 older adults (mean age: 74.4 years, range: 65-94 years; 77.1% female) who were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to assess physical frailty, geriatric pain, loneliness, geriatric depression, geriatric anxiety, and problem gambling. Results: Pathway analysis demonstrated associations between these variables and gambling problems, providing a good fit for the data, but that critically these relationships were mediated by both anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusions: This study indicates that late-life problem gambling may develop as vulnerable individuals gamble to escape anxiety and depression consequent to deteriorating physical well-being and social support. When individuals develop late-life problem gambling, it is recommended that the treatment primarily focuses upon targeting and replacing avoidant coping approaches.

AB  - The most commonly applied conceptual approach for excessive Internet use has been as a behavioral addiction, similar to pathological or problem gambling. In order to contribute to the understanding of Internet dependence as a disorder resembling problem gambling, the current study aimed to examine the relationship between problem gambling and Internet dependence and the degree to which psychological factors associated with problem gambling are relevant to the study of Internet dependence. The factors of depression, anxiety, student stressors, loneliness, and social support were examined in a sample of university students from several Australian universities. The findings revealed that there is no overlap between the populations reporting problem gambling and Internet dependence, but that individuals with these disorders report similar psychological profiles. Although requiring replication with larger community samples and longitudinal designs, these preliminary findings suggest that problem gambling and Internet dependence may be separate disorders with common underlying etiologies or consequences. The implications of the findings in relation to the conceptualization and management of these disorders are briefly discussed.

AB  - This article discusses how Western Kenyans imagine and plan their futures in contrasting ways with a focus on three different gambling practices observed in a cluster of patrilineal homesteads. While participating in the national lottery entails an understanding of the future as organized by other actors and as, in principle, projectable, I analyse the practice of regularly placing low-risk bets on football games as a consequence of negating the possibility to plan one's future in the long term. I lay bare a third conceptualization of the future by closely examining a betting 'system' one of my interlocutor had developed to hit a weekly jackpot. This conceptualization assumes that the future unfolds in ways that are, although very difficult to grasp, laid out in the present. The article concludes by distinguishing three ways in which gambling deals with the future, i.e. how it disclaims, upscales and invents the certainty of the future.

AB  - AIMS - This study aims to explore associations between structural and functional aspects of social networks and relationships (here labelled social ties) among individuals exhibiting problematic alcohol use and problem gambling, respectively. MATERIAL & METHODS - Data was collected in the 2011 Western Finland Mental Health Survey, a postal questionnaire survey applying a stratified random sampling approach. The survey response rate was 46.2% (n = 4624, age range 15-80 years). Problem behaviours were assessed using the CAGE and Lie/Bet tools. Logistic regression analyses were performed, with problematic alcohol use and problem gambling as dependent variables. Demographic variables, structural social tie factors (marital status, frequency of social contacts, engagement in association activities) and functional social tie factors (experienced loneliness, social support, neighbourhood trust, general trust) constituted explanatory variables. RESULTS - In this representative population sample, only one structural social tie variable, marital status, proved to be significantly associated with one of the outcomes (problematic alcohol use). Identical functional social tie variables were associated with both problematic alcohol use and problem gambling: individuals exhibiting the problem behaviours experienced higher levels of experienced loneliness and low levels of neighbourhood trust. Identified interaction effects with demographic factors highlight the complexity of links. CONCLUSIONS - Functional aspects of individual-level social ties appear to be more relevant when studying problematic alcohol use or problem gambling, similarly to other forms of mental health problems. The role of social ties as preventive or risk factors for problem behaviour development, as a part of problem behaviour maintenance or as a cessation and a recovery resource should be further explored, considering also interactions with demographic variables.

AB  - Background
   Problematic and pathological gambling have been linked to depression. Despite a high demand for treatment and negative financial consequences, only a small fraction of problematic and pathological gamblers seek professional help. The existing treatment gap could be narrowed by providing low-threshold, anonymous internet-based interventions. The aim of the present study was to examine the acceptance and efficacy of an online-intervention for depression ("Deprexis") in a sample of problematic and pathological slot-machine gamblers. We hypothesized that the intervention group would show a greater reduction in both depressive and gambling-related symptoms compared to a wait-list control group.
   Method
   A total of 140 individuals with self-reported gambling and mood problems were randomly allocated either to the intervention group or to a wait-list control group. After 8 weeks, all participants were invited for re-assessment. The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) served as the primary outcome assessment. Problematic gambling was measured with the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS) and the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS). The trial is registered with the German Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS00013888).
   Results
   ITT analyses showed that the intervention led to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms as well as gambling-related symptoms compared to the control group, with moderate to strong effect sizes. PP analyses failed to yield significant results due to high rates of non-completion and limited statistical power. Moderator analyses indicated that Deprexis was particularly beneficial in reducing problematic gambling for those scoring high on baseline gambling-related symptoms and for those who gamble due to loneliness.
   Discussion
   Results of the present study suggest that Deprexis might be a useful adjunct to traditional interventions for the treatment of problematic gambling. The potential of internet-based interventions that are more targeted at issues specific to gambling should be evaluated in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although gambling disorder is prevalent and functionally impairing, no FDA-approved medications exist for its treatment. The ability of clinical trials to detect the benefits of active treatment has been hindered by an unusually high placebo response. Virtually nothing is known about baseline clinical characteristics that might predict placebo response in those with gambling disorder.
   METHODS: Participants (N = 152) assigned to placebo were pooled from multiple double-blind trials of gambling disorder. Participants were classified as placebo responders or non-responders based on a cut-off of 35% reduction in symptom severity on the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale. Baseline group differences were characterized using t tests and equivalent non-parametric tests as appropriate.
   RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of individuals assigned to placebo showed a significant clinical response. Compared with non-responders, placebo responders remained in treatment for significantly longer, were more likely to report "enjoyment" as a trigger for gambling, and were less likely to state that "boredom" or "loneliness" triggered their gambling. Placebo responders and non-responders did not differ significantly in age, sex, age at symptom onset, baseline symptom severity, comorbidities, or likelihood of having received a previous treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of placebo response for gambling disorder appear markedly different from those reported for other mental illnesses.

AB  - Studies exploring excessive Internet use and gambling are rapidly expanding concerns regarding its impact on mental health, especially in young people due to the increased prevalence of Internet and gambling addictions. Research suggests that perceived peer support plays a significant role in adolescents' psychological well-being. However, no empirical study has dealt with the mediating effect of perceived peer support on the relationship between Internet and gambling addictions and psychological well-being. Thus, the present study aimed to examine whether perceived peer support mediates the relation between Internet and gambling addictions and psychological well-being of adolescents. A sample of 347 Iranian adolescents aged 14 to 18 (Mean age 16.14, 50.4% male) who were studying in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia participated in this study. Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS), Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS), Six-item Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ6), and The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) were used to collect data. Mediation analyses showed a significant indirect effect of compulsive Internet use and problem gambling on psychological well-being through perceived peer support. The total effects of compulsive Internet use and problem gambling on psychological well-being were negative. This study implies the significance of strengthening the knowledge about the impact of peer relationships among adolescents.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the social representations of different institutional leaders regarding the casino customers, their main motivations and role of the casino in daily life. The methodology was qualitative - phenomenological using semi-structured interviews. Participants were eight leaders of religious, political, and mental health institutions, and government officials. The results show that adult women are represented as the group with greater presence in the casinos. Loneliness and pathological gambling are part of the social representation of the players, with variations according to the institution that the leaders represent. The relevance of generating investigative processes that expand the concept of the games in casinos and impact on public health policies and socioeconomic development is discussed.

AB  - Objectives: Online platforms enable real-time trading activities that are similar to those of gambling. This study aimed to investigate the associations of traditional investing, real-time stock trading, and cryp-tocurrency trading with excessive behavior and mental health problems.
   Study design: This was a cross-sectional population-based survey.
   Methods: The participants were Finnish people aged 18-75 years (N 1/4 1530, 50.33% male). Survey asked about monthly regular investing, real-time stock-trading platform use, and cryptocurrency trading. The study had measures for excessive behavior: gambling (Problem Gambling Severity Index), gaming (Internet Gaming Disorder Test), internet use (Compulsive Internet Use Scale), and alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). Psychological distress (Mental Health Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), COVID-19 anxiety, and perceived loneliness were also measured. Background factors included sociodemographic variables, instant loan taking, and involvement in social media identity bubbles (Identity Bubble Reinforcement Scale). Multivariate analyses were conducted with regression analysis.
   Results: Within the sample, 22.29% were categorized into monthly regular investors only, 3.01% were investors using real-time stock-trading platforms, and 3.59% were cryptomarket traders. Real-time stock-trading platform use and cryptocurrency trading were associated with younger age and male gender. Cryptomarket traders were more likely to have an immigrant background and have taken instant loans. Both real-time stock-trading platform use and cryptomarket trading were associated with higher excessive behavior. Cryptomarket traders especially reported higher excessive gambling, gaming, and internet use than others. Cryptomarket traders reported also higher psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness.
   Conclusions: Regular investing is not a risk factor for excessive behavior. However, rapid online trading platforms and applications were significantly more commonly used by participants reporting excessive behavior and mental health problems. The strong association between cryptomarket trading and excessive behavior in particular underlines the need to acknowledge the potential risks related to real -time trading platforms.

AB  - It is argued that problem video game use (PVGU) has similarities with behavioral addictions such as problem gambling. Unlike other addictions, the predictors of online PVGU have not been studied extensively. We applied a stress-coping model, previously developed for electronic gambling addiction, to PVGU. In this model, stressors lead to excessive behavior via maladaptive coping strategies involving the behavior. Video game players (N = 2261) completed an online questionnaire about their gaming habits, and self-report measures of depression, loneliness, social anxiety, and escapism and social interaction motives for gaming. Consistent with the stress-coping model, depression, loneliness, and social anxiety predicted levels of PVGU, these effects being partially mediated by escapism and social interaction motives for gaming. The pattern of mediation differed by gamers' preferred game genre in a way that suggested "First Person Shooter" games provide an escape from aversive states, while, in addition to providing escape, massively multiplayer online role playing games, which emphasize collaborative play, may also be supplementing or substituting for face-to-face social interactions.

AB  - Research suggests that individuals with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) do not have difficulty generating alternatives to social problems but choose more negative solutions, suggesting a deficit in decision-making. However, studies report no significant differences in risky decision-making on a performance-based task among individuals with and without NSSI histories. A limitation of these studies is that decision-making was only assessed at baseline. As individuals with a history of NSSI typically self-injure when experiencing negative emotions, decision-making ability may become impaired specifically in the presence of these emotions. The aim of the current study was to investigate decision-making ability among individuals with and.without NSSI histories both at baseline and following a distressing social exclusion task. We compared individuals with (n=48) and without (n=72) NSSI histories on the Iowa Gambling Task, a behavioral measure of risky decision-making, before and after exclusion or inclusion on the Cyberball task. Results indicated no significant group differences in performance regardless of condition. When participants were grouped by racial/ethnic minority status, results indicated that non-Hispanic White individuals with a history of NSSI exhibited deterioration in risky decision-making ability following social exclusion. Potential explanations for these findings and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Suicide rates in young people have increased in England and Wales since 2010. There are a range of possible explanations for this increase, and problem gambling has been suggested as a potential risk factor. We aimed to examine the association between suicidality (suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts) and problem gambling specifically for young adults in Great Britain, where gambling has become more widely available and normalised in the past two decades.
   Methods We analysed data from the Emerging Adults Gambling Survey: a cross-sectional, online, non-probability sample survey of young adults aged 16-24 years living in Great Britain, who were selected from a YouGov online panel. Participants were eligible if they had not taken part in any other YouGov survey on gambling in the past year. We examined associations between problem gambling (defined as a score of 8 or higher on the Problem Gambling Severity Index [PGSI]) and suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in the year before survey completion in a series of regression models, with and without adjustment for sociodemographic factors, alcohol use, video gaming, anxiety, loneliness, and impulsivity.
   Findings 3549 eligible participants completed the survey between June 25 and Aug 16, 2019. 24 (37.0% [95% CI 25.6-50.2]) of 62 men who had attempted suicide in the past year had survey scores that were indicative of problem gambling, compared with 38 (3.6% [2.6-5.0]) of 1077 men who had not attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts in the past year. 13 (14.5% [8.5-23.6]) of 85 women who had attempted suicide in the past year had survey scores that were indicative of problem gambling, compared with 25 (2.0% [1.4-3.0]) of 1184 women who had not attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts in the past year. The adjusted odds ratio for attempted suicide was 9.0 (4.1-19.7) in men with scores that indicated problem gambling and 4.9 (2.0-12.0) in women with scores that indicated problem gambling, compared with participants of the same gender with PGSI scores of 0.
   Interpretation Problem gambling appears to be associated with suicide attempts in both young men and young women. This association persisted after adjusting for anxiety, impulsivity, life satisfaction, and other factors, which suggests that other mechanisms, such as the severity and multiplicity of harms experienced, or gambling to cope with life stressors, might underpin this relationship. Young people with problem-gambling behaviours should be considered at risk for suicidality. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We investigated, using a cross-lagged design, the longitudinal association of bullying involvement and peer problems with affective decision-making in adolescence (ages 11 and 14 years) in 13,888 participants of the Millennium Cohort Study. Affective decision-making (risk-taking, quality of decision-making, risk adjustment, deliberation time, and delay aversion) was measured with the Cambridge Gambling Task, bullying involvement (bully, bully-victim, victim, or 'neutral' status) with self-report measures, and peer problems with the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In general, peer problems were associated with decision-making in the unadjusted model but not after controlling for confounding. However, bullying involvement was related to decision-making even after adjustment. Compared to 'neutral' males, bullies and bully-victims improved over time in risk adjustment, and bully-victims in deliberation time, too. In both sexes, bullies showed more risk-taking compared to their 'neutral' counterparts. It seems that bullies are more sensitive to reward (or less sensitive to punishment) than those not involved in bullying. The finding that male bullies show improvement in decision-making warrants further research. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject?
   In adults, decision-making deficits and social exclusion or rejection are linked In youth, only two studies have explored this link with gambling tasks measuring real-world difficulties in decision-making. Both studies were cross-sectional and small-scale. What does this study add?
   We explore this link in adolescence, using a large, general population longitudinal sample and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Bullies were more sensitive to reward (or less sensitive to punishment) than those not involved in bullying. Male bullies improved over time in risk adjustment, a finding that warrants further research.

Using a qualitative approach, 40 participants discussed this topic in three focus groups. Motivations were reported as: to socialize, to reduce isolation and loneliness, to combat depression through relaxation, to balance boredom with healthy living, to escape from pressures at home, to find entertainment that represents value for money, and to keep alert. Consequential risks were said to be: bingo as a sedentary recreation pursuit reduces physical activity and is a possible source of developing problems with gambling.

AB  - This paper interrogates the exclusionary politics of casino urbanism in Singapore, especially in terms of how this particular brand of urbanism reproduces disciplinary regimes through the uneven consumption of fun and leisure. Singapore's vision of becoming a world-class "state of fun" is accompanied by increasingly sophisticated measures of boundary making between global leisure citizens and the excluded others, often comprised of the working class and those deemed to be at risk or lacking self-control and responsibility. The evolving biopolitical borders coincide with the multiple borders set up around Singapore's casino spaces, ensuring the exclusive consumption of Singapore's casino urbanism by the wealthy few. The fun regimes help to normalize social exclusion, moralize disciplinary control, and give legitimacy to the new class of global consumers under the operations of the state-capital apparatus. This paper argues that exclusive casino urbanism has broader social and political implications on issues of equality, accessibility, and urban participation.

AB  - The Dark Web (i.e., the anonymous web or Darknet) contains potentially harmful COVID-19-related information and content such as conspiracy theories and forged certificates. The Dark Web may particularly attract in-dividuals who are suspicious about the pandemic, but there is no research concerning the use of the Dark Web as a COVID-19 information source. In this study, we investigated the role of COVID-19 skepticism, online activities, and loneliness in the use of the Dark Web platforms as a COVID-19 information source. The data (N = 3000) were gathered in April 2021 from 18 to 75-year-old respondents from Finland (n = 1000), Sweden (n = 1000) and the United Kingdom (n = 1000). The respondents were asked how often they had utilized Dark Web platforms (for example via TOR-network) as a COVID-19 information source during the pandemic. Self-reported measures of institutional trust, anti-vaccine stances, restriction obedience, online ac-tivities, and loneliness were used as predictors in the logistic regression model. Age, gender, and education were also included in the model. The Dark Web use was more prevalent in the UK and Sweden. There was an association between anti-vaccine stances and active Dark Web use in the UK and Sweden, while low institutional trust predicted use among Finnish respondents. In all countries, restriction disobedience was related to Dark Web use as a COVID-19 information source. Frequent online gambling, increased social media use, and loneliness predicted Dark Web use, and these associations were even stronger among frequent Dark Web users than occasional users. Younger age and male gender were also associated with Dark Web use. The unregulated nature of the Dark Web makes it a risky alternative to COVID-19 information, attracting individuals who are suspicious about the pandemic and overall active online users. Misleading information and availability of forged certificates on the Dark Web challenge official health policies, posing significant risks for both individual and public health.

AB  - This study applied constructs from a widely-utilized subtyping model in the field of gambling studies, the Pathways Model, to a sample of 118 patients with opioid use disorder receiving methadone-maintenance-treatment. Surveys were analyzed using latent class analysis (LCA) to examine whether the Pathways Model indicators distinguished class membership, with confidence band interpretation used to compare class scores, and multinomial logistic regression conducted to examine associations with other correlates. LCA fit indices supported a three-class solution: (1) 'opioid-related only' (55.9%), (2) 'personal trauma/emotionally vulnerable' (15.3%), and (3) 'impulsive/current psychopathology' (28.8%). Class 1 was characterized by lower scores on nearly all indicators. Class 2 was characterized by the highest scores for personal experiences with sexual, physical, and emotional abuse during childhood and interpersonal trauma, and high impulsivity scores. Class 3 was characterized by the highest scores on stress, depression, loneliness, and impulsivity. Classes 2 and 3 both had higher scores for witnessing community violence, opioid-related coping motives, and impulsivity than Class 1. Gender, age, opioid-related consequences, and social network substance misuse were associated with membership. Our findings generally demonstrate trans-diagnostic overlap with the Pathways Model, offering support for the model's translation to other addictions.

AB  - Until recently knowledge was limited with respect to clinically relevant excessive reward-seeking behaviour such as pathological gambling, excessive shopping, and excessive working which meet diagnostic criteria of dependent behaviour. To date there is no consistent concept for diagnosis or treatment of excessive reward-seeking behaviour, and its classification is uncertain. However, the high number of subjects seeking treatment emphasises the importance of a clear conceptualisation of the so-called behavioural addictions and their successful treatment. Excessive reward-seeking behaviour may be used to regulate negative emotions. We suggest that, comparable to drug addiction, excessive reward-seeking behaviour can alleviate negative mood states and may be used as an (inadequate) stress coping strategy at the expense of active coping strategies. In the course of a pathological development, behavioural addiction may become the only available behavioural resource to cope with challenging developmental steps or social stress factors such as loneliness or anxiety.

AB  - Purpose of review The COVID-19 outbreak profoundly influenced human lives on different levels. This narrative review aims to present recent data relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and internet use and internet-based addictive behaviours [problematic Internet use (PIU), Internet addiction, Internet gaming disorder, problem gambling or gambling disorder, social media addiction including smartphone use disorder, problematic pornography use, and compulsive buying]. Recent findings During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of Internet use and Internet-based addictive behaviours increased in all age groups. The COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures were been associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in the general population, especially among children and adolescents, which are the vulnerable groups for the development of mental disorders during the crisis. Furthermore, the fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' measures, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity increased levels of loneliness, PIU, and Internet addiction. Longitudinal researches focused on the negative impacts of Internet use in prolonged stress situations on mental health, vulnerable groups, and quality of life (QoL) are needed to help clinicians and policymakers to reduce adverse consequences. Prevention programs for Internet use and Internet-based addictive behaviours must be customized to meet the needs of children, adolescents, and adults. Also, treatment programs must be tailored to the needs of patients with different Internet-based addictions.

AB  - In late 1945, a group of outraged citizens in the small city of El Cerrito formed a "Good Government League" to challenge the gambling and liquor interests who controlled City Hall. In the next few years the League achieved all of its agenda: a city manager plan, civil service reform, and the end of wide-open gambling. A movement like this was fairly typical of the Progressive Era. But the city in question was not a turn-of-the-century metropolis like New York or Chicago. These events happened in the late 1940s in a small bedroom community located just to the north of Berkeley. Within a few years, El Cerrito transformed its reputation from "Little Reno" to the squeaky-clean "City of Homes." As a case study, the El Cerrito story is interesting for a number of reasons. Most importantly, it highlights how development in the San Francisco Bay Area has involved a regional periodization that differs from what we might traditionally associate with suburban growth. The city's Old West heritage was a major source of political conflict, while the activism of the city's new middle class contrasts with what sociologists called the politically quiescent "Organization Men" of the era's "Lonely Crowd." The El Cerrito experience also lends insight into why the Bay Area has remained politically liberal since 1945. The city's reformers embraced much of the language and platform of the turn-of-the-century progressives. But they also lived through the Great Depression and the Second World War, and desired most of all to make public policy that would ensure economic security and equal opportunity. Their emphasis on an active public sector left a legacy that can still be felt today.

AB  - Research evidence suggests that professional players across a variety of sports may be at greater risk of developing addictions and other mental illnesses than the general population, both during and post-career. In this paper, we report findings from a larger project on the experiences of career transition in UK professional footballers that provide some insight into this. Using an Interpretative Phenomenological approach, four ex-professional footballers who were attending the Sporting Chance Clinic for help with problems concerning alcohol and gambling were interviewed in depth about their experiences. Focusing on issues the players perceived to be relevant to their addictions, the data were analysed thematically, drawing on Van Manen's phenomenological method, and individual case histories were also produced. The analysis suggested that club culture was key to understanding the players' difficulties; a harsh, unsupportive psychological environment combined with expectations of manliness resulted in a culture of silence in the face of personal difficulties. Relationships within the culture of pro-football were fraught with anxiety and distrust, leaving the players feeling unable and unwilling to disclose their problems and feeling used and unvalued by their managers. The lack of supportive relationships in their clubs also resulted in loneliness and social withdrawal for the participants. We conclude with a number of recommendations for the governing bodies in professional football, clubs and individual players.

AB  - Stressors caused by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) contribute to increased addictive behaviors in the general population worldwide. Little is known, however, about addictive behaviors of people who have recovered a long time ago, even years, from substance use disorder (SUD). The goal of the present research was to examine the craving for drug use and addictive behaviors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, viewing of pornography, gambling, and shopping online) of people who recovered from SUD, before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: During one week of isolation imposed in Israel following the outbreak of COVID-19 in April, 2020, a self-report questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of 113 people who had recovered from SUD, aged 22-69, 78% men.
   Results Fifty-one percent of participants reported craving drugs during the isolation period and engaging in addictive behaviors. Significant differences were found in tobacco and alcohol consumption, gambling, and viewing of pornography online, before and after the outbreak of the pandemic, especially in participants who reported having engaged in these addictive behaviors to some extent before the outbreak. A hierarchical linear regression showed a significant explained variance (R (2)=44%, p<.001), with stronger feelings of loneliness and shorter length of time free from drug use being associated with stronger craving for drugs.
   Conclusions: The drug addiction treatment establishment should pay close attention and strengthen communication with people who recovered from SUD. It is necessary to develop real-time anti-craving and anti-replacement addiction interventions to prevent relapses.

AB  - Aims To adapt the four-dimensional Gambling Motives Questionnaire-Revised (GMQ-R) to measure the motivation for engaging in electronic gaming, and to validate the internal structure and investigate the criterion validity of the new Electronic Gaming Motives Questionnaire (EGMQ). Design and setting The GMQ-R was adapted to measure motivation for playing video games and the new instrument was tested on a sample of Norwegian conscripts selected randomly from the pool of conscripts who started their military service between 2013 and 2015. Participants The questionnaire was administered to all those who had played video games during the last 6 months and consisted of 853 gamers (86.8% men, mean age = 19.4 years). Measurements All participants completed the EGMQ, as well as other measures of gaming behaviour, gaming problems, boredom, loneliness and depression. Findings The confirmatory factor analyses showed that the proposed EGMQ (measuring enhancement, coping, social and self-gratification motives) displayed satisfactory fit and internal consistency. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that gender emerged as a significant predictor (P < 0.001) of all the dependent variables (variety, hours weekly gaming, loss of control and gaming problems) and the first step explained between 1 and 6.1% of the variance in the gaming behaviours. In the second step the four motivational dimensions explained an additional 5.8-38.8% of the variance. Coping and self-gratification predicted gaming problems (P < 0.001) and coping alone predicted loss of control (P < 0.001). The four motivational dimensions were also predicted differentially by indicators of psychosocial wellbeing, indicating divergent validity of the four motives. Conclusions The four-dimensional Electronic Gaming Motives Questionnaire is a valid instrument for measuring motives for gaming.

AB  - Background: Young individuals with visual impairment (VI), exposed to higher risky of social exclusion, might be more prone to Internet risky behaviours including electronic aggression.
   Objective: Different types of Internet risky behaviours and the average time spent online were investigated among students with VI. These behaviours were analyzed for the relationship with witnessing, perpetrating and becoming a victim of electronic aggression.
   Methods: A total of 490 special needs school students with VI answered a self-administered questionnaire. The average time spent online, different types of risky Internet activities and electronic aggression were recorded, as well as sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results: Male students downloaded software illegally, hacked, published and viewed sites with sexual content, and gambled online statistically more often than female counterparts. Concerning electronic aggression, more than half of participants were engaged as witnesses, every fifth student as a victim and 11.6% as perpetrators. Two sets of ordinal logistic regression analyses have shown that communication with a person promoting violence and an excessive amount of time spent online during weekends predicted significantly the risk of witnessing and being a victim of electronic aggression. Additionally, communicating with a person promoting violence and an excessive amount of time spent online during schooldays were associated with increased odds for engagement in electronic aggression as a perpetrator.
   Conclusions: Population with VI is prone to risky Internet use and likely to be engaged in electronic aggression. New instruments and preventive strategies need to be developed, as well as diagnostic tools tailored specifically to the needs of young people with VI.

AB  - In the past decade, considerable amounts of studies have explored the neural underpinnings of empathic response toward the positive and negative feelings of others, such as pain and social exclusion, in the field of neuroeconomics. In addition, empathic response of observing other's financial gains and losses have recently started to gain increasing attention in this interdisciplinary field. However, the effects of inequality-averse social preference on individuals' response toward other's gains and losses have not yet been clearly characterized. This work conducted an electrophysiological study with a simple gambling task to explore how inequality aversion matters in modulating neural temporal dynamics toward self and others' gains and losses using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs). The electrophysiological data demonstrated increased amplitude of P300 toward self's monetary gains and losses independent of advantageous and disadvantageous status. Intriguingly, subjects in the high pay group evoked more pronounced gain loss disparity of feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude toward others than themselves. Meanwhile, such a pattern was not observed among the subjects in the low pay group. Therefore, the current double dissociation results of FRN and P300 may indicate that advantageous status enhances subjects' empathic response toward others' pecuniary outcome, giving a direct electrophysiological evidence for the economic modeling on inequality aversion behavior.

AB  - Introduction: The study aimed to investigate the associations between skipping breakfast and various health risk behaviours and mental health in university students in 28 countries.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, 21,972 university students with a median age of 20 years from 28 countries in Africa, the Americas and Asia, replied to self-reported measures of breakfast consumption, health compromising behaviours, mental health measures and protective factors.
   Results: In adjusted logistic regression analysis, infrequent and/or frequent breakfast skipping was associated with inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, frequent soft drink intake, not avoiding fat and cholesterol, current binge drinking, current tobacco use, gambling, not always wearing a seatbelt, inadequate physical activity, inadequate tooth brushing, not seeing a dentist in the past year and having been in a physical fight. In addition, infrequent and/or frequent breakfast skipping was associated with depression, lower happiness, posttraumatic stress disorder, loneliness, short sleep, long sleep, sleep problem, restless sleep, sleep problem due to traumatic event, and poor academic performance.
   Discussion: We found evidence that skipping breakfast was associated with 10 of 15 health risk behaviours, all of nine poor mental health indicators and poor academic performance.

AB  - Social media occupies more and more space in the daily lives of contemporary young adults. As online interactions have become more common than face-to-face interactions, social media has started to majorly impact individuals' ways of living, communication, language, interests, and psychology. Even though social media and internet addiction are not defined as behavioral addictions among the DSM diagnostic criteria due to lack of scientific proof, its stages (conflict, relapse, etc.) reveal themselves as behavioral addictions like shopping or gambling addictions. The aim of this study is to indicate the psychological dimensions of social media addiction in young adults, to point out their significance, and to produce scientific proofs for the literature, which are needed. In processing the data, normality tests have been applied. Women are more addicted to social media for the purposes of mood modification and being occupied. Social media addiction levels increase alongside increases in the number of Instagram followers. In addition, fake account owners and stalkers are more addicted to social media than others. Meanwhile, a moderate, negative correlation exists between self-esteem levels and social media addiction. The correlation coefficient increases for users who have more than 500 followers in the categories of relapse and conflict.

AB  - Social neuroscience is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines tools from cognitive, cellular, and molecular neuroscience to understand the neural mechanisms underlying human interactions, emphasizing the complementary nature of different organization levels in the social and biological domains. Previous studies focused on the molecular/neuronal substrates of a variety of complex behaviors, such as parental behavior and pair bonding. Less is known about the various factors influencing interindividual differences in reward processing and decision making in social contexts, both relying upon the dopaminergic system. This review concerns (1) basic electrophysiological findings and recent neuroimaging findings showing that reward processing and social interaction processes share common neural substrates and (2) genetic and hormonal influences on these processes. Recent research combining molecular genetics, endocrinology, and neuroimaging demonstrated that variations in dopamine-related genes and in hormone levels affect the physiological properties of the dopaminergic system in nonhuman primates and modulate the processing of reward and social information in humans. These findings are important because they indicate the neural influence of genes conferring vulnerability to develop neuropathologies such as drug addiction and pathological gambling. Taken together, the reviewed data start to unveil the relationships between genes, hormones, and the functioning of the reward system, as well as decision making in social contexts, and provide a link between molecular, cellular, and social cognitive levels in humans.

AB  - Internet technology has facilitated the use of a wide variety of different activities and applications in online contexts. Despite a large amount of research regarding these activities including online social networking, online gaming, online shopping, online sex, and online gambling, very little is known regarding online eating shows called 'mukbang' (i.e. a portmanteau of the South Korean words for 'eating' ['meokneun'] and 'broadcast' ['bangsong'] that refers to online broadcasts where individuals eat food and interact with the viewers). The present study carried out a scoping review of the academic and non-academic literature (i.e. peer-reviewed publications, academic theses, and the print media) in order to examine the psychological characteristics of mukbang viewers and consequences of mukbang watching. A total of 11 academic outputs from different disciplinary fields (mainly peer-reviewed papers) and 20 articles from national UK newspapers were identified following an extensive literature search. Results from the scoping review indicated that viewers use mukbang watching for social reasons, sexual reasons, entertainment, eating reasons, and/or as an escapist compensatory strategy. Furthermore, mukbang watching appears to have both beneficial consequences (e.g., diminishing feelings of loneliness and social isolation, constructing a virtual social community,) and non-beneficial consequences (e.g., altering food preferences, eating habits, and table manners, promoting disordered eating, potential excess, and 'addiction'). Implications of the study and directions for future research are also discussed.

AB  - Objectives
   To combine social genomics with cultural approaches to expand understandings of the somatic health dynamics of online gaming, including in the controversial nosological construct of internet gaming disorder (IGD).
   MethodsResultsIn blood samples from 56 U.S. gamers, we examined expression of the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), a leukocyte gene expression profile activated by chronic stress. We compared positively engaged and problem gamers, as identified by an ethnographically developed measure, the Positive and Negative Gaming Experiences Scale (PNGE-42), and also by a clinically derived IGD scale (IGDS-SF9).
   CTRA profiles showed a clear relationship with PNGE-42, with a substantial linkage to offline social support, but were not meaningfully associated with disordered play as measured by IGDS-SF9.
   ConclusionsOur study advances understanding of the psychobiology of play, demonstrating via novel transcriptomic methods the association of negatively experienced internet play with biological measures of chronic threat, uncertainty, and distress. Our findings are consistent with the view that problematic patterns of online gaming are a proxy for broader patterns of biopsychosocial stress and distress such as loneliness, rather than a psychiatric disorder sui generis, which might exist apart from gamers' other life problems. By confirming the biological correlates of certain patterns of internet gaming, culturally-sensitive genomics approaches such as this can inform both evolutionary theorizing regarding the nature of play, as well as current psychiatric debates about the appropriateness of modeling distressful gaming on substance addiction and problem gambling.

AB  - Background and aims: Addiction has been reliably associated with biased emotional reactions to risky choices. Problematic Internet use (PIU) is a relatively new concept and its classification as an addiction is debated. Implicit emotional responses were measured in individuals expressing nonproblematic and problematic Internet behaviors while they made risky/ambiguous decisions to explore whether they showed similar responses to those found in agreed-upon addictions. Methods: The design of the study was cross sectional. Participants were adult Internet users (N = 72). All testing took place in the Psychophysics Laboratory at the University of Bath, UK. Participants were given the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) which provides an index of an individual's ability to process and learn probabilities of reward and loss. Integration of emotions into current decision-making frameworks is vital for optimal performance on the IGT and thus, skin conductance responses (SCRs) to reward, punishment, and in anticipation of both were measured to assess emotional function. Results: Performance on the IGT did not differ between the groups of Internet users. However, problematic Internet users expressed increased sensitivity to punishment as revealed by stronger SCRs to trials with higher punishment magnitude. Discussion and conclusions: PIU seems to differ on behavioral and physiological levels with other addictions. However, our data imply that problematic Internet users were more risk-sensitive, which is a suggestion that needs to be incorporated into in any measure and, potentially, any intervention for PIU.

AB  - The article highlights the psychological aspects of diagnosis of predisposition to addictive behavior, the results of a comparative study of personality of socially maladjusted adolescents who use and those who do not use psychotropic substances, as well as teenagers of a normative group. Areas of personality crucial for the diagnosis of predisposition to addictive behavior, components of personal predisposition to addictive behavior and the mechanisms of their formation are identified. It is shown that addictive behavior is behavior of a man with various addictions: gambling or gaming, social networking, alcohol or other drugs, etc. The essence of addictive behavior is that a person is seeking to change his mental state artificially. Regardless of the circumstances under which a man has started to use psychotropic substances, his motives, we can say about the onset of the disease only if this very purpose is found - to change one's mental state. The transition from social maladjustment to addictive behavior takes place under the influence of various negative factors; the most important one is lack of social and psychological correction. Propensity to addictive behavior is seen as a new formation of a personality, which determines readiness for the use of psychotropic substances. As addictive behavior is an extension of social exclusion, the personality traits of adolescents predisposed to addictions are similar to those ones that determine other kinds of behavioral abnormalities. New negative formations of a personality, such as bending in the development of motivational, emotional and volitional sphere and self-consciousness, are peculiar to both socially maladjusted adolescents in general, and young people with addictive behavior, in particular. The difference lies in the degree of development and the configuration of their combination. Complex diagnostics of propensity to addictive behavior reveals the children and adolescents who urgently need the application of psychological correction methods.

AB  - Background: International interest in adverse childhood experiences (ACE) is on the rise. In China, recent research has explored the effects of ACEs on health-related outcomes, but little is known about how ACEs impact the psychological functioning of rural Chinese youth as they make transition to adulthood.
   Objective: This study is aimed to assess the prevalence and psychological consequences of ACEs among a group of rural Chinese young adults.
   Participants and settings: 1019 rural high school graduates from three different provinces of China participated in this study.
   Methods: A web-based survey was used to assess ten conventional ACEs and seven other novel ACEs using the Childhood Experiences Survey. Using validated brief measures, six indicators of psychological functioning were assessed: anxiety, depression, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, loneliness, and suicidality. Descriptive and correlational analyses of all ACEs were performed, and multivariate regressions were conducted to test associations between ACEs and study outcomes.
   Results: Three-fourths of Chinese youth endorsed at least one of ten conventional ACEs. The most prevalent ACEs were physical abuse (52.3 %) and domestic violence (43.2 %). Among seven new adversities, prolonged parental absence (37.4 %) and parental gambling problems (19.7 %) were most prevalent. Higher conventional ACEs scores were significantly associated with poorer psychological functioning, and each type of new adversity was associated with one or more psychological problems.
   Conclusion: ACEs were prevalent among rural Chinese young adults and had deleterious effects on their psychological well-being. Further work is needed to address ACEs by developing culturally appropriate assessment practices, interventions, and policy responses.

AB  - Extending classic anthropological "idioms of distress" research, we argue that intensive online videogame involvement is better conceptualized as a new global idiom, not only of distress but also of wellness, especially for emerging adults (late teens through the 20s). Drawing on cognitive anthropological cultural domain interviews conducted with a small sample of U.S. gamers (N = 26 free-list and 34 pile-sort respondents) (Study 1) and a large sample of survey data on gaming experience (N = 3629) (Study 2), we discuss the cultural meaning and social context of this new cultural idiom of wellness and distress. Our analysis suggests that the "addiction" frame provides a means for gamers to communicate their passion and commitment to online play, even furthering their enthusiasm for the hobby and community in the process, but also a way for players to express and even resolve life distress such as depression and loneliness. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has recently included "Internet gaming disorder" (IGD) as a possible behavioral addiction, akin to gambling, warranting further consideration for eventual formal inclusion in the next iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Our study leads us to suggest that clinicians only sparingly use IGD as a clinical category, given that medical and gamer understandings of "addictive" play differ so markedly. This includes better distinguishing positive online gaming involvement-also sometimes framed by gamers as "addictive"-from other play patterns more clearly entailing distress and dysfunction.

AB  - Background: Anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use has been identified as a serious public health problem. Objectives: This study investigates the prevalence and correlates of AAS use among Norwegian adolescents. Methods: In 2012, a nationally representative sample of 2,055 17-year-old adolescents (963 males and 1,088 females) participated in a survey. The response rate was 70.4%. In addition to questions about AAS use, participants completed the Parental Monitoring Scale, the Family Relations/Cohesion Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test C, the Mini-International Personality Item Pool-Five-Factor Model, the Eysenck Narrow Impulsiveness Subscale, the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking, the Short-Form Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. They also answered questions about demography, gambling, smoking, snus, and narcotic use. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: The lifetime prevalence of AAS use was 0.30% (0.52% in males and 0.09% in females), while current prevalence was 0.25%. Moreover, 19.39% of the sample reported having an acquaintance who used or had used AAS. Having an acquaintance who used or had used AAS was significantly related to snus use, depression, aggression, extraversion, and conscientiousness in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Conclusions/Importance: Our findings suggest a high prevalence of AAS use among Norwegian adolescents and denote the significance of social, personality, and health factors in adolescents' exposure to AAS milieu.

AB  - Introduction: The experience of acute pain and pain-related fear negatively impact cognition and behavior; however, little research has examined their impacts on risky decision-making and effort. The present study investigated the effects of acute pain and pain-related fear on risky decision-making and effort during cognitive tests. Method: Levels of pain-related fear were assessed. Healthy participants (n = 146) experienced acute pain induced via cold pressor task, and then were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions to induce pain-related fear: Pain Threat (n = 36), Pain Threat with Control (n = 39), Cognitive Threat with Control (n = 34), and Control (n = 36). Participants then completed measures of effort (Word Memory Test [WMT], self-reported effort) and risky decision-making (Iowa Gambling Task [IGT], Balloon Analogue Risk Task [BART]). Results: Collapsed across condition, participants did not learn to decide advantageously on the IGT following an acute pain experience. During the early trials (1-40) on the IGT, participants in the Pain Threat condition made riskier decisions. Higher levels of pain during the cold pressor task predicted less risky decisions on the BART, and participants in the Cognitive Threat with Control condition made less risky decisions. Participants in the Pain Threat with Control condition self-reported lower effort on cognitive tests, yet no group-based differences were seen in WMT performance. Greater pain-related fear predicted greater self-reported effort and better WMT performance, but no effects were seen on decision-making task performance. Conclusions: The experience of pain and the threat of additional pain can lead to changes in risky decision-making and effort on cognitive tasks. This threat of additional pain could activate underlying pain-related fear, creating hypervigilance to and avoidance of pain that affects subsequent task performance. Implications for research and clinical evaluation of acute pain and pain-related fear are discussed.

AB  - Purpose While the COVID-19 virus has been spreading worldwide, some studies have related the pandemic with various aspects of accounting and therefore emphasized the importance of accounting research in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on society as a whole. Recent studies have looked into such an impact on various industries such as retail and agriculture. The current study aims at applying a sociological framework, sociology of worth (SOW), to the gaming industry in Macau, the largest operator of state-allowed gambling and entertainment in China, which will allow for its development during the COVID-19 pandemic to be charted. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the theory of SOW as a framework and collects data from various sources, such as the government, gaming operators and the public, to create timelines and SOW frameworks to analyze the impact of the virus on the gaming industry and the society as a whole. Findings Detailed content analysis and the creation of different SOW matrices determined that the notion of a "lonely economy" during a time of a critical event may be ameliorated in the long term through compromises of the different worlds and actors of the SOW. Practical implications Though largely theory-based, this study offers a thorough account of the COVID-19 incident for both the government and the gaming industry to reflect on and to consider new ways to fight against degrowth caused by disasters or crises. Social implications The SOW framework divides society into different worlds of different worths. The current study shows how the worths of the different worlds are congruent during normal periods, and how cracks appear between them when a sudden crisis, such as COVID-19, occurs. The article serves as a social account of how these cracks are formed and how could they be resolved through compromise and reconstruction. Originality/value This study is a first attempt to apply SOW to a controversial industry (gaming) while the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing. It offers a significant contribution to the social accounting literature through its consideration of the combination of unprecedented factors in a well-timed study that pays close attention to analyses and theoretical elaboration.

AB  - The aim of the 25 and Up (25Up) study was to assess a wide range of psychological and behavioral risk factors behind mental illness in a large cohort of Australian twins and their non-twin siblings. Participants had already been studied longitudinally from the age of 12 and most recently in the 19Up study (mean age = 26.1 years, SD = 4.1, range = 20-39). This subsequent wave follows up these twins several years later in life (mean age = 29.7 years, SD = 2.2, range = 22-44). The resulting data set enables additional detailed investigations of genetic pathways underlying psychiatric illnesses in the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS). Data were collected between 2016 and 2018 from 2540 twins and their non-twin siblings (59% female, including 341 monozygotic complete twin-pairs, 415 dizygotic complete pairs and 1028 non-twin siblings and singletons). Participants were from South-East Queensland, Australia, and the sample was of predominantly European ancestry. The 25Up study collected information on 20 different mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, substance use, psychosis, bipolar and attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder, as well as general demographic information such as occupation, education level, number of children, self-perceived IQ and household environment. In this article, we describe the prevalence, comorbidities and age of onset for all 20 examined disorders. The 25Up study also assessed general and physical health, including physical activity, sleep patterns, eating behaviors, baldness, acne, migraines and allergies, as well as psychosocial items such as suicidality, perceived stress, loneliness, aggression, sleep-wake cycle, sexual identity and preferences, technology and internet use, traumatic life events, gambling and cyberbullying. In addition, 25Up assessed female health traits such as morning sickness, breastfeeding and endometriosis. Furthermore, given that the 25Up study is an extension of previous BLTS studies, 86% of participants have already been genotyped. This rich resource will enable the assessment of epidemiological risk factors, as well as the heritability and genetic correlations of mental conditions.

AB  - After having struggled through the later years of the 1980s on a variety of uneven projects films, albums, even a collaboration with the Grateful Dead -Dylan records Good as I Been to You 0992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), two collections of unaccompanied traditional songs taken from several centuries and countries. These recordings, which seem to reground him in tradition, prepare a return to eminence. Dylan records a sequence of four records (Time Out of Mind, 1997; Love and Theft, 2001; Modern Times, 2006; and Together through Life, 2009) that carry him back to the top of the charts and garner praise and awards. These records dig deep into early twentieth-century American music, from the blues to the Tex-Mex conjunto. He recalibrates his image as well, appearing as a riverboat gambler with a broad-brimmed hat and a pencil mustache, performing, often on keyboards, in front of a small string band. He then turns, in the second decade of the new century, to a set of albums that draw on the so-called Great American Songbook-Cole Porter, Gershwin, Jimmy Van Heusen, Harold Alden, et al. He absorbs and updates the lonely-pose of Frank Sinatra, now aging and stoic, his voice cracked, suffering yet again the torments of love. In 2016 he is awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the barriers identified by people with disabilities in visiting casinos.
   Design/methodology/approach - Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 people with disabilities recruited from the investigator's clinical and community networks and personal referrals, and 18 casino supervisors and dealers who attended a casino diploma course offered by a university. The data were subjected to thematic content analysis.
   Findings - The results indicated that customers with disabilities faced physical, human and financial barriers during their visit to casinos. The six barriers that were commonly identified by all participants included: the physical barriers in game playing; insufficient facilities and accessibility; insufficient space; entrance blockage; poor staff service; and insufficient information and communication. There were two other barriers reported only by the participants with disabilities - social exclusion and financial barriers. Differences in comparison to the barriers that this market segment had encountered in other tourism contexts are also discussed.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample is limited to Macao participants and the sample size is small.
   Practical implications - This study offers recommendations for casino operators and government authorities with regard to specific physical, financial and interpersonal means to alleviate apparent difficulties faced by people with disabilities when visiting a casino.
   Originality/value - This study fills the research void in the literature regarding the barriers encountered by people with disabilities in visiting a casino. It also broadcasts the genuine voice of this market segment.

KW  - Hou Chunming
AB  - This article seeks to explore the different symbolic meanings of Nezha in Taiwan and their multiple implications in the socio-cultural context. Nezha, or the Third Prince (Santaizi (sic)), is a traditional protector deity in Taiwanese folk religion. According to folklore, Nezha was a rebellious trouble-bound child who eventually severed ties with his family. As a divine being, Nezha is regarded as the prototype of the rebellious youth, the "rebel without a cause," so to speak. The contemporary novelist Xi Song adapted the Nezha legend to a psychological fiction, titled Nezha in the Investiture of the Gods (1971), depicting the deity as a lonely hero. Perhaps it is Nezha's exceptional temperament, as described in mythology, that propelled him to be worshipped as a patron god by gamblers during the eighties and nineties, when the Mark Six Lottery in Taiwan was widespread but illegal. After the lifting of martial law, Nezha's courage in relation to rebellion continued to inspire artists such as Tsai Mingliang and Hou Chunming. Tsai's Rebels of the Neon God (1992) implies the adoption of Nezha as a metaphor to symbolize decadent teenagers in modern metropolitan Taipei. Hou's Anecdotes about Spirits and Immortals (1993) presents a strange Nezha, depicted as a rebellious infant in an avant-garde style. However, since the performance of Techno Nezha at the opening ceremonies of the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung, these earlier images of Nezha have been transformed into an amusing childlike figure, which has since become an icon of Taiwanese popular culture.

AB  - Background and objectives. - Internet is an essential tool for millions of people around the world, including in France where more than fifty million people use the Internet. Considering the increase of Internet use and the related consequences, many authors agree that excessive or improper use of this tool may lead to Internet addiction, a disorder which has been receiving increasing attention. Multiple theoretical frameworks have been used to define and evaluate this phenomenon, in particular substance dependence and pathological gambling. We chose to examine the Online Cognition Scale (OCS) which is a self-report questionnaire assessing Internet addiction based on a cognitive and behavioral model, with a multi- dimensional structure including four dimensions: diminished impulse control, loneliness/depression, social comfort, and distraction. While the psychometric properties of the OCS have been explored using English, Croatian, Turkish and Chinese versions, to date, the properties of the French version have yet to be examined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the French version of the OCS in a student population.
   Materials and methods. - A sample of 146 French university students aged between 18 and 38 years old (M = 20.96; SD = 2.65) completed the French versions of the OCS as well as another scale which measures problematic Internet use, and one which evaluates depressive symptoms. Participants completed the survey twice within an interval of 3 weeks.
   Results. - Confirmatory factorial analyses revealed that the 4-factor solution did not demonstrate satisfactory fit, however, the 5-factor model was found to better fit the data. Our results revealed that the scale scores demonstrated excellent internal consistency and a satisfying inter-item correlation (alpha = 0.89 and 0,92, MIC = 0.24 and 0.32). The OCS was significantly correlated with the problematic Internet use at both time points (r =.73 and r =.74, P <.01), with time spent online (r =.34 and r =.45, P <.01) and with depressive symptoms (r =.31 and r =.28, P <.01).
   Discussion. - The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the French version of the OCS in a sample of university students, assessing reliability and validity. Factors analysis revealed that a 5-factor solution including 27 items may be the most appropriate. Overall the scale revealed good psychometric properties. The internal consistency of the scale was consistent with previous validating results, which reported Cronbach's alpha ranged between .91 and .94. While the inter item correlations were satisfying, they were lower those previously found. The test-retest reliability of the OCS was good and satisfactory for all the factors, except for the Preoccupation and Withdrawal which revealed low values. These results are also lower than those found in other studies. A significant relationship was found between OCS scores and levels of depression as well as time spent online.
   Conclusion. - The French version of the OCS has satisfying psychometric properties and appears to be a useful multidimensional tool for the evaluation of Internet addiction. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To identify participants living at home and to estimate the risk of their transition into an institutional setting. DESIGN Prospective cohort study from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a nationally representative survey of US adults aged 65 and older. SETTING US national sample. PARTICIPANTS A total of 4712 NHATS participants were living at home in 2011. Residential transitions were described every year through 2017. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was transition time into an institutional setting. Primary predictors were social support factors (living spouse, lives with others, presence of social network, and participation in social activities). Covariates included age, sex, race, cognitive status, functional disability, multimorbidity, and Medicaid enrollment. A Fine and Gray hazards model estimated the risk of transition into an institutional setting, with death before institutionalization considered a competing risk. RESULTS In 2011, 4712 NHATS participants were living at home (78 +/- 8 y; 57% female; 80% white; 10% probable dementia; 7% with three or more activities of daily living disabilities). By 2017, 58% remained at home, 17% had either transitioned to an institution or died in an institution, and 25% died before institutionalization. In multivariable analyses that adjusted for age, sex, race, cognitive status, functional disability, multimorbidity, and Medicaid enrollment, participants were more likely to move out of the home into an institution if they had no social network (0 vs three or more people; subhazard ratio [sHR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-2.5; P = .003) or lived alone (sHR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.6-2.2; P < .0001). Older adults who enjoyed going to the movies, dinner, or the casino and visiting family or friends had a lower probability of institutionalization compared with participants who did not enjoy these activities or did not visit family or friends (adjusted sHR = .7; 95% CI = .6-.9; adjusted sHR = .7; 95% CI = .6-.9, respectively). CONCLUSION Policy initiatives should target older adults with limited social support to reduce the risk of moving from home into an institution.

AB  - This article uses the somewhat unconventional approach of psychogeography (understanding mental landscapes through the lived experience of geographic ones) to retrace the experiences in Nice of two women artists, the writer Rene Vivien (Pauline Tarn, 1877-1909) and the painter Romaine Brooks (1874-1970). While both women spent significant amounts of time in Nice, and therefore would appear to have something in common, a street level recreation of their living choices reveals profound incompatibilities. Vivien enjoyed the distractions of Belle Epoque Nice (the carnival, the casinos), while Brooks lived a more reclusive existence in the more 'Italian' part of Nice. These insights help explain why their affair in the first decade of the twentieth century was doomed and they failed to appreciate each other's artistic gifts.
