AB  - Empathy plays an essential role in determining how we understand and respond to others' emotional experiences. Previous studies have mainly focused on the influencing factors of physical pain and monetary loss empathy, as well as on their effects on subsequent feelings. However, little is known about social pain empathy and its influence on subsequent feelings, and the role of personal trait empathy. In this study, we performed Cyberball Games and gambling tasks to explore the effect of social exclusion empathy on subsequent feelings for gambling outcomes (others' losses and gains) by analyzing the brain activity of excluded and non-excluded players at the gambling outcome feedback stage. It was found that both feedback-related negativity (FRN) and theta-band oscillatory are more negative for loss outcome than gain for the excluded players, while these effects cannot be found for the non-excluded players. Furthermore, we only observed a larger P300 amplitude in the gain outcome than that of loss, regardless of the players' role. More interestingly, we found state social pain empathy is negatively correlated with the d-FRN amplitude under non-excluded conditions, while trait empathy is positively correlated with P300 amplitude regardless of the players’ role. These results provide insight into the different roles of state social pain empathy and trait empathy on subsequent gambling outcomes. Furthermore, different from previous studies, the current results show that d-FRN could reflect the state empathy discrepancy rather than the biomarker of state empathy.

AB  - Background: Voluntary self-exclusion is a well-known harm reduction intervention in problem gambling, although primarily in operator-specific or venue-based systems. A nationwide overall self-exclusion system ('Spelpaus') for all licensed gambling was introduced in Sweden in 2019. However, gambling in overseas companies despite national exclusion may be a concern in online gamblers. The present web survey study aimed to study self-reported self-exclusion and gambling despite exclusion in a nationwide multi-operator land-based/online exclusion system. Methods: Web survey in web panel members of a market survey company, carried out in May, 2020 (co-occurring with the COVID-19 pandemic). Past-year online gamblers (n = 997) answered questions about gambling patterns, gambling problems, psychological distress, self-exclusion since 'Spelpaus' introduction, and gambling despite self-exclusion. Results: Seven percent reported ever self-excluded at Spelpaus, and this was associated with younger age, female gender, gambling problems, and chance-based games and online poker. In logistic regression, Spelpaus remained strongly associated with past-year online casino gambling, gambling problems, and absence of past-year sports betting. Among those having self-excluded, 38 percent reported gambling despite self-exclusion, most commonly online casino. Conclusions: In online gamblers in a setting with a nationwide self-exclusion system, using this was associated with past-year online casino gambling and gambling problems. Gambling despite self-exclusion appears to be common, and more commonly involves online casino. Stakeholders should aim to increase rates of self-exclusion in high-risk online gamblers, both during and beyond the COVID-19 situation in which the study was carried out. Also, policy makers should use gambling regulation in order to decrease the risk of breaching self-exclusion online, such as through the prohibition of non-registered gambling operators. Further research should focus on in-depth analysis of the reasons for gamblers to enroll or not enroll in multi-operator self-exclusion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Loneliness is a public health concern with detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social anxiety (SA), cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting SA might be adopted to reduce loneliness. However, whether SA and loneliness share the same underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is still an elusive question. The current study aimed at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social avoidance in SA are evident in loneliness. We used a prestratified approach involving 42 (21 females) participants with high loneliness (HL) and 40 (20 females) participants with low loneliness (LL) scores. During fMRI, participants completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in social situations and responses to social feedback. Univariate and multivariate analyses of behavioral and neural data replicated known task effects. However, although HL participants showed increased SA, loneliness was associated with a response pattern clearly distinct from SA. Specifically, contrary to expectations based on SA differences, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social feedback in both groups. Moreover, while explorative analyses revealed reduced pleasantness ratings, increased striatal activity, and decreased striatal-hippocampal connectivity in response to negative computer feedback in HL participants, these effects were diminished for negative social feedback. Our findings suggest that, unlike SA, loneliness is not associated with withdrawal from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for SA should be adjusted when targeting loneliness.

AB  - Individuals use online communities for social networking and to find similar others. These communities can be attractive for individuals who are dissatisfied with their offline relationships. This article reports two studies analyzing the daily participation in online gambling-communities. In Study 1, self-reported measures were used to examine the role of loneliness, excessive gambling, and Internet use in daily online gambling-community participation. In Study 2, a gambling-related vignette experiment was used to analyze how characteristics of online behavior predict daily online gambling-community participation. Both studies are based on three samples collected among Finnish (N = 1200 and N = 230) and U.S. (N = 1212) adolescents and young adults. In Finland and the U.S., daily online gambling-community participation was more likely among compulsive Internet users and individuals who gambled excessively. In Finland, loneliness moderated the effect between gambling problems and daily gambling-community participation, but in the U.S., loneliness had no moderating effect. Preferring pro-gambling to antigambling content also predicted more likely daily online gambling-community participation. Online gambling-communities are attractive for young individuals who experience gambling problems and are interested in gambling overall. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Two studies tested whether social exclusion can increase gambling behavior. In Study 1, participants were asked to relive a socially painful instance, a physically painful instance or a control condition and were then presented with a real online gambling device (i.e., a slot machine). The results revealed that participants who relived a socially painful instance played longer on the gambling device. In Study 2, we induced actual feelings of social disconnection and manipulated slot machine anthropomorphization. The results revealed a significant interaction between inclusionary status and anthropomorphism in predicting gambling. More specifically, excluded participants gambled longer when presented with an anthropomorphized slot machine. However, the gambling behavior of excluded and included participants was no different when participants were reminded that slot machines are inanimate objects. Finally, positive and negative game experience mediated the influence of both inclusionary status and anthropomorphism on gambling. Overall, this research identifies another potential vulnerability produced by experiences of social exclusion, namely, gambling behavior. Implications for pathological gambling and future research directions are outlined. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Older adults represent the highest proportion of gamblers (Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation [OLG], 2012). Unpartnered older adults may be more socially isolated and lonely (Dykstra & de Jong Gierveld, 2004), thus more likely to be at risk for problem gambling (McQuade & Gill, 2012). We examined whether gambling to socialize or from loneliness and going to the casino with friends/family mediate the relation between marital status and problem gambling. Data from a random sample of older adults at gambling venues across Southwestern Ontario indicated that gambling with family/friends and gambling due to loneliness mediated the relationship between marital status and problem gambling. Relative to those married, unpartnered older adults were less likely to gamble with family/friends, more likely to gamble due to loneliness, and had higher problem gambling. Prevention and treatment initiatives should examine ways to decrease loneliness and social isolation among older adults and offer alternative social activities.

AB  - Les personnes âgées constituent, en proportion, la population la plus importante parmi les joueurs (Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation [OLG], 2012). Les joueurs célibataires seraient plus isolés socialement et solitaires (Dykstra & de Jong Gierveld, 2004), et plus susceptibles de s’engager dans le jeu, présentant ainsi des risques accrus pour le jeu compulsif (McQuade & Gill, 2012). Cette étude a examiné si des motivations sociales (jeu associé à la socialisation ou à la solitude) et le contexte social (sorties au casino avec des amis ou la famille) expliquent la relation entre le statut matrimonial et le jeu compulsif chez les personnes âgées. Nous avons aussi exploré si ces associations diffèrent en fonction du genre. Les données ont été extraites d’un échantillon aléatoire de 2103 adultes âgés de 55 ans et plus qui ont été contactés dans des sites de jeu du sud-ouest de l’Ontario. Ces données ont indiqué que le jeu en compagnie de la famille ou d’amis et le jeu associé à la solitude médient la relation entre le statut matrimonial et le jeu compulsif. Les personnes âgées célibataires étaient moins susceptibles de jouer avec de la famille ou des amis, comparativement aux aînés qui étaient mariés; ils étaient plus susceptibles d’utiliser le jeu pour contrer la solitude et leur profil de jeu était davantage compulsif. Les initiatives de prévention et de traitement devraient examiner les moyens permettant de diminuer la solitude et l’isolement social chez les personnes âgées, et offrir des activités sociales alternatives.

AB  - This study explores how partners of persons with gambling problems experience the family’s everyday life, focusing on family relations and parenting. Problem gambling creates a serious impact on household finances, social life and health, emotional and relational issues. Between 6 and 10 persons are directly affected by a person’s gambling problems. Despite this, research exploring how daily life and relations in the family is affected is scarce. A qualitative method was used to acquire a deeper understanding of partners’ experiences of everyday life, relations and parenting. In-depth interviews were carried out with nine female partners of problem gamblers. All nine women had been responsible for minor children. A thematic analysis was used to systemize the participants’ experiences. The results determined how living with a partner with a gambling problem is a lonely project. Partners of problem gamblers take on a lot of responsibility for daily life activities, household finances and parenting but experience little support from their partner. A general lack of knowledge and recognition of gambling as a problem, increases the loneliness, shame and burden. Despite gambling having a tremendous impact on daily life and relations, families receive little support. Taking over responsibility and becoming the one in charge, can be understood as ways of reclaiming dignity and gaining power albeit within limits. This duality needs to be considered when providing support to families. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - ABSTRACT This study applied constructs from a widely-utilized subtyping model in the field of gambling studies, the Pathways Model, to a sample of 118 patients with opioid use disorder receiving methadone-maintenance-treatment. Surveys were analyzed using latent class analysis (LCA) to examine whether the Pathways Model indicators distinguished class membership, with confidence band interpretation used to compare class scores, and multinomial logistic regression conducted to examine associations with other correlates. LCA fit indices supported a three-class solution: (1) ‘opioid-related only’ (55.9%), (2) ‘personal trauma/emotionally vulnerable’ (15.3%), and (3) ‘impulsive/current psychopathology’ (28.8%). Class 1 was characterized by lower scores on nearly all indicators. Class 2 was characterized by the highest scores for personal experiences with sexual, physical, and emotional abuse during childhood and interpersonal trauma, and high impulsivity scores. Class 3 was characterized by the highest scores on stress, depression, loneliness, and impulsivity. Classes 2 and 3 both had higher scores for witnessing community violence, opioid-related coping motives, and impulsivity than Class 1. Gender, age, opioid-related consequences, and social network substance misuse were associated with membership. Our findings generally demonstrate trans-diagnostic overlap with the Pathways Model, offering support for the model’s translation to other addictions.

AB  - Participation in gambling is rising in older adults. Indeed, in the coming years, engagement in gambling as a social activity is expected to increase more sharply in the elderly than in any other age group. Due to their exposure to powerful age-specific risk factors such as isolation, inactivity and failing health, older people are highly vulnerable to gambling-related problems. This study aimed to explore the existence of empirical clusters related to gambling habits in a sample of elderly participants from the general population. The sample included n = 361 participants, age range 50–90 years (mean 73.8, SD 8.4). Empirical clusters were identified through a two-step clustering analysis based on a broad set of indicators, including sociodemographic features, psychopathological state, substance use, life events, gambling preferences and scores on screening measures of gambling severity. The prevalence of GD in the study was 1.4%. Two clusters were identified: (a) cluster 1 (labeled as 'low risk of gambling problems', n = 265, 73.4%), which included the higher proportion of non-gamblers or individuals who engage only in non-strategic gambling, women, widowed, and lower levels of education (no individual into this group met criteria for GD); and (b) cluster 2 (labeled as 'higher risk of gambling problems', n = 96, 26.6%), which included the higher proportion of men, who reported both non-strategic and strategic gambling preferences (all participants diagnosed of GD were grouped into this cluster), older age, longer history of gambling, higher gambling severity, higher use of substances and worse psychopathological state. The elderly constitute a heterogeneous group with regard to gambling phenotypes. The results of this study may prove particularly useful for developing reliable screening tools able to identify older patients at a high risk of gambling problems, and for designing effective prevention and intervention programs.

AB  - Background and objectives: Internet is an essential tool for millions of people around the world, including in France where more than fifty million people use the Internet. Considering the increase of Internet use and the related consequences, many authors agree that excessive or improper use of this tool may lead to Internet addiction, a disorder which has been receiving increasing attention. Multiple theoretical frameworks have been used to define and evaluate this phenomenon, in particular substance dependence and pathological gambling. We chose to examine the Online Cognition Scale (OCS) which is a self-report questionnaire assessing Internet addiction based on a cognitive and behavioral model, with a multi- dimensional structure including four dimensions: diminished impulse control, loneliness/depression, social comfort, and distraction. While the psychometric properties of the OCS have been explored using English, Croatian, Turkish and Chinese versions, to date, the properties of the French version have yet to be examined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the French version of the OCS in a student population. Materials and methods: A sample of 146 French university students aged between 18 and 38 years old (M = 20.96 ; SD = 2.65) completed the French versions of the OCS as well as another scale which measures problematic Internet use, and one which evaluates depressive symptoms. Participants completed the survey twice within an interval of 3 weeks. Results: Confirmatory factorial analyses revealed that the 4-factor solution did not demonstrate satisfactory fit, however, the 5-factor model was found to better fit the data. Our results revealed that the scale scores demonstrated excellent internal consistency and a satisfying inter-item correlation (α = 0.89 and 0,92, MIC = 0.24 and 0.32). The OCS was significantly correlated with the problematic Internet use at both time points (r =.73 and r =.74, P <.01), with time spent online (r = .34 and r = .45, P < .01) and with depressive symptoms (r =.31 and r =.28, P <.01). Discussion: The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the French version of the OCS in a sample of university students, assessing reliability and validity. Factors analysis revealed that a 5-factor solution including 27 items may be the most appropriate. Overall the scale revealed good psychometric properties. The internal consistency of the scale was consistent with previous validating results, which reported Cronbach's alpha ranged between .91 and .94. While the inter item correlations were satisfying, they were lower those previously found. The test-retest reliability of the OCS was good and satisfactory for all the factors, except for the Preoccupation and Withdrawal which revealed low values. These results are also lower than those found in other studies. A significant relationship was found between OCS scores and levels of depression as well as time spent online. Conclusion: The French version of the OCS has satisfying psychometric properties and appears to be a useful multidimensional tool for the evaluation of Internet addiction.

AB  - Objectif: L’objectif de cette étude est d’évaluer les propriétés psychométriques de la version française d’un questionnaire mesurant l’addiction à Internet, l’Online Cognition Scale, chez des étudiants français. Méthode: Un échantillon de 146 étudiants âgés de 18 et 38 ans (M = 20,96 ; DS = 2,65) a complété à deux reprises, à trois semaines d’intervalle, l’Online Cognition Scale, ainsi qu’une autre échelle mesurant l’addiction à Internet, et une échelle évaluant les symptômes dépressifs. Résultats: Une analyse factorielle de l’Online Cognition Scale a montré qu’une solution à cinq facteurs apparaissait comme plus appropriée que la solution factorielle originelle. Nos résultats mettent en avant une très bonne consistance interne de l’échelle ainsi qu’une corrélation inter-items satisfaisante (α = 0,89 et 0,92 ; MIC = 0,24 et 0,32). Les validités concordante, convergente et de construit étaient satisfaisantes. Discussion: La version française de l’Online Cognition Scale présente de bonnes propriétés psychométriques et apparaît comme un outil multidimensionnel adapté à l’évaluation d’une utilisation problématique d’Internet.

AB  - Background and aims: Problem gambling is characterized by high stigma and self-stigma, making relevant measurement of the burden of the disorder complex. The aim of our qualitative study was to describe health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impacted by problem gambling from the patients’ perspective. Methods: We conducted 6 focus groups with 25 current or lifetime at-risk problem gamblers to identify key domains of quality of life impacted by problem gambling. A content analysis from the focus groups data was conducted using Alceste© software, using descendant hierarchical classification analysis, to obtain stable classes and the significant presences of reduced forms. The class of interest, detailing the core of impacted quality of life, was described using a cluster analysis. Results: Thematic content analysis identified three stable classes. Class 1 contained the interviewers’ speech. Class 3 was composed of the vocabulary related to gambling practice, games and gambling venues (casino, horse betting, etc.). Class 2 described the core of impact of gambling on quality of life and corresponded to 43% of the analyzed elementary context units. This analysis revealed seven key domains of impact of problem gambling: loneliness, financial pressure, relationships deterioration, feeling of incomprehension, preoccupation with gambling, negative emotions, and avoidance of helping relationships. Conclusions: We identified, beyond objective damage, the subjective distress felt by problem gamblers over the course of the disorder and in the helping process, marked in particular by stigma and self-stigma. Four impacted HRQOL areas were new and gambling-specific: loneliness, feeling of incomprehension, avoidance of helping relationships, and preoccupation with gambling. These results support the relevance of developing, in a next step, a specific HRQOL scale in the context of gambling. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Online gambling has gained popularity in the last decade, leading to an important shift in how consumers engage in gambling and in the factors related to problem gambling and prevention. Indebtedness and loneliness have previously been associated with problem gambling. The current study aimed to characterize online gamblers in relation to indebtedness, loneliness, and several in-game social behaviors. The data set was obtained from 584 Internet gamblers recruited online through gambling websites and forums. Of these gamblers, 372 participants completed all study assessments and were included in the analyses. Questionnaires included those on sociodemographics and social variables (indebtedness, loneliness, in-game social behaviors), as well as the Gambling Motives Questionnaire, Gambling Related Cognitions Scale, Internet Addiction Test, Problem Gambling Severity Index, Short Depression–Happiness Scale, and UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. Social variables were explored with a latent class model. The clusters obtained were compared for psychological measures and three clusters were found: lonely indebted gamblers (cluster 1: 6.5%), not lonely not indebted gamblers (cluster 2: 75.4%), and not lonely indebted gamblers (cluster 3: 18%). Participants in clusters 1 and 3 (particularly in cluster 1) were at higher risk of problem gambling than were those in cluster 2. The three groups differed on most assessed variables, including the Problem Gambling Severity Index, the Short Depression–Happiness Scale, and the UPPS-P subscales (except the sensation seeking subscore). Results highlight significant between-group differences, suggesting that Internet gamblers are not a homogeneous group. Specific intervention strategies could be implemented for groups at risk.

AB  - Problem gambling rates in older adults have risen dramatically in recent years and require further investigation. Limited available research has suggested that social needs may motivate gambling and hence problem gambling in older adults. Un-partnered older adults may be at greater risk of problem gambling than those with a partner. The current study explored whether loneliness mediated the marital status–problem gambling relationship, and whether gender moderated the mediation model. It was hypothesised that the relationship between being un-partnered and higher levels of loneliness would be stronger for older men than older women. A community sample of Australian men (n = 92) and women (n = 91) gamblers aged from 60 to 90 years (M = 69.75, SD = 7.28) completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Problem Gambling Severity Index. The results supported the moderated mediation model, with loneliness mediating the relationship between marital status and problem gambling for older men but not for older women. It appears that felt loneliness is an important predictor of problem gambling in older adults, and that meeting the social and emotional needs of un-partnered men is important.

AB  - Aims: The aims were to compare past-year at-risk and problem gambling (ARPG) and other at-risk behaviours (computer gaming, risky alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking) by age and gender, and to explore how ARPG is associated with risky alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, poor mental health and loneliness in males and females. Design: Data from respondents aged 15–28 (n = 822) were derived from a cross-sectional random sample of population-based data (n = 4484). The data were collected in 2011–2012 by telephone interviews. The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI, score ≥ 2) was used to evaluate ARPG. Prevalence rates for risk behaviours were compared for within gender-specific age groups. Regression models were gender-specific. Results: The proportion of at-risk and problem gamblers was higher among males than females in all age groups except among 18–21-year-olds, while frequent computer gaming was higher among males in all age groups. The odds ratio (95% CI) of being a male ARPGer was 2.57 (1.40–4.74) for risky alcohol consumption; 1.95 (1.07–3.56) for tobacco smoking; 2.63 (0.96–7.26) for poor mental health; and 4.41 (1.20–16.23) for feeling lonely. Likewise, the odds ratio (95% CI) of being a female ARPGer was 1.19 (0.45–3.12) for risky alcohol consumption; 4.01 (1.43–11.24) for tobacco smoking; 0.99 (0.18–5.39) for poor mental health; and 6.46 (1.42–29.34) for feeling lonely. All 95% CIs of ARPG correlates overlapped among males and females. Conclusions: Overall, past-year at-risk and problem gambling and computer gaming seem to be more common among males than females; however, for risky alcohol consumption similar gender differences were evident only for the older half of the sample. No clear gender differences were seen in correlates associated with ARPG. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Loneliness and adapting to an unfamiliar environment can increase emotional vulnerability in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) university students. According to Blaszczynski and Nower’s pathways model of problem and pathological gambling, this emotional vulnerability could increase the risk of problem gambling. The current study examined whether loneliness was associated with problem gambling risk in CALD students relative to their Australian peers. Additionally, differences in coping strategies were examined to determine their buffering effect on the relationship. A total of 463 female and 165 male university students (aged 18–38) from Australian (38%), mixed Australian and CALD (23%) and CALD (28%) backgrounds responded to an online survey of problem gambling behaviour, loneliness, and coping strategies. The results supported the hypothesis that loneliness would be related to problem gambling in CALD students. There was no evidence of a moderating effect of coping strategies. Future research could test whether the introduction of programs designed to alleviate loneliness in culturally diverse university students reduces their risk of developing problem gambling.

AB  - Gambling is a relatively common activity in the Nordic countries, while the incidence and prevalence of problem gambling is relatively stable in this context. Social networks and relationships (e.g., gambling activities among family members and peers) have been put forward as relevant factors to consider when monitoring the epidemiological pathways in regard to gambling and problem gambling. The research on gambling and functional or qualitative aspect of networks and relationships (here labelled psychosocial factors), is however an important emerging area, warranting a synthesis of the evidence. We systematically reviewed the evidence on psychosocial risk factors in relation to gambling and problem gambling in Nordic gambling research. Included articles were identified through systematic searches in 10 scientific databases, covering the time period January 2000–July 2019. Following a systematic screening procedure, the final data set consisted of 21 original studies applying various statistical, interview or narrative methods. The review highlights both less researched psychosocial phenomena and also synthesises the evidence on the most commonly featured psychosocial factors in the included publications – loneliness and social support – evidencing conflicting findings in relation to gambling activities and problem gambling. Although few studies carried evidence to corroborate causal inferences, the risk factors and related epidemiological pathways we identify highlight focal areas that should be considered in both future prevention research and practice, broadening the arena for prevention strategies targeting new health challenges.

AB  - Background: Problematic and pathological gambling have been linked to depression. Despite a high demand for treatment and negative financial consequences, only a small fraction of problematic and pathological gamblers seek professional help. The existing treatment gap could be narrowed by providing low-threshold, anonymous internet-based interventions. The aim of the present study was to examine the acceptance and efficacy of an online-intervention for depression ('Deprexis') in a sample of problematic and pathological slot-machine gamblers. We hypothesized that the intervention group would show a greater reduction in both depressive and gambling-related symptoms compared to a wait-list control group. Method: A total of 140 individuals with self-reported gambling and mood problems were randomly allocated either to the intervention group or to a wait-list control group. After 8 weeks, all participants were invited for re-assessment. The Patient Health Questionnaire—9 (PHQ-9) served as the primary outcome assessment. Problematic gambling was measured with the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PGYBOCS) and the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS). The trial is registered with the German Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS00013888). Results: ITT analyses showed that the intervention led to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms as well as gambling-related symptoms compared to the control group, with moderate to strong effect sizes. PP analyses failed to yield significant results due to high rates of noncompletion and limited statistical power. Moderator analyses indicated that Deprexis was particularly beneficial in reducing problematic gambling for those scoring high on baseline gambling-related symptoms and for those who gamble due to loneliness. Discussion: Results of the present study suggest that Deprexis might be a useful adjunct to traditional interventions for the treatment of problematic gambling. The potential of internet-based interventions that are more targeted at issues specific to gambling should be evaluated in future studies.

AB  - Background and Objectives: International students comprise an ethnic minority subpopulation who may be at increased risk for the development of gambling problems. This study aimed to explore the psychosocial factors associated with gambling problems in international and domestic university students in Australia. Methods: One hundred seventy‐three (n = 173) university students (127 domestic, 45 international) completed measures of gambling participation, problem gambling, psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, perceived social support, loneliness, gambling‐related cognitive distortions) and English language difficulties. Results: Gambling participation, but not problem gambling status, was lower in international than domestic students. Only anxiety and cognitive distortions were associated with problem gambling in domestic students; and only cognitive distortions were associated with problem gambling in international students. International student status failed to moderate the relationships between any psychosocial factor and problem gambling status. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Future research is required to elucidate problem gambling risk and protective factors in this ethnic minority subgroup, with a view to guide culturally sensitive initiatives.

AB  - Background: To inform clinical treatment and preventative efforts, there is an important need to understand the pathways to late-life gambling disorder. Aims: This study assesses the association between age-related physical health, social networks, and problem gambling in adults aged over 65 years and assesses the mediating role of affective disorders in this association. Methods: The sample comprised 595 older adults (mean age: 74.4 years, range: 65–94 years; 77.1% female) who were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to assess physical frailty, geriatric pain, loneliness, geriatric depression, geriatric anxiety, and problem gambling. Results: Pathway analysis demonstrated associations between these variables and gambling problems, providing a good fit for the data, but that critically these relationships were mediated by both anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusions: This study indicates that late-life problem gambling may develop as vulnerable individuals gamble to escape anxiety and depression consequent to deteriorating physical well-being and social support. When individuals develop late-life problem gambling, it is recommended that the treatment primarily focuses upon targeting and replacing avoidant coping approaches.

AB  - Internet technology has facilitated the use of a wide variety of different activities and applications in online contexts. Despite a large amount of research regarding these activities including online social networking, online gaming, online shopping, online sex, and online gambling, very little is known regarding online eating shows called ‘mukbang’ (i.e. a portmanteau of the South Korean words for ‘eating’ [‘meokneun’] and ‘broadcast’ [‘bangsong’] that refers to online broadcasts where individuals eat food and interact with the viewers). The present study carried out a scoping review of the academic and non-academic literature (i.e. peer-reviewed publications, academic theses, and the print media) in order to examine the psychological characteristics of mukbang viewers and consequences of mukbang watching. A total of 11 academic outputs from different disciplinary fields (mainly peer-reviewed papers) and 20 articles from national UK newspapers were identified following an extensive literature search. Results from the scoping review indicated that viewers use mukbang watching for social reasons, sexual reasons, entertainment, eating reasons, and/or as an escapist compensatory strategy. Furthermore, mukbang watching appears to have both beneficial consequences (e.g., diminishing feelings of loneliness and social isolation, constructing a virtual social community,) and non-beneficial consequences (e.g., altering food preferences, eating habits, and table manners, promoting disordered eating, potential excess, and ‘addiction’). Implications of the study and directions for future research are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Gaming disorder (GD) has been widely examined in younger gamers, but scholars have yet to thoroughly investigate this phenomenon in a broader spectrum of adults. We performed nuanced analysis of the prevalence and associated factors of GD among three generations of Hong Kong adults, namely, Millennials, Generation X'ers, and Baby Boomers. Our study further examined the associations between GD and three mental health indicators (i.e., social anxiety, loneliness, and depression) and investigated the moderating role in such associations played by four demographic variables (i.e., gender, relationship status, education level, and generation). A community sample of 847 Hong Kong adults was recruited (39% male, mean age = 49.9 years, age range = 18–73). The estimated prevalence of GD was 8.3% in the gamer sample, and 2.6% in the overall sample, with significant differences in generation and relationship status between the GD and non-GD groups. All three mental health indicators were positively associated with GD, and relationship status and education level were found to moderate the association between social anxiety and GD. These findings reveal GD to be a mental health concern not only for Millennial gamers but also for older gamers, Generation X'ers in particular.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to compare the socio-demographic characteristics of non-problem gamblers, problem gamblers and pathological gamblers, to investigate the association between gambling related factors and perceived health and well-being among the three subgroups of gamblers, and to analyse simultaneously socio-demographic characteristics, gambling related factors and perceived health and well-being and the severity of disordered gambling (problem gamblers and pathological gamblers). Methods: The data were collected through a nationwide telephone survey in 2011. Participants were selected through a random population sample of 15-74-year-old Finns. From that sample, persons with any past-year gambling involvement (N = 3451) were selected for a subsample for the descriptive and inferential analysis in the present paper. Gambling was assessed using the South Oaks Gambling Screen. Statistical significance was determined by chi-squared tests. The odds ratio and effect size were computed by using multivariate-adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: The most significant socio-demographic characteristics (male gender, young age, education ≤ 12 years), gambling related factors (slot machine gambling, internet gambling) and perceived health and well-being (feeling lonely, smoking daily, risky alcohol consumption, mental health problems) explained 22.9 per cent of the variation in the severity of disordered gambling. Conclusion: Male gender and loneliness were found to be associated with problem gambling in particular, along with smoking and risky alcohol consumption. Mental health problems and risky alcohol consumption were associated with pathological gambling. These identified associations between disordered gambling, mental health problems and risky alcohol consumption should be taken into consideration when implementing screenings of disordered gambling.

AB  - This article examines portrayals of female gamblers in recent Hong Kong movies. The authors report that the depiction of female gamblers is very different from that of male gamblers in the movies made in the same period. Whereas the male gamblers are pitching a lonely and desperate battle against an evil opponent, the female gamblers portrayed in the movies are housewives or small-time players who gamble only for their personal gain. A generally negative overtone in portrayals of female gamblers was interpreted as a reflection of the traditional view that discourages women from gambling. The shift of gambling themes in the Hong Kong movies has been identified to reflect the most salient concerns among Hong Kong residents. Such changes are attributed to particular social and cultural changes in the community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Although gambling disorder is prevalent and functionally impairing, no FDA-approved medications exist for its treatment. The ability of clinical trials to detect the benefits of active treatment has been hindered by an unusually high placebo response. Virtually nothing is known about baseline clinical characteristics that might predict placebo response in those with gambling disorder. Methods: Participants (N = 152) assigned to placebo were pooled from multiple double-blind trials of gambling disorder. Participants were classified as placebo responders or non-responders based on a cut-off of 35% reduction in symptom severity on the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale. Baseline group differences were characterized using t tests and equivalent non-parametric tests as appropriate. Results: Fifty-one percent of individuals assigned to placebo showed a significant clinical response. Compared with non-responders, placebo responders remained in treatment for significantly longer, were more likely to report 'enjoyment' as a trigger for gambling, and were less likely to state that 'boredom' or 'loneliness' triggered their gambling. Placebo responders and non-responders did not differ significantly in age, sex, age at symptom onset, baseline symptom severity, comorbidities, or likelihood of having received a previous treatment. Conclusions: Predictors of placebo response for gambling disorder appear markedly different from those reported for other mental illnesses.

AB  - The current study explored specific stressors (loneliness and job stress) and coping strategies (problem-focused, emotional approach, avoidance, and religious coping) as predictors of outcomes relevant to problem gambling (problem gambling symptoms, gambling behaviours, and depressive symptoms). A sample of 217 frequent gamblers was recruited (a) using online advertisements (i.e., on classified sites, search engines, and Facebook); (b) using paper advertisements posted at problem gambling treatment centres; and (c) through a university student participant pool. Participants completed an online survey, which included an online version of the Gambling Timeline Followback (G-TLFB; Weinstock, Whelan, & Meyers, 2004). Six multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore the main and interactive effects of stress and coping variables on outcomes in the context of Wills' stress-coping model of addictive behaviour (Wills & Hirky, 1996; Wills & Shiffman, 1985). Generally consistent with previous reports, loneliness, job stress, and avoidance coping predicted higher levels of the outcomes, whereas problem-focused coping with job stress predicted fewer problem gambling and depressive symptoms. Emotional approach coping (EAC) and religious coping were introduced to the problem gambling literature in this study. EAC predicted lower levels of the outcomes when used in response to job stress, and it attenuated the relationship between loneliness and problem gambling when used in response to loneliness. Meanwhile, among individuals who endorsed some positive religious coping with loneliness, higher levels of this variable predicted more depressive symptoms. Negative religious coping in response to loneliness or job stress generally predicted higher levels of all three outcome variables, although endorsement of some negative religious coping with loneliness attenuated the relationship between loneliness and depressive symptoms. These results suggest a number of promising avenues for future research, particularly regarding the implications of emotional approach and negative religious coping for problem gambling. The present study introduced new coping variables to the literature and built on previous findings of bivariate correlations between coping and problem gambling by exploring these relationships in a multivariate context.

AB  - Background: International interest in adverse childhood experiences (ACE) is on the rise. In China, recent research has explored the effects of ACEs on health-related outcomes, but little is known about how ACEs impact the psychological functioning of rural Chinese youth as they make transition to adulthood. Objective: This study is aimed to assess the prevalence and psychological consequences of ACEs among a group of rural Chinese young adults. Participants and settings: 1019 rural high school graduates from three different provinces of China participated in this study. Methods: A web-based survey was used to assess ten conventional ACEs and seven other novel ACEs using the Childhood Experiences Survey. Using validated brief measures, six indicators of psychological functioning were assessed: anxiety, depression, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, loneliness, and suicidality. Descriptive and correlational analyses of all ACEs were performed, and multivariate regressions were conducted to test associations between ACEs and study outcomes. Results: Three-fourths of Chinese youth endorsed at least one of ten conventional ACEs. The most prevalent ACEs were physical abuse (52.3 %) and domestic violence (43.2 %). Among seven new adversities, prolonged parental absence (37.4 %) and parental gambling problems (19.7 %) were most prevalent. Higher conventional ACEs scores were significantly associated with poorer psychological functioning, and each type of new adversity was associated with one or more psychological problems. Conclusion: ACEs were prevalent among rural Chinese young adults and had deleterious effects on their psychological well-being. Further work is needed to address ACEs by developing culturally appropriate assessment practices, interventions, and policy responses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the extent to which motivations for women gambling were boredom, loneliness, and isolation. Research was conducted with a comparative study of female electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers and non-gamblers, matched for age, education, and geographic location. Women EGM gamblers did not differ significantly from the non-gambling sample in terms of loneliness, friendship satisfaction, or adequacy of social networks. However, a sub-group classified by the South Oaks Gambling Screen as problem gamblers were significantly more lonely than the rest of the sample. These women were also more likely to be involved in social networks where gambling was normative. Limitation of the research and need for a longitudinal study are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between severity of gambling problems and psychosocial functioning in older adults. Twenty-one current pathological gamblers and 10 current problem gamblers over 60 years of age completed the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and Social Provisions Scale (SPS). Compared with problem gamblers, pathological gamblers reported increased severity of gambling and family/social problems on the ASI; scored higher on the GDS, BSI, and UCLA-LS; and scored lower on the SPS. Although they were not seeking treatment at the time of the interview, three fourths of pathological gamblers and 30% of problem gamblers were interested in gambling treatment. These results suggest that severity of gambling problems is associated with increased psychosocial distress in older adults and that a significant proportion of older adults with a gambling disorder may be cognizant of their gambling problem and interested in treatment.

AB  - Aims: This study aims to explore associations between structural and functional aspects of social networks and relationships (here labelled social ties) among individuals exhibiting problematic alcohol use and problem gambling, respectively. Material & Methods: Data was collected in the 2011 Western Finland Mental Health Survey, a postal questionnaire survey applying a stratified random sampling approach. The survey response rate was 46.2% (n = 4624, age range 15–80 years). Problem behaviours were assessed using the CAGE and Lie/Bet tools. Logistic regression analyses were performed, with problematic alcohol use and problem gambling as dependent variables. Demographic variables, structural social tie factors (marital status, frequency of social contacts, engagement in association activities) and functional social tie factors (experienced loneliness, social support, neighbourhood trust, general trust) constituted explanatory variables. Results: In this representative population sample, only one structural social tie variable, marital status, proved to be significantly associated with one of the outcomes (problematic alcohol use). Identical functional social tie variables were associated with both problematic alcohol use and problem gambling: individuals exhibiting the problem behaviours experienced higher levels of experienced loneliness and low levels of neighbourhood trust. Identified interaction effects with demographic factors highlight the complexity of links. Conclusions: Functional aspects of individual-level social ties appear to be more relevant when studying problematic alcohol use or problem gambling, similarly to other forms of mental health problems. The role of social ties as preventive or risk factors for problem behaviour development, as a part of problem behaviour maintenance or as a cessation and a recovery resource should be further explored, considering also interactions with demographic variables.

AB  - As the availability of legalized gambling has spread, increasingly more older adults are participating in gambling activities. Although some forms of gambling are associated with negative factors affecting many aspects of life, for most older adults gambling remains a non-destructive recreational activity. In fact, previous research demonstrated that recreational gambling among older adults was associated with better mental and physical functioning and increased perceived social support. Taken together, these findings suggest that gambling is a complex phenomenon associated with a variety of positive and negative health outcomes. The goal of this study was to identify benefits older adults may derive from recreational gambling. Specifically, it was hypothesized that relative to older non-gamblers, older adults who gamble recreationally would report increased quality of life, increased satisfaction with life, decreased loneliness, and more perceived gambling benefits. Fifty-eight recreational gamblers and 58 non-gamblers, aged 60 and older, were recruited and asked to complete a packet of questionnaires. Results indicated that quality of life, loneliness and satisfaction with life were not significantly related to gambling status. However, recreational gamblers were found to perceive significantly more gambling benefits overall. Because the Perceived Benefits Questionnaire was developed for the current study, an exploratory factor analysis was also conducted. A three factor model was supported resulting in the retention of the following factors: Social/Emotional/Cognitive Benefits, Prominence Benefits, and Enjoyment/Entertainment Benefits. Recreational gamblers also reported significantly more social/emotional/cognitive benefits of gambling and enjoyment/entertainment benefits of gambling. These findings suggest that although gambling status may not be significantly related to aspects of quality of life, specific benefits are reported differently for recreational gamblers and non-gamblers when measured by a gambling benefits assessment tool. The direct assessment of benefits and the functions that these benefits serve may offer clinically useful information for problem and non-problem gamblers alike.

AB  - It is argued that problem video game use (PVGU) has similarities with behavioral addictions such as problem gambling. Unlike other addictions, the predictors of online PVGU have not been studied extensively. We applied a stress-coping model, previously developed for electronic gambling addiction, to PVGU. In this model, stressors lead to excessive behavior via maladaptive coping strategies involving the behavior. Video game players (N = 2261) completed an online questionnaire about their gaming habits, and self-report measures of depression, loneliness, social anxiety, and escapism and social interaction motives for gaming. Consistent with the stress-coping model, depression, loneliness, and social anxiety predicted levels of PVGU, these effects being partially mediated by escapism and social interaction motives for gaming. The pattern of mediation differed by gamers’ preferred game genre in a way that suggested 'First Person Shooter' games provide an escape from aversive states, while, in addition to providing escape, massively multiplayer online role playing games, which emphasize collaborative play, may also be supplementing or substituting for face-to-face social interactions.

AB  - Extending classic anthropological 'idioms of distress' research, we argue that intensive online videogame involvement is better conceptualized as a new global idiom, not only of distress but also of wellness, especially for emerging adults (late teens through the 20s). Drawing on cognitive anthropological cultural domain interviews conducted with a small sample of U.S. gamers (N = 26 free-list and 34 pile-sort respondents) (Study 1) and a large sample of survey data on gaming experience (N = 3629) (Study 2), we discuss the cultural meaning and social context of this new cultural idiom of wellness and distress. Our analysis suggests that the 'addiction' frame provides a means for gamers to communicate their passion and commitment to online play, even furthering their enthusiasm for the hobby and community in the process, but also a way for players to express and even resolve life distress such as depression and loneliness. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has recently included 'Internet gaming disorder' (IGD) as a possible behavioral addiction, akin to gambling, warranting further consideration for eventual formal inclusion in the next iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Our study leads us to suggest that clinicians only sparingly use IGD as a clinical category, given that medical and gamer understandings of 'addictive' play differ so markedly. This includes better distinguishing positive online gaming involvement—also sometimes framed by gamers as 'addictive'—from other play patterns more clearly entailing distress and dysfunction.

AB  - In his acclaimed 2000 book Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam documents a disturbing social trend of the broadest kind. Putnam cites a wide variety of data that indicate that over the past fifty years, Americans have become increasingly socially disengaged. In developing this theme, Putnam specifically cites the increase in casino gambling (and especially machine gambling) as evidence in support of his argument. Building on the empirical and theoretical work of Putnam, this exploratory article examines the sub-phenomenon of 'gambling alone' by exploring sample survey data on solitary and social gambling behavior among adults who reside in Las Vegas, Nevada. Specifically, to further understand these phenomena, a number of demographic, attitudinal, and behavioral variables are examined for their explanatory power in predicting solitary vs. social gambling behavior.

AB  - Problem gamblers often engage in few social activities other than gambling and post-treatment, can be left with considerable unstructured time and inadequate social skills. As relapse often occurs when the gambler is alone, removing or cutting back on gambling is unlikely to be a successful treatment strategy if recreational and social alternatives are unavailable. The Re(Making) Meaning project provided a structured re-engagement program for 30 participants considered at risk of relapse. In this nine-month, 18-event life-style enhancement project, offered as an adjunct to individual counselling, participants completed a range of gambling and social measures at commencement, 6 months, and 12 months. Substantial positive change in the Temptation to Gamble Scale, Work and Social Adjustment Scale, Self-Esteem, Anxiety, and Loneliness scales were achieved. It is recommended that this proof of concept study of leisure substitution for problem gambling is replicated in a controlled study to determine its relative effectiveness.

AB  - With gambling identified as one of the most popular social activities among older adults, and aging baby boomers representing a sharp increase in the number of adults older than 65 years of age, there will likely be a concomitant increase, in the coming years, in the number of older persons counting themselves among those who gamble. Due to the recent emphasis on the marketing of gambling toward senior citizens, newer research has focused on motivation behind gaming activities of older adults and the concern that they may develop a pathological gambling disorder. The majority of studies begin with the assumption that older adults are vulnerable and are thus at-risk for developing pathological or problem gambling due to factors common to later life such as illness, frequent and multiple loss, boredom, loneliness, and cognitive vulnerabilities such as Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. This dissertation challenges the assumption that gambling is inevitably a negative force in older persons' lives and shows that there are some instances when gambling may not be associated with negative outcomes. Although much research has been done on the gambling habits of adolescents and young adults, there is relatively little extant research on older adults who gamble. Because of population aging and the increased participation in gambling by senior citizens, this focus has gradually changed. However, the existing studies have limitations that might impact generalizability of findings or result in gaps in the research and discourse currently surrounding gaming phenomena in elders. This dissertation addressed certain limitations and gaps in existing literature by performing a secondary analysis of an existing data set using self-determination theory (SDT) as a theoretical framework and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) as a way to predict outcomes based on motivations and gambling behaviors. More specifically, an existing database that is a result of a large, national study, the Gambling Impact and Behavior Study (GIBS), was utilized to study gambling motivation, behaviors and outcomes for adults. The following research questions were addressed: 1) Which type of motivation—extrinsic or intrinsic—predicts better psychosocial outcomes in older adults who participate in gaming activities? 2) What impact do age, gender, and type of gambling have on the association between motivation and outcomes? Results suggest a strong association between gambling for extrinsic reasons and relationship difficulties and emotional problems for all adults (ages 18+) as well as a lower occurrence of relationship difficulties for older adults (65+) and women who gamble for intrinsic reasons.

AB  - Factors (demographics, gambling behaviors and comorbid problems) that may be related to the severity of gambling problems were investigated among 440 problem gamblers seeking treatment in an Australian outpatient treatment agency. The participants were divided into sub-threshold pathological gamblers (SPGs; N = 104) and pathological gamblers (PGs; N = 336) using Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) IV diagnosis of pathological gambling. SPGs were more likely to be separated/divorced, while PGs were more likely to be single. PGs tended to be younger than SPGs. Participation in lottery games was the only form of gambling that could distinguish between the two severity groups. No significant differences were found in participation in more than one gambling session per week and average amount spent per session on various gambling activities between the two groups. PGs were more likely to report financial, relationship, employment, physical, intrapersonal, other excessive behaviors (e.g., substance problems), leisure (e.g., loneliness, boredom) and legal problems than SPGs. Implications and limitations of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of the 25 and Up (25Up) study was to assess a wide range of psychological and behavioral risk factors behind mental illness in a large cohort of Australian twins and their non-twin siblings. Participants had already been studied longitudinally from the age of 12 and most recently in the 19Up study (mean age = 26.1 years, SD = 4.1, range = 20–39). This subsequent wave follows up these twins several years later in life (mean age = 29.7 years, SD = 2.2, range = 22–44). The resulting data set enables additional detailed investigations of genetic pathways underlying psychiatric illnesses in the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS). Data were collected between 2016 and 2018 from 2540 twins and their non-twin siblings (59% female, including 341 monozygotic complete twin-pairs, 415 dizygotic complete pairs and 1028 non-twin siblings and singletons). Participants were from South-East Queensland, Australia, and the sample was of predominantly European ancestry. The 25Up study collected information on 20 different mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, substance use, psychosis, bipolar and attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder, as well as general demographic information such as occupation, education level, number of children, self-perceived IQ and household environment. In this article, we describe the prevalence, comorbidities and age of onset for all 20 examined disorders. The 25Up study also assessed general and physical health, including physical activity, sleep patterns, eating behaviors, baldness, acne, migraines and allergies, as well as psychosocial items such as suicidality, perceived stress, loneliness, aggression, sleep–wake cycle, sexual identity and preferences, technology and internet use, traumatic life events, gambling and cyberbullying. In addition, 25Up assessed female health traits such as morning sickness, breastfeeding and endometriosis. Furthermore, given that the 25Up study is an extension of previous BLTS studies, 86% of participants have already been genotyped. This rich resource will enable the assessment of epidemiological risk factors, as well as the heritability and genetic correlations of mental conditions.

AB  - This article reports part of the qualitative findings generated from a pilot study to examine problem gambling in the ethnic communities in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, Australia. It provides an analysis of the specific perceptions and experiences of two women with gambling problems and of their two case workers. Each interview lasted from 1 to 3 hours; where informants could not speak English a bilingual interpreter assisted in the interview process. Four issues emerged from the life histories of two women: their self-explanation of their gambling behavior, beliefs about gambling, impact of gambling, and views on the availability of gambling services. These preliminary findings suggest that a more culturally appropriate service is necessary to address the specific needs and problems of gamblers and their families. The reasons for gambling for these Vietnamese women appear to be related to problems with the acculturation process and experiences of social isolation, boredom, and loneliness. The Vietnamese community places great emphasis on the importance of family and the role that families play in providing emotional, social, and financial support. However, the immigration process has changed, and in some cases severed, the important family network. Thus individuals with limited family support are more vulnerable to depression, loneliness, and isolation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: To adapt the four‐dimensional Gambling Motives Questionnaire‐Revised (GMQ‐R) to measure the motivation for engaging in electronic gaming, and to validate the internal structure and investigate the criterion validity of the new Electronic Gaming Motives Questionnaire (EGMQ). Design and setting: The GMQ‐R was adapted to measure motivation for playing video games and the new instrument was tested on a sample of Norwegian conscripts selected randomly from the pool of conscripts who started their military service between 2013 and 2015. Participants: The questionnaire was administered to all those who had played video games during the last 6 months and consisted of 853 gamers (86.8% men, mean age = 19.4 years). Measurements: All participants completed the EGMQ, as well as other measures of gaming behaviour, gaming problems, boredom, loneliness and depression. Findings: The confirmatory factor analyses showed that the proposed EGMQ (measuring enhancement, coping, social and self‐gratification motives) displayed satisfactory fit and internal consistency. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that gender emerged as a significant predictor (P < 0.001) of all the dependent variables (variety, hours weekly gaming, loss of control and gaming problems) and the first step explained between 1 and 6.1% of the variance in the gaming behaviours. In the second step the four motivational dimensions explained an additional 5.8–38.8% of the variance. Coping and self‐gratification predicted gaming problems (P < 0.001) and coping alone predicted loss of control (P < 0.001). The four motivational dimensions were also predicted differentially by indicators of psychosocial wellbeing, indicating divergent validity of the four motives. Conclusions: The four‐dimensional Electronic Gaming Motives Questionnaire is a valid instrument for measuring motives for gaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Ostracism (being excluded and ignored) can have a negative effect on basic, fundamental needs as well as on higher-order cognitive processes. Decision-making is one such cognitive process that is composed of both unconscious (Type I) and deliberative (Type II) processes. The present studies utilized multiple assessments of the effect of ostracism on Type I and Type II risky decision-making. In two studies, we manipulated ostracism using different paradigms (i.e., Cyberball and Atimia) and then participants completed multiple behavioral measures of risky decision-making. Results indicated ostracism, compared to inclusion, increased risky decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task and Game of Dice Task, but not the Balloon Analogue Risk Task. These results indicate ostracism likely affects risky decision-making processes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The most commonly applied conceptual approach for excessive Internet use has been as a behavioral addiction, similar to pathological or problem gambling. In order to contribute to the understanding of Internet dependence as a disorder resembling problem gambling, the current study aimed to examine the relationship between problem gambling and Internet dependence and the degree to which psychological factors associated with problem gambling are relevant to the study of Internet dependence. The factors of depression, anxiety, student stressors, loneliness, and social support were examined in a sample of university students from several Australian universities. The findings revealed that there is no overlap between the populations reporting problem gambling and Internet dependence, but that individuals with these disorders report similar psychological profiles. Although requiring replication with larger community samples and longitudinal designs, these preliminary findings suggest that problem gambling and Internet dependence may be separate disorders with common underlying etiologies or consequences. The implications of the findings in relation to the conceptualization and management of these disorders are briefly discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), or deliberate harm to the body without intent to die, is often performed in order to alleviate negative affect. Although individuals with an NSSI history can generate alternative behaviors, they choose to engage in NSSI, pointing to a deficit in decision-making. However, research indicates that individuals with an NSSI history do not perform worse than individuals with no NSSI history on a measure of risky decision-making at baseline. It is possible that decision-making deficits only occur in particular contexts, such as stressful interpersonal situations. The primary aim of this investigation was to examine whether changes in decision-making following social exclusion would vary as a function of NSSI status. Methods: Participants included 120 adults with (n = 48) and without (n = 72) histories of NSSI. They were assessed for demographic and clinical variables, level of distress, and decision-making ability measured by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to a social inclusion or exclusion condition on the Cyberball task, after which they rated their level of distress and completed the IGT again. Results: Individuals with a history of NSSI who were socially excluded reported more distress than individuals with a history of NSSI who were included; however, individuals with a history of NSSI were not significantly more distressed following exclusion than those with no NSSI history. Decision-making ability did not differ at baseline between individuals with and without NSSI histories, nor following the Cyberball task. However, individuals who described themselves as non-Hispanic White did perform more poorly on the IGT following social exclusion. Conclusion: Results of the current study supported research indicating that individuals with a history of NSSI perform similarly to individuals with no NSSI history on a behavioral measure of risky decision-making. However, results of the current study revealed that only non-Hispanic White individuals with a history of NSSI perform more poorly on a measure of decision-making following social exclusion compared to baseline. Given that this study was the first of its kind to use an experimental manipulation prior to administering a standardized test of risky decision-making, further research is needed to elucidate the role of decision-making in NSSI.

AB  - Addiction is much misunderstood. Women and addictive gambling even more so, and for many years women have suffered in silence. This book explores how lonely, troubled lives and damaging relationships can lead to the trap of problem gambling, and the anxiety and chaos whilst locked inside; it then offers realistic hope of a way out. With the significant increase in women gambling problematically, as reported by the British Gambling Prevalence Survey (Gambling Commission, 2010), Women and Problem Gambling aims to answer the often asked question, 'Who is to blame?' The text covers: the role of the gambling industry; the role of society; women's relationships with others and themselves; what 'hitting rock bottom' truly is. Case studies illustrate how gambling begins as harmless escapism, and how stressful and sometimes painful lives, combined with spiralling debts, can lead to desperation to avoid thoughts, feelings and the reality of life in chaos. Women can, and do, stop gambling—in this book Liz Karter shares anecdotes from clients and discusses therapeutic models and practical strategies to demonstrate how this is possible. Women and Problem Gambling is based on the author's research and theories developed throughout her extensive practice. The insights will be of value to anyone wanting to understand or work with problem gambling in women; from a woman with a problem herself, through to family, friends and any healthcare professionals or therapists involved in her care and treatment.

AB  - Research suggests that individuals with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) do not have difficulty generating alternatives to social problems but choose more negative solutions, suggesting a deficit in decision-making. However, studies report no significant differences in risky decision-making on a performance-based task among individuals with and without NSSI histories. A limitation of these studies is that decision-making was only assessed at baseline. As individuals with a history of NSSI typically self-injure when experiencing negative emotions, decision-making ability may become impaired specifically in the presence of these emotions. The aim of the current study was to investigate decision-making ability among individuals with and without NSSI histories both at baseline and following a distressing social exclusion task. We compared individuals with (n = 48) and without (n = 72) NSSI histories on the Iowa Gambling Task, a behavioral measure of risky decision-making, before and after exclusion or inclusion on the Cyberball task. Results indicated no significant group differences in performance regardless of condition. When participants were grouped by racial/ethnic minority status, results indicated that non-Hispanic White individuals with a history of NSSI exhibited deterioration in risky decision-making ability following social exclusion. Potential explanations for these findings and clinical implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - For the past 25 years, Jaak Panksepp, professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University, has waged a sometimes lonely battle against the purveyors of what he calls 'neurobehaviorism.' In his opinion, behavioral neuroscientists have simply replaced the environmental orientation of classic behaviorists, like Watson and Skinner, with neurochemical orientation. A consequence of neurobehaviorism is illustrated by the ongoing debate on the role of dopamine in addiction. In the past 25 years, the subjective state associated with brain dopamine activation has been variously described as pleasure, reward, reinforcement, drive, wanting, salience, and expectancy. An alternative approach to behavioral neuroscience is what Panksepp terms 'affective neuroscience.' This approach focuses to a greater extent on ecologically valid stimuli and spontaneous responses to assess the neural basis of a phenomenon. Although both the affective neuroscience and the behavioral neuroscience approaches examine behavior, a critical difference is that, in the former case, conscious experience is presumed to play a causal role. An important implication of an affective neuroscience formulation of gambling is that aversive feelings would be expected to accompany the absence of gambling in someone dependent upon it. Thus, if activation of the opiate system characterizes the experience of gambling, deactivation of this system would be predicted to characterize the experience of gambling withdrawal. Based on Panksepp's research on play and social attachment, gambling withdrawal would be expected to involve feelings of social distress, grief, and loss.

AB  - Gender differences in pathological gambling disorder (PGD) have received little investigation. This study was constructed to detail the demographic and phenomenological differences in men and women with PGD. We assessed gender differences in 131 Ss (aged 18-75 yrs old) with PGD who were evaluated in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical features of PGD, and treatment history. Men had an earlier age of onset of gambling behavior, while women progressed to pathological gambling sooner after beginning to gamble. In terms of gambling behavior, men were more likely to engage in blackjack, cards, sporting events, and the track, whereas women played slot machines and bingo. Women reported that loneliness was the major trigger to gambling, while men were more likely to gamble secondary to sensory stimuli. Although men were as likely as women to file bankruptcy because of gambling, women were more likely to have written bad checks and men were more likely to have lost significant savings. Both group were equally likely to seek treatment, but Gambler Anonymous and outpatient therapy were re ported equally ineffective in reducing gambling symptoms. There appear to be some gender differences in the clinical features of PGD, and these differences may have treatment implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Gambling touches on every aspect of personality, relationships, and impulse. Thus, the techniques used to treat adolescents who gamble may resemble the psychotherapy of all youngsters. This chapter will focus on a helpful core of essential skills and concepts that practitioners and administrators can use to influence the young personality with this addiction. The author states that gambling can perniciously lead adolescents into addiction because it acts synergistically with dissociative thinking. The intensity and seductions of the wagering behavior help to contain the loosely organized or fragmented mental state so typical of adolescence. Gambling helps to protect youngsters from the emotional pain that can result from their characteristically inadequate relationships and needy selves. Adolescents avoid the anguish of feeling lost, lonely and helpless through the use of a number of postures, alterations of consciousness, trances, internal struggles, self-deceptions, impulsivities, and reckless behaviors. However, these coping methods come at a considerable cost and cannot lead to a wholesom outcome. The greatest obstacle to therapy is confronting young gamblers with what they have been trying to avoid all along: integrated thinking. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the barriers identified by people with disabilities in visiting casinos. Design/methodology/approach: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 people with disabilities recruited from the investigator’s clinical and community networks and personal referrals, and 18 casino supervisors and dealers who attended a casino diploma course offered by a university. The data were subjected to thematic content analysis. Findings: The results indicated that customers with disabilities faced physical, human and financial barriers during their visit to casinos. The six barriers that were commonly identified by all participants included: the physical barriers in game playing; insufficient facilities and accessibility; insufficient space; entrance blockage; poor staff service; and insufficient information and communication. There were two other barriers reported only by the participants with disabilities—social exclusion and financial barriers. Differences in comparison to the barriers that this market segment had encountered in other tourism contexts are also discussed. Research limitations/implications: The sample is limited to Macao participants and the sample size is small. Practical implications: This study offers recommendations for casino operators and government authorities with regard to specific physical, financial and interpersonal means to alleviate apparent difficulties faced by people with disabilities when visiting a casino. Originality/value: This study fills the research void in the literature regarding the barriers encountered by people with disabilities in visiting a casino. It also broadcasts the genuine voice of this market segment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated among game machine users in a major city in Australia whether (a) more females than males exhibited symptoms of pathological gambling, (b) females reported higher guilt associated with their gambling, and (c) gamblers' self-assessment on several mood states was predictive of pathological gambling. A modified version of the South Oaks Gambling Screen (H. R. Lesieur and S. B. Blume, 1987) was administered to 104 users of game machines (44 males [aged 30–39 yrs], 60 females [aged 20–29 yrs]). Data indicate no significant sex difference in the proportion of pathological gamblers or in gambling-related guilt. Self-- assessment of Happiness, Propensity for Boredom, and Loneliness, significantly predicted scores on the South Oaks Gambling Screen, with Unhappiness a significant independent predictor of pathological gambling. Results may suggest that gambling acts to fill a need in the lives of unhappy people or that individuals who lack control over their gambling report higher unhappiness.

AB  - Four experiments tested the idea that social exclusion leads to (unintentionally) self-defeating behavior. Exclusion was manipulated by telling some people that they were likely to end up alone later in life. This randomly assigned feedback caused people to take irrational, self-defeating risks (Experiments 1 and 2), choose unhealthy, rather than healthy, behaviors (Experiment 3), and procrastinate longer with pleasurable activities rather than practicing for an upcoming test (Experiment 4). A control group, who heard that their future would be marred by frequent accidents, did not show these self-defeating patterns. Thus, the effect goes beyond just hearing bad news. Emotional distress did not significantly mediate these effects across 3 different mood measures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Ostracism is ubiquitous across the lifespan. From social exclusion on the playground, to romantic rejection, to workplace expulsion, to social disregard for the aged, ostracism threatens a fundamental human need to belong that reflexively elicits social pain and sadness. Older adults may be particularly vulnerable to ostracism because of loss of network members and meaningful societal roles. On the other hand, socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that older adults may be less impacted by ostracism because of an age-related positivity bias. We examined these hypotheses in two independent studies, and tested mechanisms that may account for age differences in the affective experience of ostracism. A study of 18- to 86-year-old participants in the Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences program showed an age-related decrease in the impact of ostracism on needs satisfaction and negative affectivity. A study of 53- to 71-year-old participants in the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) showed that ostracism diminished positive affectivity in younger (<60 years) but not older adults. Age group differences in response to ostracism were consistent with the positivity bias hypothesis, were partly explained by age differences in the impact of physical pain, but were not explained by autonomic nervous system activity, computer experience, or intimate social loss or stressful life experiences.

AB  - Argues that models of the nature and treatment of excessive gambling must incorporate behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and physiological findings. The acquisition of gambling behavior appears to be influenced by financial reinforcement and social factors. Excessive gambling also involves modifications in the individual's internal state, including loneliness, depression, and stress. Gambling may give the illusion of personal control. These effects might depend on the prior characteristics of the individual. Components of treatment should include removal of conditioned stimuli for gambling, establishment of alternative means of financial control, reduction of financial need, establishment of alternative means of controlling internal states, and reduction of negative internal states.

AB  - Objectives: Although there is growing international recognition of pathological technology use (PTU) in adolescence, there has been a paucity of empirical research conducted in Australia. This study was designed to assess the clinical features of pathological video gaming (PVG) and pathological Internet use (PIU) in a normative Australian adolescent population. A secondary objective was to investigate the axis I comorbidities associated with PIU and video gaming. Method: A total of 1287 South Australian secondary school students aged 12–18 years were recruited. Participants were assessed using the PTU checklist, Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale, Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents, revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Teenage Inventory of Social Skills. Adolescents who met the criteria for PVG or PIU or both were compared to normal adolescents in terms of axis I comorbidity. Results: The prevalence rates of PIU and PVG were 6.4% and 1.8%, respectively. A subgroup with co-occurring PIU and PVG was identified (3.3%). The most distinguishing clinical features of PTU were withdrawal, tolerance, lies and secrecy, and conflict. Symptoms of preoccupation, inability to self-limit, and using technology as an escape were commonly reported by adolescents without PTU, and therefore may be less useful as clinical indicators. Depression, panic disorder, and separation anxiety were most prevalent among adolescents with PIU. Conclusions: PTU among Australian adolescents remains an issue warranting clinical concern. These results suggest an emerging trend towards the greater uptake and use of the Internet among female adolescents, with associated PIU. Although there exists an overlap of PTU disorders, adolescents with PIU appear to be at greater risk of axis I comorbidity than adolescents with PVG alone. Further research with an emphasis on validation techniques, such as verified identification of harm, may enable an informed consensus on the definition and diagnosis of PTU.

AB  - Background: Anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) use has been identified as a serious public health problem. Objectives: This study investigates the prevalence and correlates of AAS use among Norwegian adolescents. Methods: In 2012, a nationally representative sample of 2,055 17-year-old adolescents (963 males and 1,088 females) participated in a survey. The response rate was 70.4%. In addition to questions about AAS use, participants completed the Parental Monitoring Scale, the Family Relations/Cohesion Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test C, the Mini-International Personality Item Pool-Five-Factor Model, the Eysenck Narrow Impulsiveness Subscale, the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking, the Short-Form Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. They also answered questions about demography, gambling, smoking, snus, and narcotic use. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: The lifetime prevalence of AAS use was 0.30% (0.52% in males and 0.09% in females), while current prevalence was 0.25%. Moreover, 19.39% of the sample reported having an acquaintance who used or had used AAS. Having an acquaintance who used or had used AAS was significantly related to snus use, depression, aggression, extraversion, and conscientiousness in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Conclusions/Importance: Our findings suggest a high prevalence of AAS use among Norwegian adolescents and denote the significance of social, personality, and health factors in adolescents’ exposure to AAS milieu.

AB  - My dissertation examines the importance of social capital in British marriage plots. While most people imagine heroines of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century novels embody virtue, I argue that many of the most innocent heroines speculate that sacrificing good assets can produce better marriages. These marriage plots demonstrate that a heroine's reputation must be somewhat damaged before she receives her reward of marriage. In other words, these novels do not uniformly represent, or recommend, the preservation of a heroine's good reputation; rather, they implicitly suggest that some spoiling occur before the consummation of marriage. I study how this curious freckling of heroines' reputations is desirable and financially advantageous. My first two chapters discuss how depreciated reputations become eroticized in early marriage plots including Pamela and Northanger Abbey. I focus on heroines who damage their reputations through flirtation, and I use Pierre Bourdieu's and Georg Simmel's theories to analyze social behaviors and the relationship between flirtation and value accretion, respectively. While early marriage plots often assume that a man who proposes to a woman with low social capital possesses a selfless love, by the Victorian period novels such as Jane Eyre and Daniel Deronda are more suspicious of men who desire to marry their social inferiors as well as more critical of the eroticization of feminine vulnerability. In my third chapter on Victorian novels, I connect society's growing awareness of marital abuse to fictional investigations of how loneliness renders women both appealing and especially susceptible to dangerous suitors. My fourth chapter considers the particularly troublesome capital that celebrity offers women, and I discuss the lives of real celebrities, such as Queen Victoria, and offer a reading of Trollope's Miss Mackenzie. My dissertation concludes by exploring how the patterns in established marriage plots survive in popular culture phenomena such as Downton Abbey. This dissertation contributes to the critical conversation in three ways. First, my claim that the heroine's speculation of social capital is characteristic of the marriage plot is one that brings novels into contact with the credit economy of their time. Although standards for modesty prevent women's speculations from being clearly viewed, they were important players in non-monetary exchanges. Secondly, this project highlights a unique period during which women undergo a trial of solitude that prepares them for an affective marriage (or indicates their readiness for that state). While this period of social exile has deathly connotations, the possibility of future happiness imbues even this dark phase with a certain pleasure, especially for readers. Lastly, this project brings a new focus to the significance of flirtation in British fiction and develops our understanding of the history of desire. While many scholars have written on fallen women and unrelenting flirts, there has been less interest in the flirtation of heroines who are not ultimately condemned. Old models of femininity create a space for play, romantic gambling, and even slightly bad behavior that can harm a woman's reputation. Thus, the concept of erotic femininity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was not simply virtuously staid but flawed, daring, and lively.

AB  - This dissertation is a story of men dealing with the challenges of poverty and homelessness in Tokyo, Japan. The homeless men I describe are mostly over fifty and face a daily struggle to secure the necessities of life. They live a few blocks from department stores selling luxury goods, which is ironic as Japan promoted itself as a classless society without poverty before the recession of 2008. This dissertation details how many men are resourceful and use a variety of strategies to survive and shows how Japanese society values older men who do not work. The dissertation revolves around the lives of the men in and around Ueno Park and focuses on two things: their homes, past and current, and their survival strategies. Discussing their homes includes how they became homeless and their relationship with their family. By home, I mean examining their current life in Ueno Park including how they built their home in the park. I discuss their relationships with their neighbors, fellow homeless men, and the authorities in the park. The hardships that many men experience, including health problems, facing death, loneliness, violence, and difficulties getting along with others show the difficulties in their lives. Survival strategies are crucial for homeless men. Their strategies include scavenging for aluminum cans, newspapers, magazines, cardboard, or copper wires: working a variety of jobs including those provided by welfare centers, a friend, or a coworker: and attending soup lines or applying for welfare. Since many of these strategies provide money, I examine common patterns of managing money. Some of the issues regarding money management that arose were not saving, living for the day, gambling, and living very frugally. Finally, the dissertation concludes by offering ideas for further research and policy recommendations for the Japanese government to improve the men's lives. I make several suggestions including the Ministry Health, Labour, and Welfare doing a better job of providing welfare for homeless men, giving them postcards so they can contact their families, and giving the men cash. Additionally, I propose a governmental agency to coordinate the various soup lines. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the past decade, considerable amounts of studies have explored the neural underpinnings of empathic response toward the positive and negative feelings of others, such as pain and social exclusion, in the field of neuroeconomics. In addition, empathic response of observing other's financial gains and losses have recently started to gain increasing attention in this interdisciplinary field. However, the effects of inequality-averse social preference on individuals’ response toward other's gains and losses have not yet been clearly characterized. This work conducted an electrophysiological study with a simple gambling task to explore how inequality aversion matters in modulating neural temporal dynamics toward self and others’ gains and losses using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs). The electrophysiological data demonstrated increased amplitude of P300 toward self's monetary gains and losses independent of advantageous and disadvantageous status. Intriguingly, subjects in the high pay group evoked more pronounced gain loss disparity of feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude toward others than themselves. Meanwhile, such a pattern was not observed among the subjects in the low pay group. Therefore, the current double dissociation results of FRN and P300 may indicate that advantageous status enhances subjects’ empathic response toward others’ pecuniary outcome, giving a direct electrophysiological evidence for the economic modeling on inequality aversion behavior.

AB  - Pathological use of computer and video games has been associated with indicators of psychosocial well-being, such as loneliness, low self-esteem, low social competence, and low life satisfaction. However, few studies have decisively demonstrated whether these indicators of psychosocial well-being are causes or consequences of pathological gaming. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a two-wave panel study among 851 Dutch adolescents (543 gamers). Causal relations were analyzed using autoregressive structural equation models. These analyses indicated that social competence, self-esteem, and loneliness were significant predictors of pathological gaming six months later. Thus, lower psychosocial well-being can be considered an antecedent of pathological gaming among adolescent gamers. Our analyses further indicated that loneliness was also a consequence of pathological gaming. This suggests that displacement of real-world social interaction resulting from pathological use of video games may deteriorate existing relationships, which could explain the increase in adolescent gamers’ feelings of loneliness.

AB  - Anticipating and seeking reward are among the primary motivators of human behavior. Indeed, reward seeking is central to a number of developmental processes, including learning. It is also key to maladaptive behaviors or disorders, such as addictive processes (e.g., drug use, gambling, and overeating). In this chapter, we propose that the need for social attachments is a key, but often underemphasized, primary/basic reward motivating behavior. Humans appetitively seek relationships with others. We argue that this need goes beyond sexual behavior as a basic reward stimulus and extends to the anxiety or fear-reducing quality of the attachment itself—in other words, that social relationships are crucial to adaptive, healthy emotional regulation. We also argue that the threat of loss (with the attendant state of fear and negative arousal) is a powerful signal to activate relationship-seeking behavior, and that, more generally, relationship-seeking behavior comes into play under a range of negative affective states such as anxiety or sadness. Optimally, effective relationships may help an individual manage these negative affective states, but sometimes in such states, an individual can act in destructive (and counterproductive) ways to avoid losing the relationship. In other words, we suggest that—especially when relationships are considered as primary behavioral motivators—there is a constant feedback between seeking the comfort of another for reward, pleasure, and security on the one hand, and using the other to diminish anxiety, fear, and other negative affects (including loneliness and perceived danger from a threatened loss) on the other hand. With optimal development, social relationships may be among the primary motivators for behavior. However, under conditions of early adversity and their attendant impact on later stress response systems or addictive processes, the rewarding properties of attachments either are relatively ineffective in diminishing negative affective states, or are neurobiologically co-opted by more powerful rewards that diminish the rewarding properties of attachments. In order to make this argument, we integrate operant models of motivational behavior and attachment theory, positing the development of attachment between infant and parent as a primary motivator of early infant behavior that endures into adulthood and influences adult relationship-seeking behavior. We begin with the basic definitions of 'reward' in terms of positive and negative reinforcement that we use in this chapter, and follow this with a review of the theory of attachment or social relationships as emotion-regulating systems. We then review the neurobiology of reward systems in general and describe what is currently known about the overlap between those systems and the neural circuitry of attachment, especially regarding parent-infant attachment. We next present a model of the feedback connection between reward and anxiety-regulating systems, in which attachment relationships serve as central mediators of the balance between these systems. We conclude with a discussion of how, for example, early life stress, later abuse, and/or addiction may influence the primary rewarding properties of social relationships.

AB  - Until recently knowledge was limited with respect to clinically relevant excessive reward seeking behaviour such as pathological gambling, excessive shopping, and excessive working which meet diagnostic criteria of dependent behaviour. To date there is no consistent concept for diagnosis or treatment of excessive reward-seeking behaviour, and its classification is uncertain. However, the high number of subjects seeking treatment emphasises the importance of a clear conceptualisation of the so-called behavioural addictions and their successful treatment. Excessive reward-seeking behaviour may be used to regulate negative emotions. We suggest that, comparable to drug addiction, excessive reward-seeking behaviour can alleviate negative mood states and may be used as an (inadequate) stress coping strategy at the expense of active coping strategies. In the course of a pathological development, behavioural addiction may become the only available behavioural resource to cope with challenging developmental steps or social stress factors such as loneliness or anxiety.

AB  - A female researcher studied 15 gambling women. Nine were Caucasians, five were African Americans and one was Hispanic American. The average age of the respondents was 43. The researcher asked the women who gamble for the meaning of the gambling behavior. Using the method of naturalistic inquiry, the researcher then applied theories of addiction, self-psychology, cognitive and emotional infant research, neuroscience, and complicated grief to gambling women's words. Gambling as a self-destructive addiction is a complicated web of many variables and no research can establish causality. However, the researcher discovered a high incidence of parent loss as well as other non-death losses among the respondents; i.e., 80% of the 15 gambling women's parents were dead. Predating the death of parents was the childhood experience of a gambling parent. Some of the women also reported emotional neglect or outright physical abuse by the parents. Other losses complicating the now-adult gambling women's lives were divorce and death of spouses. Problem gambling with this now-single, lonely population often escalated after these losses. Much of the problem gambling literature also reported cases of childhood neglect, abuse and loss. However, few researchers focused on loss factors as other than complicating the gambling picture. Symptoms of unresolved, complicated or absent grief over death of loved ones mimic the symptoms of the self-destructive gambling behavior. These symptoms include denial to avoid feelings; identification with the deceased resulting in dissociative states; magical thinking styles thought to be a linking phenomenon to the deceased; self-destructive behavior resulting from guilt for love-hate ambivalent feelings for the deceased; and depression, long after mourning might have ended. Some had suicidal ideation. The researcher felt that these women escaped sad emotions in a noisy gambling environment--a self-destructive environment of non-reality. These women found themselves out of control, helpless to pay off debt, thinking illogically about losing money and thinking illogically about solutions. Their only solution for paying off debt was to try harder, and to try harder meant gambling more. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook have become such a popular communication application on the Internet that these sites are now some of the most-trafficked websites in the world. Though use of social networking sites has become widespread, little research has been conducted about these sites and their impact on users. Our study attempted to partially address this gap in the literature by examining social networking site use among college students, specifically when the utilization of these types of sites becomes problematic or addictive. Researchers have begun finding evidence for the existence of Internet addiction or problematic use of the Internet in general. However, specific Internet applications which may hold addictive potential have been rarely researched, with the exception of online gambling and gaming. Given the popularity of social networking sites, the aims of our study were to determine if problematic use of social networking sites can develop, and to investigate some possible predictors of problematic use, including social anxiety and a lack of belonging to an offline social network. The less-threatening social environment that social networking sites offer compared to face-to-face interactions may make these sites particularly seductive for socially anxious individuals lacking friends. The relationship of problematic social networking site use with well-being was also examined in this study. An online survey was completed by 367 undergraduates, a majority of which identified themselves as social networking site users. Our study found evidence for the existence of problematic social networking site use by utilizing a measure modified from an existing measure of general problematic Internet use. Social anxiety was found to be positively related with problematic use, but our study failed to find support for lack of belonging to an offline social network as another predictor. However, a model placing loneliness as a mediator of the relationship between social anxiety and problematic use was supported. Finally, our study found evidence for a link between problematic use and well-being. Increased symptoms of problematic use were associated with decreased self-esteem, happiness, satisfaction with life, and increased depression and loneliness.

AB  - The notion of dependence to alcohol, drugs, gambling, and other behaviors is operationalized in standardized ways in psychology. In the communication literature, though, the concepts of dependence, reliance, and heavy exposure to television have been difficult to distinguish and tend to overlap. It is important for communication researchers to develop standardized meanings for media use, thereby creating a common ground for understanding media dependence. In this dissertation I proposed that a psychological model of addiction should be adopted to help define addictive television viewing via stimulant (i.e., need for affiliation, need for cognition, instrumental viewing motives, and parasocial interaction) and depressant (i.e., loneliness and ritualized viewing motives) routes.  A pilot study (N = 300) helped to establish a reliable measure of television addiction that reflected established psychological criteria for the detection of substance dependence. The measure of television addiction positively correlated with an adapted screening measure of addiction and television exposure. Addicted people were more often male, older, and less educated than non-addicts.  A 20-item unidimensional TV Addiction Scale resulted from the main study (N = 346). Television addiction was more strongly correlated with ritualistic viewing motives than instrumental motives. Loneliness was positively related to habit/pass time viewing and television addiction but unrelated to television exposure. This finding suggested that television exposure and addiction are distinct constructs. Need for cognition was unrelated to instrumental viewing motives and negatively related to television addiction. People who were more addicted to television reported more salient parasocial relationships, but not an increased need for affiliation. Hierarchical multiple regression suggested that the depressant route better predicted television addiction than the stimulant route. Predictors of television addiction included male gender, loneliness, low need for cognition, relaxation and habit/pass time viewing motivation, and television exposure. Habit/pass time motivation and television exposure were the best predictors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
