AB  - Gambling harms can impact the health and wellbeing of both individuals who gamble and those close to them. While harms occur across a spectrum of gambling risk levels, most research is conducted on people close to those gamblers who have severe problems. This study examined the health and wellbeing of people living with gamblers across the entire spectrum of gambling risk levels, via secondary analysis of the nationally-representative Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA). The subsample of interest comprised 13,698 respondents without a gambling problem of their own, aged between 15 and 84, and who lived in households where all residents completed the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). Health and wellbeing were measured via the SF-6D, the SF-36, and subjective wellbeing measures. Compared to those living in non-problem gambling households, participants living in problem-gambling households reported significantly lower mean SF-6D scores, lower scores on the SF-36 mental health domain, and significantly less satisfaction with both their financial situation and with feeling part of their local community. Participants living in moderate-risk gambling households also reported less satisfaction with their financial situation than those in non-problem gambling households. Conclusions: The results indicate that measurable impacts to the health and wellbeing of those living with gamblers occur predominantly at the more severe end of the risk level spectrum, except for financial dissatisfaction, which is also evident in those residing with gamblers categorised as moderate-risk. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In Canada, up to 3% of individuals have or are at risk of gambling disorder. Among these individuals, a lack of awareness of their problem gambling is a common barrier to treatment and negatively affects treatment adherence. A secondary analysis was conducted on data from 1346 individuals (mean age = 43.4, SD = 14.4; 54.3 % male) with problem gambling who did and did not perceive having a problem with their gambling as assessed by the fifth item of the Problem Gambling Severity Index, “In the past twelve months, how often have you felt that you might have a problem with gambling?” Additionally, we investigated predictors of increased general awareness at 12-month follow-up. At baseline, individuals who perceived a problem with their gambling experienced more gambling-related harms (OR = 1.714), had greater total gambling losses (OR = 1.067), were more likely to have a family history of problem gambling (OR = 2.143), experienced a greater loss of control (OR = 1.313) and more often gambled alone than with others (OR = 0.879), accounting for 26.6 % of the variance in general awareness. Baseline problem awareness was positively associated with attempts to cut down or control gambling at follow-up (χ2=11.350,p&lt;.001), but negatively associated with remission (χ2=18.392,p&lt;.001). Increases in awareness were related to an increase in the number of gambling-related harms, gambling involvement, impaired control, and lower educational attainment, explaining 35.5% of the variance in increased general awareness. The results indicate that experiencing more gambling-related harms increases the salience and awareness of problem gambling, and that awareness is also associated with an individual's gambling context, their loss of control, and their level of gambling involvement. The findings highlight the importance of gambling harms as they pertain to general awareness and suggest that improving the recognition of gambling harms could be beneficial for the prevention and intervention of gambling disorder. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Although the data on racial/ethnic associations with gambling disorder are limited, studies suggest that ethnicity may have associations with both symptom severity and psychosocial impairment linked to gambling disorder. Based on the current literature, we hypothesized that there would be a difference in gambling symptom severity, and co-occurring disorders, as a function of racial-ethnic group. Methods: 475 adults (mean age = 47.6 (±11.6) years; 54.3 % females) with gambling disorder who had participated in clinical trials on pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy were included. Participants were assessed for gambling severity, comorbidities, health issues, quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Participants who self-identified as Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (BAME) were compared to those who self-identified as white Caucasian (non-BAME). Significance was defined as p < 0.01. Results: The BAME group had significantly earlier age of first gambling. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age when gambling first became problematic, disability, current gambling disorder symptom severity, previous suicide attempt(s), quality of life, percent of salary in past year lost to gambling, or likelihood of having received treatment for gambling disorder in the past, nor in terms of having used Gamblers Anonymous. Conclusions: These data show that having gambling disorder and being from a minority racial-ethnic group was associated with significantly earlier age at first gambling, in clinical trial settings. Future work should further examine differences in the clinical features of gambling disorder in different minority groups in larger sample sizes, ideally also longitudinally, across a range of settings. Identification of the reasons/mechanisms for differences in earlier age of first gambling may lead to new public health and treatment targets to minimize gambling harms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Over the last decade, the provision of online gambling has intensified with increased access, enhanced betting markets, a broader product range, and prolific marketing. However, little research has explored how this intensification is influencing contemporary gambling experiences. This study focused on two research questions: 1) What changes in online gambling have online gamblers observed over the past decade? 2) How have these changes influenced the online gambling experiences and behaviours reported by treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking gamblers? Methods: Two samples of Australian adults were interviewed: 1) 19 people who had been gambling online for at least a decade and with no history of treatment-seeking for online gambling, and 2) 10 people who had recently sought professional help for an online gambling problem. Telephone interviews were semi-structured, with questions that encouraged participants to consider how their online gambling, including any harmful gambling, had been influenced by changes in operator practices and online gambling environments. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Both treatment- and non-treatment-seekers noted the increased speed and ease of online gambling, which now enables instant access from anywhere at any time and increased their gambling opportunities. Both groups highlighted the continued proliferation of advertising and inducements for online gambling, particularly during televised sports and racing events, in social media, and through targeted push marketing. Many treatment- and non-treatment-seekers were aware of the vast range of recently introduced bet types, particularly multi-bets. Treatment-seekers disproportionately reported negative effects from these changes, and described how and why they fostered their increased gambling, impulsive gambling, persistence and loss-chasing. They reported limited uptake and effectiveness of current harm minimisation tools. Conclusions: Counter to stated policy and practice objectives to minimise gambling harm, industry changes that have made online gambling easier, faster, and more heavily incentivised, and increased the array of complex bets with poorer odds, unduly affect addicted and harmed individuals – who are also the most profitable customers. Further consideration is needed to ensure gambling policy, industry practices and public health measures more effectively reduce gambling harm in contemporary settings. Inducements and the poor pricing of complex bets such as multi-bets, and their outsized attraction to players with problems, should be a key focus. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Aims: The media can influence gambling policy formation and public opinion. Previous research has established that the tension between political or public interest in gambling revenue and gambling harm is fundamental for understanding gambling policy. There are two opposing gambling policy positions: (1) gambling revenue or the economic benefits of gambling, and (2) the harmful impacts of gambling. This study is the first study to estimate these gambling policy positions of newspapers on a common scale. The objective is to estimate how the gambling policy positions of major Finnish daily newspapers evolved between 2004 and 2020. This knowledge deepens our understanding about the changes in the relative balance between harm and revenue in gambling policy. Methods and data: The data consisted of newspaper editorials (N = 58) on gambling policy from five major Finnish daily newspapers between 2004 and 2020. The data were analysed with the automated content analysis algorithm Wordfish. Results: The results show that there has been a clear shift in the gambling policy positions of the major Finnish newspapers towards increased acknowledgement of the importance of prevention and reduction of gambling harm. Conclusions: Due to the interplay between the media, politics, and the public, it is likely that the importance of prevention and reduction of gambling harm will be recognised and addressed to a larger extent when gambling policy is formulated in Finland in the future. More generally, if the gambling policy positions of media and other stakeholders change, this can facilitate a promotion of harm prevention policies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This brief report presents results on how gamblers have experienced risks and change during the exceptional situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is based on online questionnaires collected by the University of Helsinki and the Finnish Association for Substance Use Prevention (N = 586). Results show that the reduced availability of gambling in the Finnish context has limited its total consumption. The risk of gambling-related harms has therefore become less pressing during the pandemic. Although gambling is a public health risk in addition to being a harmful activity for the individual, the policy measures during the pandemic have revealed that, at a societal level, the risk of infection with COVID-19 was perceived as being a more serious problem than was the risk of gambling harms. © 2022, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

AB  - Background: Electronic gambling machines (EGMs) are amongst the most harmful forms of gambling. The high availability of EGMs is also linked to increased consumption. To reduce the burden of EGMs on public health, policies to reduce their numbers have recently been introduced in Italy and Finland. This study compares the aims and justifications of these legislative changes, as well as their overall impacts on total consumption. Methods: The objectives and justifications of policies to reduce the number of EGMs were based on qualitative media analysis. The impacts on total consumption were measured using financial figures provided by gambling providers in Italy and Finland. Results: Results show that the reductions in EGM numbers were justified in terms of public health concerns in both countries, but the amplitude of policies varied. In Italy, the reductions were more ambitious than in Finland, and included reductions in the number of gambling locations. The financial data nevertheless indicated that the reductions may not have been significant enough. Conclusions: Public health concerns were initially highlighted in the media discussions, but eventually in both countries reduction policies were less ambitious due to industry lobbying and state revenue interests. The reductions therefore do not appear to have been effective in reducing total consumption and the burden on public health. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The normalisation of gambling for young people has received considerable recent attention in the public health literature, particularly given the proliferation of gambling marketing aligned with sport. A range of studies and reports into the health and wellbeing of young people have recommended that they should be consulted and engaged in developing public health policy and prevention strategies. There are, however, very few opportunities for young people to have a say about gambling issues, with little consideration of their voices in public health recommendations related to gambling. This study aimed to address this gap by documenting young people’s perceptions about strategies that could be used to counter the normalisation of gambling and prevent gambling related harm. Methods: This study took a critical qualitative inquiry approach, which acknowledges the role of power and social injustice in health issues. Qualitative interviews, using a constructivist approach, were conducted with 54 young people (11–17 years) in Australia. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. Results: Five overall strategies were constructed from the data. 1) Reducing the accessibility and availability of gambling products; 2) Changing gambling infrastructure to help reduce the risks associated with gambling engagement; 3) Untangling the relationship between gambling and sport; 4) Restrictions on advertising; and 5) Counter-framing in commercial messages about gambling. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that young people have important insights and provide recommendations for addressing factors that may contribute to the normalisation of gambling, including strategies to prevent gambling related harm. Young people hold similar views to public health experts about strategies aimed at de-normalising gambling in their local communities and have strong opinions about the need for gambling to be removed from sport. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Bingo is often understood as a low-harm form of gambling. This view has been challenged by a growing body of literature identifying gambling harm to bingo players in a range of countries. In this study, we aimed to identify which conditions enabled, facilitated, intensified or mitigated gambling harm for bingo players in three populations in Victoria in the context of corporate, technological and regulatory changes. Methods: Our qualitative study investigated experiences of bingo-related gambling harm in three populations in Victoria, Australia where bingo was popular and structural disadvantage common: Indigenous people in the east, Pacific people in the state’s north and older people on low or fixed incomes in the capital. Data was generated through interviews with 53 bingo players and 13 stakeholders as well as 12 participant observations of bingo sessions. Results: We found that while bingo is overwhelmingly positive for many players, a minority of bingo players and their families experience notable harm. Harm was generated through traditional paper-based bingo games, new technologies such as tablet-based bingo and by the widespread tactic of placing bingo sessions in close proximity to harmful electronic gambling machines. Overall, the risk of harm to bingo players appears to be escalating due to commercial, technological and regulatory changes. Conclusions: These changes can be better managed by regulators: reforms are needed to safeguard bingo’s distinct character as a lower-risk form of gambling at a time when it, and its players, are under threat. Significantly, we found that harm to bingo players is intensified by factors external to gambling such as racialised poverty and adverse life events. Strategies that recognise these factors and grapple with gambling harm to bingo players are needed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Both the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and the Short Gambling Harms Screen (SGHS) purport to identify individuals harmed by gambling. However, there is dispute as to how much individuals are harmed, conditional on their scores from these instruments. We used an experienced utility framework to estimate the magnitude of implied impacts on health and wellbeing. Methods: We measured health utility using the Short Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D), and used this as a benchmark. All 2603 cases were propensity score weighted, to balance the affected group (i.e., SGHS 1+ or PGSI 1+ vs 0) with a reference group of gamblers with respect to risk factors for gambling harm. Weighted regression models estimated decrements to health utility scores attributable to gambling, whilst controlling for key comorbidities. Results: We found significant attributable decrements to health utility for all non-zero SGHS scores, as well as moderate-risk and problem gamblers, but not for PGSI low-risk gamblers. Applying these coefficients to population data, we find a similar total burden for both instruments, although the SGHS more specifically identified the subpopulation of harmed individuals. For both screens, outcomes on the SF-6D implies that about two-thirds of the ‘burden of harm’ is attributable to gamblers outside of the most severe categories. Conclusions: Gambling screens have hitherto provided nominal category membership, it has been unclear whether moderate or ‘at-risk’ scores imply meaningful impact, and accordingly, population surveys have typically focused on problem gambling prevalence. These results quantify the health utility decrement for each category, allowing for tracking of the aggregate population impact based on all affected gamblers. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: While problem gambling does not directly cause intimate partner violence (IPV), it exacerbates that violence significantly. Women experiencing both gambling harm and IPV often find themselves in challenging situations; furthermore, stigma and shame frequently act as barriers to seeking help from health and social service agencies. Despite the links between problem gambling and IPV, little is known about women’s experiences of using support services for both IPV and gambling related issues. This paper explores positive experiences of help-seeking for gambling-related IPV in Australia by adopting a strengths-based research approach. Methods: Qualitative, unstructured interviews were conducted for a larger study exploring the nature of the relationship between problem gambling and IPV. To gain new insights into the service experiences of women impacted by gambling related IPV, interviews with 48 women with lived experience of IPV relating to a male partner’s gambling, and 24 women with lived experience of IPV relating to their own gambling were reanalysed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes emerged from the data signifying or demonstrating strength-based responses: ‘Commitment to Integrated and Collaborative Responses’; ‘Therapeutic Support’; and ‘Instrumental Support’. The themes highlight the importance of recognising the intersectionality of gambling related IPV and supporting the person ‘at the centre of the service’. Tangible and instrumental supports, such as emergency accommodation and financial assistance, were also central to the recovery process. Conclusion: Effective service responses are dependent on understanding how problem gambling and IPV intersect. Importantly, service providers must recognise and address the many facets of each woman’s situation and the shame associated with resolving interdependent and complex issues. Responding to the needs of women impacted by gambling related IPV requires both individual-level awareness and organisational support; recommendations to strengthen service provision are provided. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Gambling has traditionally been conceptualised as an issue of addiction and personal responsibility. While there are now clear public health models that recognise that gambling harm is caused by a range of socio-cultural, environmental, commercial and political determinants, government and industry messages about gambling are still largely personal responsibility focused. Given the well-recognised issues associated with personal responsibility paradigms, this study sought to understand how gamblers themselves conceptualised responsibility for gambling harm. Methods: A qualitatively led online panel survey was conducted with 363 adult gamblers in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia. Participants were asked to respond to what they thought were the causes of gambling harm, and what could be done to prevent harm. A reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. Results: Six common tropes were constructed from gamblers’ responses: (1) Gambling in moderation; (2) Personal responsibility for rational behaviour; (3) Character flaws; (4) Personal responsibility to seek help; (5) More education is needed; and (6) Governments are responsible for action – but motivation and efficacy are questioned. Gamblers primarily understood gambling harm as being a matter of personal responsibility, and government responsibility was generally seen as limited to providing information to facilitate informed gambling choices. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that gamblers’ perceptions of gambling harm are similar to the personal responsibility framings and tropes present in industry and government messaging strategies. Refocusing public communication strategies away from ‘responsible gambling’ messaging, and towards evidence-based approaches, will be an important part of addressing the harms associated with gambling. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Survey responses from a sample of nearly 15,000 Australian sports fans were used to study the determinants of: (i) gambling behaviour, including if a person does gamble and the type of gambling engaged with; (ii) the number of sports and non-sports bets made over a 12-month period; and (iii) attitudes towards betting on sports. The probability of betting on sports decreased with increasing age and was lower for women and people with a university education. This gender difference varied with age, with the greatest difference found among the young. Similar effects were observed for the number of sports bets made, which declined with age. The gender difference in the number of sports bets also varied with age with the greatest difference found among the young arising from the high propensity of young men to bet on sports. Attitudes to sports betting were also analysed, with a key finding that, within friendship circles, the views that sports betting is perceived as harmless, common and very much a part of enjoying sports were stronger among young men. These permissive attitudes were stronger among people who bet on sports and those who bet on sports more frequently. The analysis of sports fans provides insights into the characteristics of the target market most likely to bet on sports, which can be used to inform public health initiatives and harm reduction campaigns. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between socio-demographic factors, gambling behaviour, and the level of gambling expenditure. The data were drawn from the population-based Gambling Harms Survey 2016 and 2017 conducted in Finland. The data were linked to register-based variables. Past-year gamblers were included (Wave 1; n = 5 805, both Waves; n = 2 165). The study showed that of the 4.2 % of gamblers that produced 50.0 % of the total GE in 2016, 33.1 % of the GE was produced by those with a gambling problem and 43.3 % by those with at-risk gambling pattern. Compared to gamblers in the lowest GE group, those in the highest GE group were more likely to be men, aged 25 or older, with upper secondary education, have a high income, be on disability pension or sickness allowance, be frequent gamblers, gambling at least six game types, and showing at-risk and problem gambling patterns. Cumulative weekly GE by income tertiles remained fairly stable between the years. The results suggest that GE is highly concentrated. Among the small group of high-intensity consumers, the majority of the revenue comes from at-risk and problem gambling. Participants in the low GE group differ from those in the intermediate and high GE groups in terms of socio-demographics and gambling behaviour. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Feminist researchers have argued for a focus on ‘everyday gambling’ and domestic spaces as sites of women’s leisure. In this article, we analyse how culture, class and gender shape the consumer practices of migrant women from Pacific Islands countries (Cook Islands and Tonga) who play bingo in regional Australia. This intersectional approach examines the effects of bingo in the everyday lives of these women. We show how migrant women gamblers have a distinctive experience of ‘lifestyle’ that is located within a meaningful symbolic order that values both domestic responsibilities and community relations within extended families, even when distance from the homeland and economic precarity entail social and financial pressures. While much policy research focuses on gambling harms, including the impact of electronic gaming machines or online gambling, here we show how bingo is embedded in social relations that mitigate many of the ongoing financial problems and deeper existential anxieties for those in precarious economic circumstances. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper presents an integrative review of research on domestic and family violence (DFV), including intimate partner violence (IPV), experienced by victims and perpetrators with a gambling problem. It aims to review, critique, and synthesize research on this topic to generate fresh and alternative perspectives to guide future research. Based on a systematic search of the academic literature and a targeted search of gray literature, the paper summarizes findings from empirical studies pertaining to the prevalence of perpetration and victimization, characteristics of perpetrators and victims, and explanations for this violence. Based on this review, the paper suggests several potential improvements that can be considered in future studies. These include a shift from focusing on situational violence to also include coercive control; greater sensitivity in research design and interpretation to gender differences in experiences of violence; and the need to include economic abuse as a form of DFV/IPV. Adopting a public health lens is also recommended to broaden the research focus from victims and perpetrators to also consider contextual factors. In particular, gambling research should examine the contribution of gambling products, practices, environments, and marketing to DFV/IPV and how this might be ameliorated. While research to date has drawn much needed attention to the risks that gambling presents for DFV/IPV, this review provides some suggestions for future research so that it can provide more nuanced findings to inform policy and practice.

AB  - Gambling-related harms can impact the lives of children living with someone experiencing a gambling problem. These harms have been associated with impacts across a number of domains. However, previous studies exploring gambling-related effects on the health and wellbeing of children have had conflicting results. This study aimed to further understand the impact of parental gambling problems on children's health and wellbeing using nationally representative data from Growing up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. The subsample of interest contained 3,695 children (49.1% female) across two cohorts aged around 12 and 16 years. Parental gambling problems were measured by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). Child health and wellbeing was measured via the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D), the Spence Anxiety Scale, the Short Mood & Feelings Questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and self-harm and happiness questions. Across both cohorts, the study found significant associations between parental gambling problems and poorer health, anxiety and/or low mood symptoms, and behavioural and emotional problems in children. The study found that more than 10% of Australian children were living in households with adults experiencing some level of gambling problems, including 1.2% in households with severe problems. Policymakers and educators might help ensure that the appropriate information and support is being provided to these children. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background and aims: Lower-risk recommendations for avoiding gambling harm have been developed as a primary prevention measure, using self-reported prevalence survey data. The aim of this study was to conduct similar analyses using gambling company player data. Methods: The sample (N = 35,753) were Norsk Tipping website customers. Gambling indicators were frequency, expenditure, duration, number of gambling formats and wager. Harm indicators (financial. social, emotional, harms in two or more areas) were derived from the GamTest self-assessment instrument. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were performed separately for each of the five gambling indicators for each of the four harm indicators. Results: ROC areas under the curve were between 0.55 and 0.68. Suggested monthly lower-risk limits were less than 8.7 days, expenditure less than 54 €, duration less than 72-83 min, number of gambling formats less than 3 and wager less than 118-140€. Most risk curves showed a rather stable harm level up to a certain point, from which the increase in harm was fairly linear. Discussion: The suggested lower-risk limits in the present study are higher than limits based on prevalence studies. There was a significant number of gamblers (5-10%) experiencing harm at gambling levels well below the suggested cut-offs and the risk increase at certain consumption levels. Conclusions: Risk of harm occurs at all levels of gambling involvement within the specific gambling commercial environment assessed in an increasingly available gambling market where most people gamble in multiple commercial environments, minimizing harm is important for all customers. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - While there is evidence for self-exclusion (SE) as an individual-level harm reduction intervention, its effects on reducing harm from gambling at the population level remain unclear. Based on a review of national legal frameworks and SE programs, including their utilization and enforcement in selected high-income societies, the present analysis aims to explore the reach and strengths of SE in the protection of gamblers in these jurisdictions. It places particular emphasis on SE programs' potential to prevent and minimize gambling harm at the population level. The overview examined SE in Finland, Germany, Italy, Massachusetts (USA), Norway, Sweden, and Victoria (Australia). These jurisdictions differ considerably in how gambling is regulated as well as in how SE is implemented and enforced. The reach and extent of enforcement of SE apparently vary with the polity's general policy balance between reducing gambling problems and increasing gambling revenue. But in any case, though SE may benefit individual gamblers and those around them, it does not appear to be capable of significantly reducing gambling harm at the population level. To render SE programs an effective measure that prevents gamblers and those linked to them from financial, social, and psychological harm, utilization needs to be substantially increased by reforming legal regulations and exclusion conditions.

AB  - Internet delivered interventions are accessible and easy to access and can be used to deliver brief interventions. These interventions can be tailored according to individual need for the prevention and minimisation of gambling harm or early intervention for those that are displaying some signs of problems. The objective of this review was to summarise the existing literature on the effectiveness of prevention, harm reduction and early intervention programs when delivered online. A systematic review was conducted for peer-reviewed studies that evaluated internet delivered interventions for the prevention, harm reduction or early intervention for gambling problems. Four electronic databases were consulted in the past 20 years (2000–2020) resulting in a total of 15 included studies. Across identified studies just one study provided prevention with 7 harm reduction and 7 early interventions. The quality of the literature was variable with just 8 randomised controlled trials with the remainder matched controls or longitudinal cohort studies. The target group was predominantly gamblers accessing betting and casino websites (n = 8). Studies administered four types of interventions which included personalised and normative feedback, limit setting, self-directed cognitive and behavioural therapy and self-exclusion. These were delivered via customer gaming accounts, email, and self-learning packages. The available literature shows promise in the effectiveness of internet delivered interventions. However, the limited number of studies included in this review highlight significant lost opportunities to leverage technology in the prevention and reduction of gambling harm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Gambling is associated with many conditions that can compromise young people’s health and wellbeing, such as substance use and poor school achievement. Conversely, low school achievement can be linked to lower socio-economic position. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine whether compulsory school achievement is linked with gambling participation and gambling expenditure (GE) later in youth and whether GE is linked with lower socio-economic position. Methods: The Finnish Gambling Harms survey data (n = 7186) were used. The data were collected in three regions during spring 2017. Participants aged 18–29 years old were selected from the data. Past-year GE was examined using two measures: weekly gambling expenditure (WGE, in €) and relative gambling expenditure (RGE, in %). Logistic regression and log-linear regression models for past-year gambling, WGE and RGE were created. Results: Persons who had no more than a mediocre grade point average (GPA) had a 25% higher WGE and 30% higher RGE in 2016 than those who had an outstanding GPA in the compulsory school. Compared with persons with an outstanding GPA, those with a satisfactory to very good GPA spent 13% more on gambling, and their RGE was 17% higher. Additionally, those with lower socio-economic status (SES) had a higher WGE and RGE compared with higher SES. Conclusions: Even after controlling for other crucial background characteristics, early life success, in the form of compulsory school outcomes, seems to correlate with gambling expenditures later in youth. This suggests that the gambling behaviour can be linked to the cognitive ability of an individual. Our findings also imply that gambling could be more heavily concentrated on individuals that are already more socially disadvantaged. However, it is worth noting that individual factors such as traumas, antisocial personality, anxiety and depression are all associated with gambling and poor academic achievement. Overall, this suggests that various educational tools at a younger age can be effective in preventing gambling-related problems in later life. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, gambling harm has been considered a significant public health concern due to its increasing socioeconomic costs. Although the adverse effects of gambling have attracted research interest, evidence of its effect on financial stress remains largely anecdotal. This study empirically examines the link between individual problem gambling severity and financial stress using panel data from the household, income and labour dynamics in Australia survey. After addressing endogeneity, we find that problem gambling severity is positively associated with self-reported financial stress. Thus, problem gambling severity tends to increase financial stress. This finding is robust to alternative measures of financial stress and gambling behaviour—whether gambling is measured using the problem gambling severity index, gambling risk statuses, number of gambling activities, or gambling expenditure. The positive effect of gambling on financial stress is largely driven by gambling activities involving scratch cards and poker machines. Although males exhibit higher levels of problem gambling severity, females are more financially stressed than males. Our findings also suggest that gambling widens the gender gap in financial stress. Further analysis reveals that financial resilience mediates the gambling-financial stress relationship. This implies that promoting policies that enhance financial resilience can help to insulate individuals against the effects of gambling on financial stress. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - A small body of research has shown that gambling problems are elevated among homeless populations and suggests the complexity of relationships between homelessness, gambling and a broad range of other social and addiction issues. This research explored patterns of gambling and coexisting issues at the level of the individuals’ experiences. We describe the experiences of 17 residents of a transitional housing service who had experienced gambling harm as people who gamble and/or affected others, using a descriptive qualitative approach. Four themes, each with subthemes, were identified in the data. Participants described their histories, strong links between methamphetamine use and gambling and the importance of connectedness and family to recovery. Gambling was seldom an issue raised by professional services or divulged by the participants, nor was it described as a key factor in becoming homeless. General self-help strategies (such as distraction) were adapted by participants in attempts to modify or control their gambling. The present results stress the need to destigmatise gambling problems (even relative to methamphetamine use) and to provide gambling information and support through a broad range of social and health services in a way that resonates both with those affected those providing professional support. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article analyses the specificities of the policymaking and research communities to explain why policies to prevent gambling disorder and other gambling-related harms have seen little change over the last two decades. Although existing knowledge on these issues suggests the implementation of prevention interventions based on public health perspectives, there are few government-led initiatives that adopt broad approaches beyond those advocated by the Responsible Gambling perspective. This situation would be influenced by two communities of actors with distinct professional cultures: policy makers face general incompatibilities with prevention policies, which are complex and go beyond political timeframes; gambling researchers, in turn, operate in fields dominated by approaches oriented towards measuring gambling disorder and with little interest in structural issues. To address this situation, the text advocates emphasising socio-economic inequalities related to gambling by the research field and improving science communication strategies as a means of influencing action to reduce the overall negative consequences of gambling. © 2022, Sinnergiak Social Innovation.

AB  - Background: People with gambling problems frequently report repeated unsuccessful attempts to change their behavior. Although many behavior change techniques are available to individuals to reduce gambling harm, they can be challenging to implement or maintain. The provision of implementation support tailored for immediate, real-time, individualized circumstances may improve attempts at behavior change. Objective: We aimed to develop and evaluate a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for individuals who require support to adhere to their gambling limits. JITAI development is based on the principles of the Health Action Process Approach with delivery, in alignment with the principles of self-determination theory. The primary objective was to determine the effect of action- and coping planning compared with no intervention on the goal of subsequently adhering to gambling expenditure limits. Methods: Gambling Habit Hacker is delivered as a JITAI providing in-the-moment support for adhering to gambling expenditure limits (primary proximal outcome). Delivered via a smartphone app, this JITAI delivers tailored behavior change techniques related to goal setting, action planning, coping planning, and self-monitoring. The Gambling Habit Hacker app will be evaluated using a 28-day microrandomized trial. Up to 200 individuals seeking support for their own gambling from Australia and New Zealand will set a gambling expenditure limit (ie, goal). They will then be asked to complete 3 time-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) per day over a 28-day period. EMAs will assess real-time adherence to gambling limits, strength of intention to adhere to goals, goal self-efficacy, urge self-efficacy, and being in high-risk situations. On the basis of the responses to each EMA, participants will be randomized to the control (a set of 25 self-enactable strategies containing names only and no implementation information) or intervention (self-enactable strategy implementation information with facilitated action- and coping planning) conditions. This microrandomized trial will be supplemented with a 6-month within-group follow-up that explores the long-term impact of the app on gambling expenditure (primary distal outcome) and a range of secondary outcomes, as well as an evaluation of the acceptability of the JITAI via postintervention surveys, app use and engagement indices, and semistructured interviews. This trial has been approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2020-304). Results: The intervention has been subject to expert user testing, with high acceptability scores. The results will inform a more nuanced version of the Gambling Habit Hacker app for wider use. Conclusions: Gambling Habit Hacker is part of a suite of interventions for addictive behaviors that deliver implementation support grounded in lived experience. This study may inform the usefulness of delivering implementation intentions in real time and in real-world settings. It potentially offers people with gambling problems new support to set their gambling intentions and adhere to their limits. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Children of problem gamblers are at risk of harm, however, there are no population level estimates as to how many children are currently exposed to parental problem- and at-risk gambling. The current study analysed data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, a nationally representative survey, to derive the first ever national estimates of the proportion of problem, moderate, and low risk gamblers (as measured by PGSI) in the Australian parent population. It also reports how many children under 15 years of age in Australia are exposed to parental gambling across the gambling risk categories. The results show that 13.7% of all Australian families with dependent children are currently exposed to some level of gambling risk due to parental gambling, and nearly 4% of families with children are exposed to parental moderate risk or problem gambling. This corresponds to almost 200,000 children each year. The results and approach of this study will guide future examination of child wellbeing in families where parents experience problems with gambling. The results are discussed in the context of public health approaches to familial gambling harm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study compared land-based-only gamblers (LBOGs), online-only gamblers (OOGs), and mixed-mode gamblers (MMGs), based on a 2019 Australian national telephone survey (N = 15,000). It examined 1) prevalence, demographics and gambling behaviours, 2) problematic gambling, 3) most harmful gambling forms, 4) gambling-related harms-to-self, and 5) risk factors for higher problem gambling severity. Results estimated that 43.1% of Australians were non-gamblers, 39.5% LBOGs, 12.8% MMGs and 4.6% OOGs. MMGs were more likely than LBOGs to be male, younger, unmarried, Australian-born, and indigenous. OOGs were more likely than MMGs to be married, university educated, born outside of Australia, speak a non-English language, and less likely to be indigenous. As hypothesised, MMGs had the highest gambling involvement, gambling problems and gambling-related harm. Relative risk of gambling problems for MMGs (5.1% problem gambling; 11.0% moderate risk gambling), exceeded that of both LBOGs (1.4%; 3.8%) and OOGs (0.7%; 4.7%). Risk factors for problematic gambling included engaging in more gambling forms, being male, single, less educated, indigenous, and speaking a non-English language. Crucially, gambling on the internet (OOGs and MMGs combined) was associated with higher problem gambling severity than land-based-only gambling (LBOGs), even after controlling for these risk factors. The findings can inform targeted public health measures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background and aims: Gambling-related harm to concerned significant others (CSOs) is an important public health issue since it reduces CSOs' health and wellbeing in numerous life domains. This study aimed to 1) estimate the first national prevalence of CSOs harmed by gambling in Australia; 2) identify the characteristics of CSOs most at risk of harm from another person's gambling; 3) compare the types and number of harms experienced by CSOs based on their relationship to the person who gambles; and 4) compare the number of harms experienced by CSOs by self-identified gender. Methods: Based on a national CATI survey weighted to population norms, 11,560 respondents reported whether they had been personally and negatively affected by another person's gambling in the past 12 months; and if so, answered detailed questions about the harms experienced from the person's gambling who had harmed them the most. Results: Past-year prevalence of gambling-related harm to adult Australian CSOs was (6.0%; 95% CI 5.6%-6.5%). CSOs most commonly reported emotional harms, followed by relationship, financial, health and vocational harms, respectively. Former partners reported the most harm, followed by current partners, other family members and non-family members, respectively. Female CSOs were more likely to report more harm and being harmed by a partner or other family member, and male CSOs from a non-family member. Discussion and conclusions: The findings provide new insights into the wider societal burden of gambling and inform measures aimed at reducing harm to CSOs from gambling and supporting them to seek help. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Gambling and sports are entangled in a close relationship. However, little remains known about gambling behaviors and perceptions in sports. Drawing on normalization theory, this study explores the prevalence and predictors of problem gambling as well as the normalization of gambling (including its availability and accessibility, prevalence, and socio-cultural accommodation) in sports clubs. A cross-sectional study design was implemented, based on an online survey completed by 817 Belgian sports club actors. This survey consisted of the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and questions about personal and socio-cultural factors regarding gambling. Data were analyzed with SPSS 26 software, using descriptive statistics and an ordinal logistic regression analysis. These analyses exposed being male, being aged 26–35 years old, and being involved in football (soccer) as factors that might be linked with higher levels of problem gambling in sports. Furthermore, sports betting is especially shown to be normalized in sports clubs given its prevalence, and its frequently organized and discussed character. Moreover, respondents disclosed a lack of formal rules (96%) and education initiatives (98.7%) on gambling in their sports club. Given the indicated support for gambling regulations and educational measures, this study may inform sports organizations about how to help denormalize gambling. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The provision of commercialised gambling products and services has changed radically in recent decades. Gambling is now provided in many places by multi-national corporations, with important implications for public health and policymaking. The United Kingdom is one of the most liberalised gambling markets globally, however there are few empirical analyses of gambling policy from a public health perspective. This study aims to provide a critical analysis of a core element of UK gambling policy, the provision of industry-funded youth gambling education programmes. Methods: Adopting a commercial determinants of health lens, a discourse theoretical analysis was conducted using the logics of critical explanation. The data comprised resources provided by three gambling industry-funded charities (GambleAware, GamCare and the Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust) and their partners. Results: The resources present a gambling education discourse that serves to reproduce the ‘responsible gambling’ agenda, while problematising children and young people. While the resources appear to offer educational content and opportunities for debate, the dominant focus is on teaching about personal responsibility and on the normalisation of gambling and gaming and their industries, while constraining the concept of agency. The resources encourage young people to act as individuals to control their impulses, and to correct what are portrayed as faulty cognitions with the aim of becoming responsible consumers. Our findings demonstrate how the gambling education discourse aligns with wider industry interests, serving to deflect from the harmful nature of the products and services they market while shifting responsibility for harm onto children, youth and their families. Conclusions: Despite being delivered in the name of public health, the resources construct a discourse favourable to corporate interests. Educators, parents, policymakers, and others need to be empowered to address the conflicts of interest that exist in the delivery of gambling industry-funded resources. The promotion of such industry-favoured interventions should not be allowed to undermine efforts to implement regulations to prevent gambling harms. © 2022

AB  - This study investigates the prevalence of being an affected other (AO) of a person with problem gambling; and the associations between being an AO and socio-demographics, gambling behaviour, health-related correlates and the amount and type of gambling-related harm (GRH) for the AOs. Furthermore, perspectives of the affected family members (AFMs) and close friends (ACFs) were acknowledged. Cross-sectional, random sample Finnish Gambling population-based survey data (n = 3,994) were collected in 2019. AOs were identified using a question with seven options. Information on GRH was sought using structured questions. One-fifth (21.2 %) of all respondents were AOs, men being typically ACFs and women being more often AFMs. Being an AO was associated with younger age, gambling participation, having a gambling problem of their own and health barriers such as psychological distress. AFMs experienced GRH more often and the amount of different GRHs was greater among the AFMs. The most common harm category experienced by the AOs was emotional harm. Both health-related issues and the amount of GRHs was largest among the AFMs. A substantial amount of GRH was also experienced by ACFs. The study suggests that support could be tailored for AFMs and ACFs, based on their AO status and individual needs. A public health approach for effective harm prevention in primary, secondary and tertiary levels are discussed. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - This study presents a large-scale mapping review of how the literature on gambling identifies suggested solutions to prevent or reduce gambling harm and whose responsibility it is to implement them. The purpose of this is to provide a concise reference for stakeholders who must make critical decisions regarding the enhancement of consumer protection and harm minimization measures. Two databases, Scopus and Web of Science, were searched to identify relevant studies. The initial search yielded 5135 results, from which a total of 1292 empirical studies published between 2014 and 2018 were selected for analysis. Inductive content analysis was performed to identify suggested solutions reported in each study. The results indicate that commonly suggested solutions are the creation of educational and awareness programs (e.g., information on the risks of gambling, resources for help seekers, how games really work) and further restrictions on gambling advertising. We found that health service providers are mostly given the responsibility to implement various strategies, followed by policy makers. Numerous empirically proven suggestions for health service providers, policy makers, gambling industry operators, educational institutions, consumers, and families are discussed in detail. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this paper is to identify possible regulatory, policy and program measures to address gambling harm to bingo players and their communities, and in doing so extend existing public health approaches to gambling to better include bingo. Study design: This was a qualitative case study of three populations in Victoria, Australia where bingo was popular and structural disadvantage common: Indigenous people in the state's east, Pacific people in the north and older people on low or fixed incomes in the capital, Melbourne. Methods: Our study investigated experiences of bingo, including gambling harm and recommendations for change. Data were generated through interviews with 53 bingo players and 13 stakeholders as well as 12 participant observations of bingo sessions. Results: Five broad drivers of and influences on harm to bingo players are identified: technological, regulatory and commercial changes eroding bingo's protective factors; bingo being used to bolster other forms of gambling; promotion of gambling interests over people's wellbeing; not recognising experiences of different communities and; external structural influences such as racialised poverty. We identify recommendations from bingo players and stakeholders to address harm arising from bingo involving wagering. Based on these recommendations and available evidence, we propose five sets of measures to mitigate against gambling harm to bingo players and their communities, and so extend existing public health approaches to gambling to better encompass bingo. These sets of measures are: safeguarding bingo's protective features; delinking bingo from the gambling eco-system; dismantling political protection of the gambling industry; tailoring strategies for sub-populations and preventing oppression and abuse. Conclusions: In the face of significant regulatory, commercial and technological changes to bingo that risk increasing and intensifying harm, a public health approach to bingo could help mitigate gambling harm. © 2022

AB  - Purpose: The involvement of patients or members of the public within public health, health and social care and addictions services is growing in the UK and internationally but is less common in gambling support services. The purpose of this study was to explore Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) infrastructures and engagement channels used in health and care services and debate their transferability to the gambling support sector (including research, education and treatment). Design/methodology/approach: A narrative review examined data from six English language electronic databases, NHS evidence and grey literature covering the period 2007–2019. We identified 130 relevant items from UK literature. A workshop was held in London, England, with people with lived experience of gambling harm to seek their views on and applicability of the review findings to gambling services. Findings: Synthesis of literature and workshop data was undertaken. Main themes addressed “What works” in relation to: building infrastructures and organising involvement of people with lived experience; what people want to be involved in; widening participation and sustaining involvement and respecting people with lived experience. Practical implications: Examination of the literature about involvement and engagement of patients, service users and the public in public health, health and social care and addiction services provides potentially useful examples of good practice which may be adopted by gambling services. Originality/value: The involvement of people with lived experience of gambling harms in gambling support services is under-explored, with little published evidence of what constitutes good practice amongst self-organising groups/networks/grassroots organisations or rights-based/empowerment-based approaches. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Gambling in the modern era is pervasive owing to the variety of gambling opportunities available, including those that use technology (eg, online applications on smartphones). Although many people gamble recreationally without undue negative effects, a sizeable subset of individuals develop disordered gambling, which is associated with marked functional impairment including other mental health problems, relationship problems, bankruptcy, suicidality, and criminality. The National UK Research Network for Behavioural Addictions (NUK-BA) was established to promote understanding of, research into, and treatments for behavioural addictions including gambling disorder, which is the only formally recognised behavioural addiction. In this Health Policy paper, we outline the status of research and treatment for disordered gambling in the UK (including funding issues) and key research that should be conducted to establish the magnitude of the problem, vulnerability and resilience factors, the underlying neurobiology, long-term consequences, and treatment opportunities. In particular, we emphasise the need to: (1) conduct independent longitudinal research into the prevalence of disordered gambling (including gambling disorder and at-risk gambling), and gambling harms, including in vulnerable and minoritised groups; (2) select and refine the most suitable pragmatic measurement tools; (3) identify predictors (eg, vulnerability and resilience markers) of disordered gambling in people who gamble recreationally, including in vulnerable and minoritised groups; (4) conduct randomised controlled trials on psychological interventions and pharmacotherapy for gambling disorder; (5) improve understanding of the neurobiological basis of gambling disorder, including impulsivity and compulsivity, genetics, and biomarkers; and (6) develop clinical guidelines based on the best contemporary research evidence to guide effective clinical interventions. We also highlight the need to consider what can be learnt from approaches towards mitigating gambling-related harm in other countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Issue addressed: Older adults are at an increased risk of experiencing gambling harm, which may be due to their use of high-intensity gambling products such as electronic gambling machines (EGMs). However, little research has explored the motivations behind older adults’ engagement with EGMs, their understanding of the structural characteristics of EGMs, or their perceptions of risk associated with EGM gambling. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. Methods: Focus groups were conducted in Melbourne, Australia with n = 126 adults aged 55+, who had attended a club or pub in the last 12 months. Topics included EGM attitudes and behaviours, structural characteristics of EGMs, and the potential risks associated with EGM gambling. Thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. Results: For most participants, EGM gambling was secondary to their participation in other activities available within venues. Participants identified structural characteristics of EGMs; however, there were some misconceptions about how EGMs operated, including how or why machines paid out. Most participants perceived that they were not at risk of gambling harm because they engaged in “responsible” gambling practices such as setting limits. Conclusions: Older adults often engaged in EGM gambling because of its availability in community-based venues. Older adults’ perception that they are implementing responsible gambling practices may be increasing their susceptibility to harm. So what?: There is a need to reduce the availability and accessibility of EGMs in community settings and develop public education programs that are tailored to the needs of older adults. © 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association.

AB  - Background and aims: The aims were to examine how socio-demographics and gambling behavior relate to both primary and additional gambling motives, and whether the gambling motives change during a one-year-period. Methods: The Finnish Gambling Harms Survey data was used. Gambling motives were measured with a categorical question. Gambling severity was measured using the Problem and Pathological Gambling Measure (PPGM). Using the first-wave data including only past-year gamblers (n = 5,684), five logistic regression models were utilized to explore the associations of gambling motives with socio-demographics and gambling behavior. The stability of gambling motives was assessed with McNemar's test using longitudinal data (n = 2,078). Results: Gambling for positive feeling was associated with younger age, high income, high gambling involvement and at-risk gambling. Monetary motive was associated with female gender, high gambling involvement, online or mixed-mode and at-risk gambling. Supporting worthy causes was associated with older age, monthly and weekly gambling, and land-based gambling. Socializing was associated with younger age and gambling occasionally on land-based venues with multiple game types. Finally, the motive to escape was intensified among 25-34-year-olds, homemakers, and those with high gambling involvement and at-risk or problem gambling. Gambling motives remained relatively stable for one year. Discussion and conclusions: Gender and age profiles varied in different motives. Positive feeling, socializing and escape motive was heightened among younger respondents while supporting worthy causes was heightened among the oldest. Women gambled for money more often than men. Escape motive was associated with problem gambling. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm the longitudinal results. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Many people who experience harm and problems from gambling do not seek treatment from gambling treatment services because of personal and resource barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are widely used across diverse health care areas and populations. However, there are few in the gambling harm field, despite their potential as an additional modality for delivering treatment and support. Objective: This study aims to understand the needs, preferences, and priorities of people experiencing gambling harms and who are potential end users of a cognitive behavioral therapy mHealth intervention to inform design, features, and functions. Methods: Drawing on a mixed methods approach, we used creators and domain experts to review the GAMBLINGLESS web-based program and convert it into an mHealth prototype. Each module was reviewed against the original evidence base to maintain its intended fidelity and conceptual integrity. Early wireframes, design ideas (look, feel, and function), and content examples were developed to initiate discussions with end users. Using a cocreation process with a young adult, a Maori, and a Pasifika peoples group, all with experiences of problem or harmful gambling, we undertook 6 focus groups: 2 cycles per group. In each focus group, participants identified preferences, features, and functions for inclusion in the final design and content of the mHealth intervention. Results: Over 3 months, the GAMBLINGLESS web-based intervention was reviewed and remapped from 4 modules to 6. This revised program is based on the principles underpinning the transtheoretical model, in which it is recognized that some end users will be more ready to change than others. Change is a process that unfolds over time, and a nonlinear progression is common. Different intervention pathways were identified to reflect the end users' stage of change. In all, 2 cycles of focus groups were then conducted, with 30 unique participants (13 Maori, 9 Pasifika, and 8 young adults) in the first session and 18 participants (7 Maori, 6 Pasifika, and 5 young adults) in the second session. Prototype examples demonstrably reflected the focus group discussions and ideas, and the features, functions, and designs of the Manaaki app were finalized. Attributes such as personalization, cultural relevance, and positive framing were identified as the key. Congruence of the final app attributes with the conceptual frameworks of the original program was also confirmed. Conclusions: Those who experience gambling harms may not seek help. Developing and demonstrating the effectiveness of new modalities to provide treatment and support are required. mHealth has the potential to deliver interventions directly to the end user. Weaving the underpinning theory and existing evidence of effective treatment with end-user input into the design and development of mHealth interventions does not guarantee success. However, it provides a foundation for framing the intervention's mechanism, context, and content, and arguably provides a greater chance of demonstrating effectiveness. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - The burden of harm from problem gambling weighs heavily on those experiencing poverty and homelessness, yet most problem gambling prevention and treatment services are not designed to address the complex needs and challenges of this population. To redress this service gap, a multi-service agency within a shelter setting in a large urban centre developed and implemented a population-tailored, person-centred, evidence-informed gambling addiction program for its clients. The purpose of this article is to report on qualitative findings from an early evaluation of the program, the first designed to address problem gambling for people experiencing poverty and/or homelessness and delivered within a shelter service agency. Three themes emerged which were related to three program outcome categories. These included increasing awareness of gambling harms and reducing gambling behaviour; reorienting relationships with money; and, seeking, securing, and stabilizing shelter. The data suggest that problem gambling treatment within the context of poverty and homelessness benefits from an approach and setting that meets the unique needs of this community. The introduction of gambling treatment into this multi-service delivery model addressed the complex needs of the service users through integrated and person-centered approaches to care that responded to client needs, fostered therapeutic relationships, reduced experiences of discrimination and stigma, and enhanced recovery. In developing the Gambling Addiction Program, the agency drew on evidence-based approaches to problem gambling treatment and extensive experience working with the target population. Within a short timeframe, the program supported participants in the process of recovery, enhancing their understanding and control of their gambling selves, behaviours, and harms. This project demonstrates that gambling within the context of poverty requires a unique treatment space and approach. © 2022 Matheson et al.

AB  - Recent general population surveys have produced highly variable estimates of the extent of problem gambling in Great Britain, ranging from as low as 0.4% to as high as 2.7% of adults. This level of uncertainty over the true level of problem gambling creates difficulties for policy makers and those planning treatment and support services for individuals and families affected by problem gambling. In this article, we assess the extent to which differences in approaches to sampling and measurement between surveys contribute to variability in estimates of problem gambling. We compare estimates of problem gambling using the Problem Gambling Severity Index across eight different surveys conducted at approximately the same time but which use different sampling and measurement strategies. Our findings show that surveys conducted online produce substantially higher estimates of problem gambling compared with in-person interview surveys. This is because online surveys, whether using probability or non-probability sampling, overrepresent people who are more likely to gamble online and to gamble frequently, relative to the proportions of these groups in the general population. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - A number of studies have explored the relationship between religious beliefs and gambling (including gambling fallacies and gambling harm) but report seemingly contradictory findings. While some studies have found religious belief to be positively associated with gambling fallacies, others have found it to be a protective factor from gambling harms. One explanation for these differing effects is that gambling fallacies and metaphysical religious belief share properties of supernatural and magical thinking. Nevertheless, social support and moral strictures associated with religion might help protect against an unhealthy engagement with gambling. Using a multidimensional measure of religiosity, we hypothesised that only the supernatural facet of religious adherence would present a risk for gambling fallacies. We analysed two archival data sources collected in Canada (Quinte Longitudinal Study: N = 4121, Mage = 46, SDage = 14, Female = 54%; Leisure, Lifestyle and Lifecycle Project: N = 1372, Mage = 37, SDage = 17, Female = 56%). Using the Rohrbaugh–Jessor Religiosity Scale, we confirmed that the supernatural theistic domain of religion was a positive risk factor for gambling fallacies. However, participation in ritual (behavioural) aspects, such as churchgoing, was negatively associated with risk, and no effect was observed for the consequential (moral) domain. We conclude that multidimensional aspects in religious measures may account for conflicting prior findings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aims: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many treatment or help services for gambling were closed or moved online. At the same time, closures of gambling opportunities impacted gambling availability and practices. This study investigates gamblers’ and their concerned significant others’ (CSOs) experiences and views on treatment and help services during this exceptional time and perceptions on how to develop services further after the pandemic. Design: Three online questionnaires to elicit gambler and CSO experiences were conducted during the spring 2020 in Finland. In total, 847 respondents answered and shared experiences on how the situation had impacted their gambling behaviour and service needs, how service closures or the moving of services online had impacted them, and how they thought the prevention and treatment of gambling harms should be organised during and after COVID-19. Results: Changed gambling practices reduced overall service needs. Service closures had negative impacts, but online services were considered positively, as these provided a low-threshold option. Respondents also shared insights into how the service provision for gamblers should further be developed during and after COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to describe associations between playing predictor games and online sports betting behaviours, and problem gambling. Methods: An online survey using a convenience sample was completed by males aged 18 + years, living in the United Kingdom, and having participated in any gambling activity in the past year (n = 384). The survey asked questions about sociodemographics, gambling behaviours and predictor game playing behaviours. The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) tool was used to determine existence of at-risk and problem gambling. Bivariate analyses using X2, and multivariate analyses using binary logistic regressions were carried out. Results: Predictor games were played by 45.8% of all participants. In bivariate analyses, there was an association between predictor game playing and age (p = 0.019), with predictor game playing most prevalent in the age group 18–24 years 51.8%. In bivariate analysis, there was a significant graded relationship between playing predictor games and PGSI group (p &lt; 0.001), with predictor game playing most prevalent among those with problem gambling 76.9%. In multivariate analysis, after controlling for sociodemographics and PGSI group, those who played predictor games were 2.80 (1.65–4.74 p &lt; 0.001) times more likely to engage in high frequency online sports gambling than those who did not play predictor games. Conclusions: This study suggests there may be links between playing predictor games and gambling harms through increased frequency of online sports gambling, particularly amongst already vulnerable groups. Policy options placing restrictions on the most harmful inducements – one of which being predictor games – must be considered to protect against gambling harms. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose of Review: The gambling industry in Africa has seen substantial growth and evolution over recent years with a growing body of literature describing these shifts. Here, we provide a narrative synthesis of the extant literature on the origins, trends and consequences of the expansion and intensification of the commercial gambling industry in sub-Saharan Africa with a reference for future research on gambling as a growing public health concern. Recent Findings: The historical shift and permeation of gambling in sub-Saharan Africa is diverse with evidence of certain countries following a neo-colonial logic. Advances in technology have made gambling more accessible and created new markets in Africa. A key motive driving gambling on the continent is a lack of stable employment. While the intensification and growth of Africa’s gambling industry has brought economic benefits to some African investors and individuals, this has been accompanied by a range of gambling harms. Legislation and policies designed to better regulate the gambling industry and redress these harms are needed. In this context, a small number of services and campaigns designed to mitigate gambling harms demonstrate promise, but more research is needed in this area. Summary: The gambling industry in sub-Saharan Africa has undergone a dramatic transformation. While it is true that the growth of the African gambling industry has provided an additional revenue stream to governments, it is also necessary to acknowledge the concurrent rise in gambling addiction and the health-related and social harms that it elicits. As such, designing effective regulatory measures and policy interventions that can reduce the public health burden of gambling harms is vital. However, these interventions need to take in to account the significance of cultural differences that exist among countries on the continent. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study explored how the use of smartphones can influence sports betting by young adults, compared to using computers and land-based betting facilities. Interviews with 33 Australians aged 18–29 years, who bet regularly on sports, esports, and/or fantasy sports, were analysed using adaptive grounded theory. Seven major themes related to platform functionality, sourcing betting information, physical accessibility, financial accessibility, social influences, privacy, and marketing. The grounded theory model depicts how features of smartphones, online gambling, and betting apps combine in smartphone betting to provide instantaneous access to betting, anywhere and at any time, to facilitate harmful betting behaviours. These behaviours included increased betting participation, frequency and expenditure, placing a wider variety of bets, impulsive and spontaneous betting, placing riskier bets with longer odds, chasing losses, and acting on social encouragement to bet. These findings can inform harm minimisation measures, regulation, and policy. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: A public health approach to gambling has been accompanied by a wide understanding of gambling harms. This has led to the creation of conceptual frameworks to understand and itemize different gambling-related harms, dimensions of harms, and subjects of harms. The current paper presents a comparative review and synthesis of existing harm frameworks. Method: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic literature review on existing harm frameworks in five scientific databases across the years 2000–2021. We included studies that aimed at creating a conceptual framework or synthesis of different level gambling harms at a population level. The final sample consists of seven papers that present four different models. Results: Gambling-related harms span health, psychological, relationship, financial, cultural, work, and crime-related issues. Harms accrue to individuals (heavy gamblers, non-problem gamblers and nongamblers), but also to families, communities, and societies. Harms form a spectrum in terms of severity and temporality. Risk factors or determinants of gambling are often similar to the harmful consequences of gambling. Conclusions: The results are discussed in terms of gaps in current understanding of gambling harms, including increased communication between models, increased focus on severity levels and issues of causality, and a better incorporation of harms that stem from gambling provision rather than harmful gambling consumption. We conclude that framing harms as consequences of individual behavior remains predominant, and a shift of focus to the social and commercial determinants of gambling harms is needed. This also includes the development of societal level harm screening. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Legacy gambling harm refers to adverse consequences that extend past the period where people are actively gambling at harmful levels. These harms can affect the gambler, people close to them and the wider community. This article reviews current research that investigates legacy harms; the types of legacy harm, how long they last and whether evidence suggests these harms are real or instead imagined injuries or reflections on past regrets. Recent Findings: Legacy harms to individuals can be broadly categorised as including financial, relationship, emotional/psychological, health, culture, work/study and criminal/deviance harms. In addition, legacy harms affect entire communities by drawing funds and social capital away from vulnerable communities, leaving them socially, culturally and materially impoverished. Most legacy harms that accrue to gamblers have a half-life of 4 years, although financial harms last somewhat longer at 5 years. Greater distance in time from a past gambling issue is reliably and positively related to health and well-being indicators, including the Health Utility Index and the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index, which suggests that legacy gambling harms are real and have a lasting impact on well-being, rather than just imagined hardship from prior gambling difficulties. Summary: These findings suggest programme and policy development to support gamblers in reducing and managing their legacy harms, rather than focusing only on relapse prevention. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Until now, there has been no evidence-based, specific advice for people who gamble who want to reduce their risk of experiencing gambling harms. This paper presents the results from the first large-scale, comprehensive, international project to develop lower-risk gambling guidelines. Specifically, we calculated relative risk estimates to determine risk of harm across the range of possible limits for gambling frequency, expenditure, and number of types of gambling engaged in; conducted an online survey (n = 4583) of people who gamble to assess whether they understood and found credible the proposed quantitative limits; conducted a series of interviews and focus groups with people who gamble to assess self-control strategies and reactions to proposed quantitative limits; conducted a meta-analysis of problem gambling risk factors in the general population; and consulted with a pan-Canadian, multi-sectoral committee of stakeholders. Project outcomes were examined and deliberated by a working group of scientists who decided upon a set of recommendations for lower-risk gambling. This paper presents these recommendations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Issues addressed: Research is needed to understand young people's perspectives about public health promotion strategies relevant for their health and wellbeing. This study provides suggestions from young male gamblers about sports betting harm prevention and reduction strategies. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 young men aged 18 to 24 years, from Melbourne, Victoria, who regularly engaged in sports betting. A critical qualitative inquiry approach, using methods of constructivist grounded theory guided the study. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret and construct themes from the data. Results: Participants indicated three main harm prevention strategies. These were online consumer protection and regulatory strategies, public education campaigns that highlighted sports betting risks and harms and the creation of formal and informal support networks to reduce stigma and encourage help seeking. They also supported being engaged in the development of harm prevention strategies and suggested ways to help reduce barriers to engagement. Conclusion: Young men recognise the need for regulatory, education and engagement responses to counter the risks posed by new gambling products. Young men may be difficult to engage in formal prevention activities, however, youth-led and informal interactive mechanisms may help to overcome this barrier, and contribute to a comprehensive public health approach to gambling harm prevention. So what?: Young men can draw upon their lived experiences of gambling to provide insights relevant for public health promotion. Mechanisms should be developed to engage young people in the co-production of strategies and policies aimed at gambling harm prevention and reduction. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study explored women’s gambling in response to male intimate partner violence (IPV). Twenty-four women were recruited through service providers and online advertising. All women had been victimised by IPV and all experienced problems relating to the gambling on electronic gaming machines (EGMs). Thematic analysis of their in-depth interviews identified three major themes. The main pattern of gambling and IPV (Theme 1) was where ongoing coercive control preceded the woman’s gambling. Situational violence in response to gambling was also observed. Regardless of temporal sequence, a self-perpetuating cycle of gambling and IPV victimisation was typically apparent, with both issues escalating over time. Reflecting severe traumatic violence, push factors from IPV that motivated the women’s gambling (Theme 2) included physical escape, psychological escape, hope of regaining control over their lives, and gambling to cope with the legacy of abuse. Pull factors attracting these women to gambling venues (Theme 3) appeared to have heightened appeal to these victims of IPV. These included venues’ social, geographic and temporal accessibility, allowance for uninterrupted play on EGMs, and the addictive nature of EGMs. These push and pull factors led to these women’s prolonged and harmful gambling while exacerbating their partner’s violence. Concerted efforts are needed to assist women in this cycle of IPV and gambling, prevent violence against women, and reduce harmful gambling products and environments. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Social casino games have achieved widespread popularity, and are accessed by more than 85 million people each day. Yet, why people play social casino games is largely unknown. To address this gap, an inductive approach was taken to better understand the motives for playing social casino games, as well as the motives for transitioning from social casino gaming to gambling and vice versa. To this end, 269 social casino gamers were asked to provide a ranked list of their motives for playing social casino games. Additionally, we asked participants their motivations for transitioning from gambling to social casino gaming (n = 202) or vice versa (n = 67). A total of 795, 605, and 201 unique responses describing motives for playing social casino games, transitioning from social casino gaming to gambling, and transitioning from gambling to social casino gaming, respectively, were analyzed using a thematic content analysis. The most frequently endorsed motive for playing social casino games was for enhancement (e.g., fun, challenge). Participants also noted playing to earn rewards, including money, and for social reasons. Several motives linked social casino game play to gambling. These included: to hone gambling-related ‘skills’, a desire to transition to gambling to win real money, and as a gambling harm-reduction strategy. Motives for playing social casino games did not differ significantly between those who first gambled and then transitioned to social casino gaming and vice versa, suggesting that once people begin playing social casino games, they have similar motives for continued engagement. The present study contributes to understanding the immense popularity of social casino games and their links to gambling. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Gambling poses a global threat to public health due to its far-reaching impacts. Research has demonstrated a ripple effect of harmful gambling on social network members and broader communities. While researchers have documented extreme harms associated with an affected other, limited research has qualitatively investigated how women describe their concerns about the gambling of a social network member, and any subsequent negative impacts on their own lives. Methods: An online panel survey was conducted with women aged 18 years and older, who gambled at least once in the last 12 months, and resided in the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales. This paper focused on the open text responses of a subsection of the sample (n = 136) who reported being negatively impacted by someone else's gambling. The study utilised reflexive thematic analysis to interpret the data. Results: Results indicated that women were concerned about the gambling behaviours of a broad range of social network members. Open text responses regarding the nature of these concerns mostly related to individualised paradigms of gambling behaviour – including whether the participant perceived their network member could afford to gamble, was being responsible with their gambling, or were gambling too frequently. Participants experienced a range of negative impacts including significant financial issues, relationship difficulties, poorer emotional wellbeing as a result of worrying about the gambler, and loss of trust. Some described the negative experiences associated with growing up with a parent who gambled. Conclusion: The research demonstrates the broad impacts of gambling on affected others. This study enhances our understanding of how women are harmed by gambling and considers the complexities of their experiences and relationships with the gambler. This extends knowledge beyond quantitative descriptors of harm among affected others and provides a critical reflection on the nuances of women's experiences with gambling and gambling harm. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Academics, gambling regulators, and the gambling industry increasingly espouse a shared responsibility view of preventing gambling harm, considering individual gamblers and external stakeholders (e.g., gambling industry employees, government regulators, and public health workers) to be jointly responsible for this task. This study is the third in a series exploring gamblers’ beliefs about responsibility for preventing gambling harm. Method: A sample of 4,336 subscribers to MGM Resorts International (MGM)’s loyalty card program as of January 2020 completed a web-based survey. Results:We observed that 58.1%of participants only held individual gamblers responsible for helping prevent gambling harm. However, two factors increased the likelihood of holding a shared responsibility viewpoint and assigning responsibility to casinos for reducing gambling harm: (a) scoring positive on the Brief Biosocial Gambling Screen (BBGS) or an Expanded Problem Gambling Screen (EPGS) and (b) being aware of GameSense, an onsite responsible gambling education program. Those who screened positive on the BBGS or EPGS also were more likely than their counterparts to deny personal responsibility for minimizing gambling harm to individual gamblers; that is, they were more likely to hold a purely external responsibility viewpoint. A meta-analytic year-over-year comparison revealed that compared to being aware of GameSense, screening positive for problem gambling was more strongly associated with assigning responsibility to casinos for minimizing gambling harm. Conclusions: We discuss these findings in the context of self-determination theory and suggest implications for health promotion and best practices for message design in responsible gambling programs © 2021.

AB  - Esports betting and skin gambling involve betting on the outcomes of video game competitions and/or using virtual currencies for betting. The present study evaluated a conceptual model linking video game involvement, video-game related gambling, traditional gambling, and gambling problems and harm. Data were collected via a cross-sectional online survey with 737 participants aged 18 + who engaged in esports cash betting (n = 576), esports skin betting (n = 184), or skin gambling on games of chance (n = 330). The findings highlighted the distinctly different relationships esports cash betting versus skin gambling had with traditional gambling involvement and harmful gambling. Gambling with skins on games of chance was predictive of gambling problems and gambling harm after controlling for participation in traditional gambling (OR = 1.32 and 1.17 respectively). Whereas betting on esports with cash was associated with betting on a variety of other forms of gambling, and there was no unique contribution to problems and harm over and above participation on these other forms (e.g., EGMs, sports betting). Skin gambling is directly implicated in gambling problems and harm, whereas cash betting on esports is only indicative of interest in many forms of potentially harmful gambling. Greater research attention to skin gambling is warranted, and particularly with respect to its role as a virtual currency more easily accessible for gambling. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Online wagering has expanded significantly in recent decades and has emerged as a serious public health issue. Research investigating online wagering has predominantly used quantitative methods to explore the determinants that influence young men’s engagement with these products, with fewer qualitative insights. Social practice theory offers a framework in which to qualitatively analyse how online wagering practices are shaped, modified, and evolve. This study explored the online wagering practices of sixteen, 18–24 year old, young men, in Victoria, Australia. In-depth, qualitative interviews explored the contexts and motivations in their early and current wagering practices and the influence of social and structural conditions. Data were interpreted using a reflexive approach to thematic analysis. The data were theoretically conceptualised through a social practice lens, focusing on materials, meanings, and competencies. Materials included social networks and spaces, and wagering infrastructure and marketing. Meanings encompassed peer belongingness and bonding. Perceived competencies included an exaggerated confidence that influenced the type of gambling chosen and perceived spending strategies to achieve financial gain. Importantly, these three elements intersected to form a bundle of wagering practices. Interrupting the interconnection of these bundles may form the basis of public health intervention. Public health research must also continue to monitor how online wagering practices evolve and change in response to a range of interacting determinants and move away from a focus on the individual. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: While it is a generally accepted fact that many gambling screening tools are not fit for purpose when employed as part of a public health framework, the evidence supporting this claim is sporadic. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the gambling screening tools currently in use and examine their utility as part of a public health approach to harm reduction, providing a holistic snapshot of the field. Methods: A range of index tests measuring aspects of problem gambling were examined, including the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) and the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), among others. This review also examined a range of reference standards including the Diagnostic Interview for Gambling Severity (DIGS) and screening tools such as the SOGS. Results: The present review supports the belief held by many within the gambling research community that there is a need for a paradigm shift in the way gambling harm is conceptualised and measured, to facilitate early identification and harm prevention. Discussion: This review has identified a number of meaningful deficits regarding the overall quality of the psychometric testing employed when validating gambling screening tools. Primary among these was the lack of a consistent and reliable reference standard within many of the studies. Currently there are very few screening tools discussed in the literature that show good utility in the domain of public health, due to the focus on symptoms rather than risk factors. As such, these tools are generally ill-suited for identifying preclinical or low-risk gamblers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: The ability to accurately recall past gambling behavior and outcomes is essential for making informed decisions about future gambling. We aimed to determine whether online gambling customers can accurately recall their recent gambling outcomes and betting frequency. Method: An online survey was distributed to 40,000 customers of an Australian sports and race wagering website which asked participants to recall their past 30-day net outcome (i.e., total amount won or lost) and number of bets. We compared responses to these questions with participants’ actual outcomes as provided by the online site. Results: Among the 514 participants who reported their net outcome, only 21 (4.09%) were accurate within a 10% margin of their actual outcome. Participants were most likely to underestimate their losses (N = 333, 64.79%). Lower actual net losses were associated with greater underestimation and overestimation of losses. Of the 652 participants who reported their gambling frequency, 48 (7.36%) were accurate within a 10% margin of their actual frequency. Most participants underestimated their number of bets (N = 454, 69.63%). Higher actual betting frequencies were associated with underestimating betting and lower actual frequencies with overestimating betting. Conclusions: The poor recall accuracy we observed suggests public health approaches to gambling harm minimization that assume people make informed decisions about their future bets based on past outcomes and available funds should be reconsidered. Findings also question the reliability of research outcomes predicated on self-reported gambling behavior. Research is needed to determine the best methods of increasing people’s awareness of their actual expenditure and outcomes. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - Problem gambling can have negative impacts on both harmed gamblers, and those people close to them (concerned significant others; CSOs). Experiencing these gambling-related harms can have a significant impact on a person’s wellbeing and quality of life. Recently, the focus of research on people with gambling problems has expanded from exploring gambling-related harms and specific psychological outcomes, to include global evaluations of health and wellbeing. However, it is also important to understand the degree to which these impacts extend to CSOs. This narrative literature review presents what is known about the impact of gambling-related harms on CSOs’ wellbeing and identifies areas of future enquiry. The review identified both knowledge and methodological gaps, including that relatively little is known about impacts to CSOs’ subjective wellbeing. What is known, is confounded by different methods of identifying CSOs across studies, and the use of predominantly small, non-representative, and treatment-related samples. Addressing these gaps will lead to a greater understanding of the impact of problem gambling on the community. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Women make up a significant proportion of all gamblers globally. However, there has been limited research which has explored women’s gambling and the factors that may make women, and subgroups of women, vulnerable to harm. Methods: Using a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 women aged 55 years and over who regularly gambled on electronic gambling machines (EGMs). Results Key factors were identified to illustrate older women’s experiences of gambling and are presented according to four determinants of health: Individual; socio-cultural; environmental; and commercial. While this research confirms that older women’s gambling behaviors are strongly influenced by individual and socio-cultural factors, gambling environments, and industry practices are also influential. Conclusion A model illustrates the interplay of individual, socio-cultural, environmental, and commercial determinants, and the article proposes how they may contribute to gambling harm in older Australian women. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Gambling harm affects men and women relatively equally, and gender influences the social determinants of gambling harm. Responses to preventing and minimising women’s gambling harm have been shaped and constrained by population research identifying male gender as a key risk factor for gambling problems. Gender analysis in gambling studies is rare and has lacked theoretical underpinning and coherence, limiting possibilities for gender-responsive and gender-aware harm prevention and reduction activities. Methods: Two influential qualitative studies of gambling harm in New Zealand (involving total n = 165 people who gambled, affected others, community leaders, gambling and community support service providers, policy makers and academics) neglected to explore the role of gender. This study revisited data collected in these studies, using thematic analysis informed by feminist social constructionist theory. The overarching research questions were: How do gender-related issues, notions and practices influence women’s gambling related harm? What are the implications for women’s gambling harm reduction? Results: Women’s socio-cultural positioning as primary caregivers for families and children constrained their ability to access a range of recreational and support options and increased the attractiveness of local gambling opportunities as accessible and ‘safe’ outlets for stress reduction. Patriarchal practices of power and control within family contexts operated to maintain gambling behaviour, shut down alternative recreational opportunities, and limit women’s autonomy. Consideration of these themes in relation to current health promotion practice in New Zealand revealed that national programmes and strategies appear to be operating without cognisance of these gender dynamics and therefore have the potential to exacerbate or cause some women harm. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the value of theoretically informed gender analysis for gambling harm reduction research, policy and practice. International guidelines for gender-aware and gender-responsive health research and practice should be engaged as a foundation for strategic and effective gambling harm reduction programmes, projects, research and policy, and as an essential part of developing and implementing interventions for gambling harm. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Unlike in other Nordic countries, most of the electronic gambling machines (EGMs) are placed outside the Casino Helsinki and the gambling arcades in Finland. The placement of EGMs in non-casino locations, such as supermarkets, kiosks, and petrol stations, is matter of serious concern. We argue that availability and accessibility of EGMs has led to normalisation and banalisation of gambling in Finland. Exposure to EGMs also put at risk vulnerable populations and problem gamblers, who already suffer from the negative consequences of gambling harms. Gambling companies’ self-regulation initiatives and corporate social responsibility programmes are not enough to prevent and limit EGM related gambling harms. We suggest that Finland should follow Norway’s example and limit the availability of EGMs and transfer them from non-casino locations to gambling arcades. Finnish EGM policy should be a question of public policy guided by public health concerns. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Gambling-related harm is an increasing recognised problem internationally. Recent years have seen an explosion in opportunities to gamble, both in person and online. Health and other care settings have the potential to act as screening sites to identify and support gamblers who may be at high risk of experiencing gambling-related harm. This study aimed to identify interventions to screen for risk of gambling-related harm in the general population which may be delivered in health, care and support settings. Methods: Systematic review. Searches of key databases and grey sources since 2012 were undertaken in October 2019. Electronic database searches generated a total of 5826 unique hits. Nine studies published 2013–2019, along with thirteen grey literature documents met our eligibility criteria. The criteria were setting (health, care and support settings), participants (any attendee in help, care and support settings), interventions (screening to identify risk of harm from gambling behaviours) and outcome measures (gambling behaviours, service use). Results: Three papers evaluating screening interventions delivered in general practice (repeat visits and written advice), mental health service (the use of screening tools to identify risk of harm), and substance abuse treatment (intensive outpatient treatment for substance use disorders or methadone maintenance) indicated evidence of potential effectiveness. Six papers supported the feasibility and acceptability of delivering interventions in various settings. Grey literature reports described the implementation of interventions such as training materials, and transfer of interventions developed for substance abuse populations by practitioners. Conclusions: Health, care and support services offer potentially important contexts in which to identify and offer support to people who are at risk of gambling related harm. Screening interventions appear feasible and acceptable in a range of community and healthcare settings for those at risk of gambling harm. Evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening in these populations should therefore be prioritised. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Here we present a systematic review of the existing research into gambling harms, in order to determine whether there are differences in the presentation of these across demographic groups such as age, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status, or gambling behaviour categories such as risk severity and participation frequency. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Inclusion criteria were: 1) focus on gambling harms; 2) focus on harms to the gambler rather than affected others; 3) discussion of specific listed harms and not just harms in general terms. Exclusion criteria were: 1) research of non-human subjects; 2) not written in English; 3) not an empirical study; 4) not available as a full article. Methods: We conducted a systematic search using the Web of Science and Scopus databases in August 2020. Assessment of quality took place using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria. Results: A total of 59 studies published between 1994 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria. These were categorised into thematic groups for comparison and discussion. There were replicated differences found in groups defined by age, socioeconomic status, education level, ethnicity and culture, risk severity, and gambling behaviours. Conclusion: Harms appear to be dependent on specific social, demographic and environmental conditions that suggests there is a health inequality in gambling related harms. Further investigation is required to develop standardised measurement tools and to understand confounding variables and co-morbidities. With a robust understanding of harms distribution in the population, Primary Care Workers will be better equipped to identify those who are at risk, or who are showing signs of Gambling Disorder, and to target prevention and intervention programmes appropriately. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Advances in technology and increased usage of electronic mobile devices over the past decade have changed the way gamblers engage with online gambling. The convenience of mobile electronic devices is understood to be a major contributor to the increase of online gambling, which in turn has been implicated in the growth of sports betting. Emerging evidence suggests several sources of differentiation between mobile and other online gambling, which have important psychological implications. Given the inherent differences, we cannot conclude that evidence for the effectiveness of treatment for non-smartphone problem gambling (PG) automatically translates to online smartphone sports betting PG. The aim of this study, therefore, was to describe the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of cue exposure therapy (CET) to treat individuals presenting to a community-based PG therapy service with an online smartphone sports betting addiction, using a case series design. Six men (21–42 years old) received up to 10 weekly 60-min manualised CET sessions. Outcome measures were gambling harm, gambling urge, gambling cognitions, psychological distress, and functional impairment. All six participants completed a course of CET averaging 8.33 sessions (SD = 1.75) and reported improvement across each of the outcome measures. Psychological distress scores had reduced to the non-clinical range for all six participants and five participants scored below the cut offs for PG and functional impairment at 1 month follow up. The findings provide preliminary proof of concept evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of CET for online smartphone sports betting addiction. © 2021, Crown.

AB  - Purpose: Harms due to excessive gambling can be experienced by gamblers and those close to them. Family gambling problems (FGPs) are currently under-researched, particularly in population-representative samples. This study aimed to identify prevalence, risk factors, and the complex of stressors and health-related consequences associated with FGPs, as well as isolating the impact of FGPs on physical and psychological health problems. Methods: We analysed data from the National Health Survey 2011–13, a large (N = 15,475) nationally representative sample of Australian adults. Participants reported on the presence of 14 family stressors (including FGPs), self-assessed health status, and risky health behaviours. Psychological impact was measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10, as well as several indicators of the presence of mental health problems. Results: Overall, 1.7% of households reported a FGP. Interviewees in these households reported three times the number of other stressors than those without a FGP. In addition, they were around eight times more likely to be experiencing other addictions (drug and alcohol related problems) and stressors associated with socially deviant behaviours (trouble with police, abuse or violent crime, and witness to violence). Once age, gender, socioeconomic disadvantage, and other stressors were controlled for, FGPs significantly predicted lower self-assessed health and higher psychological distress. Conclusions: FGPs occur within a complex of other addictions and stressors, impacting the quality of life of people close to problem gambling. The findings are discussed in relation to their support for General Strain Theory (Agnew, Criminology 30:47–87, 1992). © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and aims: It is common for gambling research to focus on problem and disordered gambling. Less is known about the prevalence of gambling-related harms among people in the general population. This study aimed to develop and validate the 18-item version of the Short Gambling Harms Screen (SGHS-18). Methods: Population-representative web-based and postal surveys were conducted in the three geographical areas of Finland (n = 7186, aged 18 or older). Reliability and internal structure of SGHS-18 was assessed using coefficient omega and via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Four measurement models of SGHS-18 were compared: one-factor, six-factor, a second-ordered factor model and a bifactor model (M4). Results: The analysis revealed that only the bifactor model had adequate fit for SGHS-18 (CFI = 0.953, TLI = 0.930, GFI = 0.974, RMSEA = 0.047, SRMR = 0.027). The general factor explained most of the common variance compared to specific factors. Coefficient omega hierarchical value for global gambling harm factor (0.80) was high, which suggested that SGHS-18 assessed the combination of general harm constructs sufficiently. The correlation with the Problem and Pathological Gambling Measures (PPGM) was 0.44, potentially reflecting that gambling harms are closely—although not perfectly—aligned with the mental health issue of problem gambling. SGHS-18 scores were substantially higher for participants who gambled more often, who spent more money or who had gambling problems, demonstrating convergent validity for the screen. Discussion: The SGHS-18 comprehensively measures the domains of gambling harm, while demonstrating desirable properties of internal consistency, and criterion and convergent validity. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background and aim: Examining risk-curves is important to understanding the degree to which indices of gambling consumption are associated with gambling-related harm. Risk-curves have largely been described as J-shaped, suggesting that at low levels of consumption harm remain constant but then increase sharply at a certain threshold. Alternative methods in recent work, however, have described risk-curves as linear and R-shaped, indicating that risk of harm increases as consumption increases at all levels of consumption. The aim of the current study is to estimate the shape of gambling risk-curves using competing methods. Design: Systematic comparison of gambling risk-curves using categorical (via plots) and continuous (via bootstrapped regression analyses) operationalizations of gambling consumption. Setting and participants. Data were 2873 gamblers (1417 women) from the fourth Social and Economic Impact Study of Gambling in Tasmania. Measurements: Gambling-related harm was assessed using the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and Short Gambling Harm Screen (SGHS). Gambling consumption was assessed as annual frequency, expenditure and expenditure as a proportion of income. Findings: Categorical gambling consumption data plotted with equal magnitudes evidenced J-shaped risk-curves. When the magnitude of gambling categories was re-scaled to the mid-points, risk-curves no longer appeared J-shaped. Additionally, bootstrapped regression analyses using the continuous gambling consumption data did not provide evidence for J-shaped risk-curves. Conclusions: Gambling risk-curves in Tasmania appear not to be J-shaped, but rather suggest that risk of gambling-related harm increases with even small increases in gambling consumption. © 2021 Society for the Study of Addiction

AB  - The internet raises substantial challenges for policy makers in regulating gambling harm. The proliferation of gambling advertising on Twitter is one such challenge. However, the sheer scale renders it extremely difficult to investigate using conventional techniques. In this article, the authors present three U.K. Twitter gambling advertising studies using both big data analytics and manual content analysis to explore the volume and content of gambling ads, the age and engagement of followers, and compliance with U.K. advertising regulations. They analyze 890,000 organic ads from 417 accounts along with data on 620,000 followers and 457,000 engagements (replies and retweets). They find that approximately 41,000 U.K. children follow Twitter gambling accounts, and that two-thirds of gambling advertising tweets fail to fully comply with regulations. Ads for e-sports gambling are markedly different from those for traditional gambling (such as on soccer, casinos, and lotteries) and appear to have strong appeal for children, with 28% of engagements with e-sports gambling ads coming from users under 16 years old. The authors make six policy recommendations: spotlight e-sports gambling advertising, create new social media–specific regulations, revise regulation on content appealing to children, use technology to block users under 18 years from seeing gambling ads, require ad labeling of organic gambling tweets, and deploy better enforcement. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Strategies such as behavioural substitution, self-monitoring, social support as well as planning and urge management can assist gamblers to limit or reduce their gambling behaviours. Not all gamblers implement strategies before, during or after gambling, even though the use of strategies is recommended by the gambling and treatment industry. Australian gamblers completed an online survey with follow-up (n = 411) to determine the predictors of intention to use strategies and the actual use of strategies. Results indicated 92% of gamblers attempted at least one strategy to stick to their limits over the 30-day period (median = 30 strategies, IQR = 11 to 56). Gamblers indicated a positive attitude towards strategy engagement and perceived themselves as having control over their use but the role that important others (e.g., family members) could play in strategy implementation warrants further examination. To improve strategy engagement, prevention and intervention programmes should target factors associated with intentions rather than focusing on behaviour. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Question-order effects are known to occur in surveys, particularly those that measure subjective experiences. The presence of context effects will impact the comparability of results if questions have not been presented in a consistent manner. In this study, we examined the influence of question order on how people responded to two gambling scales in the Australian Capital Territory Gambling Prevalence Survey: The Problem Gambling Severity Index and the Short Gambling Harm Screen. The application of these scales in gambling surveys is continuing to grow, the results being compared across time and between jurisdictions, countries, and populations. Here we outline a survey experiment that randomized the question ordering of these two scales. The results show that question-order effects are present for these scales, demonstrating that results from them may not be comparable across jurisdictions if the scales have not been presented consistently across surveys. These findings highlight the importance of testing for the presence of question-order effects, particularly for those scales that measure subjective experiences, and correcting for such effects where they exist by randomizing scale order. © 2021, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

AB  - Aims This study explores the prevalence of being a past-year affected other (AO) of a problem gambler by gender. The aims were to study the amount and type of gambling-related harms (GRHs) for subgroups of AOs and to distinguish GRH profiles for AO subgroups. Methods A total of 7186 adults aged 18 years and over participated in the Gambling Harms Survey evaluating year 2016. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Results Of all respondents, 12.9% were defined as past-year AOs (women 13.7%; men 12.1%). The proportion of affected non-family members (ANFs) was 8.4%, and 5.6% were affected family members (AFMs). AFMs were usually women, and ANFs were usually men. Emotional, relationship, and financial harms were the most common types of harm. The odds of experiencing financial harm were highest for the 18-to 34-year-olds (OR 1.82) and for those whose partner/ex-partner had a gambling problem (OR 3.91). Having a parent/step-parent (OR 1.93) and child/stepchild (OR 3.64) increased the odds of experiencing emotional harm, whereas male gender (OR 0.50) and being an ANF (OR 0.58) decreased emotional harm. Relationship harm was evident for partners/ex-partners (OR 1.97–5.07). Conclusions GRH profiles for AO subgroups varied, which emphasizes the need for effective harm minimization strategies for those in need. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The Pareto effect (also known as the 80/20 rule) describes a skewed distribution of engagement that is observed for many products. In this study, we investigated Pareto estimates for online casino gambling, and tested their association with voluntary self-exclusion (VSE) as a marker of gambling harm, and examined their sensitivity to varying time windows. We used one year of betting data from the eCasino section of a provincially-run gambling website in British Columbia, Canada. The data contained 30,920 account holders who placed at least one bet on the platform from October 2014 to September 2015. The top 20% most engaged gamblers accounted for 92% (based on total number of bets) and 90% (based on net losses) of eCasino gambling activity over the year. The top 20% of online gamblers displayed higher levels of VSE enrolment than the remaining 80% (total bets: 13% vs 7%; net losses: 16% vs 6%, respectively). Pareto estimates increased with longer time windows, from one month to one year (total bets: 80% to 92%; net losses: 81% to 90%, respectively). This accumulation was driven by the relative loyalty of the most engaged gamblers, coupled with the influx of new and more transient gamblers on a month-to-month basis. These data strengthen links between concentrations of engagement with online products and measures of harm, but also highlight the dynamic nature of these estimates. One year estimates are preferable for estimating the degree of concentration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasingly, industry operators and governments espouse the view that they play a role in minimizing gambling harm and have developed and implemented programs and policies designed to promote responsible gambling. However, little is known about gamblers’ perceptions of responsibility for minimizing gambling harm or whether these perceptions are linked to gamblers’ own experience of gambling harm. Gamblers’ perceptions of stakeholder responsibility for minimizing gambling harm could impact not only their gambling behavior but also the potential for legal action following excessive financial loss. We surveyed participants selected from MGM Resorts International (MGM)’s loyalty card database (N = 3748) regarding their perceptions of responsibility for minimizing gambling harm. Additionally, we administered the Brief Biosocial Gambling Screen (BBGS), the Positive Play Scale, and measures assessing participants’ understanding of gambling concepts and use of responsible gambling strategies. Compared to those who screened negative, participants who screened positive on the BBGS had more diffuse conceptions of responsibility for minimizing gambling harm and were more likely to hold five particular stakeholder groups (e.g., MGM Resorts employees, government regulators, public safety officials) responsible. In multivariate analyses, participants’ distributed sense of responsibility for reducing gambling harm predicted their BBGS status over and above other risk factors (i.e., Positive Play, understanding of gambling concepts, use of responsible gambling strategies). We discuss implications for responsible gambling programs and policies. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: Gambling is a public health concern, given the multiplicity of harms for individuals, families and communities. This article reports on the commissioning and delivery of a problem gambling treatment service in a metropolitan area in England, where the concentration of problem gambling is often higher than the national average. Study design: This is a cross-sectional study, using purposively sampled ‘experts’ and stakeholders involved in the conception and set-up of the service. Methods: Individual semistructured interviews were used to ascertain the depth of information required to fully appreciate the nuances and complexities of the service. Eight participants took part in the interviews, with an additional respondent providing written comments in relation to the interview schedule as a workaround to accommodate the organisational impacts of COVID-19. Results: The article identifies several factors contributing to the successful delivery of the service. Well-managed collaborative provision with expertise from across sectors is critical, but this needs to be balanced against the challenges faced by bridging cultural variances in practice and language. Adopting evidence-based models of delivery was central to practice, and moreover, geographical location is a key consideration to encourage access for those facing gambling problems and discourage feelings of stigma. Conclusions: This article offers a unique contribution to understanding more about the provision of gambling treatment services. This is crucial, given that a greater number of people face challenges as a consequence of gambling harms, and such services should be seen part of forming a coherent public health response. © 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Background: In Britain, unprecedented restrictions on daily life associated with the Covid-19 pandemic included the suspension of professional sports events during the initial ‘lockdown’. This provides opportunities to observe changes in sports bettors’ behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. Methods: In July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n = 3866). Bi-variate analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during Britain's initial ‘lockdown’ (March-June 2020). Results: 29.8% of male sports bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown (OR = 2.50 [95% CI 1.38–4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during lockdown (OR = 4.21 [1.99–8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons. Poorer wellbeing was associated with problem gambling for men and MRPG for women. Conclusions: Those changing gambling behaviours during the initial Covid-19 lockdown (e.g. increasing gambling frequency or starting a new gambling activity) are potentially vulnerable to gambling harms. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Aims: This article assesses the efficiency of six Nordic state-controlled gambling companies in raising revenue for their host societies, and the terms under which they operate. Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have established gambling monopolies on the grounds that they help to prevent fraud and money laundering, and channel proceeds to their host societies. Within the last decade, Denmark (2012) and Sweden (2019) have opened substantial parts of their gambling markets to competition, whereas Finland and Norway continue to uphold monopolies. Design: The analysis is based on publicly disclosed income statements and financial reporting concerning Nordic gambling operators for the year 2017. We calculated how much they contribute to societies, what are the costs, and how these figures compare among the companies. Results: We found that Veikkaus raises the highest amounts of surplus to society both in absolute terms and in relative numbers, and that, overall, the companies vary in efficiency. We discuss the reasons for these differences, focusing on their respective product portfolios, institutional frameworks and competitive market positions. Conclusions: The results problematise the measurement of efficiency in gambling companies in monetary terms. Efficiency depends on high total consumption with little regard to the principles of responsible gambling and the prevention of gambling problems. Nordic countries have a strong commitment to the protection of health, but in the case of gambling, protecting the monopoly seems to outweigh harm prevention. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This systematic literature review evaluates the potential of gambling monopolies to affect gambling harms. It compares the occurrence of gambling harms in jurisdictions with gambling monopolies to jurisdictions with license-based regimes. Recent Findings: The review identified 21 publications concerning three gambling-related harm indicators: problem gambling prevalence, total consumption, and the appearance of conflicts of interest. Due to the dearth of literature, concept papers and older publications were also included. Summary: Results show that there is a paucity of empirical research on the effectiveness of different regulatory regimes in affecting gambling harms. Available research demonstrates that monopolistic regimes appear to perform somewhat better in terms of problem gambling prevalence and total consumption but may also be more prone to conflicts of interest than license-based regimes. Monopolistic configurations also differ between themselves, and issues such as availability, accessibility, product range, scope of preventive work, monitoring, as well as the recognition of the public health approach may better predict the levels of harm in society than the existence of a monopoly. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose of Review: The slot machine zone describes a ‘trance-like’ state of diminished attention to time passing and gambling-irrelevant events during Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) use. This article summarizes two prominent theoretical accounts of this state and articulates a new account that seeks to integrate them. Recent Findings: Zone experiences are correlated with gambling problems and may be amplified by specific features of EGMs and other modern gambling formats. Links with excitement, relaxation, and depression have been found, implicating both positive and negative reinforcement processes. Emerging evidence suggests gamblers in the zone are more focused on EGM use (‘zoned in’). Models rooted in either Flow Theory or dissociation do not fully account for these effects. Summary: Integrating earlier models, we propose a continuum of gambling immersion as a function of problem gambling severity. Cognitive studies aimed at clarifying the psychological nature of immersion will help inform programmes that treat and prevent gambling harm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Recent research has shown that harm is not just a feature of problem gambling, but can also be observed in other lower risk categories. Some debates exist, however, as to the distribution of harm across these categories and how harm should be best measured. This study was designed to examine how estimates of self-reported harm are affected by the methodology used. A particular focus was on how harm estimates for low and higher risk gambling (as classified by the PGSI) varied when respondents were able to make more graded attributions of their harm to gambling. An online panel sample of 554 gamblers responded to a brief survey that included the PGSI, measures of gambling harm drawn from Browne et al. (Assessing gambling-related harm in Victoria: a public health perspective, Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, Melbourne, 2016) as well as questions about demographics and gambling habits. The recruitment was designed to obtain good representation of each PGSI group, with 23% found to be problem gamblers; 36% moderate risk and 21% low risk gamblers. In support of Browne et al. (2016), the findings showed that higher proportions of harm in low risk gamblers is likely to be identified when one uses binary or ‘any harm’ scoring, but that this effect mostly disappears when more graded scoring or attribution of harm measures are used. Higher risk PGSI groups consistently reported more harms and more serious harms than lower risk groups. It was concluded that the measurement of gambling harm and its estimated distribution over PGSI categories is quite sensitive to how it is measured. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The prevalence of gambling harm among active duty military personnel is a largely unexplored topic. With different forms of social gambling often found within (or in close proximity to) military bases around the world, understanding the extent of gambling activities and consequent harms occurring within military contexts warrants further attention. This review aims to identify, describe and thematically synthesise published literature on gambling harm and related issues among active duty military personnel. Scoping review methods were applied in order to understand this relatively under-researched population and understand appropriate avenues for future research. A systematic multi-database text word search, incorporating search results from Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and the Journal Military Medicine, was conducted. A total of 11 sources met inclusion criteria, all originating from the United States of America. The results suggest a distinct gap in the current international literature on this topic. Despite gambling’s long and colourful association with defence downtime, research into gambling harm prevalence rates in relation to what could be considered a high-risk group is limited. Findings reveal that strategies to identify and address gambling harm within this population are severely lacking from the published literature and non-existent outside North America. Implications for understanding and addressing gambling harm among active duty personnel and directions for future research are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Jurisdictions around the world have a self-declared mandate to reduce gambling-related harm. However, historically, this concept has suffered from poor conceptualisation and operational-isation. However, recent years have seen swift advances in measuring gambling harm, based on the principle of it being a quantifiable decrement to the health and wellbeing of the gambler and those connected to them. This review takes stock of the background and recent developments in harm assessment and summarises recent research that has validated and applied the Short Gambling Harms Screen and related instruments. We recommend that future work builds upon the considerable psychometric evidence accumulated for the feasibility of direct elicitation of harmful consequences. We also advocate for grounding harms measures with respect to scalar changes to public health utility metrics. Such an approach will avoid misleading pseudo-clinical categorisations, provide accurate population-level summaries of where the burden of harm is carried, and serve to integrate gambling research with the broader field of public health. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives Systematic mapping of evaluations of tools and interventions that are intended to mitigate risks for gambling harm. Design Scoping Review and z-curve analysis (which estimates the average replicability of a body of literature). Search strategy We searched 7 databases. We also examined reference lists of included studies, as well as papers that cited included studies. Included studies described a quantitative empirical assessment of a game-based (i.e., intrinsic to a specific gambling product) structural feature, user-directed tool, or regulatory initiative to promote responsible gambling. At least two research assistants independently performed screening and extracted study characteristics (e.g., study design and sample size). One author extracted statistics for the z-curve analysis. Results 86 studies met inclusion criteria. No tools or interventions had unambiguous evidence of efficacy, but some show promise, such as within-session breaks in play. Pre-registration of research hypotheses, methods, and analytic plans was absent until 2019, reflecting a recent embracement of open science practices. Published studies also inconsistently reported effect sizes and power analyses. The results of z-curve provide some evidence of publication bias, and suggest that the replicability of the responsible product design literature is uncertain but could be low. Conclusion Greater transparency and precision are paramount to improving the evidence base for responsible product design to mitigate gambling-related harm. Copyright: © 2021 McAuliffe et al.

AB  - Issue addressed: Advancements in mobile- and web-based technologies proliferate everyday opportunities to gamble. The increased availability, popularity and intensity of online gambling platforms and interactive gaming activities also changes the way we construct gambling harm reduction interventions. Information and communication technologies (ICT) provide potential opportunities to reduce harm from online gambling through harm minimisation initiatives and currently available services. The aim of this review was to firstly understand the scope of peer-reviewed evidence on ICT-based strategies to reduce online gambling harm, and secondly, what evidence exists specifically in relation to ICT-based harm reduction initiatives for people who gamble online. Methods: Scoping review methods and a five-stage model of analysis were used to: identify the published literature on ICT-based harm minimisation activities for online gambling; distil models appropriate to address gambling harm in this setting; and synthesise all available evidence, noting gaps and patterns. Results: Sixteen gambling-specific ICT-based interventions were reviewed in depth. The majority of included studies focused on different components of computer-assisted or online therapy programs for disordered gambling, specifically the development of individual skills in managing problematic gambling behaviour. Conclusions: The review found that despite the widespread potential ICT represent for addressing gambling harm there has been only limited published research to date. So what: There is a clear need for further investigation into uptake, usage, focus and effectiveness of all online gambling interventions on offer. The dearth of gambling-specific empirical knowledge potentially indicates a serious resourcing and reporting issues in this area. © 2020 Australian Health Promotion Association

AB  - Strong cultural acceptance of gambling and the stress of migration are placing migrants at risk of developing gambling problems in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of problem gambling and its determinants among internal migrant workers in Muse, Myanmar, situated along the border with China. A cross-sectional study was conducted in April to May 2018 in Muse among 273 internal migrants. The prevalence of problem gambling was 58.2%. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, male gender, non-Burmese ethnicities, those aged 25 years and older, daily manual laborers/unemployed, and alcohol consumption remained significantly associated. Results suggest a high prevalence of problem gambling, which was associated with substance use. These findings emphasize the need to develop strategies for locally adaptive gambling prevention and interventions and further the need for routine screening process in community services and for training staff to be aware of and respond to gambling harms. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and aims: Loot boxes are a common feature in video games where players win, buy or are gifted a virtual box or other container that is unwrapped to reveal virtual items of value, such as skins, weapons, in-game currency or special abilities. The current study aimed to relate the use of loot boxes to gambling problems and harm. Methods: An online survey was conducted with 1,954 adolescents and young adults from NSW Australia, 59.9% female (aged 12–24), recruited by online panel aggregator, Qualtrics. Results: Buying and selling loot boxes was associated with higher 12-month gambling frequency and gambling problems in young adults, aged 18–24 (Problem Gambling Severity Index). Young adults who bought loot boxes additionally had more gambling-related harms (Short Gambling Harms Screen). Young women, aged 18–24, who opened, bought and/or sold loot boxes spent more money in the last 12 months on gambling. In adolescents, aged 12–17, buying loot boxes was similarly associated with gambling problems (DSM-IV-MR-J). Furthermore, adolescent girls who bought and/or sold loot boxes viewed gambling more positively than other girls (Attitudes Towards Gambling Scale). There was no evidence, however, that longer-term experience in opening or purchasing loot boxes, a differentiating feature of the survey, is associated with current gambling problems. Discussion and conclusions: This study suggests that loot boxes may be attractive to people who are already predisposed to engage in other gambling, and females who use loot boxes may have unique vulnerabilities to gambling problems that could be explored in future research. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Background and aims: Problem gambling severity and gambling-related harm are closely coupled, but conceptually distinct, constructs. The primary aim was to compare low-risk gambling limits when gambling-related harm was defined using the negative consequence items of the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI-Harm) and the Short Gambling Harms Scale items (SGHS-Harm). A secondary aim was compare low-risk limits derived using a definition of harm in which at least two harms across different domains (e.g. financial and relationship) were endorsed with a definition of harm in which at least two harms from any domain were endorsed. Methods: Data were collected from dual-frame computer-assisted telephone interviews of 5,000 respondents in the fourth Social and Economic Impact Study (SEIS) of Gambling in Tasmania. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyse were conducted to identify low-risk gambling limits. Results: PGSI-Harm and SGHS-Harm definitions produced similar overall limits: 30-37 times per year; AUD$510-$544 per year; expenditure comprising no more than 10.2-10.3% of gross personal income; 400-454 minutes per year; and 2 types of gambling activities per year. Acceptable limits (AUC ≥0.70) were identified for horse/dog racing, keno, and sports/other betting using the PGSI definition; and electronic gaming machines, keno, and bingo using the SGHS definition. The requirement that gamblers endorse two or more harms across different domains had a relatively negligible effect. Discussion and conclusions: Although replications using alternative measures of harm are required, previous PGSI-based limits appear to be robust thresholds that have considerable potential utility in the prevention of gambling-related harm. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Older women are vulnerable to the risks associated with some forms of gambling. While research has examined how individuals functionally interact with gambling products, very limited research has investigated how individuals conceptualise and interpret the risks associated with these products. Theorists suggest that risk-taking is not based on a lack of knowledge but on the different ways people make sense of their lives. As such, this study aimed to understand the factors that may influence how older women who gamble on electronic gambling machines (EGMs) perceive the risks associated with gambling on these products. It examined how risk perceptions interacted with a range of complex social factors in women's everyday lives to influence their risk behaviours. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 Australian women aged 55 and over who had been negatively impacted by EGM gambling. This study found that older women's risk perceptions of gambling were shaped by their early recreational experiences with gambling, rather than their current regular and harmful gambling behaviours. Risk perceptions of EGMs were often downplayed or ignored as women sought to maintain valued social identities within the venues. Women went through a process of risk negotiation whereby the benefits of this social interaction outweighed the potential harms associated with the machines. This also led them to deflect or ignore risk minimisation messaging which was completely focused on individual behaviours. This study signals the importance of moving away from individualised responsible gambling messages towards risk information about gambling products. This research also provides evidence of the need for regulation addressing the design features of EGMs that ultimately may make products safer and protect the most vulnerable from gambling harm. © 2021

AB  - Purpose of Review: People can place preponderant importance on a single life domain (e.g., relationships, appearance, financial success). The result is that success (or failure) in that domain has significant influence on the self-concept and thus judgments of self-worth. A focused self-concept has also been shown to be a core feature of various psychiatric disorders, including depression, body image disorders, and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Herein, we summarize mounting evidence indicating that a self-concept focused on financial success is important for understanding the etiology and maintenance of disordered gambling. Recent Findings: The review indicates that a financially focused self-concept is moderately and positively associated with disordered gambling severity. Specifically, we outline research that has examined how and why financially focused self-concept proliferates and maintains disordered gambling. Based on this research, we put forth the idea that having a financially focused self-concept is an etiological factor that is common to the different gambling disorder subtypes outlined in the Pathways Model—arguably the leading biopsychosocial model of gambling addiction and gambling harm. Summary: More research is needed that assesses the antecedents and consequences of possessing a financially focused self-concept. We call on researchers to assess sociocultural, psychological, and environmental factors that may cultivate a financially focused self-concept as well as factors that may help people expand their domains of self-worth. The recovery process from any psychiatric disorder that includes a financial focus as an etiological factor should be aided by an expansion of the life domains from which self-worth is garnered. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Increasingly, gambling stakeholders communicate that minimizing gambling harm is a shared societal responsibility. Individual gamblers’ beliefs about responsibility for minimizing gambling harm are worthy of study because these beliefs might influence gambling behavior. In this study, using a sample of casino loyalty program subscribers (N = 4,795), we observed that respondents who had a positive result on a brief gambling disorder screen were more likely than those who screened negative to hold seven stakeholder groups (i.e., scientists, clinicians, casino employees, government regulators, public health officials, casino industry lobbyists, public safety officials) responsible for helping to minimize gambling harm. The sum of stakeholder groups held responsible for minimizing gambling harm, along with beliefs that casinos share responsibility for encouraging responsible gambling behavior, predicted gambling disorder screening status after controlling for established problem gambling risk factors. These results replicated our previous study using a mostly independent sample. Contrary to our expectations, beliefs about responsibility for mitigating gambling harm were mostly unrelated to measures of gambling involvement. These results provided additional support for the notion that those who are at risk for gambling harm are especially likely to hold others responsible for minimizing such harm. However, they call into question the role of gambling involvement in this relationship. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Speed of play has been identified as a key structural characteristic in gambling behaviour, where games involving higher playing speeds enhance the experience of gambling. Of interest in the present study is the consistent finding that games with higher event frequencies are preferred by problem gamblers and are associated with more negative gambling outcomes, such as difficulty quitting the game and increased monetary loss. The present study investigated the impact of gambling speed of play on executive control functioning, focusing on how increased speeds of play impact motor response inhibition, and the potential mediating role arousal and dissociative experience play in this relationship. Fifty regular non-problem gamblers took part in a repeated-measures experiment where they gambled with real money on a simulated slot machine across five speed of play conditions. Response inhibition was measured using an embedded Go/No-Go task, where participants had to withhold motor responses, rather than operating the spin button on the slot machine when a specific colour cue was present. Results indicated that response inhibition performance was significantly worse during faster speeds of play, and that the role of arousal in this relationship was independent of any motor priming affect. The implications of these findings for gambling legislation and gambling harm-minimisation approaches are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Affected others impacted by someone else’s gambling utilise numerous behaviour change strategies to minimise gambling-related harm but knowledge on what these strategies are and how they are implemented is limited. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive data-driven taxonomy of the types of self-help strategies used by affected others, and to categorize these into high-level behaviour change techniques (BCTs). Two taxonomies were developed using an inductive and deductive approach which was applied to a dataset of online sources and organised into the Rubicon model of action phases. These taxonomies were family-focused (how to reduce the impact of gambling harm on families) and gambler-focused (how to support the gambler in behaviour change). In total, 329 online sources containing 3536 different strategies were identified. The family-focused classification contained 16 BCTs, and the most frequent were professional support, financial management and planned consequences. The gambler-focused classification contained 11 BCTs, and the most frequent were feedback on behaviours, professional support and financial management. The majority of family-and gambler-focused BCTs fell under the actional phase of the Rubicon model. Grounded in lived experience, the findings highlight the need for intervention and resource development that includes a wide range of specific techniques that affected others can utilise. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Assessing the harmful consequences of gambling is an area of active investigation. One measure intended to capture gambling-related harm is the 10-item short gambling harm screen (SGHS). Although good psychometric properties have been reported, it has been suggested that the screen’s less severe probes may not represent genuinely harmful consequences, but rather may reflect rational opportunity costs. Consequently, it has been argued that the screen may lead to overestimation of the extent of gambling-related harm in the population. The current study sought to examine the psychometric performance of three less severe suspect items in the SGHS. Associations between each of these items and a specially constructed scale of relatively severe “unimpeachable” gambling harms were calculated from archival data from 5551 Australian and New Zealand gamblers. All three suspect items, both individually and upon aggregation, predicted greater endorsement of “unimpeachable” harms, and indicated the presence of gambling problems. Moreover, the SGHS as a whole is highly correlated with “unimpeachable” gambling harms. Including suspect items in the SGHS was found to improve predictions of low-and moderate-risk gambling status, but slightly decreased predictions of severe gambling problems. The results are inconsistent with the notion that SGHS harm probes capture either inconsequential consequences or opportunity costs. They confirm prior findings that harm symptomatology is unidimensional, and that the report of multiple more prevalent, but less severe, harms serves as an effective indicator of the spectrum of experienced harm. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Mobile gambling differs from land-based and traditional forms of gambling in that the opportunity to place bets and engage with casinos is constantly present and easily accessible. Instead of going to a physical bookmaker or casino, mobile gambling is done quickly and swiftly, anytime, anywhere, with a few taps on a mobile device. Previous studies reveal mobile gambling has managed to reach new audiences especially amongst younger people. Gambling harms can have severe adverse effects on individuals, families and society. However, for a subgroup of highly involved individuals, gambling can be considered a harmonious passion that permits frequent gambling without elevating individual's risks of experience problem gambling manifestations. Combining the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) and Dualistic Model of Passion (DMP) frameworks, the present study aims to determine if and how the different gratifications sought from mobile gambling are susceptible to explaining non-problematic versus problematic patterns in highly involved gamblers. Data were collected over two waves from a global sample of mobile gamblers (N = 327). Results emphasize that the motivational underpinnings of mobile gambling (as measured by the U&G) differ in obsessive versus harmonious passion. Obsessive passion is associated with poor mood and problematic gambling. In contrast, harmonious passion for mobile gambling is associated with positive mood but is unrelated to problematic gambling. Based on these findings, and given that problematic gambling is an internationally relevant public health issue (the prevalence of problem gambling is estimated to range from 0.1% to 5.8% in different countries), we suggest interventions focusing on specific uses and gratifications associated with an obsessive passion for mobile gambling may be effective in reducing problematic usage patterns.

AB  - Aim: Gambling harm is a serious public health issue affecting the health, financial security, and social well-being of millions of people and their close relations around the world. Despite its population health implications, gambling harm is not typically viewed and treated as a public health policy issue. This paper critically reviews the evolution of the public health perspective on gambling harm. It also considers how gambling harm can be operationalized within a public health model. Methods: A critical historical review of the emerging public health perspective on gambling harm was conducted. Key documents covering three decades of development were reviewed and appraised through a process of deliberation and debate over source impact in the fields of research, policy, and programming internationally. Results: The first decade mainly focused on identifying gambling harm and framing the public health issue. The second decade featured the expansion of health assessment and emerging areas of policy and program development. The third decade saw an increased focus on public health frameworks that advanced understanding of harm mechanics and impact. As reflected by the essential functions of a general public health model, gambling harm prevention efforts emphasize health promotion over other key functions like health assessment and surveillance. Conclusion: Gambling harm is a public health issue requiring greater attention to health assessment and surveillance data development. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to understand the factors that may influence how and why people with intellectual disability may engage in gambling. Method: Nineteen people with intellectual disability were recruited from a disability advocacy organization and participated in face to face, semi-structured qualitative interviews. Open ended questions were used to explore participants' gambling participation, recall of, and attitudes toward, different gambling products, understanding of gambling harm, and awareness of responsible gambling messages. Results: All participants could remember gambling in their lifetime and some participants had recently engaged in gambling. Many participants were aware of different gambling products, and a few participants could describe in detail the technical aspects of electronic gambling machines. Most participants did not specifically recall seeing gambling harm minimization messages, however some described engaging in individual responsibility measures, such as limits and control, as they perceived this reduced the risks of experiencing harm. Conclusions: People with intellectual disability are engaging with gambling products in a similar way to the general community. Therefore, it is important to understand the different pathways that may lead people with intellectual disability to initiate and continue gambling and to ensure that they are aware of and protected from the potential risk. Implications for Public Health: Policy makers and practitioners should seek to understand and implement a range of strategies to reduce and prevent the harms associated with particular gambling products and environments for this population sub-group. © Copyright © 2021 Pitt, Thomas, Watson, Shuttleworth, Murfitt and Balandin.

AB  - This study derived a set of Australian low-risk gambling limits and explored the relative and absolute risk associated with exceeding these limits. Secondary analysis of population-representative Tasmanian and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) cross-sectional (11,597 respondents) and longitudinal studies (2027 respondents) was conducted. Balancing sensitivity and specificity, the limits were: gambling frequency of 20–30 times per year; gambling expenditure of AUD $380– $615 per year (USD $240–$388 per year); gambling expenditure comprising 0.83–1.68% of gross personal income; and two types of gambling activities per year. All limits, except number of ac-tivities, predicted subsequent harm, with limits related to gambling expenditure consistently the best-performing. Exceeding the limits generally conferred a higher degree of relative and absolute risk, with gamblers exceeding the limits being 3–20 times more likely to experience harm than those who do not, and having a 5–17% risk of experiencing harm. Only 7–12% of gamblers exceeding the limits actually experienced harm. Gambling consumption lower than the limits also conferred a considerable amount of harm. Using a relative risk method, this study derived similar limits from disparate Australian states and territories. These limits can serve as working guidelines for the consideration of researchers, clinicians, and policy makers, but need to be subject to further rigorous empirical investigation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Aims: Excessive time and money spent on gambling can result in harms, not only to people experiencing a gambling problem but also to their close family and friends ("concerned significant others"; CSOs). The current study aimed to explore whether, and to what extent, CSOs experience decrements to their wellbeing due to another person's gambling. Methods: We analysed data from The Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA; N = 19,064) and the Canadian Quinte Longitudinal Study (QLS; N = 3,904). Participants either self-identified as CSOs (QLS) or were identified by living in a household with a person classified in the problem gambling category by the PGSI (HILDA). Subjective well-being was measured using the Personal Wellbeing Index and single-item questions on happiness and satisfaction with life. Results: CSOs reported lower subjective wellbeing than non-CSOs across both countries and on all three wellbeing measures. CSO status remained a significant predictor of lower wellbeing after controlling for demographic and socio-economic factors, and own-gambling problems. There were no significant differences across various relationships to the gambler, by gender, or between household and non-household CSOs. Discussion and Conclusions: Gambling-related harms experienced by CSOs was reliably associated with a decrease in wellbeing. This decrement to CSO's wellbeing was not as strong as that experienced by the person with the first-order gambling problem. Nevertheless, wellbeing decrements to CSOs are not limited to those living with a person with gambling problems in the household and thus affect many people. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Background As in many other countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Malawi's commercial gambling sector has grown considerably in recent years. Driven by the widespread availability of internet through mobile devices, the industry has penetrated both urban and rural settings. In Malawi the model commonly implemented by gambling companies is similar to that used by mobile phone operators. Agents equipped with cellular devices connect to providers' servers to place wagers for customers and print receipts using simple printers attached to their devices. This has produced lucrative returns for providers. While increasing attention is being paid to this trend, most research focusses on sports betting and there is a deficit of papers that document gambling-related harms. Methods Here we present a narrative case report of a 16-year-old boy, 'Wati' (pseudonym), who lived in rural Malawi and took his own life after gambling and losing money that did not belong to him. As his community is part of a demographic surveillance site, a verbal autopsy was conducted, later supplemented with interviews with Wati's close friend and uncle, to whom his mother referred us. We triangulated data from these three sources to create a narrative case report of Wati's suicide and its relationship to his gambling practices. Results We found that the gambling harms leading up to Wati's suicide were recurrent, that his gambling practices were diverse (lottery, football betting, digital games and cards) and that signs of distress were apparent before his suicide. Conclusions From this case report, we learn that underage individuals participate in gambling in Malawi, can develop harmful habits and that their gambling is not confined to sports betting. We also learn that there is a lack of accessible services for people who develop harmful gambling practices. Wati could have benefited from such services and they may have saved his life. © 2021 Sichali JM et al.

AB  - There are increasing global concerns about women’s participation in gambling, and their risk of gambling-related harm. Limited attention has been given to the range of specific and tailored strategies that may be used to prevent and reduce women’s risk of gambling-related harm. This study aimed to understand how key informants in Australia conceptualised the risks facing women who gamble, and the range of tailored strategies that could be used to respond. Online focus groups were conducted with n = 15 key informants working in gambling research, policy, prevention, treatment services, and five women with lived experience of gambling harm (as Experts by Experience). A reflexive approach to thematic analysis was used to guide the data interpretation. Gambling harm was recognised as a hidden problem for women. There were a number of knowledge gaps that key informants acknowledged they had about women, with participants suggesting that older rather than younger women were most at risk of experiencing gambling harm. Participants recommended a range of de-normalisation strategies that could specifically target women–including strategies to address the barriers for women attending recreational and social alternatives, co-producing public health messages with women for public education initiatives, and providing anonymous pathways for women to participate in advocacy for gambling reform. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Within a neo-liberal economic orthodoxy, the gambling industry has succeeded in the discursive feat of transforming gambling from its previous pariah pastime status to normalized entertainment. This contemporary discourse of gambling as entertainment has repositioned gambling as harmless fun. The comfortable orthodoxy of ‘responsible gambling’ adopts language emphasizing concepts such as ‘personal responsibility’. A focus on the lack of self-control of delinquent users deflects attention away from harmful products, diminishing scrutiny of industry failure to appropriately address gambling harms. We analyzed data derived from interviews with stakeholders familiar with the gambling licensing process in Victoria, Australia, in order to identify if and how the discursive structures of this comfortable orthodoxy manifest in discussions on gambling. Data were derived from thematic analysis of 21 interviews with decision makers, industry advocates, and other stakeholders. Evidence highlights multiple recurring discursive structures of the ‘comfortable orthodoxy’, including the narrative of gambling as legalized recreation, personal choice and self-responsibility. Highlighting the pervasiveness of this discourse, these narratives were evident across the spectrum of informants. This research illustrates the way in which multiple gambling stakeholders deploy the discursive structures underpinning gambling regulation and operations. Discourses establish understanding of the nature of specific issues, and can influence responses to public health or other policy problems. In this instance, a discourse overwhelmingly favoring industry interests, has the potential to entrench and support harmful systems of exploitation and harm creation. Transforming the responsible gambling discourse is an important focus for public health activity concerned with reducing gambling related harm. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Gambling studies literature is a space where discourses call objects such as ‘gambling harm reduction’ and ‘women harmed by gambling’ into being and give them status as namable and describable. Methodology and methods: A poststructural feminist analysis of the positioning of women who gamble in gambling studies literature was carried out to explore possibilities and constraints for gambling harm reduction practices. Gambling studies literature was accessed to enable a range of historically emerging framings of women’s gambling practices and harm to be brought to light. Discourse analysis drew on key concepts (discourse, subjectivity, power/knowledge) and principles (reversal, discontinuity, specificity and exteriority) developed by Michel Foucault. Findings: Gambling studies have constructed women as: ‘risky gamblers’, ‘vulnerable women’, and as subject to gendered socio-cultural determinants of gambling and harm. Dominant conceptualisations of women in gambling studies tend to bring individual women who gamble into focus, obscuring the social, governmental and commercial determinants of gambling and harm, and often reproducing some unhelpful gender stereotypes in the process. Conclusions: Holistic, environmental and Indigenous women’s health discourses have the potential to shift gambling harm reduction from a health services approach to one that is focused on supporting community wellbeing. This includes women’s co-production and ownership of harm reduction strategies. It is concluded that opportunities women’s gambling harm reduction may be found in critical psychology, and/or approaches which emphasize coherent and critical gender analysis, collaborative action, community development and client-led practice. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The gambling industry has grown into a global business in the 21st century. This has created the need for a new emphasis on problem prevention. This article highlights the core themes of the book Setting Limits: Gambling, Science and Public Policy, taking a broad view of the consequences of gambling for society as a burden on health, well-being and equality. The book covers the extent of gambling and gambling-related problems in different societies and presents a critical review of research on industry practices, policy objectives and preventive approaches, including services to people suffering from gambling and its consequences. It discusses the developments in game characteristics and gambling environments and provides evidence on how regulation can affect those. Effective measures to minimize gambling harm exist and many are well supported by scientific evidence. They include restrictions on general availability as well as selective measures to prevent gamblers from overspending. The revenue generated from gambling for the industry, governments, and providers of public services funded from gambling returns presents an obstacle to developing policies to implement harm-reduction measures. A public interest approach must weigh these interests against the suffering and losses of the victims of gambling. © 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction

AB  - Purpose: Existing Australian (and global) gambling harm prevention and minimization measures are overwhelmingly based on self-regulation, using largely ineffective measures focused on individual behavior change. This is substantially attributable to resistance to effective policy change, driven by a well-organized and significantly resourced gambling industry. It is evident that the gambling industry (like tobacco, alcohol and the processed foods industry) has actively sought political engagement as a mechanism to resist policy change. However, unlike tobacco and alcohol, little research has been undertaken to examine gambling industry influence on policymaking. This study aims to describe and analyze the pattern of disclosed financial donations received by Australian politicians and political parties from major gambling industry actors during the period 1998–2018. Further, it examines apparent temporal relationships between donations and gambling legislation or policy positions. Material and methods: Donation data were sourced for the period 1998–2018 from the Australian Electoral Commission website. All data were classified according to donor and recipient and analyzed to provide descriptive statistics. Donations earmarked for specific campaigns, politicians’ electorates or events were also identified. Results: The findings demonstrate that members of the gambling industry are consistent and substantial donors to both major parties in Australia. Furthermore, the pattern of donations provides evidence of temporal relationships between donations and federal and state gambling policy decisions and positions. Conclusions: Close examination of industry corporate political activities like political donations supports a greater understanding of the factors that influence the gambling policy environment and, as with tobacco, will contribute to more effective regulation to prevent and address harm. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Gambling is recognized as a significant public health problem. However, there is little research exploring community attitudes towards gambling and the development of advocacy initiatives. Engaging adults and young people in advocacy efforts is recognized as being beneficial to the successful implementation of harm prevention and reduction strategies. This study explored the attitudes of young people and their parents towards the alignment of gambling with sport, and the strategies they perceive could be used to prevent and reduce gambling related harm. Using a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach, 30 family groups from Melbourne, Australia participated in semi-structured interviews. Parents and young people were asked about gambling and its promotion, alignment with sporting codes, the potential impact on young people and strategies that may prevent or reduce gambling harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken to interpret the data. The sample comprised 29 parents, one grandparent and 48 young people. Themes emerging from the data related to the use of imagery and appeal strategies in advertisements, the normalization of betting in advertisements and the alignment of betting with sport. Parents and young people also identified a number of potential gambling harm prevention and reduction initiatives. Parents and young people were able to describe a range of strategies used by gambling companies to promote their products, understand the potential impact of these strategies, and recommend strategies to reduce harm. Given this level of understanding there is clearly an opportunity to engage young people and stakeholders in advocacy initiatives aimed at reducing and preventing gambling harm. © The Author(s) 2019

AB  - Internet gambling provides a unique environment with design mechanics and data-driven opportunities that can impact gambling-related harms. Some elements of Internet gambling including isolation, lack of interruption, and constant, easy access have been argued to pose specific risks. However, identifiable player accounts enable identification of behavioral risk markers and personalized private interfaces to push customized messages and interventions. The structural design of the Internet gambling environment (website or app) can have a strong influence on individual behavior. However, unlike land-based venues, Internet gambling has few specific policies outlining acceptable and unacceptable design practices. Harm minimization including responsible gambling frameworks typically include roles and responsibilities for multiple stakeholders including individual users, industry operators, government regulators, and community organizations. This paper presents a framework for how behavioral science principles can inform appropriate stakeholder actions to minimize Internet gambling-related harms. A customer journey through internet gambling demonstrates how a multidisciplinary nexus of collaborative effort may facilitate a reduction in harms associated with Internet gambling for consumers at all stages of risk. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders could result in the implementation of appropriate design strategies to assist individuals to make decisions and engage in healthy, sustainable behaviors. © Copyright © 2020 Gainsbury, Black, Blaszczynski, Callaghan, Clancey, Starcevic and Tymula.

AB  - Background: Internet gambling may increase rates of gambling harm. This current study aimed to assess Internet poker players’ views on various harm-reduction (HR) strategies. It also examined differences in these views according to the games played (poker only vs. poker plus other gambling activities), indebtedness, and problem gambling severity. Methods: Internet poker players (n = 311; 94.2% Male) recruited online between 2012 and 2014 were included in the analyses and completed a survey on indebtedness, problem gambling severity index, and ten statements regarding HR features. Results: Among the whole sample, the most frequently endorsed HR strategy was setting money limits, specialized online help, and peer support forums. People who play poker only (70%) are less prone to endorse the utility of information on excessive gambling and specialized healthcare centers. No differences were found between those people with debt versus those without regarding HR assessment. Participants with severe problem gambling were more skeptical about HR strategies based on information on specialized healthcare centers. Conclusion: Setting money limits, online help, and peer support forums are the most commonly endorsed strategies. Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of online harm reduction strategies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Gambling problems are increasingly understood as a health-related condition, with harms from excessive time and money expenditure contributing to significant population morbidity. In many countries, the prevalence of gambling problems is known with some precision. However, the true severity of gambling problems in terms of their impact on health and wellbeing is the subject of ongoing debate. We firstly review recent research that has attempted to estimate harm from gambling, including studies that estimate disability weights using direct elicitation. Limitations of prior approaches are discussed, most notably potential inflation due to non-independent comorbidity with other substance use and mental health conditions, and potential biases in the subjective attribution of morbidity to gambling. An alternative indirect elicitation approach is outlined, and a conceptual framework for its application to gambling is provided. Significant risk factors for propensity to develop gambling problems are enumerated, and relative risks for comorbidities are calculated from recent meta-analyses and reviews. Indirect elicitation provides a promising alternative framework for assessing the causal link between gambling problems and morbidity. This approach requires implementation of propensity score matching to estimate the counterfactual, and demands high quality information of risk factors and comorbid conditions, in order to estimate the unique contribution of gambling problems. Gambling harm is best understood as a decrement to health utility. However, achieving consensus on the severity of gambling problems requires triangulation of results from multiple methodologies. Indirect elicitation with propensity score matching and accounting for comorbidities would provide an important step towards full integration of gambling within a public health paradigm. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Behavioural dependence (BD) for gambling has traditionally been subsumed under the concept of ‘problems’: a hybrid construct that includes both indicators of BD, and adverse consequences (harm) arising from excessive time and money expenditure. Although progress has been made towards specific measurement of harm, dedicated measures of BD do not exist. Theory led us to expect that (1) dependence and harm are measurably distinct constructs, (2) harm mediates the relationship between dependence and wellbeing, and finally, that (3) separate measures should be more effective than a unidimensional problems measure in predicting wellbeing. Candidate BD items from six existing measures of gambling problems were extracted and evaluated with respect to DSM-5 criteria and content overlap, leading to 17 candidate items. This was further reduced to 8 items based on both item content and psychometric criteria, using data from an online panel of 1524 regular gamblers, with demographic characteristics similar to Australian population norms. Participants also completed measures of harm, problems, and subjective wellbeing. All three hypotheses were confirmed. BD was shown to be highly reliable and unidimensional, and measurably distinct from gambling harms. Harm mediated the negative relationship between BD and wellbeing. The harm + BD model yielded better predictions of personal wellbeing that a unidimensional, continuous problems measure—and explained about twice the variance of a simple contrast between problem and non-problem gamblers. We conclude that is psychometrically justified to specifically measure gambling BD, and this may be of particular use in theoretically-driven applications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented restrictions on people’s movements and interactions, as well as the cancellation of major sports events and social activities, directly altering the gambling landscape. There is urgent need to provide regulators, policy makers and treatment providers with evidence on the patterns and context of gambling during COVID-19 and its aftermath. This protocol describes a study addressing the following three questions: (1) How has COVID-19 changed gambling practices and the risk factors for, and experience of, gambling harms? (2) What is the effect of COVID-19 on gambling marketing? (3) How has COVID-19 changed high risk groups’ gambling experiences and practices? This mixed-method study focuses on two groups, namely young adults and sports bettors. In workpackage-1, we will extend an existing longitudinal survey of gambling in young adults (aged 16–24 years) (first wave conducted June–August 2019), adding COVID-19-related questions to the second wave (July–August 2020) and extending to a third wave in 2021; and undertake a survey of sports bettors in the UK (baseline n = 4000, ~July–August 2020), with follow-ups in ~October–November 2020 and ~February-March 2021. In workpackage-2, we will examine changes in expenditure on paid-for gambling advertising from January 2019 to July 2021 and undertake a mixed-method content analysis of a random sample of paid-for gambling advertising (n ~ 200) and social media marketing (n ~ 100) during the initial COVID-19 “lockdown”. Workpackage-3 will involve qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of (a) young adults (aged 18–24 years) and (b) sports bettors. © 2020, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Internationally, Internet gambling is increasingly permitted under regulated licensing conditions; however, the specific products that are legal varies between jurisdictions. Online sports and race wagering are now legal in many jurisdictions, but in-play betting (also referred to as “live action” or “in-the-run” betting) is often restricted. In-play betting enables bets to be placed on an event after it has commenced. Prohibitionist policies often cite the potential for this type of betting to increase risk of gambling problems. This study aimed to identify which online bettors are most likely to engage in in-play betting, and to investigate the relationship between in-play betting and gambling problems. Online survey responses were collected from 501 Australian past-month online sports bettors in the context of in-play betting only being available on offshore gambling sites or via telephone betting. Thirty-four percent of participants had placed a bet in-play in the past month. Participants placing in-play bets differed from those who had not in terms of education, employment status, ethnicity, age, and gambling involvement. Those who bet in-play had higher problem gambling severity scores than those who did not bet in-play. Problem gambling severity significantly predicting in-play betting, holding other variables constant. Findings are consistent with previous research indicating that the relationship between in-play gambling and problems holds across jurisdictions which have prohibited and legalized in-play betting. The findings suggest that in-play betting should warrant specific regulatory attention and interventions to minimize gambling harms among individuals that engage with this activity. © Copyright © 2020 Gainsbury, Abarbanel and Blaszczynski.

AB  - Background: Harms from gambling are considerable and widespread, impacting beyond the individual gambler. Asserting benefits, including supporting ‘good causes’ outweighs this harm, is a common legitimization tactic of commercial gambling. Identified as problematic on many levels, this is a global phenomenon. Using unusually transparent data, this research assesses the extent to which such contributions offset gambling harms. Methods: Commonly in Australian jurisdictions, not-for-profit gambling operators (clubs) qualify for gambling tax reductions. To qualify in the state of Victoria, clubs submit annual statements documenting that at least 8.33% of their net gambling revenue (NGR) supports community purposes. We examined community benefit records from three consecutive annual reporting periods (2012–2015). Results are presented in aggregate, and via specific case studies. Results: We identified significant over-valuation of 'community benefits'. Gambling tax deductions overwhelmingly (82%) went to operational expenses including wages, venue maintenance, capital costs and utilities. Contributions to charitable and philanthropic purposes represented 4.5% of all community benefit claims (1.5% of club NGR). Conclusions: Similar to other jurisdictions, Victoria’s community contribution arrangements provide limited actual community benefit. Doing little to offset gambling harm, demonstrated benefits largely accrue to specific sectional interests. Greater transparency and improved governance is required. This includes, reviewing tax exemptions, reviewing allowable claims, and greater compliance oversight. This research identifies multiple failings with a community benefit scheme operating in a relatively transparent manner. Research lessons may be of interest to policy makers and others wanting to ensure that gambling’s demonstrable harms are, indeed, offset by clear benefits to community, and to preventing gambling harm. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Over the past few years, online gambling has become a more commonplace leisure time activity. However, for a small minority, online gambling can become problematic. Consequently, the gambling industry has started to acknowledge their role in player protection and harm minimization and some online gambling companies have introduced responsible gambling tools such as targeted personalized messages as a way of helping players stay in control. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of targeted messages among 7134 Swedish online gamblers who played at one of five sites within the ComeOn Group between July 2019 and January 2020. The results showed that online gamblers receiving personalized feedback (i.e., feedback concerning their own actual gambling behavior in the form of text messages) wagered significantly less money on both the day they read a personalized message and seven days after they read a personalized message. The data support the results found by previous laboratory and real-world studies showing that targeted personalized information can be an effective tool for online gambling companies to reduce gambling expenditure among their clientele. The findings will also be of interest to other stakeholders including gambling regulators, policymakers, and researchers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Recent research evidence has suggested that gambling is a public health concern. A number of studies report the association between gambling activity and increased instances of various other harms, including substance misuse and psychological disorders. In parallel to alcohol misuse, it is also becoming clear that gambling related harm is more of a continuum of harm, as opposed to traditionally accepted categorisations of gambling behavior: safe and responsible or “problem” and harmful. Previous effective treatment models for alcohol misuse have considered a public health approach to develop interventions. As such, the current research seeks to use a public health approach to both investigate the extent of gambling harm across Wales, and to identify upstream predictors of harm to inform future interventions. Method: A triangulation of data collection methods was utilized across Wales, UK. Two hundred and forty-eight participants completed a quantitative survey relating to gambling behavior and related harm, which included the Problem Severity Gambling Index, the Gambling Commission measure of frequency, The Gambling Motives Questionnaire and the Fast Alcohol Screening tool. Ninety-eight of these participants completed a qualitative subsection. Structured interviews were conducted with 20 individuals from 11 service providers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for the five case studies of individuals who had previously sought help for gambling. The geographical density and distribution of Licensed Gambling Outlets was also mapped in local areas. Results: The findings provide further evidence of a continuum of gambling related harm. Twenty seven percent of survey participants demonstrate some indicators of risk of gambling harm. Social, cultural and environmental contexts play a role in initiation and maintenance of gambling behavior and the subsequent related harm. Accounts from individuals corroborated the quantitative findings. Conclusions: Findings from this Welsh sample are in line with and add support to the growing international research evidence that gambling harms are a universal issue that cross cultures. It is clear that action is needed by legislators at a policy level and that broadening the focus of intervention to a public health level is necessary to develop effective strategies for harm reduction. © Copyright © 2020 John, Holloway, Davies, May, Buhociu, Cousins, Thomas and Roderique-Davies.

AB  - Objectives: To address the current status of responsible gambling (RG) as the dominant discourse for reducing gambling harm. Study design: The article is a narrative review of relevant literature analysed discursively. Methods: We identified significant texts describing the discourse of RG and analysed these to extract major characteristics and themes of the discourse. These were then subjected to a critique, using the public health discourses as an alternative system for addressing gambling harm. Results: The discourse of RG is inadequate for preventing or minimising gambling harm. A public health–focused approach to prevent and minimise gambling harm is likely to be far more effective but will be opposed by vested interests. Conclusions: It is timely to consider abandoning the discourse of RG. This discourse has been discredited because of its complicity with vested interests and a lack of evidence to demonstrate its efficacy in preventing or reducing harm. A public health response to the prevention of gambling harm is feasible and practical and can and should be further developed and implemented rapidly. © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Internationally, Indigenous people have higher rates of problem gambling than other population groups, yet the uptake of gambling help services is thought to be low. This may be due to the lack of culturally appropriate services and staff. This study aimed to systematically search and review the literature relating to interventions designed for Indigenous populations that seek to prevent or address gambling harm, to support the design of new programs. Peer-reviewed articles and gray literature that described programs of this nature and/or which reported outcomes for Indigenous participants were included in the review. Included studies were published between January 2000 and May 2019 and available in English. Only four articles were identified for inclusion: two described programs in Australia and two in New Zealand. Only one article provided outcome data, which was inconclusive, and one described three separate interventions. Three of the four described involved community-led approaches informed by cultural and emancipatory principles. There is currently insufficient evidence to guide interventions aiming to prevent and address gambling harm for Indigenous peoples. This review identified an urgent need for new intervention research in this area. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Problem gambling has not been a priority within either Leeds City Council or partnership plans. However, financial inclusion, licencing and public health teams have been able to develop a cross-Council approach to problem gambling. This has been aided by an upfront payment plus annual payments to the Council that have been part of the licencing agreement for a new casino. As a result, research has been commissioned on local prevalence. This showed a higher rate of problem gamblers (1.8%) than national estimates with a similar level to nationally of those ‘at risk’. The research also showed that local services had difficulties identifying problem gamblers and signposting for support. This had led to a high profile communications campaign to coincide with ‘Responsible Gambling Week’ complemented by training for frontline workers. The interviews undertaken for the research, plus the findings themselves, have been a powerful help in securing interest and commitment beyond the Council and to the health and third sectors. The use of local stories has helped build momentum for partnership working. For example, focus groups to explore how gambling affected migrants and medical student interviews with university students. The article will describe how increasing understanding across partners has helped build confidence to provide cross city responses to national consultations and contribute to national publications and conferences. Of even greater significance, the local National Health Service has secured funding from GambleAware for a Northern Gambling Service to be based in Leeds with satellites in the North East and Greater Manchester. This will provide treatment for those with severe gambling addiction. Additional support will come from a significant increased provision of GamCare services working to identify, screen and support problem gamblers. The use of Council premises for both of these services is testament to joint working. Recognising that this is a new emerging agenda has led to the creation of a Yorkshire and Humber Problem Gambling Working Group, endorsed by the Association of Directors of Public Health. This has resulted in shared learning and determining a consistent approach to harm. Even during a short time, the degree of interest has risen substantially. A regional gambling harm reduction framework has been produced that sets out a menu of actions. This intends to help local areas determine their own priorities. There is increasing recognition that problem gambling is a public health issue. Leadership requires a systems led, and Health in All Policies, approach to ensure problem gambling is not seen as a narrow niche issue led by public health staff. There is a need to recognise that engagement takes time. However, this is a new and emerging issue. The solutions to problem gambling are not clear and this allows for more creative, pragmatic and coproduced approaches. © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a ‘health in all policy’ approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a ‘whole council’ approach. © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to discuss and analyse the gambling habits and perceptions towards gambling cultures and problems among the large ‘baby boomer’ generation in Finland from an intersectional approach. These people born between 1945 and 1955 in their retirement or approaching retirement may face new risks regarding gambling. The results of this study support the designing of harm prevention among this ageing generation. Study design: Twenty-five people were interviewed in six focus groups. Participants' gambling experience varied from non-gambling to having experienced some problems. Three of the focus groups had participants with second degree education the highest, and three of the groups had participants with second degree education the lowest. Four interviews were conducted in the capital area and two in rural environments. Methods: The group interview data were analysed with thematic content analysis. After initial coding in accordance with the research questions, subthemes and final themes were formed. Results are discussed through the final themes. Results: The main results concern the gambling habits on the participants’ life course: from shared, cultural experiences in their childhood to mostly minor gambling on the edge of retirement; the mutual understanding of the enormous growth in gambling supply during their lifetime, but emphasizing the importance of gambling monopoly for the society; and framing gambling problems as an individual tendency. Conclusions: The prevention of gambling harm within this generation needs to take into account the historical changes they have lived: from few, harmless gambling products framed as an instrument to support ‘good causes’ to the current world of commercial gambling. The deterministic understanding of gambling problems as an individual flaw may prevent recognizing problem gambling and seeking help to tackle the problems. Risks for gambling harm relate more to the gambling structures and cultures this ageing generation lives in, and the deterministic, individual understanding of gambling harm they share, than to marginalized positions they may have through gender or education. © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gambling may cause a variety of problems, both health and social, to the player, his family and his environment; Problems can be more serious for those who gamble more frequently or bet more money. Beyond the mental health gambling disorder and considering other harms derived from gambling, it is possible to develop a public health approach to the issue, including both prevention and harm reduction aspects. In recent decades gambling availability has expanded, with attempts at regulation. The objective of this paper is to provide basic information about gambling in Spain, stratifying data by Autonomous Communities (AC), from a public health perspective. METHODS: A descriptive study of some aspects of gambling in Spain was carried out. The data for amounts gambled by participants, gross gaming revenue of the industry, and establishments or machines licensed for the year 2017 were extracted from the available systematic sources. Aggregated data were tabulated and stratified by AC for those presential gambling categories with the greatest compulsive gambling potential and relevant business volume. Crude results and ratios per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated. RESULTS: Up to 41,826.8 million euros were spent gambling throughout Spain in 2017, a figure that exceeds 3.5% of the Gross Domestic Product, and the largest segment was online gambling in its various modalities (32%), followed by the national lottery and similar traditional games (27%). The supply of gambling venues (74.9 establishments per million inhabitants) was assessed by AC, showing large differences among them: their density in the region of Murcia is tenfold that of Catalonia. Gambling machines that can be installed in hospitality establishments (B machines) showed a density of 43.4 per 1,000 inhabitants, with greater homogeneity across AC than gambling premises. Regional data on the amounts spent in casinos, bingo cards, and sports betting show no homogeneous patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of money spent on gambling in Spain is very important, and online gambling has become the largest business segment. The most traditional game modes and probably with less addictive potential such as lotteries and draws continue to have a relevant presence. The availability of presential gambling shows wide heterogeneity among AC, especially for licensed gambling establishments, whose density is ten times greater in the community with more supply compared to the one with less. The data by AC of some game modalities suggest that availability may be a relevant factor for gambling, but not the only one.
OBJETIVO: Participar en juegos de azar puede causar problemas diversos, tanto sanitarios como sociales, que afectan a la persona jugadora, a su familia y a su entorno. Éstos pueden ser más graves para las personas que juegan con mayor frecuencia o que se juegan más dinero. Más allá del trastorno por juego reconocido en la salud mental, y teniendo en cuenta que de las apuestas se derivan otros daños sociales, es posible desarrollar un enfoque de salud pública sobre el juego, contemplando tanto aspectos de prevención como de reducción de daños. En las últimas décadas ha proliferado la oferta de juegos de azar, con algunos intentos de regulación. El objetivo de este trabajo fue aportar información básica sobre la oferta actual de juego en España, desagregando los datos según comunidades autónomas (CCAA), desde una perspectiva de salud pública. METODOS: Se realizó un estudio descriptivo de algunos aspectos de la oferta de juego en España. Los datos de importes jugados, los márgenes estimados de los operadores y establecimientos, o las máquinas licenciadas para el año 2017 se extrajeron de las fuentes sistemáticas consolidadas sobre el juego en España. Se tabularon datos agregados, y se desglosaron por CCAA para las categorías de juego presencial con mayor potencial de juego compulsivo y por volumen relevante de negocio. Se calcularon resultados brutos y razones por 100.000 habitantes. RESULTADOS: En 2017 se jugaron un total de 41.826,8 millones de euros en toda España, cifra que supera el 3,5% del Producto Interior Bruto, y el mayor segmento de negocio fue el juego online en sus diversas modalidades (32%), seguido de los juegos tradicionales como la Lotería Nacional y otros similares (27%). Se valoró la oferta de locales de juego (74,9 locales por millón de habitantes), con grandes diferencias entre CCAA: la región de Murcia tuvo una densidad diez veces mayor que Cataluña. Las máquinas B que pueden instalarse en establecimientos de hostelería presentaron una densidad de 43,4 por 1.000 habitantes, con mayor homogeneidad entre CCAA que los locales de juego. Los datos territorializados de gasto en casinos, cartones de bingo y apuestas deportivas mostraron patrones no concordantes. CONCLUSIONES: El volumen de dinero gastado en juegos de azar en España es muy importante, y el juego online se ha convertido en el mayor segmento de negocio. Las modalidades de juego más tradicionales, y probablemente con menos potencial adictivo, como son las loterías y sorteos, siguen teniendo una presencia muy relevante. La oferta de juego presencial muestra cierta heterogeneidad entre CCAA, especialmente por lo que respecta a los salones de juego. Los datos territorializados de algunas modalidades de juego sugieren que la oferta puede ser un factor condicionante del juego, aunque no el único.

AB  - Background and aims: The Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling moves beyond a symptomsbased view of harm and addresses a broad set of factors related to the risks and effects of gambling harmfully at the individual, family, and community levels. Coauthored by international research experts and informed by multiple stakeholders, Gambling Research Exchange (GREO) facilitated the framework development in 2013 and retains responsibility for regular updates and mobilization. This review article presents information about the revised version of the Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling completed in late 2018. Methods: We describe eight interrelated factors depicted in the framework that represent major themes in gambling ranging from the specific (gambling environment, exposure, gambling types, and treatment resources) to the general (cultural, social, psychological, and biological influences). After outlining the framework development and collaborative process, we highlight new topics for the recent update that reflect changes in the gambling landscape and prominent discourses in the scientific community. Some of these topics include social and economic impacts of gambling, and a new model of understanding gambling related harm. Discussion and conclusions: We address the relevance of the CFHG to the gambling and behavioral addictions research community. Harm-based frameworks have been undertaken in other areas of addiction that can both inform and be informed by a model dedicated to harmful gambling. Further, the framework brings a multi-disciplinary perspective to bear on antecedents and factors that cooccur with harmful gambling. © 2020 The Author.

AB  - Background: Engagement in responsible or 'positive play' strategies is known to be negatively associated with problem gambling, as indexed by measures such as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). Less is known about whether positive play is associated with reduced harm or a greater ability to enjoy the recreational benefits of gambling. Aims: This study investigated the relationship between positive play and gambling harm after controlling for PGSI scores and whether positive play moderated the relationship between PGSI scores and harm. It also examined whether positive play was related to perceived benefits associated with gambling. Methods: The study utilised an online panel sample of 554 respondents who completed a survey that included the PGSI, measures of gambling harm drawn from Browne et al. (2016), and the newly developed Positive Play Scale (Wood et al., 2019). The study involved predominantly monthly gamblers with higher levels of gambling risk: 23% problem gamblers; 36% moderate risk; and 21% low risk gamblers. Results: The results indicated that positive play was negatively associated with reduced gambling harm. The behavioural Positive Play subscales relating to pre-commitment and honesty and control explained additional variation in harm after controlling for PGSI scores. Higher levels of positive play also moderated and reduced the relationship between the PGSI and gambling harm. Perceived benefits were, unexpectedly, found to be higher in problem gamblers and negatively related to positive play. Conclusion: Behavioural measures of positive play appear to be useful moderating factors in understanding the relationship between problem gambling and harm. Higher-risk gamblers appear to experience both greater costs as well as benefits from gambling, which likely reflects a stronger personal need to engage in the activity. © 2020 The Author.

AB  - Background and aims: The Prevention Paradox (PP) suggests that a large proportion of aggregate harm from gambling occurs to people who do not have a gambling disorder. However, it has not yet been tested using a population-representative sample. We aimed to test whether the PP applies to gambling in Finland. The prevalence rates of diverse harmful consequences from gambling were surveyed amongst a population-representative sample of past-year gamblers. Methods: The study used first wave data (N = 7,186) of Finnish Gambling Harms survey, collected via online and postal surveys in 2017. A subset of 3,795 adults (≥18 years), who had gambled at least monthly in 2016, were selected for analysis. Measurements: Gambling-related harms were evaluated with the 72-item Harms Checklist. Problem and Pathological Gambling Measure (PPGM) measured respondents' probable disordered gambling from the subset of items for impaired control (4 questions) and other issues (3 questions). Findings: Consistent with previous findings, the majority of harms were reported by those in the less severe PPGM categories (i.e. scoring <5). However, considering each domain separately, this was true only for financial, emotional/psychological, and work/study harms. The PP was not supported for health, relationship, or social deviance harms. Conclusions: The population prevalence of the most serious harms (e.g. unsafe living conditions) is concentrated among those with severe impaired control issues. However, even excluding the ∼15% of harms occurring to occasional gamblers, most financial, emotional and work/study impacts occur to those with lower levels of control issues. Efforts at harm reduction should focus on the entire spectrum of issues that people experience from their gambling. © 2020 The Author.

AB  - Many governments around the world have adopted a public health (PH) approach as a framework to minimise, reduce or prevent gambling-related harm. In principle, this appears very sensible given the success of PH approaches in other areas of society: in disease control, nutrition, physical exercise and reductions in smoking. In this paper, we examine the challenges that are faced in applying PH principles to gambling. We argue that gambling is a difficult activity to address because of the highly skewed distribution of severity that makes PH interventions seem less relevant for the majority and difficult to apply to the complex minority. In our view, gambling harm can really only be reduced by changing the behaviour of individuals, and this objective is very much informed by the principles and practices of ‘individual-focused disciplines’ including psychology, social work and the medical sciences. Greater evidence and evaluation are needed to demonstrate how the ‘whole of population’ approaches advocated by PH are superior than ecological, individual-focused or responsible gambling approaches to reduce gambling-related harm. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An important consequence of adoption of public health approaches in the field of gambling studies has been the increasing emphasis afforded to gambling harm. Reducing or eliminating harm has now become the overt stated mission of many government foundations and funding bodies. A by-product of these developments has been the gradual reduction of references to terms capturing the nature of the primary disorder (problem or pathological gambling or gambling disorder) in preference for what are considered to be more neutral or less ‘stigmatising’ terms (e.g. ‘people with gambling harm’). In this paper, we argue that this conflation of gambling harm with the disorder is misguided. Not only does it fail to acknowledge the validity of the disorder but it is also unjustified by evidence and may have unintended negative consequences for both people affected by gambling and the field more generally. In particular, we focus on the clinical and legal advantages of adherence to an individual-centred, pathology model of gambling disorder. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article examines Shaffer et al.’s (2020) reaction to a Lancet paper that called for an effective public health approach to gambling. The paper claimed policy responses are individually oriented and inadequately address corporate harm determinants. Shaffer et al. maintain these and related claims are incorrect, misleading and driven by personal, political and anti-gambling views. They contend that their Reno model (RM) of responsible gambling is science-based and ascribes responsibility to multiple stakeholders, not just individuals. While agreeing that the RM is not confined to individuals, multiple reviews indicate that the most widely studied and deployed responsible gambling (RG) measures are individually focussed and have low efficacy (RG-light). An individual emphasis is also identified in the content of Shaffer et al.’s paper and it is suggested that some might see this serving industry interests. While agreeing that people who consider a product to be objectionable may view scientific evidence selectively, it is contended that this probably also applies to people who benefit financially from or are enamoured with a product. Although agreeing with a number of statements made by Shaffer et al., it is concluded that others are not well-grounded in fact. This includes statements about problem gambling prevalence and the relative importance of gambling and other determinants of gambling-related harm. While there are points of tension, it is concluded that the RM and associated RG interventions, especially RG-heavy, can play a significant part within a comprehensive regulatory and public health framework that addresses major harm determinants. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Electronic gaming machines (EGMs) are widely used and the gambling product most commonly associated with harmful gambling. Understanding factors that increase the risk of problematic EGM play is therefore important. Previous studies into risk factors for EGM gambling have used measures of problem gambling based on an individual’s total gambling activity, which therefore do not distinguish harmful gambling specifically associated with EGMs. This study used an EGM-specific measure (PGSI-EGM) to achieve its aim of identifying risk factors specifically associated with problematic EGM play. By removing nuisance effects from other gambling forms that higher-risk gamblers typically engage in, this approach provides a more accurate assessment of the determinants of EGM-related problems. An online survey was completed by 1932 at-least monthly EGM players in Australia. It measured demographics, EGM gambling behaviour, motivations, gambling urges, gambling fallacies, trait self-control, alcohol misuse, and the PGSI-EGM. A penalised regression model identified the most important proximal predictors of higher-risk EGM gambling as: higher gambling urges, higher levels of erroneous cognitions, playing EGMs more frequently, higher session expenditure, longer sessions, usually playing EGMs alone, and playing EGMs in more venues. Lower trait self control was the strongest distal determinant. Higher-risk EGM players tended to be younger, male, more educated, never married, to have higher (although still modest) incomes, and be more likely to have alcohol problems. These findings can inform interventions such as treatment, consumer education and venue interventions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Rationale: Gambling and alcohol use are recreational behaviours that share substantial commonalities at a phenomenological, clinical and neurobiological level. Past studies have shown that alcohol can have a disinhibiting effect on gambling behaviour, in terms of bet size and persistence. Objectives: This study was conducted in order to characterise how alcohol affects biases in judgment and decision-making that occur during gambling, with a focus on sequential decision-making including the gambler’s fallacy. Methods: Sequential biases were elicited via a roulette-based gambling task. Using a standard between-groups alcohol challenge procedure, male participants played the roulette task 20 min after receiving an alcoholic (0.8 g/kg; n = 22) or placebo (n = 16) beverage. The task measured colour choice decisions (red/black) and bet size, in response to varying lengths of colour runs and winning/losing feedback streaks. Results: Across both groups, a number of established sequential biases were observed. On colour choice, there was an effect of run length in line with the gambler’s fallacy, which further varied by previous feedback (wins vs losses). Bet size increased with feedback streaks, especially for losing streaks. Compared to placebo, the alcohol group placed higher bets following losses compared to wins. Conclusions: Increased bet size after losses following alcohol consumption may reflect increased loss chasing that may amplify gambling harms. Our results do not fit a simple pattern of enhanced gambling distortions or reward sensitivity, but help contextualise the effects of alcohol on gambling to research on decision-making biases. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: To help mitigate potential gambling harm, responsible gambling information centres are launching across casino venues in North America. The launch of the first such centre in the USA provided an opportunity to achieve three goals: (1) document the centre’s reach among casino patrons, (2) generate a comprehensive description of services provided, and (3) explore the potential for a dose–response relationship between centre exposure and gambling beliefs and behaviour. Design: We documented services provided and surveyed consecutive centre visitors. Setting: We achieved these goals at the GameSense Info Center, located in the first Massachusetts casino. Method: Programme staff recorded their services via electronic checklist and administered one-page surveys to visitors with whom they discussed problem or responsible gambling. Results: Programme staff reported engaging directly with approximately 1% of daily patrons. About 70% of their interactions were casual. During conversations that did move beyond a casual nature, programme staff typically provided information about responsible gambling, consistent with patrons’ self-reported needs and concerns. Finally, among a sample of patrons who repeatedly engaged with programme staff at the most involved level (N = 129), those with relatively little programme exposure were more likely to hold an accurate gambling belief but less likely to report having set time limits on their casino visits. Conclusion: We did not observe support for the notion that using an on-site information centre to teach patrons about important gambling concepts is associated with more responsible gambling behaviour. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Many people worry that exposure to Internet gambling will overpower individuals’ self-control, stimulate addictive behavior patterns, and provide the context to sustain addiction once it emerges. Though many researchers have attempted to evaluate this proposition, they have been limited by their methodological approaches-specifically, their use of convenience samples and self-reports of Internet gambling behavior. At the Division on Addiction, the authors collaborated with bwin.party digital entertainment to examine electronically recorded gambling data (i.e., records of actual gambling) among bwin.party subscribers. As described in this chapter, their early epidemiological studies revealed that few Internet gamblers are intemperate and that the typical Internet player gambles moderately. However, those who do use the Internet to gamble excessively often experience lasting and far-reaching harm. The authors review prevention and intervention strategies to help promote healthier Internet gambling. These cross-cutting strategies emerge from public policy, public health, corporate social responsibility, and other fields. With regard to user-initiated strategies, the authors describe what researchers have discovered about the effectiveness and reach of self-limitation and self-exclusion programs. With regard to operator-initiated strategies, they propose a series of steps leading to the development of algorithms designed to predict which Internet gamblers will require interventions to reduce gambling harm. The authors describe their approach to these steps during their work developing predictive algorithms for bwin.party. Finally, the chapter considers ethical principles that should inform the development of programs and policies designed to provide the safest possible Internet gambling experience. © Oxford University Press 2020.

AB  - Commercial gambling has seen massive global expansion in the past 25 years. It is a huge industry selling a risky form of entertainment: Problem gambling is the only nonsubstance addiction recognized in the DSM-5, affecting an average of 2.3% of people in jurisdictions where prevalence data are available. Gambling also harms people who gamble below the clinical threshold of "problem gambling", as well as the friends, families and communities of people who gamble. Gambling harm is disproportionally felt by racialized peoples and people of lower socioeconomic status. As such, researchers and governments are increasingly viewing gambling as a public health issue. Gambling research is published in both the primary and grey literature, and the integrity of gambling research is a topic of increasingly heated debate. Bibliometric reviews have found that gambling research is heavily focused on the psychological and biological characteristics of people with problem gambling, with less emphasis on the gambling products themselves and how they are provided. While the gambling grey literature is recognized as valuable by the gambling research community, it has not yet been systematically assessed. In this paper we present the grey literature analysis portion of a pilot project to use a big data approach to produce a mapping review of gambling research from five nations: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States. For primary research publications on gambling, we performed systematized searches on the Scopus and Web of Science databases. For gambling grey literature, we retrieved all grey literature documents in the GREO International Gambling Research Evidence Centre. For the period of 2014-2018, the grey literature search yielded 360 reports, compared to 1292 articles in the primary literature search. The proportion of grey literature greatly varied by country, ranging from <10% in USA to nearly 50% in New Zealand. Content analysis revealed that the problems investigated in gambling grey literature are very different from the published literature: The top problems in the published literature were young gamblers and online gambling, whereas the top problems in the grey literature were the prevalence of problem gambling and the health and well-being of the public. This demonstrates that the grey literature is a vital piece of the puzzle to understanding this public health issue. © 2020 TextRelease. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gambling-related harm has become a key metric for measuring the adverse consequences of gambling on a population level. Yet, despite this renewed understanding in contemporary research, little exploration has been conducted to evaluate which instrument is best suited to capture the harmful consequences of gambling. This study was designed with the aim of determining whether Likert scales were better suited to capture gambling harm than binary scales. We hypothesized that the Short Gambling Harm Screen (SGHS), initially scored using a binary scale, would perform similarly to the alternate form that was Likertized for the purpose of this study. A corresponding comparison in the reverse direction was executed for the Problem Gambling Severity Index. The SGHS’s performance was assessed via a repeated-measures design in combination with three other measures of validity administered at the conclusion of the survey. In the end, we found that changing the scoring format (i.e., from binary to Likert) had negligible impact on the SGHS’s psychometric performance. We conclude that the original scoring method of the SGHS is not only appropriate but also no less suitable than Likert scales in measuring gambling harm. © 2020, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

AB  - Background: The expansion of online gambling in the UK has been accompanied by an increase in the number of novel betting products, particularly for soccer. The present research investigates which types of sports bettors are the most likely to use novel gambling products called ‘custom sports bets’ (CSBs), which allow gamblers to create their own unique bets. Method: A large-scale, cross-sectional survey of online sports/horse racing bettors (n = 789, 32.7% female). The survey collected two measures of CSB usage and four validated gambling measures: the Problem Gambling Severity Index, the Gambling Related Cognition Illusion of Control Scale, the Short Gambling Harm Screen, and the Consumption Screen for Problem Gambling. Results: Overall, 62.0% of participants reported having used a CSB, and those who had used a CSB did so on an average of 29.4 days over the last year. Overall, 16.0% of participants who had used a CSB were current problem gamblers, compared to 6.7% among those who had not. CSB users reported an average of 2.3 out of 10 possible gambling harms, compared to 1.5 harms for those who had not used a CSB. The illusion of control scale was significantly positively correlated with whether participants had ever used a CSB before, but not with past-year frequency of CSB usage. The usage of CSB products was most strongly associated with the frequency of gambling consumption. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest that CSB products raise distinctive concerns around consumer protection for frequent sports bettors which deserve further investigation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Gambling disorder is recognized in DSM-5 and ICD-11 as a behavioral addiction that shares substantial psychological and neurobiological overlap with substance use disorders. This chapter outlines how cognitive processes originally described in the field of judgment and decision-making provide a foundation from which gambling-related cognitive distortions emerge. These cognitive mechanisms are implicated in the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of disordered gambling. We focus on three specific effects: the illusion of control, the tendency to anthropomorphize gambling games, and slot machine immersion. We conceptualize these biases as arising from the interaction between personal vulnerabilities to gambling disorder, which include neurocognitive dispositional factors and structural characteristics of gambling products. From this framework, the structural design of gambling products, including emerging technologies that facilitate access to gambling games, may perpetuate gambling-related distortions and thus gambling harms, with implications for regulation. Psychological therapies that build on this cognitive approach are widely deployed in the treatment of problem gambling and have evidence of effectiveness, including techniques directly aiming to restructure decision-making biases. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increase in advocacy and social media activism in the field of gambling studies. Much of the focus of this activity has been directed toward concern about the lack of concerted government action to reduce gambling-harm as well as concern about industry influence in government policy and research agendas. It is thought that such activity could be successful in reducing harmful behavior as has been witnessed in relation to smoking in previous decades. In this paper, we highlight some concerns about this advocacy activity as it applies to gambling. We support the view that careful scrutiny should be applied to any research directly funded for industry due to the potential conflict of interest. However, we believe that: (a) greater scrutiny should be given to the role of government and other interest groups in the determination of research agendas and (b) greater transparency be displayed by public health advocates who are strongly opposed to gambling on moral, ethical or theoretical grounds. We discuss the potential pitfalls of conflating research academic and advocacy roles and the threats which this can pose for balanced, inclusive and objective debates in the field of gambling studies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The economic benefits of gambling may be offset by economic harm to other industries. This economic phenomenon, also known as substitution or cannibalization, refers to a new product that diverts consumption and profits from other products or industries. Gambling may displace revenue from other businesses, but economic impact studies on gambling do not consider such shifts between expenditures. This paper presents a systematic review of the available evidence (N = 118) on whether the introduction or expansion of gambling harms or benefits other business activity. Although the issue has been considered in previous review studies, no industry-level analysis is currently available. The results show that such an approach is necessary, as the impacts of gambling on other industries appear to depend strongly on the type of industry, as well as on the location and type of gambling. Industries that are negatively affected by gambling include other recreation, retail and merchandise, manufacturing, and agriculture and mining. Alcohol consumption, construction, and the finance, insurance, and real estate industries, as well as other services, appear to be positively affected by the presence of gambling. In other cases, the evidence is either mixed or inconclusive. These results nevertheless depend strongly on the type of gambling. Destination gambling appears to be more beneficial to other industries than recreational gambling. Overall, the results show that even in cases when gambling does substitute for other industries, the displacement is not complete. The reasons for this and the gaps in the existing evidence and literature are discussed. © 2020, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Gambling is now a well-recognised public health issue and forms the focus of extensive harm reduction initiatives. Recent developments in policy, practice and technology, such relaxation of regulations, the increasing influence of global gambling corporations, and the development of devices such as mobile phone apps and fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) mean that the landscape is a complex, dynamic, and fast moving one. Gambling is now practiced using new technologies, in various spaces and places, and features in a range of social surroundings. Therefore, research is needed to inform appropriate gambling harm reduction strategies that can respond to this complex domain. Yet, research and policy approaches to the reduction of gambling harm are predominantly framed through psychological and economic models of individual behaviour, addiction, and 'rational' action. This is beginning to change, with a growing corpus of socio-cultural approaches to gambling research now emerging. Method: In this article, we argue the case of recognising gambling as a social practice, the performance of which draws upon multiple elements such as technology and materials, spaces and places, language and discourse, and structures and agency. We call for a practice theory approach to gambling research that joins efforts to move beyond individual gamblers and their behaviour, to also acknowledge the interaction of multiple elements shaping gambling practices. To achieve this, we suggest that research methods such as visual ethnography can be helpful. Conclusion: We set out how a social practice perspective to gambling research can generate different insights and help inform more nuanced and appropriate gambling harm reduction initiatives. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background Not all gambling exposes people to the same level of harm. Harm from gambling is found at the individual, social (family and friends) and community levels. This includes financial hardship, psychological distress and interpersonal conflict or relationship breakdown. The harm from gambling to wider society includes fraud, theft, loss of productivity in the workforce and the cost of treating this addiction. The annual estimated excess cost of gambling for Wales is between £40 and £70 million. Methods This study reviews the existing data sources and literature to ascertain if gambling is an emerging public health issue in Wales. Results In Wales 61% of adults had gambled in the last year (1.5 million people). And 1.1% of the population (30 000 people) self-report as having a problem with gambling using either the Problem Gambling Severity Index or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of American Psychiatric Association tools. The 'ripple effect' of gambling harm can mean friends and family are highly impacted. Conclusion The existing data and literature together with the rapidly evolving developments in infrastructure demonstrate that gambling is an emerging public health issue in Wales. The impact on families and society warrants population level interventions to tackle this public health issue. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Reflecting international patterns, Aboriginal people in Victoria are more likely to gamble and to experience gambling harm than non-Indigenous Victorians. This paper describes experiences of gambling reported by 50 Aboriginal people interviewed in regional Victoria in 2016 and 2017 as part of studies initiated by two Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. Data were analysed using social practice theory (SPT) and coded to the elements of ‘meaning’, ‘material’, ‘competence’, and ‘temporality’. Across each element we identified highly contradictory experiences. Gambling held meaning as an opportunity for community gatherings but was also regarded as a cause of domestic violence, conflict, isolation and shame. Materially, the venues that offered gambling were experienced by many Aboriginal people as safe and welcoming, but at the same time gambling produced a damaging affective sense of addiction for some. Gambling was a competency that some people valued and taught to children, but it was also seen as undermining cultural practices. While Aboriginal people were historically denied access to licensed venues offering commercial gambling, many participants now found opportunities to gamble inescapable. The intermingling of benefits and harms described above supports the need for a multi-faceted response to gambling in Aboriginal communities, which includes harm reduction as well as supply restriction and treatment. Some experiences of gambling related by our participants reflected those reported also by non-Indigenous Australians, while others were differently nuanced. Because SPT is used to understand collectively-shared practices, it facilitates the identification of gambling interventions at the level of the community, as recommended by our research participants. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Gambling exposes people to risk for harm, but also has recreational benefits. The present study aimed to measure gambling harm and gambling benefits on similar scales using two novel methods adapted from the Burden of Disease approach (McCormack et al. in Psychol Med 18(4):1007–1019, 1988; Torrance et al. in Health Serv Res 7(2):118–133, 1972) to find whether gambling either adds or subtracts from quality of life. A Tasmanian population-representative survey of 5000 adults (2534 female) from random digit dialling (RDD) of landline telephones in Tasmania (50%), as well as pre-screened Tasmanian RDD mobiles (17%) and listed mobile numbers (33%), measured gambling benefits and harms amongst gamblers (59.2%) and a non-exclusive set of people who were “affected” by someone else’s gambling (4.5%). The majority of gamblers indicated no change to their quality of life from gambling (82.5% or 72.6% based on direct elicitation or time trade off methods, respectively). Nevertheless, a weighted average of all the positive and negative influences on quality of life, inclusive of gamblers and affected others, revealed that the quality of life change from gambling is either a very modest + 0.05% or a more concerning − 1.9% per capita. Gambling generates only small or negative net consumer surpluses for Tasmanians. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Prior studies have identified self-regulatory strategies that are infrequently used by problemgamblers, but which might be protective if used. However, guidelines with evidence-based safe gambling practices (SGPs) that prevent gambling-related harm are lacking. This study aimed to: 1) identify a parsimonious set of evidence-based SGPs that best predict nonharmful gambling amongst gamblers who are otherwise most susceptible to experiencing gambling harm; 2) examine how widely are they used; and 3) assess whether their use differs by gambler characteristics. A sample of 1,174 regular gamblers in Alberta Canada completed an online survey measuring uptake of 43 potential SGPs, gambling harms and numerous risk factors for harmful gambling. Elastic net regression identified a sub-sample of 577 gamblers most susceptible to gambling harm and therefore most likely to benefit from the uptake of SGPs. A second elastic net predicted gambling harm scores in the sub-sample, using the SGPs as candidate predictors. Nine SGPs best predicted non-harmful gambling amongst this sub-sample. The behaviour most strongly associated with increased harm was using credit to gamble. The behaviour most strongly associated with reduced harm was 'If I'm not having fun gambling, I stop'. These SGPs form the basis of evidencebased safe gambling guidelines which can be: 1) promoted to consumers, 2) form the basis of self-assessment tests, 3) used to measure safe gambling at a population level, and 4) inform supportive changes to policy and practice. The guidelines advise gamblers to: stop if they are not having fun, keep a household budget, keep a dedicated gambling budget, have a fixed amount they can spend, engage in other leisure activities, avoid gambling when upset or depressed, not use credit for gambling, avoid gambling to make money, and not think that strategies can help you win. These guidelines are a promising initiative to help reduce gambling-related harm. © 2019 Hing et al.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Gambling operators’ capacity to track gamblers in the online environment may enable identification of those users experiencing gambling harm. This review provides an update on research testing behavioral variables against indicators of disordered gambling. We consider the utility of machine learning algorithms in risk prediction, and challenges to be overcome. Recent Findings: Disordered online gambling is associated with a range of behavioral variables, as well as other predictors including demographic and payment-related information. Machine learning is ideally suited to the task of combining these predictors in risk identification, although current research has yielded mixed success. Recent work enhancing the temporal resolution of behavioral analysis to characterize bet-by-bet changes may identify novel predictors of loss chasing. Summary: Data science has considerable potential to identify high-risk online gambling, informed by principles of behavioral analysis. Identification may enable targeting of interventions to users who are most at risk. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study compared the experience of gambling related harms between gamblers and spouses, whilst taking into account gender and problem gambling severity. Participants (N = 5036, 2603 females) from Australia and New Zealand completed a retrospective survey that probed the prevalence of specific harms from gambling within six harm domains (financial, work/study, health, emotional/psychological, relationship, and social deviance). Overall there was a similar count of total harms reported across all domains experienced by spouses (vs gamblers), however the types and patterns of harms reported were markedly different. Spouses reported the highest number of harms within the emotional/psychological and relationship domains, whereas gamblers experienced a higher number of harms in all other domains. Spouses were five to six times more likely to report increased conflict in their relationship due to gambling, greater relationship tension, and ending a relationship. In comparison, gamblers reported more severe health-related harms, such as suicide attempts and increased alcohol consumption. The findings highlight the unique ways in which gamblers and their spouses each respond to the presence of gambling problems. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper examines the significance of recent developments in research relating to gambling-related harm. Previous research, it is argued, has failed to capture gambling-harm in a way that is useful to inform public policy and regulation. This is because most standardised psychometric measures and the DSM classifications have conflated gambling behaviour and harm and mostly focused on serious harms. As a result, little has generally been known about the prevalence of harm in lower risk gambling groups. Here we summarise the findings from recent harm research, the methodologies used and their conceptual implications. It is argued that strong progress has been made in the categorization and measurement of gambling harm, but that caution must be applied when applying these measures to estimate the ‘burden of disease’ associated with gambling in the community. Particular issues discussed include: the differentiation of opportunity cost and harm; the validity of additive methods involving different severities of measured harm; using comparisons with unfamiliar disorders; and the validity of prevention paradox arguments in this area of research. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A proliferation of wagering advertising has raised concerns about its effects, especially on vulnerable gamblers. This study examined exposure to wagering advertisements and inducements, and their reported influence on the size, frequency and riskiness of bets placed-amongst regular bettors and by gambler risk group. An Ecological Momentary Assessment design minimised recall bias. After completing a baseline survey, 722 regular bettors completed up to 15 surveys administered on 5 days per week over three non-consecutive weeks. Data were analysed for the 316 race bettors and 279 sports bettors completing at least one survey. The results indicate that regular bettors have almost daily exposure to wagering advertising, including for inducements. The most frequently seen and influential advertisement types were direct messages (emails, texts and/or phone calls from wagering operators, which, in Australia, bettors are automatically opted-into when opening a betting account) and advertisements on betting websites or apps. Participants reported the most influential inducements to be: stake-back offers, multi-bet offers, match your stake or deposit offers, better odds/winnings inducements, happy hours, rewards programs, and cash out early offers. The findings indicate that wagering advertisements, including for inducements, are likely to be having powerful effects on regular bettors. On each day that respondents saw these advertisements (most days for most advertisement types), substantial minorities reported increased size and frequency of betting. Results did not vary by gambler risk group. Understanding which types of wagering advertising are associated with most gambling-related harm can inform advertising regulations, targeted public health interventions, and future research.

AB  - Background: Our understanding of gambling relapse is limited despite the damaging consequences affecting many aspects of the gambler’s life. Paradoxically, regardless of these negative consequences problem gamblers (PGs) continue to relapse, seemingly unable to stop this cycle of harm. This paper addresses the phenomenon of repeated gambling relapse shedding some insights into why gamblers continue to relapse. Methods: The study comprised of (n = 54) participants purposefully selected who participated in either 1 of 5 focus groups (n = 35) or in-depth interviews (n = 19). The new knowledge obtained was from PGs, significant others, and workers with direct experience of gambling relapse. Interview recordings were analysed using thematic, textual analysis. Results: The avoidance of negative emotions from the consequences of the destructive behaviour associated with repeated relapse leads to a hopeless “merry-go-round”. Once on this “merry go round”, relapse becomes a habitual way of life where behaviour change and learning from the devastation of a gambling relapse is challenging. Exiting this cycle means PGs must face the consequences of their gambling which for many is overwhelming, and relapse is a way to avoid despair. Conclusions: These findings provide insights into relapse which has implications for gamblers seeking treatment, assessment and treatment “drop-outs”. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Video slot machines are associated with both accelerated transition into problematic forms of gambling, as well as psychosocial harm above and beyond other forms of gambling. A growing body of evidence is uncovering how key design features of multiline slot machines produce an inflated experience of reward, despite the fact that these features offer no overall financial benefit to the player. A pernicious example of this are ‘losses disguised as wins’ (LDWs), which occur when simultaneous bets placed on multiple lines result in a winning combination that returns an amount greater than zero, but less the total wager. These events are usually accompanied by the same celebratory sounds and animations that accompany true wins. We argue that LDWs may leverage neuropsychological phenomena that underlie reinforcement learning and contribute to extended or repetitive use and gambling-related harm. While other characteristics of slot machine gambling have been examined by cognitive neuroscientists, this feature has not yet received attention. Neuroscientific methods can be used to assess the impact of LDWs on the human reward system, to assess the claim that these events are a reinforcing and contributing factor in the development of harmful play. Positive findings would provide further persuasive evidence in support of strategies to minimise gambling harm through the regulation of machine design. © 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: Public health advocacy is important in preventing harm and promoting health in communities. There has been little research into public health advocacy strategies which address gambling related harms. This study aimed to identify the role of advocacy in gambling reform, challenges to gambling advocacy implementation, and strategies that could facilitate change. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a sample of 50 stakeholders with backgrounds in gambling policy, research, health promotion, and advocacy. Participants were asked about how advocacy could be used to address gambling harm, and the range of barriers and facilitators for effective advocacy responses. A constant comparative method of analysis was used on the data. Results: While participants perceived that there was a role for advocacy in preventing and reducing gambling related harm, they discussed a range of challenges. These included restrictions associated with funding of research and services, the power of the gambling industry, and the role of stigma in preventing people with lived experience of gambling from speaking about their experiences. Participants also described a range of facilitators of public health advocacy approaches, including independent funding sources, reframing the ‘responsibility’ debate, developing opportunities and capacity for people with lived experience of harm, and developing broadly based coalitions to enable cohesive and consistent advocacy responses to gambling harm. Conclusion: There is a clear role for public health advocacy approaches aimed at preventing and reducing gambling harm. Future research could identify how advocacy strategies may be implemented as a part of a comprehensive public health approach to gambling reform. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Individual differences in the risk of developing gambling-related harm play an important role in theoretical models and practical interventions. The present study attempted comprehensive measurement and evaluation of 25 known risk factors for gambling-related harm in order to determine which factors provided large and unique explanatory power. We surveyed 1650 regular gamblers from an online panel, screening in 1174 (466 male) who passed all checks of attention and response consistency. We evaluated each risk factor based on bivariate correlations with harms, then made separate multivariate evaluations of proximal (e.g., gambling motivations) and distal (e.g., religiosity) risk factors. Almost all bivariate correlations were significant, but most distal factors were not significant in multivariate models. Trait impulsivity was the most important risk factor by a large margin. Excessive consumption, less use of safe gambling practices, and more fallacies were key proximal risks of harm. Many well-known correlates of gambling harm (e.g., youth, lower educational attainment) do not show a direct role in the development of gambling harm when controlling for other factors. The results support theoretical models that emphasise early conditioning and biological vulnerability (manifested through impulsivity). Since maladaptive cognitive and behavioural schemas appear to be more important than motivations (e.g., escape, excitement, ego), interventions may benefit by targeting these proximal drivers of harm.

AB  - While information science researchers have for some time examined sharing, non-sharing behaviours have received less attention. This study explored the role and impact of secretive information behaviours in the context of gambling activities and social interactions around harmful gambling. The study followed a qualitative approach, involving in-depth interviews with recovering gamblers and gamblers' families and friends in Ireland. Findings revealed that secretive information behaviours, such as self-concealment, were characteristic of gamblers' and their families' experiences of gambling harm. While self-concealing information behaviours facilitated the gambler's secret participation in gambling, the negative financial and social outcomes had a further serious impact on family members and their coping strategies. Understanding how and why people adopt secretive information behaviours can facilitate positive navigation of information in risky and stressful circumstances. Findings offer a more holistic view of information use, sharing, and decision making, by including negative as well as positive information outcomes in modeling of information behaviour. © 2019

AB  - Background: While the prevalence of women's participation in gambling is steadily increasing, there is a well-recognised male bias in gambling research and policy. Few papers have sought to synthesise the literature relating to women and gambling-related harm and provide practical suggestions to guide future research, policy, and practice which take into account the specific nuances associated with women's gambling. Methods: A narrative literature review was conducted to review the evidence base on women's gambling behaviours and experiences of harm. Drawing from strategies used effectively in other areas of public health, key elements for a gendered approach to harm prevention were identified and adapted into practical public health research, policy and practice strategies. Results: Results indicated a lack of research that explores women's gambling. Few studies have examined the impact of gambling on the lives of women, with limited understanding of the factors that influence women's engagement with gambling products, and the impact of industry tactics. A gendered approach was identified as a strategy used successfully in other areas of public health to shift the focus onto women and to ensure they are considered in research. In tobacco control, increasing trends in women's smoking behaviour were combatted with targeted research, policy and practical initiatives. These key elements were adapted to create a conceptual framework for reducing and preventing gambling harm in women. The framework provides regulatory direction and a research agenda to minimise gambling-related harm for women both in Australia and internationally. Evidence-based policies should be implemented to focus on the influence of gender and associated factors to address gambling-related harm. Practical interventions must take into account how women conceptualise and respond to gambling risk in order to develop specific harm prevention programs which respond to their needs. Conclusion: A gendered approach to gambling harm prevention shifts the focus onto the unique factors associated with women's gambling and specific ways to prevent harm. As seen in other areas of public health, such a framework enables harm measures, policies, and interventions to be developed that are salient to girls and women's lives, experiences and circumstances. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Harmful gambling is a complex issue with diverse antecedents and resulting harms that have been studied from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Although previous bibliometric reviews of gambling studies have found a dominance of judgement and decision-making research, no bibliometric review has examined the concept of "harm" in the gambling literature, and little work has quantitatively assessed how gambling research priorities differ between countries. Methods: Guided by the Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling (CFHG), an internationally relevant framework of antecedents to harmful gambling, we conducted a bibliometric analysis focusing on research outputs from three countries with different gambling regulatory environments: Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Using a Web of Science database search, 1424 articles published from 2008 to 2017 were retrieved that could be mapped to the eight CFHG factors. A subsample of articles (n = 171) containing the word "harm" in the title, abstract, or keywords was then drawn. Descriptive statistics were used to examine differences between countries and trends over time with regard to CFHG factor and harm focus. Results: Psychological and biological factors dominate gambling research in Canada whereas resources and treatment have received more attention in New Zealand. A greater percentage of Australia and New Zealand publications address the gambling environment and exposure to gambling than in Canada. The subset of articles focused on harm showed a stronger harms focus among New Zealand and Australian researchers compared to Canadian-authored publications. Conclusions: The findings provide preliminary bibliometric evidence that gambling research foci may be shaped by jurisdictional regulation of gambling. Countries with privately operated gambling focused on harm factors that are the operators' responsibility, whereas jurisdictions with a public health model focused on treatment and harm reduction resources. In the absence of a legislated requirement for public health or harm minimisation focus, researchers in jurisdictions with government-operated gambling tend to focus research on factors that are the individual's responsibility and less on the harms they experience. Given increased international attention to gambling-related harm, regulatory and research environments could promote and support more diverse research in this area. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This study uses a simple metric to assess the degree of risk an individual player takes on while gambling. The player’s average potential gross win per bet placed captures both the amount of money put at risk and the volatility of returns, each of which will be correlated with risk of gambling harm. To illustrate the potential usefulness of this metric, the study analyses individual account data relating to online bets on horse racing. Analysing total stakes, the traditional indicator of risk taking, and applying ordinary least squares regression, the greatest risk takers appear to be males in their mid-fifties. Using the new metric and applying quantile regression to allow a focus on heavier bettors, the highest risk takers are shown as substantially younger, males around 30. Choice of metric and estimation method therefore matter and the approach proposed here could be used by operators to identify which online players take greatest risks. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article aimed to develop and validate a measure of protective beliefs–distinct from the absence of erroneous beliefs–that may be associated with resistance to gambling problems. Study 1 was designed to determine the reliability and content validity of a preliminary set of protective belief items. Participants (N = 1479, 813 males) also completed the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). Most items were associated with reduced risk of problems; however, items relating to an awareness of gambling harm, and preparedness to lose money were positively correlated with gambling problems and were therefore not demonstrably protective. Study 2 sought to reduce scale size and assess the scale’s ability to predict risk of gambling problems. Participants (N = 1168, 625 males) completed belief items, the PGSI, and measures of gambling consumption and cognitive distortions. Results showed that endorsement of protective beliefs was negatively correlated with PGSI, gambling consumption and cognitive distortions, and predicted PGSI above that of cognitive distortions. Findings suggest that the Protective Gambling Beliefs Scale (PGBS) offers a unique tool for understanding resistance to the development of gambling problems. Future research should focus on exploring whether protective beliefs can diminish the likelihood of the onset of problem gambling. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A major obstacle to understanding how expenditure varies among people who gamble is the difficulty of obtaining accurate expenditure data from individual gamblers. To overcome the shortcomings of retrospective self-reports, this study used a prospective ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design to capture these data every 24 or 48 hours. It aimed to examine (a) demographic, psychological, behavioural, and contextual characteristics of high-spending sports and race bettors and (b) the relationship between betting outlay and problem gambling severity. A baseline survey was completed by 320 regular sports bettors and 402 regular race bettors, followed by 15 EMA surveys over 3 non-consecutive weeks. Higher spending bettors were more likely to be male, place more of their bets online, have higher disposable incomes, have commenced betting at a younger age, have more accounts with betting operators, and bet when affected by alcohol. The analyses confirmed the strong link between problem gambling severity and financial outlay on betting. Regular sports bettors who were experiencing gambling problems spent 4 times more than their nonproblem gambling counterparts did, and those at moderate risk spent 3 times more. Regular race bettors who were experiencing gambling problems spent 3 times more than the non-problem gambling race bettors did, and those at moderate risk spent twice as much. These results suggest that regulatory and other initiatives that help bettors to limit or reduce their financial outlay on betting should be central to harm minimization efforts in order to reduce the growing number of bettors who experience gambling problems and harm. © 2019, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

AB  - Background and aims: Gambling education programs typically focus on promoting gambling as a high-risk activity with harmful effects; however, these programs demonstrate limited effects on the prevention of gambling problems. This paper proposes a clear theoretical framework to inform the content and delivery of gambling education initiatives and draws on psychological and pedagogical research to address some of the practical issues associated with its implementation. Methods: Literature was reviewed across fields of psychology, public health, and pedagogy to provide key recommendations to improve the outcomes of gambling education. Results: Four key recommendations were made for the development of future gambling education programs centering on theoretical approach, specialized content, and delivery. Discussion and conclusions: Recommended advancements are as follows: (a) evidence suggests shifting away from messages about gambling harms and instead applying a cognitive-developmental framework of problem gambling that may improve youth engagement by increasing personal relevance. (b) The cognitive model of problem gambling suggests that misconceptions about the profitability of gambling games (e.g., the gambler’s fallacy) play an important role in the development of problems and should be a key target for education. However, exposing such misconceptions requires the challenge of teaching the mathematical principles that underpin them. (c) The pedagogical field provides valuable insights into teaching complex concepts. Research that applies the conceptual change model to science education suggests misconceptions also facilitate learning new complex information, such as gambling-related mathematical concepts (i.e., randomness and statistics). (d) In addition, improvements in computer-assisted teaching methods provide opportunities to use simulations and visualizations to help teach abstract concepts and correct such misconceptions. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Background and aims: The broadcast of wagering advertisements during televised sports matches has been associated with various adverse outcomes. In order to counter these effects, legislative bodies require wagering operators to include responsible gambling messages in their advertisements; however, the effectiveness of these messages is unclear. This study sought to examine the extent to which responsible gambling messages are looked at, in the wider context of gambling advertisements. Methods: Forty-nine regular sports bettors and 10 non-gamblers viewed a series of sports betting advertisements, while an eye-tracker recorded the number of fixations placed on responsible gambling messages, as well as other text-based wagering content. Results: Responsible gambling messages were, generally, presented in a non-conspicuous manner. Eye-tracking data revealed that significantly fewer fixations were placed on responsible gambling messages, compared to wagering information (p < .001); however, this effect did not differ according to level of gambling risk (p = .169). The number of fixations placed on the different types of responsible gambling messages was found to vary, based on gambling risk (p = .006), as well as, what appears to be, the physical characteristics of these messages. Discussion: Very few fixations were placed on, or near, responsible gambling messages, compared to other wagering information, meaning that, in their current form, they are unlikely to be effective in protecting against gambling harm. Preliminary evidence shows that presenting messages on a high-contrast/block-color background increases the number of fixations on these. Conclusion: Further research is needed to identify ways of increasing the effectiveness of responsible gambling initiatives in the sports betting context. © 2019 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

AB  - The exact origins of gambling have faded into obscurity but its presence dates back to antiquity. Archaeological findings offer evidence of games of chance played circa 4000 years BC, with many forms laying the foundation for subsequent gambling where items of values were exchanged on the outcome of chance events. Societal acceptance of gambling has fluctuated from extremes of widespread indulgence to attempted suppression, the latter in response to the social and economic impacts of excessive gambling. In the early 1900s, psychological theories were applied in an attempt to explain excessive gambling and operationally define the condition as a clinical disorder. The inclusion of ‘pathological gambling’ within ICD-9 in 1975 and DSM-III in 1980 consolidated the clinical status of the disorder, but debate on symptomatology and its classification as an impulse control or addictive behaviour remains. Although traditionally the focus has been directed predominately towards establishing diagnostic criteria and developing instruments to measure prevalence rates, contemporary efforts are turning their attention to assessing gambling-related harms across the full spectrum of gambling behaviours. This is reflected in the growing use of the term ‘problem gambling’ to refer to gambling behaviour that is resulting in harm and is consistent with a wider public health harm minimization approach that complements the clinical management of gambling disorders. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Objectives:Within the field of gambling research, an emerging body of literature has begun to examine the associations between neighborhood context and gambling outcomes (i.e., gambling participation and problems). Previous research has been heavily focused on objective measures of neighborhood influence with few studies examining subjective (i.e., perceived) neighborhood attributes as they relate to gambling outcomes. This study aimed to expand knowledge of the effects of neighborhood characteristics on gambling patterns and problems.Methods:Using data derived from the fourth wave of an epidemiological community sample (n=1862), this study explores the associations between perceived neighborhood contextual factors and gambling participation and problems.Results:Our findings reveal that community participation was positively related to gambling participation, even after accounting for control variables (i.e., sex and social support). Perceived neighborhood disorder was positively associated with problem gambling.Conclusions:Findings highlight the importance of looking beyond individual risk factors for gambling outcomes. Population-based interventions for gambling problems may benefit from understanding how neighborhood contexts come into play. © 2018 by the Canadian Society of Addiction Medicine.

AB  - Over the past decade, gambling has become a very popular activity across Europe including the growth of Internet gambling. Portugal is one of the few European countries where little research has been carried out. Given the lack of studies, a Portuguese sample (N = 1,599) was surveyed concerning their online and offline gambling habits. More specifically, the aim of this study was to identify and compare from the total sample, online pathological gamblers (PGON) (n = 171) and offline pathological gamblers’ (PGOF) (n = 171) characteristics, and eventual risk factors for the development of problem gambling. Results demonstrated that PGON had different profiles compared to PGOF, although there were also similarities. Situational characteristics were much more significant for PGON than PGOF (e.g., availability, accessibility, affordability), but PGOF had higher scores than PGON on factors concerning individual characteristics (e.g., intensity of feelings while gambling, depression, suicidal ideation, etc.). Findings also showed differences concerning attitudes toward responsible gambling measures. The fact that situational characteristics are more attractive to online gamblers confirms differences between PGON and PGOF and suggests that this preferred attractiveness may enhance problem gambling potential. Further research is needed to better understand the interaction between Internet situational characteristics and the individual characteristics of gamblers, as well as the profile of the growing population of gamblers that uses both online and offline modes to gamble. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Responsible consumption of gambling (RCG) is now a major paradigm driving industry, government and public health measures that aim to prevent or minimize gambling-related harm. This is reflected in the pervasive message to ‘gamble responsibly’. However, few attempts have been made to define the concept or identify its foundation principles, resulting in substantial ambiguity over what RCG means and its essential characteristics. This study addresses this void by synthesizing findings from a systematic literature review, website analysis and online survey of 107 experts–to develop a set of underlying principles and a definition of RCG. These tasks were facilitated by the reasonably consistent principles found to underpin RCG in the three data sources, despite wide variations in how the construct has previously been defined. Thus, the set of principles of RCG developed in this study (affordability, balance, informed choice, control, enjoyment, harm-free) should attract wide acceptance, as should the definition given that it combines and summarizes these principles. Adopting a consistent definition and set of RCG principles will provide a basis for developing consistent guidelines for consumers, offer direction for public health efforts for gambling harm minimization, and inform government policies and industry measures aiming to support safe gambling. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess the impact of gambling problems on quality of life. Specifically, we generated disability weight estimates for gambling problems in New Zealand, and compared these results with (i) Australian figures (J Gambl Issues, 10.4309/jgi.v0i36.3978, 2017) and (ii) other health states (Lancet, 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61680-8, 2013); such as anxiety and alcohol use disorders. Method: The 324 participants (48 experts and 276 general population members) evaluated a series of gambling harm vignettes. The participants rated the decrement to one’s quality of life using Visual Analogue Scale and Time Trade-Off protocols (Br Med Bull, 10.1093/bmb/ldq033, 2010). These evaluations enabled the calculation of disability weights for three categories of gamblers (low-risk, moderate-risk, and problem gamblers). Results: Disability weight estimates for low-risk, moderate-risk, and problem gamblers in NZ were consistently higher than the Australian weights: low (0.18 vs. 0.13), moderate (0.37 vs. 0.29), and problem (0.54 vs. 0.44). The quality of life impact for problem gambling in NZ (0.54) was comparable to that experienced in severe alcohol use disorder (0.55) (Lancet, 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61680-8, 2013). Conclusions: This study represents one of the first attempts to assess gambling-related harm through a public health perspective. The results of this study are informative for policy-making, resource allocation, and service planning. These estimates now allow for the population-level impact of gambling in NZ to be calculated and tracked over time, which is essential for informing harm-minimisation initiatives. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction and Aims: Gambling research is characterised by widespread gambling industry involvement. It is likely (as with alcohol and tobacco industry influence) that this will delay or divert effective harm prevention or minimisation measures. Gambling harms are known to be significant and widespread. Effective action to reduce these harms requires concomitant efforts to eliminate industry influence. Design and Methods: Gambling industry influence and activity in three research forums is described. The influence of tobacco and alcohol industry involvement in research directions and outcomes is discussed. Aspects of the discursive elements of industry funded and/or directed research outputs are analysed in the context of industry-friendly discourse and its effects. Industry activity and participation at representative research forums is outlined. Results: The examples and background provided demonstrate that specific material and discursive effects of gambling industry involvement can be discerned in the gambling literature. The consequences of this for the gambling evidence base around harm prevention and minimisation are presented. Discussion and Conclusions: Industry influence operates at multiple levels within the gambling research field. There is increasing awareness of this, and of the effects it may have on the development and deployment of effective harm prevention and minimisation efforts. Key reforms are proposed: (i) the elimination of industry participation and sponsorship of gambling research associations and forums; and (ii) the establishment where necessary of new research forums and international scholarly associations. © 2018 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs

AB  - Background: This report is an overview of results from the 2016 Finnish Gambling Harms Survey covering the population and clinical perspectives. It summarises the main findings on gambling participation, gambling habits, gambling-related harm, and opinions on gambling advertising. Methods: The population sample (n = 7186) was collected from three regions and the clinical sample (n = 119) in a gambling help clinic. Results: Frequency of gambling in the population sample was characteristically once a week, while in the clinical sample it was daily. Men gambled more often than women only in the population sample. The most common gambling environments were kiosks, grocery stores or supermarkets, and home. The most typical gambling-related harms were financial or emotional/psychological harms; the amount of experienced harm was considerable among the clinical sample. The clinical sample also perceived gambling advertising as obtrusive and as a driving force for gambling. Conclusions: The results of the clinical sample imply that when gambling gets out of hand, the distinctions between gamblers’ habits diminish and become more streamlined, focusing on gambling per se – doing it often, and in greater varieties (different game types). There is a heightened need to monitor gambling and gambling-related harm at the population level, especially amongst heavy consumers, in order to understand what type of external factors pertaining to policy and governance may contribute to the shift from recreational to problem gambling. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - It is common for jurisdictions tasked with minimising gambling-related harm to conduct problem gambling prevalence studies for the purpose of monitoring the impact of gambling on the community. However, given that both public health theory and empirical findings suggest that harms can occur without individuals satisfying clinical criteria of addiction, there is a recognized conceptual disconnect between the prevalence of clinical problem gamblers, and aggregate harm to the community. Starting with an initial item pool of 72 specific harms caused by problematic gambling, our aim was to develop a short gambling harms scale (SGHS) to screen for the presence and degree of harm caused by gambling. An Internet panel of 1524 individuals who had gambled in the last year completed a 72-item checklist, along with the Personal Wellbeing Index, the PGSI, and other measures. We selected 10 items for the SGHS, with the goals of maximising sensitivity and construct coverage. Psychometric analysis suggests very strong reliability, homogeneity and unidimensionality. Non-zero responses on the SGHS were associated with a large decrease in personal wellbeing, with wellbeing decreasing linearly with the number of harms indicated. We conclude that weighted SGHS scores can be aggregated at the population level to yield a sensitive and valid measure of gambling harm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Women's participation in, and harm from gambling, is steadily increasing. There has been very limited research to investigate how gambling behaviour, product preferences, and perceptions of gambling harm may vary across subgroups of women. Methods: This study surveyed a convenience sample of 509 women from Victoria and New South Wales, Australia. Women were asked a range of questions about their socio-demographic characteristics and gambling behaviour. Focusing on four gambling products in Australia-casino gambling, electronic gambling machines (EGMs), horse betting, and sports betting-women were asked about their frequency of participation, their product preferences, and perceptions of product harms. The sample was segmented a priori according to age and gambling risk status, and differences between groups were identified using Chi-square tests and ANOVAs. Thematic analysis was used to interpret qualitative data. Results: Almost two thirds (n=324, 63.7%) of women had engaged with one of the four products in the previous 12 months. Compared to other age groups, younger women aged 16-34 years exhibited a higher proportion of problem gambling, gambled more frequently, and across more products. While EGMs were the product gambled on most frequently by women overall, younger women were significantly more likely to bet on sports and gamble at casinos relative to older women. Qualitative data indicated that younger women engaged with gambling products as part of a "night out", "with friends", due to their "ease of access" and perceived "chance of winning big". There were significant differences in the perceptions of the harms associated with horse and sports betting according to age and gambling risk status, with younger women and gamblers perceiving these products as less harmful. Conclusions: This study highlights that there are clear differences in the gambling behaviour, product preferences, and perceptions of product harms between subgroups of women. A gendered approach will enable public health researchers and policymakers to ensure that the unique factors associated with women's gambling are taken into consideration in a comprehensive public health approach to reducing and preventing gambling harm. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Previous research has shown that government and industry discussions of gambling may focus on personal responsibility for gambling harm. In Australia, these discussions have largely excluded people with lived experience of problem gambling, including those involved in peer support and advocacy. Methods: We conducted 26 in-depth interviews with people with current or previous problem gambling on electronic gaming machines (EGMs) involved in peer support and advocacy activities, using an approach informed by Interpretive Policy Analysis and Constructivist Grounded Theory. Results: Participants perceived that government and industry discussed gambling as safe and entertaining with a focus on personal responsibility for problem gambling. This focus on personal responsibility was perceived to increase stigma associated with problem gambling. In contrast, they described gambling as risky, addictive and harmful, with problem gambling resulting from the design of EGMs. As a result of their different perspectives, participants proposed different interventions to reduce gambling harm, including reducing accessibility and making products safer. Conclusions: Challenging the discourses used by governments and industry to describe gambling, using the lived experience of people with experience of gambling harm, may result in reduced stigma associated with problem gambling, and more effective public policy approaches to reducing harm. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Harmful gambling has been identified as an important public health issue that affects individuals, families and the broader community. One gambling product, electronic gambling machines (EGMs), has been associated with significant gambling harm in Australia. There has been limited research that has explored community perceptions of EGMs and attitudes towards reform. This study, conducted in NSW, Australia, aimed to explore community use of EGM venues (clubs and hotels containing EGMs), attitudes towards EGMs and whether the use of these venues influenced attitudes towards EGM reform. Methods: An online survey was conducted with 500 adults aged 16 years and over, representative of the population for age and gender. Discrete choice and open-ended questions were used to gather data on gambling behaviours, use of and attitudes towards EGMs and EGM venues and support for gambling harm reduction measures. Results: Three quarters of participants had visited an EGM venue in the previous year. Participants who had attended such venues were significantly more likely to use EGMs at least once per month. Participants attended EGM venues for a range of reasons including use of non-gambling facilities such as restaurants, the social aspects of the venue and ease of access to the venue. Some participants also attended EGM venues specifically for the gambling facilities. Most participants identified some negative impacts of EGMs for local communities and were supportive of measures to reduce the number of EGMs and prevent children's exposure to EGMs in such venues. Conclusions: This study shows a high level of support for EGM reform amongst both individuals who attend EGM venues and also those who do not. There is potential for government to further regulate EGMs and the environments where they are located. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The Gambling Act 2003 mandated a public health strategy for preventing and minimising gambling harm in New Zealand. Aware Communities and Supportive Communities are two public health programmes subsequently implemented nationwide. These programmes differed from common health promotion initiatives such as media or education campaigns as they were community-action based (requiring community involvement in programme planning and delivery). We carried out a process evaluation to determine their implementation effectiveness and inform improvement and future programme planning. Methods: Our qualitative dominant mixed methods design comprised analysis of over a hundred implementer progress reports (submitted July 2010-June 2013), a staff survey and a staff focus group interview. Results: The programmes demonstrated capacity to not only achieve expected outcomes (e.g. enhanced community awareness about harmful gambling), but also to enhance social sustainability at the community level (e.g. established trustful relationships) and achieve some programme sustainability (e.g. community ownership over ongoing programme delivery). Conclusions: The evaluation noted the potential for a sustainable gambling harm-minimisation model. Community-action based harm-minimisation programmes offer programme sustainability potential which in turn offers funding cost-effectiveness when there are continual public health outcomes beyond initial funding. Although resource intensive, the community-action based approach enables culturally appropriate public health programmes suitable for societies where specific ethnic groups have higher gambling risk. Recognition of such harm-minimisation programmes' contribution to social sustainability is important considering the potential for broader public health outcomes (e.g. better life quality, lesser social problems) within socially sustainable societies. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Emotions typically exert powerful, enduring, and often predictable influences over decision-making. However, emotion-based decision-making is seen as a mediator of impulsive and reckless gambling behaviour, where emotion may be seen as the antithesis of controlled and rational decision-making, a proposition supported by recent neuroimaging evidence. The present paper argues that the same emotional mechanisms can be used to influence a gambler to cease gambling, by focusing their emotional decision-making on positive external and personally relevant factors, such as familial impact or longer term financial factors. Emotionally stimulating messages may also have the advantage of capturing attention above and beyond traditionally responsible gambling messaging. This is important given the highly emotionally aroused states often experienced by both gamblers and problem gamblers, where attentional activation thresholds for external stimuli such as messages may be increased. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In New Zealand, a public health programme on gambling policy development is part of a national gambling harm reduction and prevention strategy mandated by the Gambling Act 2003. Funded by the Ministry of Health, the programme directs workplace/organisational gambling policies, non-gambling fundraising policies, and local council policies on electronic gaming machines (EGMs). We carried out a process evaluation of this programme to identify practical information (e.g. advocacy approaches; challenges and ameliorating strategies) that can be used by programme planners and implementers to reinforce programme effectiveness and serve to guide similar policy-focused public health initiatives elsewhere. Methods: Evaluation criteria, based on the programme's official service specifications, guided our evaluation questions, analysis and reporting. To identify informative aspects of programme delivery, we thematically analysed over 100 six-monthly implementer progress reports (representing 3 years of programme delivery) and transcript of a focus group with public health staff. Results: Identified output-related themes included purposeful awareness raising to build understanding about gambling harms and the need for harm-reduction policies and stakeholder relationship development. Outcome-related themes included enhanced community awareness about gambling harms, community involvement in policy development, some workplace/organisational policy development, and some influences on council EGM policies. Non-gambling fundraising policy development was not common. Conclusions: The programme offers an unprecedented gambling harm reduction approach. Although complex (due to its three distinct policy focus areas targeting different sectors) and challenging (due to the extensive time and resources needed to develop relationships and overcome counteractive views), the programme resulted in some policy development. Encouraging workplace/organisational policy development requires increased awareness of costs to employers and society and appreciation of policy value. Although encouraging non-gambling fundraising policies will likely remain challenging, public debate on ethical aspects could stimulate policy consideration. Influencing council EGM policy decisions will remain important for minimising EGM accessibility among vulnerable communities. Public involvement in EGM policy decisions has strong implications for policy effectiveness. Given the expanding range of gambling activities (including online gambling) presently accessible to communities worldwide, both organisational and public policies (as advocated through the programme) are needed to minimise gambling harms. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding of the harmfulness of game types is needed when planning harm minimization and prevention strategies. Adult data (N = 3555) from the Finnish Gambling 2015 survey was used to investigate the associations between different game types and gambling-related harms. A negative binomial regression model was used to analyse the effects of demographics, gambling involvement factors, and engaging in different game types on the number of gambling-related harms, which were evaluated by PGSI and SOGS. Age of 18–24, gambling several times a week, high relative expenditure, online gambling and engaging weekly either in scratch games, betting games or slot machine gambling were associated with a higher number of gambling harms. Chasing losses was the most typical harm among online poker players and fast-paced daily lottery game players, while poor self-control was the most typical harm with other game types, although some of the results were not statistically significant. Multiple factors were associated with gambling harms, including young age and gambling intensity. Games that provide a possibility for high-frequency gambling are more linked to harms. Recommendations should be implemented to incorporate effective harm-minimizing strategies in the regulation of specific game types both at the legislative level (provision and supply) and at the public health level. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background and aims: Direct messaging via text messages (texts) and emails is a widely used method to advertise sports and race-betting offers. However, they have attracted little research, as this advertising is not in the public domain. This study aimed to determine whether betting expenditure is related to receiving direct wagering messages, and the specific inducements they promote. We hypothesized that receiving direct messages, particularly texts, would be related to betting expenditure within 24 hr. Methods: In this ecological momentary assessment study, regular sports (n = 98) and race (n = 104) bettors from Australia completed short daily surveys over 1 week that captured exposure to direct messages, betting behavior in the previous 24 hr, and betting intention for the next 24 hr. Respondents were asked to forward any texts and emails received to the researchers, who coded them for inducement content. Results: Longitudinal analyses found that receiving emails was positively associated with betting intention, whereas texts were positively associated with higher likelihood of betting and betting expenditure. These effects persisted when controlling for problem gambling status and signature betting events. Refund stake and bonus odds inducements were positively associated with likelihood of race betting (although not in multivariate models), as were bonus winnings inducements for sports betting. Discussion and conclusions: Direct messages, particularly texts, are powerful marketing tools, encouraging a nearly immediate, and arguably impulsive, betting response, which may increase gambling-related problems. Overseeing this private form of advertising presents challenges to regulators, and to public health efforts that aim to reduce gambling harm. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The prevention paradox (PP) describes a situation in which a greater number of cases of a disease-state come from low-risk members of a population, because they are more prevalent than high-risk members. Past research has provided only tangential and disputed evidence to support the application of the PP to gambling-related harm. Aims: To assess whether the PP applies to gambling, the prevalence of a large set (72) of diverse harmful consequences from gambling was examined across four risk categories for problem gambling, including no-risk, low-risk, moderate-risk, and problem-gambling. Methods: Respondents who had gambled on non-lottery forms in the past 6 months completed an online survey (N = 1,524, 49.4% male). The data were weighted to the known prevalence of gambling problems in the Victorian community. Results: The prevalence of gambling harms, including severe harms, was generally higher in the combined categories of lower risk categories compared to the high-risk problem-gambling category. There were some notable exceptions, however, for some severe and rare harms. Nevertheless, the majority of harms in the 72-item list, including serious harms such as needing temporary accommodation, emergency welfare assistance, experiencing separation or end of a relationship, loss of a job, needing to sell personal items, and experiencing domestic violence from gambling, were more commonly associated with lower risk gamblers. Conclusion: Many significant harms are concentrated outside the ranks of gamblers with a severe mental health condition, which supports a public-health approach to ameliorating gambling-related harm. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - Background and aims: Families play an important role in the evolution of gambling and are also adversely affected by the disordered gambling of any one of their members. The aims of this study were to explore both the role families play in gambling initiation, maintenance, and help-seeking, and the harm caused to families by the gambling behavior using a qualitative approach. Methods: Regular older adult gamblers were included in the study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 older adults to gain an understanding of gambling from their perspective. Older adult gamblers described their lived experience of gambling ranging from initiation to harm and attempts to cut down or limit gambling. Data were analyzed using thematic network analysis. Results: The mean age of the 25 participants was 66.2 years. The majority were male (n = 18), of Chinese ethnicity (n = 16), had secondary education (n = 9), were married (n = 20), and currently employed (n = 15). Four organizing themes related to the role of families in initiation and maintenance of gambling, harm caused to family members, and their role in help-seeking were identified. Discussion and conclusions: The study emphasizes the role of Asian families in both initiation and maintenance of gambling. Hence, families must be involved in prevention and outreach programs. Family members must be educated, so that they can encourage help-seeking to ensure early treatment and recovery. There is a need for interventional studies for reducing stress and improving coping among family members. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper responds to commentaries from the Reno Model authors and other international researchers who reviewed our earlier paper in this volume. We take a considered view of the Reno Model and find it to be wanting as a responsible gambling (RG) tool because it fails to address the depth and diversity of harms so evident in today’s gambling environment. We propose a new consumer protection paradigm that prioritizes operator duty of care, integrity of operations, and consumer protection, along with independent regulation and research. We discuss the rebuttal of our Reno critique by Shaffer et al. along with the other commentaries. There appears to be general support for our critique and more robust public health approaches to RG. We urge support for engagement in an international process for a WHO instrument referencing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Similar to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco, this would re-frame gambling harm prevention and address current deficiencies in regulatory oversight of harmful gambling products and environments, by promoting duty of care, harm prevention, regulatory integrity, and public accountability. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hancock and Smith critique the “Reno model” on several accounts. Yet, despite their robust critical evaluation, they are surprisingly ambivalent about its potential for future use, suggesting that the model may be usefully redeemed by improving its provisions for consumer protection. In this commentary, we argue that Hancock and Smith’s proposed improvements to the Reno model do not go far enough. To that end, we aim to rehabilitate the Reno model by radically transforming its assumptions into a set of eight axioms on which effective consumer protection measures might be based. This provisional framework for the social management of gambling may support the policy outcomes advocated by Hancock and Smith. If regulators and researchers are serious about effective gambling harm minimisation, then our rehabilitated Reno model might offer a new and necessary set of foundational principles for research and practice. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This article provides commentary on Hancock and Smith’s examination of the Reno Model of responsible gambling (RG). Hancock and Smith (2017) contend that the model, intended to provide consumer protection and reduce gambling-related harm, serves as a major impediment to implementation of effective RG policies. This impediment is in large part attributed to the model’s long domination of the ‘international RG policy landscape’ and its emphasis on individual responsibility and problem gamblers. Hancock and Smith also examine other barriers to the introduction of more effective policies. They propose incorporation of the Reno Model within a broader RG-Consumer Protection approach. This approach includes public health principles, consumer protection, duty-of-care, regulatory responsibility and independent research. While portrayed starkly, when there are shades of grey, Hancock and Smith’s critique has merit. Their main conclusion is compelling, namely that effective consumer protection and harm reduction will require much greater emphasis on changes to gambling products, industry operations and practices, and gambling regulation. This article supports the RG-Consumer Protection approach. It also presents epidemiological and other research findings that identify a wide range of risk and protective factors. It suggests that consideration of the full spectrum of modifiable factors at individual, community and wider social levels will enhance policy and prevention programme outcomes. A number of these factors are common to other health conditions, so there is potential for collaboration and synergies with health and social agencies. Mention is made of recent meetings of the International Think Tank on Gambling Research, Policy and Practice and the World Health Organisation. The outcomes of these meetings portend collaborations to advance a global gambling public health agenda. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - It has long been asserted that increased gambling availability leads to increased participation and harm (availability hypothesis). It has also been proposed that over time participation and harm decrease even when availability continues to rise (adaptation hypothesis). New Zealand has national gambling and problem gambling surveys dating from the mid-1980s. They include five-yearly surveys of gambling behaviour and attitudes from 1985 to 2005 and surveys of gambling and problem gambling in 1990 and 1999. The National Gambling Study (NGS) (2012–2015) was in part designed to assess changes in behaviour, attitudes and gambling-related harm since the 1999 and 2005 surveys. Selected NGS data are examined in relation to data from earlier surveys. A national lottery, instant lotteries and electronic gaming machines were introduced during the late 1980s. Since then, gambling availability continued to increase. Participation in most newly introduced gambling forms increased markedly, usually within the first year or two, and then decreased, often substantially. Following an initial rise, contrary to the availability hypothesis, overall participation declined. This was accompanied by a decline in problem gambling prevalence. These findings are consistent with adaptation. Since 2000, while participation continued to fall, problem gambling prevalence plateaued. This finding appears to be at variance with both the availability and adaptation hypotheses. It points to the importance of factors other than gambling availability in determining problem gambling and related harm. Possible reasons for the plateauing of problem gambling in the face of substantial reductions in participation are considered. They have implications for future research and policy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Harmful gambling is a significant public health issue. There has been widespread discussion in the Australian media about the extent and impact of sports betting on the Australian community, particularly relating to young men and children. Given the role that the media plays in influencing policy change and political agendas, and the acknowledgement that media based advocacy is a fundamental component of successful advocacy campaigns, this research aimed to investigate how different stakeholder groups discuss sports betting within the Australian print media. The study uses this information to provide recommendations to guide public health media advocacy approaches. Methods: A quantitative content analysis of print media articles was conducted during two significant Parliamentary Inquiries about sports betting - (1) The Joint Select Committee Inquiry into the Advertising and Promotion of Gambling Services in Sport (2012/2013), and (2) 'The Review of Illegal Offshore Wagering (2015/2016). A total of 241 articles from 12 daily Australian newspapers were analysed. Statistical analysis was used to compare frequency of, and changes in, themes, voices and perspectives over time. Results: Discussions about the marketing and communication of sports betting was a main theme in media reporting (n = 165, 68.5%), while discussions about gambling reform decreased significantly across the two time periods (p < 0.0001). The presence of sports betting industry (p < 0.0001), sporting code (p < 0.0001) and public health expert (p = 0.001) voices all increased significantly across the two time periods. There were very few (n = 11, 4.6%) voices from those who had experienced gambling harm. Finally, while there were significantly fewer articles taking the perspective that regulation changes were needed to protect vulnerable sub-populations (p < 0.0001), articles that had a neutral perspective about the need for regulation change increased significantly across the two time periods (p < 0.0001). Discussion and conclusions: Mapping the media reporting of sports betting is important in developing effective public health advocacy approaches. This study indicates that discussions about the marketing strategies utilised by the sports betting industry was still a main theme in media articles. However, discussions relating to sports betting reforms, in particular to protect individuals who may be vulnerable to the harm associated with these products and their promotional strategies (for example children and young men) decreased during the time periods. Public health advocates may seek to address the decrease in media reports about reform by developing clear evidence-based messages about why regulatory reform is needed, as well as the potential consequences of not implementing reforms. Working with organisations to build capacity for people who have experienced gambling harm may help ensure that individuals with a lived experience of harm have an increased voice in the media. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Responsible Gambling Codes of Conduct (CoC) are used around the world to describe electronic gambling machine (EGM) operator commitments to reducing harm from gambling. In addition to the provision of passive product information and warnings, CoC describe how venues should assist EGM users displaying signs of problematic gambling. The focus in this paper is on venue adherence to the active strategies described in these documents relating to supporting ‘responsible gambling’ and discouraging harmful, intensive and extended gambling. The paper triangulates data from aspirational statements by EGM operators published in CoC documents; structured, unannounced observations by the research team in 11 EGM venues; and interviews and focus groups conducted with 40 gamblers and 20 professionals in Melbourne, Australia. Results showed only isolated evidence of supportive interactions between staff and gamblers to address gambling harm. The weight of evidence demonstrated that venues often fail to respond to signs of gambling problems and instead encourage continued gambling in contradiction of their CoC responsibilities. Signs of gambling problems are a normalised feature of EGM use in these venues. To genuinely address this public health and public policy challenge, improved consumer protection for gamblers may be achieved through legislation requiring venues to respond to signs of gambling problems. This may include a range of measures such as banning food and beverage service at machines and limiting withdrawals of cash by gamblers, as well as using behavioural tracking algorithms to identify problematic gambling patterns and binding universal pre-commitment systems to complement supportive interventions by venue staff. © 2017 Australian Institute of Family Studies.

AB  - Aims: To derive low-risk gambling limits using the method developed by Currie et al. (2006) applied to longitudinal data. Design: Secondary analysis of data from the Quinte Longitudinal Study (n = 3054) and Leisure, Lifestyle and Lifecycle Project (n = 809), two independently conducted cohort studies of the natural progression of gambling in Canadian adults. Setting: Community-dwelling adults in Southeastern Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Participants: A total of 3863 adults (50% male; median age = 44) who reported gambling in the past year. Measurements: Gambling behaviours (typical monthly frequency, total expenditure and percentage of income spent on gambling) and harm (experiencing two or more consequences of gambling in the past 12 months) were assessed with the Canadian Problem Gambling Index. Findings: The dose–response relationship was comparable in both studies for frequency of gambling (days per month), total expenditure and percentage of household income spent on gambling (area under the curve values ranged from 0.66 to 0.74). Based on the optimal sensitivity and specificity values, the low-risk gambling cut-offs were eight times per month, $75CAN total per month and 1.7% of income spent on gambling. Gamblers who exceeded any of these limits at time 1 were approximately four times more likely to report harm at time 2 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.9–6.6]. Conclusions: Longitudinal data in Canada suggest low-risk gambling thresholds of eight times per month, $75CAN total per month and 1.7% of income spent on gambling, all of which are higher than previously derived limits from cross-sectional data. Gamblers who exceed any of the three low-risk limits are four times more likely to experience future harm than those who do not. © 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction

AB  - There are a number of different pathways to care that people experiencing problems with gambling may pursue. The current research examined the potential of player-tracking systems, such as pre-commitment technology or loyalty cards, to improve the delivery of links to treatment. Thirty-three key informants from gambling treatment and community education in Australia were interviewed about the potential contributions of these technologies to helping link gamblers with problems to treatment services. Thematic analysis revealed three broad considerations for effective links to treatment using these technologies. First, links need to be appropriate in terms of the multitude of problems (other than gambling) that people might face with customized links appropriate to a gambler’s circumstances. Second, the presentation of the links should make them easy to notice and appropriately timed. Third, links should be provided as part of a broader strategy of harm minimization; by recognizing where people are in terms of behavioural change; providing positively framed guidance; and maintaining consistency with public health approaches. This research provides guidance based on informed expert opinion on what features of technology-driven links-to-treatment are likely to meet with greatest success. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Excessive gambling results in a range of diverse harms experienced by individuals and their family members. However, little consideration has been given to specifically assessing such harms. Despite recent attempts to comprehensively ‘list’ and describe the ‘wide net’ of specific harms, what remains particularly unclear is the best way to measure the presence of harm and quantify its relationship to gambling. This article proposes a two-step method for quantifying gambling-related harm. From the literature, 104 questions assessing 48 items of harm were categorized into seven domains. Items were administered to 391 clinical and 151 community gamblers. Results suggest that while high-impact harms such as suicide and divorce are commonly associated with problem gambling, the reported frequency is low. Most gamblers sustain low-impact harms such as reduced savings and worry. This study presents the evaluation of specific gambling-related harms distributed in a clinical and community sample taking into account severity and its relationship to gambling behaviours. It is concluded that gambling-related harms negatively impact on quality of life with a minority suffering more severe harms. It is argued that the proposed two-step methodology provides a basis for developing a psychometrically valid measure of gambling-related harm. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Gambling problems appear to be more prevalent in the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population than in the non-Indigenous population. Although gambling harms can be significant, treatment-seeking rates are low. The Delphi expert consensus method was used to develop a set of guidelines on how a family or community member can assist an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person with gambling problems. Methods: Building on a previous systematic review of websites, books and journal articles a questionnaire was developed that contained items about the knowledge, skills and actions needed for supporting an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person with gambling problems. These items were rated over three rounds by an expert panel comprising professionals who provide treatment to or conduct research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with gambling problems. Results: A total of 22 experts rated 407 helping statements according to whether they thought the statements should be included in these guidelines. There were 225 helping statements that were endorsed by at least 90% of participants. These endorsed statements were used to develop the guidelines. Conclusion: Experts were able to reach substantial consensus on how someone can recognise the signs of gambling problems and support an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person to change. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Gambling has quickly emerged as an important global public health issue. With new technologies used to develop high intensity gambling products and promotions aimed at driving consumption, public health organisations and researchers, community groups, and politicians have argued for a range of regulatory and education measures aimed at reducing gambling harm. However, there has been limited research seeking to understand community perceptions of the harms associated with gambling products and environments, and the level of community support for strategies designed to prevent and reduce gambling harm. Methods: An online study of 500 adolescents and adults (aged 16 and over) was conducted with a representative sample (by age and gender) of individuals who were current residents in the state of Victoria, Australia. Participants were asked a range of questions about their own gambling behaviours, with the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) used as a measure of problem gambling. Participants were asked about their perceptions of harms associated with electronic gambling machines (EGMs), sports betting, horse betting, and casino gambling. They were also asked about the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with gambling harm reduction strategies related to marketing and promotions, restrictions on gambling products and venues, and public education campaigns. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and paired t tests, with thematic analysis used to interpret qualitative responses to open-ended questionnaire items. Results: More than one third (n = 201, 40.2%) of participants were at risk of experiencing some level of harm from gambling (PGSI ≥ 1), with 83 participants (16.6%) recording scores that indicated problem gambling (PGSI ≥ 8). One in five participants gambled on EGMs at least monthly (n = 100, 20.0%). Those who gambled on sports did so frequently, with nearly 1 in 5 gambling on sport at least once a month (n = 87, 17.4%). Over half of the sample rated casino gambling and EGMs as very harmful, while one third rated these forms of gambling as extremely harmful. Over one third of the sample rated horse and sports betting as very harmful, with one in five rating these products as extremely harmful. There was strong agreement with the need to ban gambling advertising during children's viewing hours, during sporting matches and at sporting venues. The majority of participants agreed with reducing and restricting EGMs, and providing more public education for both adults and children about the negative consequences from gambling. Conclusions: The findings suggest a strong perception in the Victorian community that gambling products are harmful. While governments have been reluctant to implement a comprehensive approach to reducing gambling harm, this study reveals significant community support for a range of harm reduction and prevention measures associated with gambling products. Public health practitioners can use this evidence in advocating for a comprehensive public health approach to reducing the harms associated with gambling promotions and products. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding why some people experience problems with gambling whilst others are able to restrict gambling to recreational levels is still largely unexplained. One potential explanation is through salutogenesis, which is a health promotion approach of understanding factors which move people towards health rather than disease. An important aspect of salutogenesis is sense of coherence. Individuals with stronger sense of coherence perceive their environment as comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. The present study examined the relationship of individuals’ sense of coherence on their gambling behaviour and experience of gambling related harm. This exploratory study utilised an archival dataset (n = 1236) from an online, cross sectional survey of people who had experienced negative consequences from gambling. In general, a stronger sense of coherence was related to lower problem gambling severity. When gambling behaviour was controlled for, sense of coherence was significantly related to the experience of individual gambling harms. A strong sense of coherence can be seen as a protective factor against problematic gambling behaviour, and subsequent gambling related harms. These findings support the value of both primary and tertiary prevention strategies that strengthen sense of coherence as a harm minimisation strategy. The present study demonstrates the potential value of, and provides clear direction for, considering sense of coherence in order to understand gambling-related issues. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - While the financial and psychological burden on problem gamblers can be severe, at least some of the ill effects are also passed on to family or other close social ties. The present study estimated the number of affected-others for the typical problem gambler. Australian members of an online panel with gambling problems (N = 3076) and panel members who indicated that they had been affected by someone else’s gambling (N = 2129) were asked to estimate the number of other people who were negatively affected by their gambling. Using robust statistics to analyse this data, the study found lower estimates made by problem gamblers (four affected people) compared to estimates made by affected others (six affected people, including the respondent). It was concluded that a point-estimate of six people affected is a more accurate figure since it does not suffer from self-presentation effects of problem gamblers. Low-risk and moderate-risk gamblers, unsurprisingly, affected far fewer other people (one and three, respectively). Both gamblers and affected-others most often identified close family members, including spouses and children, as the people impacted by others’ gambling problems. These results provide an approximate measure of the number of people affected, per problem gambler, to facilitate accurate accounting of the harms accruing from gambling problems. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There is concern that recent innovations of traditional face-to-face gambling products may lead to increased harm because of the tendency for innovated products to share certain structural features with electronic gaming machines (EGMs). The VICES framework focusses on several mechanisms known to influence gambling behaviour: visual and auditory enhancements, illusions of control, cognitive complexity, expedited play and social customization. The current study applied the VICES framework to an investigation of player experiences with both traditional and innovated gambling products. Through a series of six focus groups (N = 40) with regular bingo, poker and casino table game players and sports bettors, we examined the characteristics of innovated gambling products and their influences on player experience and the risk of gambling harm. Findings suggest that traditional games are perceived as more social, more enjoyable and less harmful. This was largely attributed to the low social interaction, expedited play and increased potential for consumption that is associated with EGM-type gambling activity. Further, we suggest that VICES, pending some revision, is a valid and applicable framework by which to identify characteristics of innovated products that influence player experience and behaviour. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Prior estimates of the population-level impact of gambling have relied on economic costings. Recent work has derived disability weights for the Problem Gambling Severity Index, which measure per-person impact of gambling on quality of life on a scale of zero to one. This provided scope for the present study to calculate the ‘burden of gambling harm’, which captures the aggregate impact of harms arising from gambling on quality of life in a population. Gambling-related harm was associated with 101,675 years of life lost in Victoria, Australia: approximately two-thirds that of alcohol use and dependence, and major depressive disorder. Problem gamblers suffer more individually (disability weight =.44) compared to those in moderate (.29) and low (.13) risk categories. Nevertheless, moderate and low-risk gamblers account for 85% of population-level harm, due to greater prevalence of these groups. Overall, the scale of gambling-related harm is large relative to other significant health issues, with milder yet non-negligible harm accruing to a relatively broad segment of the gambling population. The article suggests that the tendency to conflate the (typically low) prevalence of problem gambling with total gambling impact is misleading, and argues for a broader population-health based measure. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Responsible gambling (RG) is defined as gambling for pleasure and entertainment but with an awareness of the likelihood of losing, an understanding of the associated risks and the ability to exercise control over one's gambling activity. The current study describes a qualitative approach to explore RG among older adults (aged 60 years and above) in Singapore and reports on the cognitive and behavioural strategies employed by them to regulate their gambling. Methods: Inclusion criteria included Singapore residents aged 60 years and above, who could speak in English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil and were current or past regular gamblers. Participants were recruited using a combination of network and purposive sampling. Socio-demographic information on age, age of onset of gambling, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education and employment was collected. The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) was used to collect information on gambling activities and problems associated with gambling behaviour. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 older adults (60 years and above) who currently gambled. The data was analyzed using thematic network analysis. Results: This global theme of RG comprised two organising themes: self -developed strategies to limit gambling related harm and family interventions to reduce gambling harm. The basic themes included delayed gratification, perception of futility of gambling, setting limits, maintaining balance, help-seeking and awareness of disordered gambling in self or in others. Family interventions included pleading and threatening, compelling help-seeking as well as family exclusion order. Conclusions: The study highlights the significant role that families play in Asian societies in imposing RG. Education of family members both in terms of the importance of RG, and communication of the ways in which older adults can incorporate RG behaviours including the use of exclusion in specific scenarios is important. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Incarcerated populations across the world have been found to be consistently and significantly more vulnerable to problem gambling than general populations in the same countries. In an effort to gain a more specific understanding of this vulnerability the present study applied latent class analysis and criminal career theory to gambling data collected from a sample of English and Scottish, male and female prisoners (N = 1057). Theoretical links between gambling and crime were tested through three hypotheses: (1) that prisoners in the UK would have higher rates of problem gambling behaviour than the national population; (2) that if the link between gambling and crime is coincidental, gambling behaviour would be highly prevalent in an offending population, and (3) if connections between gambling behaviour and offending are co-symptomatic a mediating factor would show a strong association. The first of these was supported, the second was not supported and the third was partially supported. Latent class analysis found six gambling behaviour clusters measured by responses to the Problem Gambling Severity Index, primarily distinguished by loss chasing behaviour. Longitudinal offending data drawn from the Police National Computer database found four criminal career types, distinguished by frequency and persistence over time. A significant association was found between higher level loss chasing and high rate offending in criminal careers suggesting that impulse control may be a mediating factor for both gambling harm and criminal careers. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - This article examines gambling harms from both gamblers and affected others’ perspectives. Participants (3076 gamblers and 2129 affected others) completed a retrospective survey that elicited information on harms they experienced from gambling across their lifetime. Their responses were analyzed through testing measurement invariance, estimating item-response theoretic parameters, calculating percentages, confidence intervals, and correlations, as well as regressions. The results indicated large commonalities in the experience of harms reported by gamblers and affected others. Further, gamblers appeared to ‘export’ about half of the harms they experienced to those around them. The findings also provided detailed profiles of evolving harms as problem gambling severity varies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Time-sampling methodology was implemented to examine the prospective associations between affect, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder. Thirty (9 male, 21 female) adults with a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study. Participants completed electronic diary entries of their current affective state, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior for 30 consecutive days. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior. Instead, affect predicted the desire to gamble, with high levels of sadness and arousal independently predicting an increased desire to gamble. Desire to gamble predicted actual gambling behavior. There were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of gambling motivations at baseline; however, during the 30-day period, participants with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often than did participants with depressive disorder, whereas those with depressive disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of positive affect. The present findings provide evidence that negative affect is not directly related to actual gambling behavior, and suggest that affective states rather impact the desire to gamble. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Harmful gambling is a public health issue that affects not only adults but also children. With the development of a range of new gambling products, and the marketing for these products, children are potentially exposed to gambling more than ever before. While there have been many calls to develop strategies which protect children from harmful gambling products, very little is known about the factors that may influence children's attitudes towards these products. This study aimed to explore children's gambling attitudes and consumption intentions and the range of consumer socialisation factors that may influence these attitudes and behaviours. Methods: Children aged 8 to 16 years old (n = 48) were interviewed in Melbourne, Australia. A semi-structured interview format included activities with children and open-ended questions. We explored children's perceptions of the popularity of different gambling products, their current engagement with gambling, and their future gambling consumption intentions. We used thematic analysis to explore children's narratives with a focus on the range of socialising factors that may shape children's gambling attitudes and perceptions. Results: Three key themes emerged from the data. First, children's perceptions of the popularity of different products were shaped by what they had seen or heard about these products, whether through family activities, the media (and in particular marketing) of gambling products, and/or the alignment of gambling products with sport. Second, children's gambling behaviours were influenced by family members and culturally valued events. Third, many children indicated consumption intentions towards sports betting. This was due to four key factors: (1) the alignment of gambling with culturally valued activities; (2) their perceived knowledge about sport; (3) the marketing and advertising of gambling products (and in particular sports betting); and (4) the influence of friends and family. Conclusions: This study indicates that there is a range of socialisation factors, particularly family and the media (predominantly via marketing), which may be positively shaping children's gambling attitudes, behaviours and consumption intentions. There is a need for governments to develop effective policies and regulations to reduce children's exposure to gambling products and ensure they are protected from the harms associated with gambling. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Gambling can cause significant health and social harms for individuals, their families, and communities. While many studies have explored the individual factors that may lead to and minimise harmful gambling, there is still limited knowledge about the broader range of factors that may contribute to gambling harm. There are significant regulations to prevent the marketing of some forms of gambling but comparatively limited regulations relating to the marketing of newer forms of online gambling such as sports betting. There is a need for better information about how marketing strategies may be shaping betting attitudes and behaviours and the range of policy and regulatory responses that may help to prevent the risky or harmful consumption of these products. Methods: We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 50 Australian men (aged 20-37 years) who gambled on sports. We explored their attitudes and opinions regarding sports betting marketing, the embedding of marketing within sports and other non-gambling community environments, and the implications this had for the normalisation of betting. Results: Our findings indicate that most of the environments in which participants reported seeing or hearing betting advertisements were not in environments specifically designed for betting. Participants described that the saturation of marketing for betting products, including through sports-based commentary and sports programming, normalised betting. Participants described that the inducements offered by the industry were effective marketing strategies in getting themselves and other young men to bet on sports. Inducements were also linked with feelings of greater control over betting outcomes and stimulated some individuals to sign up with more than one betting provider. Conclusions: This research suggests that marketing plays a strong role in the normalisation of gambling in sports. This has the potential to increase the risks and subsequent harms associated with these products. Legislators must begin to consider the cultural lag between an evolving gambling landscape, which supports sophisticated marketing strategies, and effective policies and practices which aim to reduce and prevent gambling harm. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Gambling expansion is commonly justified in public discourse by claims of community benefit, increased employment and capital investment. Compared to other jurisdictions, the Electronic Gambling Machine (EGM) license process in Victoria, Australia, is relatively transparent and amenable to analysis. This article describes research that assessed factors relevant to EGM license decisions made by Victoria’s gambling regulator between 2007 and 2014. During the period under review, the regulator granted 144 of 154 applications, finding that approving these applications would not be detrimental to relevant communities. Most commonly cited factors supporting approvals were commitments to undertake capital works, contribute to community purposes and increase employment. The regulator overwhelmingly agreed that supportive factors would balance harms, such as problem gambling, high levels of expenditure or socio-economic disadvantage. This research demonstrates the difficulty of balancing apparently quantifiable benefits against less readily measurable gambling-related harms in regulatory decision-making. The study found that harms were poorly conceived and understood inadequately and supportive factors frequently overstated. This process may lead to unnecessarily high levels of community harm, contradicting the purposes of the relevant legislation. The article suggests that better, more consistently applied principles are required to ensure the more rigorous scrutiny of supportive factors and improved understanding of gambling harms. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - North American Aboriginals have an extensive cultural history of gambling. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of modern western gambling on these traditional beliefs. This is the first large-scale study of this issue in Canada. A total of 1114 Aboriginals in 15 cities in Canada’s Prairie Provinces were surveyed, with recruitment occurring at Native Friendship Centres, shopping malls and other locations where Aboriginals congregated. Results showed that ‘gambling’ to most urban Aboriginal people refers to western commercial forms, something distinct from historical traditions. Attitudes toward gambling were negative, except whether Aboriginal provision of western commercial forms was good or bad for Aboriginal people, where opinion was divided. Primary motivations for gambling were the same as for non-Aboriginals: to win money and for entertainment. Although attitudes and motivations were quite similar to non-Aboriginals, overall level of gambling participation was higher, especially for electronic gambling machines, instant lotteries and bingo. It is concluded that Canadian Aboriginals have a largely westernized orientation to western forms of gambling. The policy implication of this finding is that the factors predictive of gambling benefits as well as the factors predictive of gambling harm among Aboriginals do not appear to be culturally unique. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In their critical review of the prevention paradox (PP) applied to gambling-related harm, Delfabbro and King (2017) raise a number of concerns regarding specific assumptions, methods, and findings as well as the general conceptual approach. Besides discussing the PP, the review also considers the merits of considering a "continuum of harm," as opposed to the more traditional categorical approach to classifying problem gamblers. Their critique is carefully modulated and balanced, and starts a useful dialogue in the context of a public health approach to gambling. Unfortunately, some of Delfabbro and King's (2017) arguments rest on the treatment of gambling harm as a binary state and conflates gambling-related harm with disordered gambling. In this reply, we argue that the application of PP logic to gambling harm has not yet been addressed by us, and is only indirectly related to the more important objective of understanding how gambling can reduce ones' quality of life. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Aims: This study investigates the proportion of concerned significant others (CSOs) of problem gamblers at population level and describes the extent and type of gambling harms for CSOs. Methods: Cross-sectional random sample data (n = 4515) were collected in 2015. The data were weighted based on age, gender and residence. CSOs were identified using a question including seven options. Gambling harms were inquired using structured questions. Descriptive statistics and Chi-Squared and Fischer's exact tests were used. Results: Overall, the proportion of CSOs was 19.3%. Males had close friends with gambling problems more often than females, while females had family members with gambling problems more often than males. Of the CSOs, 59.5% had experienced one or more harms. Females experienced more harms than males. Typical harms were worry about health or well-being of close ones, emotional distress and problems in interpersonal relationships. CSOs with a problem gambler in the family, particularly a partner, child/children or mother, experienced harms more often than CSOs with a problem gambler as a close friend. Conclusions: Female gender was associated with a larger extent of harms. The extent of harms was greatest if the problem gambler was a family member; however, a substantial amount of harms were experienced when the problem gambler was a close friend. CSOs and their position in evaluating gambling harms in general should be acknowledged. Persons beyond the nuclear family and the harms they encounter should be better acknowledged in prevention and harm minimisation. Early identification and a clear referral path to tailored support in occupational, social and healthcare settings may be considered. © Author(s) 2016.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how children and adults recall the content and promotional channels for sports wagering marketing.
RESULTS: Children recruited from NRL (n=75, 96.2%) and AFL (n=46, 92.0%) sites were significantly more likely to have recalled having ever seen a promotion for sports wagering as compared to children from Soccer sites (n=18, 75.0%) (p<0.05). Children and adults identified seeing sports wagering promotions in similar environments, most commonly on television, and at stadiums. Three-quarters of children (75.0%) and the majority of adults (90.0%) perceived that sports wagering was becoming a normal part of sport.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This research shows that children engaged in particular sports have high awareness of wagering marketing, particularly as seen on television or at sporting matches. Regulation should comprehensively address the placement, quantity and content of wagering marketing aligned with sport to prevent current and/or future gambling harm.
METHODS: A mixed methods study of 152 parent/child (8-16 years) dyads was conducted at AFL (Australian Football League), NRL (National Rugby League), and soccer sporting sites in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia. Questions related to the frequency of viewing AFL and NRL matches, sports wagering promotions and perceptions of the normalisation of wagering in sport. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to analyse data. © 2016 Public Health Association of Australia.

AB  - Gambling is rapidly emerging as an important public health issue, with gambling products causing considerable health and social harms to individuals, families and communities. Whilst researchers have raised concerns about online wagering environments, few studies have sought to explore how factors within different gambling environments (both online and land-based) may be influencing the wagering, and more broadly the gambling risk behaviours of young men. Using semi-structured interviews with 50 Australian men (20–37 years) who gambled on sport, we explored the ways in which online and land-based environments may be risk-promoting settings for gambling. This included the appeal factors associated with gambling in these environments, factors that encouraged individuals to gamble, and factors that encouraged individuals to engage in different, and more harmful types of gambling. Interviews were conducted over the course of a year (April 2015 – April 2016). We identified a number of situational and structural factors that promoted risky gambling environments for young men. In the online environment, gambling products had become exceedingly easy to access through mobile technologies, with young men subscribing to multiple accounts to access industry promotions. The intangibility of money within online environments impacted upon risk perceptions. In land-based environments, the social rituals associated with peer group behaviour and sport influenced risky patterns of gambling. The presence of both gambling and alcohol in pub environments led individuals to gamble more than they normally would, and on products that they would not normally gamble on. Land-based venues also facilitated access to multiple forms of gambling under the one roof. We identified a number of factors in both land and online environments that when combined, created risk-promoting settings for gambling among young men. By exploring these contextual conditions that give rise to gambling harm, we are better able to advocate for effective public health responses in creating environments that prevent harmful gambling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous research using the Gambling Outcome Expectancies Scale (GOES; Flack and Morris in J Gambl Stud, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s10899-014-9484-z ) revealed the instrument has excellent psychometric properties and differentially predicts gambling frequency and problem gambling scores. However, like the existing gambling motivation scales, the GOES psychometric properties and predictive utility have not been tested outside of cross sectional studies. The current study used a prospective survey design to redress this issue. Eight hundred and ninety-three participants, drawn from the general community, completed the second wave of the gambling survey. Temporal invariance testing revealed the GOES was reliable. Furthermore, the ability of the GOES to predict gambling behaviour using baseline and concurrent measures of gambling outcome expectancies was demonstrated. Specifically, consistent with the Wave 1 results, the gambling outcome expectancies that reflect diverse reasons for gambling (e.g., social, escape, and money) preferentially predicted gambling frequency whereas the narrower range of emotion focused reasons (e.g., excitement, escape, and ego enhancement) predicted gambling problems. Considered in light of the Wave 1 findings, these results underscore the need for gambling harm minimisation initiatives to take into account the emotion-oriented reasons for gambling.

AB  - It has been argued that generating pop-up messages during electronic gambling sessions, which cause a player to engage in self-appraisal of their gambling behaviour, instil greater control and awareness of behaviour (Monaghan, Computers in Human Behaviour, 25, 202–207, 2009). Consideration for the potential interaction between the messaging’s efficacy and gambling outcome (winning or losing) is lacking however. Thirty participants took part in a repeated-measures experiment where they gambled on the outcome of a computer-simulated gambling task. Outcome was manipulated by the experimenter to induce winning and losing streaks. Participants gambled at a significantly faster speed and a higher average stake size, which resulted in a greater betting intensity in the Loss condition compared to the Win condition. Computer generated self-appraisal messaging was then applied during the gambling session, which was able to significantly reduce the average speed of betting in the Loss condition only, demonstrating an interaction effect between computer generated messaging and gambling outcome. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - AIMS - Problem gambling, even if it occurs in leisure time, can cause harm in the workplace. Problem gamblers are preoccupied with gambling and often suffer from psychiatric and psychosomatic symptoms caused by their excessive gambling. This may lead to inefficiency at work and absenteeism. Severe gambling problems typically lead to a constant need for money, which may result in theft of money or goods from the workplace and in embezzlement. This paper outlines measures to prevent and respond to gambling-related harm and crime in the workplace. METHODS - A review of the literature and qualitative interviews with therapists specializing in problem gambling treatment, peer counsellors from mutual support societies, recovered problem gamblers who have embezzled, and professionals working in workplace crime security and the prevention of alcohol, drug and gambling harm. RESULTS - Important measures in preventing and responding to gambling harm in the workplace include: substance use and gambling policy, problem gambling awareness, attention to signs of gambling-related harm, control functions, appropriate responses to harmful gambling, and rehabilitation. CONCLUSION - The workplace should play a greater role in the universal, selective and indicated prevention of problem gambling. © 2016 Per Binde, published by De Gruyter Open.

AB  - This paper investigates consumer perspectives of implemented and proposed gambling harm minimisation measures taken from a geographically stratified survey of adult residents in Tasmania, Australia. Electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers were asked whether current and proposed EGM harm minimisation measures impacted on their actual or anticipated gambling expenditure and enjoyment. Participants were analysed based on their endorsement of Problem Gambling Severity Index criteria (scores 0–27), and categorised as non-problem gamblers (score 0), low-risk gamblers (scores 1–2), and moderate/problem gamblers (scores 3?). Specifically, we wanted to identify harm minimisation policies that resulted in the lowest decreases in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers and the highest decreases in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers. Regarding current policies, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was the ban on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) in EGM venues (0.2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was the reduction in maximum lines (46.9 %). For the proposed measures, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was visible clocks (1.2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was reducing cash withdrawals (36.3 %). These results suggest universal EGM harm minimisation measures can differentially target non-problem and moderate/problem gamblers. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

AB  - To examine whether the "prevention paradox" applies to British individuals in relation to gamblingrelated harm. Methods: Data were derived from 7,756 individuals participating in the British Gambling Prevalence Survey 2010, a comprehensive interview-based survey conducted in Great Britain between November 2009 and May 2010. Gambling-related harm was assessed using an adapted version of the DSM-IV Pathological Gambling criteria. The previous year's prevalence of problem gamblers was examined using the Problem Gambling Severity Index. Gambling involvement was measured by gambling frequency and gambling participation (gambling volume as expressed by time and money spent gambling). Results: The prevalence rates for past-year gambling harms were dependence harm (16.4%), social harm (2.2%), and chasing losses (7.9%). Gambling-related harms were distributed across low- to moderate-risk gamblers (and not limited to just problem gamblers) and were reported by the majority of gamblers who were non-high time and spend regular gamblers than high time and spend regular gamblers. Conclusions: The prevention paradox is a promising way of examining gambling-related harm. This suggests that prevention of gambling might need to consider the population approach to minimizing gambling harm. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To explore the attitudes and opinions of public health experts in gambling and related unhealthy commodity industries towards the tactics used by the gambling industry to prevent reform and the advocacy responses to these tactics. Methods: In-depth interviews (30-60 minutes) with a convenience sample of 15 public health experts and stakeholders with a public health approach to gambling (n=10), or other unhealthy commodity industries (food, alcohol, tobacco, n=5). Results: Participants described the influences of political lobbying and donations on public policy, and industry framing of problem gambling as an issue of personal responsibility. Industry funding of, and influence over, academic research was considered to be one of the most effective industry tactics to resist reform. Participants felt there was a need to build stronger coalitions and collaborations between independent academics, and to improve the utilisation of media to more effectively shift perceptions of gambling harm away from the individual and towards the product. Conclusions and implications: Gambling industry tactics are similar to the tactics of other unhealthy commodity industries. However, advocacy initiatives to counter these tactics in gambling are less developed than in other areas. The formation of national public health coalitions, as well as a strong evidence base regarding industry tactics, will help to strengthen advocacy initiatives. © 2015 Public Health Association of Australia.

AB  - Background: Since 2008, Australia has seen the rapid emergence of marketing for online and mobile sports wagering. Previous research from other areas of public health, such as tobacco and alcohol, has identified the range of appeal strategies these industries used to align their products with culturally valued symbols. However, there is very limited research that has investigated the tactics the sports wagering industry uses within marketing to influence the consumption of its products and services. Method: This study consisted of a mixed method interpretive content analysis of 85 sports wagering advertisements from 11 Australian and multinational wagering companies. Advertisements were identified via internet searches and industry websites. A coding framework was applied to investigate the extent and nature of symbolic appeal strategies within advertisements. Results: Ten major appeal strategies emerged from this analysis. These included sports fan rituals and behaviours; mateship; gender stereotypes; winning; social status; adventure, thrill and risk; happiness; sexualised imagery; power and control; and patriotism. Symbols relating to sports fan rituals and behaviours, and mateship, were the most common strategies used within the advertisements. Discussion/Conclusions: This research suggests that the appeal strategies used by the sports wagering industry are similar to those strategies adopted by other unhealthy commodity industries. With respect to gambling, analysis revealed that strategies are clearly targeted to young male sports fans. Researchers and public health practitioners should seek to better understand the impact of marketing on the normalisation of sports wagering for this audience segment, and implement strategies to prevent gambling harm. © 2016 Deans et al.

AB  - Cognitive bias is prevalent among gamblers, especially those with gambling problems. Grounded in the heuristics theories, this study contributes to the literature by examining a cognitive bias triggered by the break streak pattern in the casino setting. We postulate that gamblers tend to bet on the latest outcome when there is a break-streak pattern. Moreover, three determinants of the betting decision under break-streak pattern, including the streak length of the alternative outcome, the frequency of the latest outcome, and gender, were identified and examined in this study. A non-participatory observational study was conducted among the Cussec gamblers in a casino in Macao. An analysis of 1229 bets confirms our postulation, particularly when the streak of the alternative outcome is long, the latest outcome is frequent, and the gamblers are females. The findings provide meaningful implications for casino management and public policymakers regarding the minimization of gambling harm. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - AIM - This qualitative study expands on female problem gambling by examining short online narratives written by Finnish women. Problem gambling is analysed within the familial context in order to discover gendered roles and practices, and in relation to substance use and abuse in women's lives. DESIGN - Two sets of qualitative data were used in this study. The first set was collected from two online discussion forums, and the second set was extracted from an online counselling service data in 2008. Chosen messages formed short narratives of women's problem gambling trajectory (51 cases). The data were analysed in accordance with the content analysis method. RESULTS - Women had started gambling either in adolescence or in adulthood. Most of the women played on slot machines or gambled online. The lack of coping skills, stressful events in life and troubled relationships made the women more vulnerable to gambling harms and other addictions. In some couples, partners were either drinking or gambling. This made the women's lives even more complicated, because they could not count on their partners' help and support. The women tried to hide the consequences of their problem gambling for fear of losing their significant others. CONCLUSIONS - Female gambling and female problem gambling are complex concepts influenced by social, cultural and political factors. This study has shown in its limited framework that female problem gambling is related to the gambling environment, the social acceptance of gambling and the regulation of gambling operations within the place of jurisdiction. © by Johanna Järvinen-Tassopoulos 2016.

AB  - Concerns exist that Internet gambling may increase rates of gambling harms, yet research to date has found inconsistent results. Internet gamblers are a heterogeneous group and considering this population as a whole may miss important differences between gamblers. The differential relationship of using mobile and other devices for gambling online has not been considered as compared to the use of computers. The true relationship of Internet gambling on related problems and differences between preferred modes for accessing online gambling may be obscured by confounding personal and behavioural factors. This paper thus uses the innovative approach of propensity score matching to estimate the consequence of gambling offline, or online through a computer, as compared to mobile or other supplementary devices by accounting for confounding effects of difference among groups of Australian gamblers (N = 4482). Gamblers who prefer to gamble online using computers had lower rates of gambling problems as compared to those using mobile and supplementary devices. Individual life cycle was useful to differentiate between groups, indicating age, marital, and employment status should be considered together to predict how people gamble online. This is the first empirical study to suggest that the mode of accessing Internet gambling may be related to subsequent harms. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Harm from gambling is known to impact individuals, families, and communities; and these harms are not restricted to people with a gambling disorder. Currently, there is no robust and inclusive internationally agreed upon definition of gambling harm. In addition, the current landscape of gambling policy and research uses inadequate proxy measures of harm, such as problem gambling symptomology, that contribute to a limited understanding of gambling harms. These issues impede efforts to address gambling from a public health perspective. Methods: Data regarding harms from gambling was gathered using four separate methodologies, a literature review, focus groups and interviews with professionals involved in the support and treatment of gambling problems, interviews with people who gamble and their affected others, and an analysis of public forum posts for people experiencing problems with gambling and their affected others. The experience of harm related to gambling was examined to generate a conceptual framework. The catalogue of harms experienced were organised as a taxonomy. Results: The current paper proposes a definition and conceptual framework of gambling related harm that captures the full breadth of harms that gambling can contribute to; as well as a taxonomy of harms to facilitate the development of more appropriate measures of harm. Conclusions: Our aim is to create a dialogue that will lead to a more coherent interpretation of gambling harm across treatment providers, policy makers and researchers. © 2016 Langham et al.

AB  - Abstract: In New Zealand, a pop-up message feature that interrupts gambling is mandatory on all electronic gaming machines (EGMs) in all venues. The present research documented the views and experiences of pop-up messages from a range of gamblers and gambling venue staff. A series of focus groups was held with 40 gamblers (ranging from infrequent gamblers to current/former problem gamblers), and 19 staff from casino and non-casino venues. Most participants thought that pop-up messages were ineffective as a harm-minimization measure. Venue staff participants viewed pop-up messages much more negatively than gamblers, who were generally accepting of their existence and sometimes described them as useful. Venue staff participants were also very negative about the additional hassles and confusion they believed to be caused by pop-up messages, and a range of problems they perceived with their accuracy. Nonetheless, there was a consistent although less prevalent view that pop-up messages were useful in reducing gambling harm and potentially bringing harmful gamblers to the attention of others. Participants raised some possibilities for enhancing their effectiveness; these were generally consistent with the evidence base developed since the introduction of pop-up messages in the New Zealand gambling environment. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Commercial gambling is expanding rapidly across the globe. However, the field of gambling research has not kept pace with this expansion, and continues to focus on prevalence studies and individuated treatment regimes, with little attention to the political, economic or technological underpinnings of commercial gambling. The implications of this lack of sophistication in the research agenda are that society is ill-equipped to understand the nature and underlying causes of gambling harms, and how these might best be avoided, minimized or ameliorated. Around the world, various levels of government benefit from gambling revenue, with consequences for the independent regulation of gambling. Further, there is considerable industry influence on the research agenda, often involving similar techniques to those employed previously by the tobacco and alcohol industries to engage researchers. This influence is compounded by a failure of many gambling researchers and journals to adopt traditional academic safeguards, such as the disclosure of conflicts of interest, and by many arguing for a 'partnership model' with industry to advance the research agenda. This paper identifies five basic principles to restore reasonable standards of integrity in gambling studies: (1) research should not be funded by the proceeds of gambling; (2) research priorities should not be influenced by the beneficiaries of gambling; (3) conferences and other research fora should not be influenced by industry; (4) funding sources should be disclosed in journals and at conferences; and (5) meaningful access to gambling products and environments must be part of licensing. We also propose a range of actions to promote greater transparency and independence in the gambling research field. © 2015 Society for the Study of Addiction.

AB  - AIMS-The purpose of this population-based study was to explore the relationship between gambling and violent behaviour and attitudes towards violence among 14-and 16-year-old adolescents. DESIGN-A national survey was conducted in Finland in 2011. The main measures in our study were gambling frequency and number of reported gambling-related harms. Their associations with violent behaviours and attitudes towards violence were studied using multinomial logistic regression and negative binomial regression. RESULTS-47.1% of adolescents had gambled during the past six months and 13.2% of them had experienced gambling-related harms. Both gambling frequency and the number of gambling-related harms were linked to violent behaviour as well as to positive attitudes towards violence. Adolescents who engaged in gambling on a daily basis and/ or experienced gambling harms had the highest risk. CONCLUSIONS-Health promotion efforts among gamblers should take into account their increased risk for violent behaviour. © by Tiina Räsänen 2015.

AB  - German gambling operators are required to identify problem gamblers at an early stage and exclude them from gambling on their premises. The main aim of this pilot study was to investigate the compliance of staff in Bremen’s amusement arcades. While visiting 29 of 111 amusement arcades, covert gamblers simulated signs of problematic gambling behaviour, arranged self-exclusions, monitored observance of the exclusion list and made fieldnotes about the staff’s reactions. The application of age checks was also tested. The findings showed that only in six cases (5%) did the staff adequately respond to evident signs of problematic gambling behaviour. Although 18 of 29 cases (62%) eventually resulted in self-exclusions or ban-like agreements, in some instances it was necessary to overcome major obstacles that emanated from the staff’s behaviour. During 15 subsequent follow-up visits, 13 banned mystery gamblers (87%) had no problems gambling on amusement-with-prizes (AWP) machines. Finally, just 26% of the 20- to 25-year-old mystery gamblers had their ID checked. The results indicate the necessity of regular external evaluations regarding the implementation of gambling harm-minimization measures in order to identify any shortcomings. In addition, the level of staff compliance may be increased by amending current legislation (e.g. by introducing a nationwide self-exclusion programme). © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Concerns that Internet gambling has elevated the prevalence of problem gambling have not been substantiated; however, evidence suggests a subgroup of Internet gamblers do experience higher rates of gambling harms. Greater overall involvement in gambling appears to be predictive of harms. The purpose of this study was to examine differences between Internet gamblers with a single or multiple online gambling accounts, including their gambling behaviours, factors influencing their online gambling and risk of experiencing gambling problems. Methods: Internet gamblers (3178) responding to an online survey that assessed their gambling behaviour, and use of single or multiple online gambling accounts. Results: Results revealed that multiple account holders were more involved gamblers, gambling on more activities and more frequently, and had higher rates of gambling problems than single account holders. Multiple account holders selected gambling sites based on price, betting options, payout rates and game experience, whereas single account holders prioritized legality and consumer protection features. Conclusion: Results suggest two different types of Internet gamblers: one motivated to move between sites to optimize preferred experiences with a tendency to gamble in a more volatile manner; and a smaller, but more stable group less influenced by promotions and experiences, and seeking a reputable and safe gambling experience. As the majority of Internet gamblers use multiple accounts, more universal responsible gambling strategies are needed to assist gamblers to track and control their expenditure to reduce risks of harm. © The Author 2015.

AB  - Background: Preventing gambling harm has become a policy priority in many European countries. Adverse consequences related to problem gambling are well known, but few studies have analyzed gambling-related harm in detail in general population samples. We determined the extent and distribution of gambling harm in Finland, as assessed by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and analyzed gambling involvement, demographics and their association with various types of harm. Methods: A nationwide telephone survey was conducted among 4484 Finns aged 15-74 years in 2011-12. Gambling-related harms were based on the nine-item PGSI. Gambling involvement was measured by gambling frequency and weekly average gambling expenditure. Associations among harms, demographics and gambling involvement were examined in logistic regression. Results: During the previous year, 13% of respondents experienced at least one gambling-related harm (males 18.1%, females 7.2%). The four commonest harms were 'chasing losses' (8.6%), 'escalating gambling to maintain excitement' (3.1%), 'betting more than could afford to lose' (2.8%), and 'feeling guilty' (2.6%). The harm profile in descending order was the same for both genders but differed in prevalence. Young age (<25 years) was associated with increased likelihood of reporting harms. Both monthly and weekly gambling and spending over €21 per week on gambling were related to the harms. Conclusions: Our results provide support for the public health approach to gambling: harms were reported even at low gambling frequency-expenditure levels. In addition to the high-risk approach, adopting a population-level approach to preventing gambling harm could shift the population distribution of harm in a lower direction. © The Author 2014.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe gambling practices and trends in Quebec between 2009 and 2012 given that, in Canada, public funding allocation to address the risks associated with gambling practices should be based on valid prevalence data and knowledge of patterns and trends in vulnerable populations. METHODS: The study data were taken from the 2009 and 2012 cross-sectional waves of the Enquête sur les habitudes de jeu des Québécois (ENHJEU-Québec). The analytical sample consisted of 11,888 respondents in 2009 and 12,008 respondents in 2012. RESULTS: The prevalence of lifetime non-gamblers in the adult population of Quebec increased from 13.6% in 2009 to 16.4% in 2012, and past-year gambling participation decreased from 70.5% to 66.2%. Changes in gambling patterns were not contingent on demographic characteristics; gambling prevalence decreased in all subcategories. The proportion of problem and low-risk gamblers remained unchanged, whereas the prevalence of non-problem gamblers decreased significantly from 66.1% in 2009 to 61.5% in 2012. CONCLUSION: Gambling participation in Quebec is decreasing, though the proportion of problem gamblers remains stable. Given these findings, allocation of public resources for health care services should be maintained. Secondary and primary prevention efforts need to be initiated or maintained to prevent gambling harm. © Canadian Public Health Association, 2015. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the most significant changes to the gambling environment in the past 15 years has been the increased availability of Internet gambling, including mobile; Internet gambling is the fastest growing mode of gambling and is changing the way that gamblers engage with this activity. Due to the high level of accessibility, immersive interface and ease at which money can be spent, concerns have been expressed that Internet gambling may increase rates of disordered gambling. The current paper aimed to provide an overview of the research to date as well as highlight new and interesting findings relevant to Internet gambling addiction. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was conducted to provide an overview of significant trends and developments in research that relates to disordered Internet gambling. This paper presents research to inform a greater understanding of adult participation in Internet gambling, features of this interface that may impact problem severity, the relationship between Internet gambling and related problems, as well as considering the role of the wider spectrum of gambling behaviour and relevant individual factors that moderate this relationship. © 2015, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - This is the first of two papers describing the development of the FocaL Adult Gambling Screen for Electronic Gambling Machine players (FLAGS-EGM). FLAGS-EGM is a measurement approach for identifying gambling risk, a tool that incorporates separate reflective and formative constructs into a single instrument. A set of statements was developed that captured ten constructs associated with gambling risk or which were considered components of problem gambling. Following completion of focus groups with regular slot players, a survey with the reduced set of statements was then administered to a sample of 374 casino slot players in Ontario, Canada. Nine of the proposed constructs passed tests for reliability and validity (Risky Cognitions Beliefs, Risky Cognitions Motives, Preoccupation Desire, Risky Practices Earlier, Risky Practices Later, Impaired Control Continue a Session, Impaired Control Begin a Session, Negative Consequences, and Persistence). A tenth construct (Preoccupation Obsession) requires further development through the addition of improved statements. © 2015 Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gambling disorder is one of the mental health issues concerning the New Zealand Asian migrant community. This article describes how Asian problem gambling services used “Gamblefree Day” (GFD) as a health promotion campaign to raise awareness of gambling harm in New Zealand Chinese and Korean communities. The nationwide GFD health promotion project consisted of an action group, song-writing competition, and discount restaurant dining, as well as the recruitment and training of volunteers specifically for the campaign. The formative evaluation of the campaign adopted a mixed method approach collecting survey data and qualitative feedback from campaign participants and volunteers over a period of three years. Formative evaluation focusing on Auckland was conducted to collect feedback from restaurant owners, volunteers, and participants of various events. Participants in the events reported increased understanding about problem gambling and the support services available in the communities. The formative evaluation of this project highlighted the concerns about excessive gambling within the Chinese and Korean populations in New Zealand. Study outcomes would encourage health promotion practitioners to systematically investigate changes over time in awareness of gambling problems and help seeking behaviors such as accessing counseling services among members of ethnic communities by using standardized measures. There is a dearth of theoretical or empirical literature addressing best practice for promoting the mental health of ethnic minority groups. Therefore, this paper sheds light on lessons learnt in designing culturally responsive interventions for Asian or similar migrant populations. © 2014, Springer India Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Local environment plays an important role in understanding gambling as a public health issue. This study uses help-seeking as an outcome measure for a local area analysis of problem gambling in Victoria, Australia. We used a cross-sectional ecological design to investigate the extent to which gaming industry and demographic, economic, and social factors are associated with rates of telephone and face-to-face counselling for problem gambling at the local government area level. Electronic gaming machine density was independently correlated with both types of helpseeking, with a range of local factors controlled. This study supports previous research that has consistently found an association between gaming machine density and problem gambling, using gaming machine expenditure as a proxy measure of harm. We build on previous work by confirming that this relationship exists when gambling harm is measured through two types of help-seeking. © 2014, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

AB  - This paper aimed to analyze the harms arising from gambling and gambling-related help-seeking behaviour within a large sample of Indigenous Australians. A self-selected sample of 1,259 Indigenous Australian adults completed a gambling survey at three Indigenous sports and cultural events, in several communities and online. Based on responses to the problem gambling severity index (PGSI), the proportions of the sample in the moderate risk and problem gambler groups were higher than those for the population of New South Wales. Many in our sample appeared to face higher risks with their gambling and experience severe gambling harms. From PGSI responses, notable harms include financial difficulties and feelings of guilt and regret about gambling. Further harms, including personal, relationship, family, community, legal and housing impacts, were shown to be significantly higher for problem gamblers than for the other PGSI groups. Most problem gamblers relied on family, extended family and friends for financial help or went without due to gambling losses. Nearly half the sample did not think they had a problem with gambling but the results show that the majority (57.7 %) faced some risk with their gambling. Of those who sought gambling help, family, extended family, friends and respected community members were consulted, demonstrating the reciprocal obligations underpinning traditional Aboriginal culture. The strength of this finding is that these people are potentially the greatest source of gambling help, but need knowledge and resources to provide that help effectively. Local Aboriginal services were preferred as the main sources of professional help for gambling-related problems.

AB  - Although problem gamblers make up a small proportion of the New Zealand population, those who are living in more deprived areas at higher risk of harm from their own or someone else's gambling. The global financial crisis in 2008 has been linked with changes in gambling behaviour and with increases in inequality between areas of relative deprivation. Nationally representative datasets from in-home face-to-face health surveys in 2008, 2010 and 2012 were analysed to investigate changes in gambling behaviour, experiences of household-level harm related to gambling, and the association with economic deprivation. Although overall gambling participation had dropped, the experience of gambling harm at the household level was significantly higher in 2012 compared with 2008 and 2010. The increase in harm was experienced disproportionately by those in more deprived areas, who were 4.5 times as likely to experience gambling-related arguments or money problems. We consider possible explanations including more harmful gambling behaviour as a response to financial stresses, decreasing household resilience to financial stresses, and the concentration of more harmful forms of gambling product in more deprived areas. Causes of gambling harm in deprived communities, and the vulnerability of households in these communities, should be addressed if inequalities are to be reduced. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Problem gambling represents a significant public health problem, however, research on effective gambling harm-minimisation measures lags behind other fields, including other addictive disorders. In recognition of the need for consistency between international jurisdictions and the importance of basing policy on empirical evidence, international conventions exist for policy on alcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances. This paper examines the evidence of best practice policies to provide recommendations for international guidelines for harm-minimisation policy for gambling, including specific consideration of the specific requirements for policies on Internet gambling. Evidence indicates that many of the public health policies implemented for addictive substances can be adapted to address gambling-related harms. Specifically, a minimum legal age of at least 18 for gambling participation, licensing of gambling venues and activities with responsible gambling and consumer protection strategies mandated, and brief interventions should be available for those at-risk for and experiencing gambling-related problems. However, there is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of limits on opening hours and gambling venue density and increased taxation to minimise harms. Given increases in trade globalisation and particularly the global nature of Internet gambling, it is recommended that jurisdictions take actions to harmonise gambling public health policies. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Background and objectives. Public health research has pointed to alcohol and substance abuse as the most significant public health challenges in Greenland with the negative impact on families and communities that entail, but few studies have investigated the role of problem gambling as addictive behaviour among Inuit. The objectives of the present study were to investigate (a) the association between lifetime problem gambling and harmful alcohol use as well as frequent use of marijuana and (b) the prevalence of cross-addictive behaviour among Greenland Inuit. Design. A representative cross-sectional study among Greenland Inuit (n =2,189). Data was collected among adults (18 +) in 8 towns and 13 villages in Greenland from 2006-2010. Lifetime problem gambling, harmful alcohol use and frequent use of marijuana were measured through a self-administered questionnaire. Results. The odds ratio for harmful alcohol use and frequent use of marijuana was significantly higher among lifetime problem gamblers compared to non-problem gamblers/non-gamblers. One or more addictive behaviours were present among more than half of the men (53%) and one third of the women (37%), and the co-occurrence of lifetime problem gambling with either harmful alcohol use, frequent use of marijuana or both was found among 12.2% of men and 3.7% of women. The prevalence of one or more addictive behaviours was 44% in households with children. Conclusions. For lifetime problem gamblers, the gambling problems were more often than not combined with harmful alcohol use, frequent use of marijuana or both - especially among men. The high prevalence of addictive behaviours in households with children indicates that many families are presently affected negatively by alcohol, gambling and marijuana. This suggests that pathological gambling should be included systematically in future public health strategies, treatment programs and interventions in Greenland. © 2013 Christina Viskum Lytken Larsen et al.

AB  - This study aimed to develop an empirically based description of relapse in Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) problem gambling (PG) by describing the processes and factors that 'pull' the problem gambler away from relapse contrasted with the 'push' towards relapse. These conceptualisations describe two opposing, interacting emotional processes occurring within the problem gambler during any relapse episode. Each relapse episode comprises a complex set of psychological and social behaviours where many factors interact sequentially and simultaneously within the problem gambler to produce a series of mental and behaviour events that end (1) with relapse where 'push' overcomes 'pull' or (2) continued abstinence where 'pull' overcomes 'push'. Four focus groups comprising thirty participants who were EGM problem gamblers, gamblers' significant others, therapists and counsellors described their experiences and understanding of relapse. The groups were recorded, recordings were then transcribed and analysed using thematic textual analysis. It was established that vigilance, motivation to commit to change, positive social support, cognitive strategies such as remembering past gambling harms or distraction techniques to avoid thinking about gambling to enable gamblers to manage the urge to gamble and urge extinction were key factors that protected against relapse. Three complementary theories emerged from the analysis. Firstly, a process of reappraisal of personal gambling behaviour pulls the gambler away from relapse. This results in a commitment to change that develops over time and affects but is independent of each episode of relapse. Secondly, relapse may be halted by interacting factors that 'pull' the problem gambler away from the sequence of mental and behavioural events, which follow the triggering of the urge and cognitions to gamble. Thirdly, urge extinction and apparent 'cure' is possible for EGM gambling. This study provides a qualitative, empirical model for understanding protective factors against gambling relapse. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

To assess whether previously reported ethnic and socio-economic disparities are evident when researching broader gambling harms. Methods: An in-home, nationwide survey captured data from a multi-stage, random probability sample of 1,774 adults and 199 15-17-year-olds. Oversampling Maori (NZ's indigenous people), Pacific and Asian peoples, and people in areas of deprivation, allowed analysis by ethnicity and socio-economic status. Results: Data show high participation levels; around 8 out of 10 people took part in at least one gambling activity in the previous 12 months. Type and frequency of activities was used to define four groups: infrequent gamblers (60.9%); frequent, non-continuous gamblers (17.6%); frequent, continuous gamblers (4%); and non-gamblers (17.5%). Self-reported knowledge of the signs of gambling harm was high. Arguments about gambling and people going without/unpaid bills provided two indicators of broader gambling harm. Around one-sixth of New Zealanders experienced each of these harms. Impacts were greatest for low-income groups, Maori, and Pacific peoples. Conclusions: The proportion of New Zealander's experiencing broader gambling harms is much higher than the prevalence for problem gambling. Consistent with other research, results show the flow-on impacts of problem gambling-on family, friends and communities. Implications: Measures can be developed to benchmark the wider harms of gambling and evaluate public health programs addressing harm at population and subpopulation levels. © 2012 Public Health Association of Australia.

AB  - Albertans representing five age cohorts (13-15, 18-20, 23-25, 43-45 and 63-65) were surveyed (n = 1809) to assess their attitudes toward gambling in general, gambling in Alberta and legal gambling's impacts in the province. Age, gender and problem gambling status were found to be reliable predictors of gambling attitudes in that youngermale, nonproblemgamblersweremost approving of the activity. Results also indicate thatAlbertans are ambivalent about gambling and that gambling and public policy aremis-aligned to the extent that gambling's harms are thought to outweigh its benefits. Likely reasons for the gap between gambling policy and public opinion are that gambling issues lack the salience of ongoing high-profile topics such as the economy, health care, education and the environment, and gambling dependent special interest groups can exert considerable influence on gambling policy in ways that may not harmonise with the public interest. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Participation in gambling by young people aged 13-18 years. METHOD: During 2001, prior to the passing of legislation to minimise gambling harm, more than 500 students from six high schools completed a survey of their participation in gambling during the previous 12 months, and completed three problem gambling screens. RESULTS: Gambling, including under-age gambling, was a common event. Up to one in five were identified as at risk for problem gambling on at least one screen. Students who were non-European, or were from low socioeconomic areas, were more likely to be at risk for problem gambling. Help for gambling problems was preferred from friends and family rather than others, while inclusion of information in the education curriculum about risk of gambling problems was supported. CONCLUSIONS: The survey provided evidence for pre-legislation baseline gambling behaviour, and risk for problem gambling, of students attending high schools in Auckland. Levels of risk for problem gambling paralleled the elevated risk found for youth in many countries. Raising awareness, through a school curriculum, of risk for gambling problems among adolescents may be explored as a strategy to reduce the high levels of risk for gambling problems identified.

AB  - Despite the growing popularity of the harm reduction approach in the field of adolescent alcohol and substance abuse, a harm reduction approach to prevention and treatment of youth problem gambling remains largely unexplored. This article poses the question of whether the harm reduction paradigm is a promising approach to the prevention of adolescent problem gambling and other risky behaviors. The authors use a universal, selective, and indicative prevention framework to present current prevention initiatives that have emerged from the harm reduction health paradigm for adolescent substance and alcohol abuse. The risk-protective factor model is used as a conceptual basis for designing youth problem gambling harm reduction prevention programs. This framework illustrates the developmental appropriateness of the harm reduction approach for youth. Implications drawn from this conceptual examination of harm reduction as a prevention approach to adolescent problem gambling provide valuable information for treatment providers as well.
