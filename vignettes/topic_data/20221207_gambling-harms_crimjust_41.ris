AB  - Within a neo-liberal economic orthodoxy, the gambling industry has succeeded in the discursive feat of transforming gambling from its previous pariah pastime status to normalized entertainment. This contemporary discourse of gambling as entertainment has repositioned gambling as harmless fun. The comfortable orthodoxy of 'responsible gambling' adopts language emphasizing concepts such as 'personal responsibility'. A focus on the lack of self-control of delinquent users deflects attention away from harmful products, diminishing scrutiny of industry failure to appropriately address gambling harms. We analyzed data derived from interviews with stakeholders familiar with the gambling licensing process in Victoria, Australia, in order to identify if and how the discursive structures of this comfortable orthodoxy manifest in discussions on gambling. Data were derived from thematic analysis of 21 interviews with decision makers, industry advocates, and other stakeholders. Evidence highlights multiple recurring discursive structures of the 'comfortable orthodoxy', including the narrative of gambling as legalized recreation, personal choice and self-responsibility. Highlighting the pervasiveness of this discourse, these narratives were evident across the spectrum of informants. This research illustrates the way in which multiple gambling stakeholders deploy the discursive structures underpinning gambling regulation and operations. Discourses establish understanding of the nature of specific issues, and can influence responses to public health or other policy problems. In this instance, a discourse overwhelmingly favoring industry interests, has the potential to entrench and support harmful systems of exploitation and harm creation. Transforming the responsible gambling discourse is an important focus for public health activity concerned with reducing gambling related harm. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The prevalence of gambling harm among active duty military personnel is a largely unexplored topic. With different forms of social gambling often found within (or in close proximity to) military bases around the world, understanding the extent of gambling activities and consequent harms occurring within military contexts warrants further attention. This review aims to identify, describe and thematically synthesise published literature on gambling harm and related issues among active duty military personnel. Scoping review methods were applied in order to understand this relatively under-researched population and understand appropriate avenues for future research. A systematic multi-database text word search, incorporating search results from Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and the Journal Military Medicine, was conducted. A total of 11 sources met inclusion criteria, all originating from the United States of America. The results suggest a distinct gap in the current international literature on this topic. Despite gambling's long and colourful association with defence downtime, research into gambling harm prevalence rates in relation to what could be considered a high-risk group is limited. Findings reveal that strategies to identify and address gambling harm within this population are severely lacking from the published literature and non-existent outside North America. Implications for understanding and addressing gambling harm among active duty personnel and directions for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T1  - Measuring Gambling Harm: The Influence of Response Scaling on Estimates and the Distribution of Harm Across PGSI Categories.

AB  - Recent research has shown that harm is not just a feature of problem gambling, but can also be observed in other lower risk categories. Some debates exist, however, as to the distribution of harm across these categories and how harm should be best measured. This study was designed to examine how estimates of self-reported harm are affected by the methodology used. A particular focus was on how harm estimates for low and higher risk gambling (as classified by the PGSI) varied when respondents were able to make more graded attributions of their harm to gambling. An online panel sample of 554 gamblers responded to a brief survey that included the PGSI, measures of gambling harm drawn from Browne et al. (Assessing gambling-related harm in Victoria: a public health perspective, Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, Melbourne, 2016) as well as questions about demographics and gambling habits. The recruitment was designed to obtain good representation of each PGSI group, with 23% found to be problem gamblers; 36% moderate risk and 21% low risk gamblers. In support of Browne et al. (2016), the findings showed that higher proportions of harm in low risk gamblers is likely to be identified when one uses binary or 'any harm' scoring, but that this effect mostly disappears when more graded scoring or attribution of harm measures are used. Higher risk PGSI groups consistently reported more harms and more serious harms than lower risk groups. It was concluded that the measurement of gambling harm and its estimated distribution over PGSI categories is quite sensitive to how it is measured. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Pacific people in New Zealand are a minority ethnic population identified in national prevalence studies as having the highest risk of developing gambling problems. As earlier studies identified some links between culture and gambling for this population, our study aimed to deepen understanding of these links and their role in explaining the disproportionate gambling harms experienced by Pacific people. To achieve this aim we employed intersectionality as a theoretical framework to explore the culture-gambling intersection for this population group. We analysed data from a subset of focus groups conducted for a broad study of gambling harms in New Zealand. The subset was selected based on the presence of individuals knowledgeable about Pacific people's gambling behaviours, including staff from Pacific problem gambling treatment services who provided examples from a cultural perspective. We identified themes at a latent level via an interpretive process to identify underlying cultural contexts of gambling harms. Findings indicated that whilst harms experienced by Pacific people were similar to those identified amongst the general population, the cultural contexts in which some harms manifested were complex. This paper contributes to the existing knowledge base about gambling harms for Pacific people in relation to six culture-gambling intersecting themes that emerged from the data: collectivism, gift-giving, gambling-based fundraising, patriarchy, beliefs about blessings, and sports celebrities. Findings are discussed in relation to the current knowledge of gambling and conceptualisations of gambling harm within Pacific communities. Implications for culturally appropriate harm minimisation strategies and prevention interventions for this population are suggested. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - It is common for jurisdictions tasked with minimising gambling-related harm to conduct problem gambling prevalence studies for the purpose of monitoring the impact of gambling on the community. However, given that both public health theory and empirical findings suggest that harms can occur without individuals satisfying clinical criteria of addiction, there is a recognized conceptual disconnect between the prevalence of clinical problem gamblers, and aggregate harm to the community. Starting with an initial item pool of 72 specific harms caused by problematic gambling, our aim was to develop a short gambling harms scale (SGHS) to screen for the presence and degree of harm caused by gambling. An Internet panel of 1524 individuals who had gambled in the last year completed a 72-item checklist, along with the Personal Wellbeing Index, the PGSI, and other measures. We selected 10 items for the SGHS, with the goals of maximising sensitivity and construct coverage. Psychometric analysis suggests very strong reliability, homogeneity and unidimensionality. Non-zero responses on the SGHS were associated with a large decrease in personal wellbeing, with wellbeing decreasing linearly with the number of harms indicated. We conclude that weighted SGHS scores can be aggregated at the population level to yield a sensitive and valid measure of gambling harm. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Incarcerated populations across the world have been found to be consistently and significantly more vulnerable to problem gambling than general populations in the same countries. In an effort to gain a more specific understanding of this vulnerability the present study applied latent class analysis and criminal career theory to gambling data collected from a sample of English and Scottish, male and female prisoners (N = 1057). Theoretical links between gambling and crime were tested through three hypotheses: (1) that prisoners in the UK would have higher rates of problem gambling behaviour than the national population; (2) that if the link between gambling and crime is coincidental, gambling behaviour would be highly prevalent in an offending population, and (3) if connections between gambling behaviour and offending are co-symptomatic a mediating factor would show a strong association. The first of these was supported, the second was not supported and the third was partially supported. Latent class analysis found six gambling behaviour clusters measured by responses to the Problem Gambling Severity Index, primarily distinguished by loss chasing behaviour. Longitudinal offending data drawn from the Police National Computer database found four criminal career types, distinguished by frequency and persistence over time. A significant association was found between higher level loss chasing and high rate offending in criminal careers suggesting that impulse control may be a mediating factor for both gambling harm and criminal careers.

AB  - This article examines gambling harms from both gamblers and affected others' perspectives. Participants (3076 gamblers and 2129 affected others) completed a retrospective survey that elicited information on harms they experienced from gambling across their lifetime. Their responses were analyzed through testing measurement invariance, estimating item-response theoretic parameters, calculating percentages, confidence intervals, and correlations, as well as regressions. The results indicated large commonalities in the experience of harms reported by gamblers and affected others. Further, gamblers appeared to 'export' about half of the harms they experienced to those around them. The findings also provided detailed profiles of evolving harms as problem gambling severity varies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper investigates consumer perspectives of implemented and proposed gambling harm minimisation measures taken from a geographically stratified survey of adult residents in Tasmania, Australia. Electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers were asked whether current and proposed EGM harm minimisation measures impacted on their actual or anticipated gambling expenditure and enjoyment. Participants were analysed based on their endorsement of Problem Gambling Severity Index criteria (scores 0-27), and categorised as non-problem gamblers (score 0), low-risk gamblers (scores 1-2), and moderate/problem gamblers (scores 3+). Specifically, we wanted to identify harm minimisation policies that resulted in the lowest decreases in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers and the highest decreases in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers. Regarding current policies, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was the ban on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) in EGM venues (0.2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was the reduction in maximum lines (46.9 %). For the proposed measures, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was visible clocks (1.2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was reducing cash withdrawals (36.3 %). These results suggest universal EGM harm minimisation measures can differentially target non-problem and moderate/problem gamblers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Problem gambling represents a significant public health problem, however, research on effective gambling harm-minimisation measures lags behind other fields, including other addictive disorders. In recognition of the need for consistency between international jurisdictions and the importance of basing policy on empirical evidence, international conventions exist for policy on alcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances. This paper examines the evidence of best practice policies to provide recommendations for international guidelines for harm-minimisation policy for gambling, including specific consideration of the specific requirements for policies on Internet gambling. Evidence indicates that many of the public health policies implemented for addictive substances can be adapted to address gambling-related harms. Specifically, a minimum legal age of at least 18 for gambling participation, licensing of gambling venues and activities with responsible gambling and consumer protection strategies mandated, and brief interventions should be available for those at-risk for and experiencing gambling-related problems. However, there is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of limits on opening hours and gambling venue density and increased taxation to minimise harms. Given increases in trade globalisation and particularly the global nature of Internet gambling, it is recommended that jurisdictions take actions to harmonise gambling public health policies.

AB  - This paper aimed to analyze the harms arising from gambling and gambling-related help-seeking behaviour within a large sample of Indigenous Australians. A self-selected sample of 1,259 Indigenous Australian adults completed a gambling survey at three Indigenous sports and cultural events, in several communities and online. Based on responses to the problem gambling severity index (PGSI), the proportions of the sample in the moderate risk and problem gambler groups were higher than those for the population of New South Wales. Many in our sample appeared to face higher risks with their gambling and experience severe gambling harms. From PGSI responses, notable harms include financial difficulties and feelings of guilt and regret about gambling. Further harms, including personal, relationship, family, community, legal and housing impacts, were shown to be significantly higher for problem gamblers than for the other PGSI groups. Most problem gamblers relied on family, extended family and friends for financial help or went without due to gambling losses. Nearly half the sample did not think they had a problem with gambling but the results show that the majority (57.7 %) faced some risk with their gambling. Of those who sought gambling help, family, extended family, friends and respected community members were consulted, demonstrating the reciprocal obligations underpinning traditional Aboriginal culture. The strength of this finding is that these people are potentially the greatest source of gambling help, but need knowledge and resources to provide that help effectively. Local Aboriginal services were preferred as the main sources of professional help for gambling-related problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Internet delivered interventions are accessible and easy to access and can be used to deliver brief interventions. These interventions can be tailored according to individual need for the prevention and minimisation of gambling harm or early intervention for those that are displaying some signs of problems. The objective of this review was to summarise the existing literature on the effectiveness of prevention, harm reduction and early intervention programs when delivered online. A systematic review was conducted for peer-reviewed studies that evaluated internet delivered interventions for the prevention, harm reduction or early intervention for gambling problems. Four electronic databases were consulted in the past 20 years (2000–2020) resulting in a total of 15 included studies. Across identified studies just one study provided prevention with 7 harm reduction and 7 early interventions. The quality of the literature was variable with just 8 randomised controlled trials with the remainder matched controls or longitudinal cohort studies. The target group was predominantly gamblers accessing betting and casino websites (n = 8). Studies administered four types of interventions which included personalised and normative feedback, limit setting, self-directed cognitive and behavioural therapy and self-exclusion. These were delivered via customer gaming accounts, email, and self-learning packages. The available literature shows promise in the effectiveness of internet delivered interventions. However, the limited number of studies included in this review highlight significant lost opportunities to leverage technology in the prevention and reduction of gambling harm.

AB  - Gambling studies literature is a space where discourses call objects such as 'gambling harm reduction' and 'women harmed by gambling' into being and give them status as namable and describable. A poststructural feminist analysis of the positioning of women who gamble in gambling studies literature was carried out to explore possibilities and constraints for gambling harm reduction practices. Gambling studies literature was accessed to enable a range of historically emerging framings of women's gambling practices and harm to be brought to light. Discourse analysis drew on key concepts (discourse, subjectivity, power/knowledge) and principles (reversal, discontinuity, specificity and exteriority) developed by Michel Foucault. Gambling studies have constructed women as: 'risky gamblers', 'vulnerable women', and as subject to gendered socio-cultural determinants of gambling and harm. Dominant conceptualisations of women in gambling studies tend to bring individual women who gamble into focus, obscuring the social, governmental and commercial determinants of gambling and harm, and often reproducing some unhelpful gender stereotypes in the process. Holistic, environmental and Indigenous women's health discourses have the potential to shift gambling harm reduction from a health services approach to one that is focused on supporting community wellbeing. This includes women's co-production and ownership of harm reduction strategies. It is concluded that opportunities women's gambling harm reduction may be found in critical psychology, and/or approaches which emphasize coherent and critical gender analysis, collaborative action, community development and client-led practice.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between socio-demographic factors, gambling behaviour, and the level of gambling expenditure. The data were drawn from the population-based Gambling Harms Survey 2016 and 2017 conducted in Finland. The data were linked to register-based variables. Past-year gamblers were included (Wave 1; n = 5 805, both Waves; n = 2 165). The study showed that of the 4.2 % of gamblers that produced 50.0 % of the total GE in 2016, 33.1 % of the GE was produced by those with a gambling problem and 43.3 % by those with at-risk gambling pattern. Compared to gamblers in the lowest GE group, those in the highest GE group were more likely to be men, aged 25 or older, with upper secondary education, have a high income, be on disability pension or sickness allowance, be frequent gamblers, gambling at least six game types, and showing at-risk and problem gambling patterns. Cumulative weekly GE by income tertiles remained fairly stable between the years. The results suggest that GE is highly concentrated. Among the small group of high-intensity consumers, the majority of the revenue comes from at-risk and problem gambling. Participants in the low GE group differ from those in the intermediate and high GE groups in terms of socio-demographics and gambling behaviour. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The expansion of online gambling in the UK has been accompanied by an increase in the number of novel betting products, particularly for soccer. The present research investigates which types of sports bettors are the most likely to use novel gambling products called 'custom sports bets' (CSBs), which allow gamblers to create their own unique bets. A large-scale, cross-sectional survey of online sports/horse racing bettors (n = 789, 32.7% female). The survey collected two measures of CSB usage and four validated gambling measures: the Problem Gambling Severity Index, the Gambling Related Cognition Illusion of Control Scale, the Short Gambling Harm Screen, and the Consumption Screen for Problem Gambling. Overall, 62.0% of participants reported having used a CSB, and those who had used a CSB did so on an average of 29.4 days over the last year. Overall, 16.0% of participants who had used a CSB were current problem gamblers, compared to 6.7% among those who had not. CSB users reported an average of 2.3 out of 10 possible gambling harms, compared to 1.5 harms for those who had not used a CSB. The illusion of control scale was significantly positively correlated with whether participants had ever used a CSB before, but not with past-year frequency of CSB usage. The usage of CSB products was most strongly associated with the frequency of gambling consumption. Overall, these findings suggest that CSB products raise distinctive concerns around consumer protection for frequent sports bettors which deserve further investigation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study compared the experience of gambling related harms between gamblers and spouses, whilst taking into account gender and problem gambling severity. Participants (N = 5036, 2603 females) from Australia and New Zealand completed a retrospective survey that probed the prevalence of specific harms from gambling within six harm domains (financial, work/study, health, emotional/psychological, relationship, and social deviance). Overall there was a similar count of total harms reported across all domains experienced by spouses (vs gamblers), however the types and patterns of harms reported were markedly different. Spouses reported the highest number of harms within the emotional/psychological and relationship domains, whereas gamblers experienced a higher number of harms in all other domains. Spouses were five to six times more likely to report increased conflict in their relationship due to gambling, greater relationship tension, and ending a relationship. In comparison, gamblers reported more severe health-related harms, such as suicide attempts and increased alcohol consumption. The findings highlight the unique ways in which gamblers and their spouses each respond to the presence of gambling problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Harms from gambling are considerable and widespread, impacting beyond the individual gambler. Asserting benefits, including supporting 'good causes' outweighs this harm, is a common legitimization tactic of commercial gambling. Identified as problematic on many levels, this is a global phenomenon. Using unusually transparent data, this research assesses the extent to which such contributions offset gambling harms. Methods: Commonly in Australian jurisdictions, not-for-profit gambling operators (clubs) qualify for gambling tax reductions. To qualify in the state of Victoria, clubs submit annual statements documenting that at least 8.33% of their net gambling revenue (NGR) supports community purposes. We examined community benefit records from three consecutive annual reporting periods (2012–2015). Results are presented in aggregate, and via specific case studies. Results: We identified significant over-valuation of 'community benefits'. Gambling tax deductions overwhelmingly (82%) went to operational expenses including wages, venue maintenance, capital costs and utilities. Contributions to charitable and philanthropic purposes represented 4.5% of all community benefit claims (1.5% of club NGR). Conclusions: Similar to other jurisdictions, Victoria's community contribution arrangements provide limited actual community benefit. Doing little to offset gambling harm, demonstrated benefits largely accrue to specific sectional interests. Greater transparency and improved governance is required. This includes, reviewing tax exemptions, reviewing allowable claims, and greater compliance oversight. This research identifies multiple failings with a community benefit scheme operating in a relatively transparent manner. Research lessons may be of interest to policy makers and others wanting to ensure that gambling's demonstrable harms are, indeed, offset by clear benefits to community, and to preventing gambling harm.

T1  - Protective Action and Risky Beliefs: The Relationship Between Religion and Gambling Fallacies.

AB  - A number of studies have explored the relationship between religious beliefs and gambling (including gambling fallacies and gambling harm) but report seemingly contradictory findings. While some studies have found religious belief to be positively associated with gambling fallacies, others have found it to be a protective factor from gambling harms. One explanation for these differing effects is that gambling fallacies and metaphysical religious belief share properties of supernatural and magical thinking. Nevertheless, social support and moral strictures associated with religion might help protect against an unhealthy engagement with gambling. Using a multidimensional measure of religiosity, we hypothesised that only the supernatural facet of religious adherence would present a risk for gambling fallacies. We analysed two archival data sources collected in Canada (Quinte Longitudinal Study: N = 4121, Mage = 46, SDage = 14, Female = 54%; Leisure, Lifestyle and Lifecycle Project: N = 1372, Mage = 37, SDage = 17, Female = 56%). Using the Rohrbaugh–Jessor Religiosity Scale, we confirmed that the supernatural theistic domain of religion was a positive risk factor for gambling fallacies. However, participation in ritual (behavioural) aspects, such as churchgoing, was negatively associated with risk, and no effect was observed for the consequential (moral) domain. We conclude that multidimensional aspects in religious measures may account for conflicting prior findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Existing Australian (and global) gambling harm prevention and minimization measures are overwhelmingly based on self-regulation, using largely ineffective measures focused on individual behavior change. This is substantially attributable to resistance to effective policy change, driven by a well-organized and significantly resourced gambling industry. It is evident that the gambling industry (like tobacco, alcohol and the processed foods industry) has actively sought political engagement as a mechanism to resist policy change. However, unlike tobacco and alcohol, little research has been undertaken to examine gambling industry influence on policymaking. This study aims to describe and analyze the pattern of disclosed financial donations received by Australian politicians and political parties from major gambling industry actors during the period 1998–2018. Further, it examines apparent temporal relationships between donations and gambling legislation or policy positions. Donation data were sourced for the period 1998–2018 from the Australian Electoral Commission website. All data were classified according to donor and recipient and analyzed to provide descriptive statistics. Donations earmarked for specific campaigns, politicians' electorates or events were also identified. The findings demonstrate that members of the gambling industry are consistent and substantial donors to both major parties in Australia. Furthermore, the pattern of donations provides evidence of temporal relationships between donations and federal and state gambling policy decisions and positions. Close examination of industry corporate political activities like political donations supports a greater understanding of the factors that influence the gambling policy environment and, as with tobacco, will contribute to more effective regulation to prevent and address harm.

AB  - Background: Women make up a significant proportion of all gamblers globally. However, there has been limited research which has explored women's gambling and the factors that may make women, and subgroups of women, vulnerable to harm. Methods: Using a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 women aged 55 years and over who regularly gambled on electronic gambling machines (EGMs). Results Key factors were identified to illustrate older women's experiences of gambling and are presented according to four determinants of health: Individual; socio-cultural; environmental; and commercial. While this research confirms that older women's gambling behaviors are strongly influenced by individual and socio-cultural factors, gambling environments, and industry practices are also influential. Conclusion A model illustrates the interplay of individual, socio-cultural, environmental, and commercial determinants, and the article proposes how they may contribute to gambling harm in older Australian women.

AB  - Background: Public health advocacy is important in preventing harm and promoting health in communities. There has been little research into public health advocacy strategies which address gambling related harms. This study aimed to identify the role of advocacy in gambling reform, challenges to gambling advocacy implementation, and strategies that could facilitate change. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a sample of 50 stakeholders with backgrounds in gambling policy, research, health promotion, and advocacy. Participants were asked about how advocacy could be used to address gambling harm, and the range of barriers and facilitators for effective advocacy responses. A constant comparative method of analysis was used on the data. Results: While participants perceived that there was a role for advocacy in preventing and reducing gambling related harm, they discussed a range of challenges. These included restrictions associated with funding of research and services, the power of the gambling industry, and the role of stigma in preventing people with lived experience of gambling from speaking about their experiences. Participants also described a range of facilitators of public health advocacy approaches, including independent funding sources, reframing the 'responsibility' debate, developing opportunities and capacity for people with lived experience of harm, and developing broadly based coalitions to enable cohesive and consistent advocacy responses to gambling harm. Conclusion: There is a clear role for public health advocacy approaches aimed at preventing and reducing gambling harm. Future research could identify how advocacy strategies may be implemented as a part of a comprehensive public health approach to gambling reform. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Advances in technology and increased usage of electronic mobile devices over the past decade have changed the way gamblers engage with online gambling. The convenience of mobile electronic devices is understood to be a major contributor to the increase of online gambling, which in turn has been implicated in the growth of sports betting. Emerging evidence suggests several sources of differentiation between mobile and other online gambling, which have important psychological implications. Given the inherent differences, we cannot conclude that evidence for the effectiveness of treatment for non-smartphone problem gambling (PG) automatically translates to online smartphone sports betting PG. The aim of this study, therefore, was to describe the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of cue exposure therapy (CET) to treat individuals presenting to a community-based PG therapy service with an online smartphone sports betting addiction, using a case series design. Six men (21–42 years old) received up to 10 weekly 60-min manualised CET sessions. Outcome measures were gambling harm, gambling urge, gambling cognitions, psychological distress, and functional impairment. All six participants completed a course of CET averaging 8.33 sessions (SD = 1.75) and reported improvement across each of the outcome measures. Psychological distress scores had reduced to the non-clinical range for all six participants and five participants scored below the cut offs for PG and functional impairment at 1 month follow up. The findings provide preliminary proof of concept evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of CET for online smartphone sports betting addiction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and aim: Examining risk‐curves is important to understanding the degree to which indices of gambling consumption are associated with gambling‐related harm. Risk‐curves have largely been described as J‐shaped, suggesting that at low levels of consumption harm remain constant but then increase sharply at a certain threshold. Alternative methods in recent work, however, have described risk‐curves as linear and R‐shaped, indicating that risk of harm increases as consumption increases at all levels of consumption. The aim of the current study is to estimate the shape of gambling risk‐curves using competing methods. Design Systematic comparison of gambling risk‐curves using categorical (via plots) and continuous (via bootstrapped regression analyses) operationalizations of gambling consumption. Setting and participants Data were 2873 gamblers (1417 women) from the fourth Social and Economic Impact Study of Gambling in Tasmania. Measurements Gambling‐related harm was assessed using the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and Short Gambling Harm Screen (SGHS). Gambling consumption was assessed as annual frequency, expenditure and expenditure as a proportion of income. Findings Categorical gambling consumption data plotted with equal magnitudes evidenced J‐shaped risk‐curves. When the magnitude of gambling categories was re‐scaled to the mid‐points, risk‐curves no longer appeared J‐shaped. Additionally, bootstrapped regression analyses using the continuous gambling consumption data did not provide evidence for J‐shaped risk‐curves. Conclusions: Gambling risk‐curves in Tasmania appear not to be J‐shaped, but rather suggest that risk of gambling‐related harm increases with even small increases in gambling consumption.

AB  - <bold>Introduction and Aims: </bold>Gambling research is characterised by widespread gambling industry involvement. It is likely (as with alcohol and tobacco industry influence) that this will delay or divert effective harm prevention or minimisation measures. Gambling harms are known to be significant and widespread. Effective action to reduce these harms requires concomitant efforts to eliminate industry influence.<bold>Design and Methods: </bold>Gambling industry influence and activity in three research forums is described. The influence of tobacco and alcohol industry involvement in research directions and outcomes is discussed. Aspects of the discursive elements of industry funded and/or directed research outputs are analysed in the context of industry-friendly discourse and its effects. Industry activity and participation at representative research forums is outlined.<bold>Results: </bold>The examples and background provided demonstrate that specific material and discursive effects of gambling industry involvement can be discerned in the gambling literature. The consequences of this for the gambling evidence base around harm prevention and minimisation are presented.<bold>Discussion and Conclusions: </bold>Industry influence operates at multiple levels within the gambling research field. There is increasing awareness of this, and of the effects it may have on the development and deployment of effective harm prevention and minimisation efforts. Key reforms are proposed: (i) the elimination of industry participation and sponsorship of gambling research associations and forums; and (ii) the establishment where necessary of new research forums and international scholarly associations.

AB  - Speed of play has been identified as a key structural characteristic in gambling behaviour, where games involving higher playing speeds enhance the experience of gambling. Of interest in the present study is the consistent finding that games with higher event frequencies are preferred by problem gamblers and are associated with more negative gambling outcomes, such as difficulty quitting the game and increased monetary loss. The present study investigated the impact of gambling speed of play on executive control functioning, focusing on how increased speeds of play impact motor response inhibition, and the potential mediating role arousal and dissociative experience play in this relationship. Fifty regular non-problem gamblers took part in a repeated-measures experiment where they gambled with real money on a simulated slot machine across five speed of play conditions. Response inhibition was measured using an embedded Go/No-Go task, where participants had to withhold motor responses, rather than operating the spin button on the slot machine when a specific colour cue was present. Results indicated that response inhibition performance was significantly worse during faster speeds of play, and that the role of arousal in this relationship was independent of any motor priming affect. The implications of these findings for gambling legislation and gambling harm-minimisation approaches are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The gambling industry has grown into a global business in the 21st century. This has created the need for a new emphasis on problem prevention. This article highlights the core themes of the book Setting Limits: Gambling, Science and Public Policy, taking a broad view of the consequences of gambling for society as a burden on health, well‐being and equality. The book covers the extent of gambling and gambling‐related problems in different societies and presents a critical review of research on industry practices, policy objectives and preventive approaches, including services to people suffering from gambling and its consequences. It discusses the developments in game characteristics and gambling environments and provides evidence on how regulation can affect those. Effective measures to minimize gambling harm exist and many are well supported by scientific evidence. They include restrictions on general availability as well as selective measures to prevent gamblers from overspending. The revenue generated from gambling for the industry, governments, and providers of public services funded from gambling returns presents an obstacle to developing policies to implement harm‐reduction measures. A public interest approach must weigh these interests against the suffering and losses of the victims of gambling. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Adams such as a redesign of electronic gambling machine (EGM) games, stressing that they could have little chance of being implemented. He cites problem gambling awareness and self-monitoring is needed to hinder problem gambling. He adds that gamblers should keep their gambling expenditure at affordable levels.

AB  - Behavioural dependence (BD) for gambling has traditionally been subsumed under the concept of 'problems': a hybrid construct that includes both indicators of BD, and adverse consequences (harm) arising from excessive time and money expenditure. Although progress has been made towards specific measurement of harm, dedicated measures of BD do not exist. Theory led us to expect that (1) dependence and harm are measurably distinct constructs, (2) harm mediates the relationship between dependence and wellbeing, and finally, that (3) separate measures should be more effective than a unidimensional problems measure in predicting wellbeing. Candidate BD items from six existing measures of gambling problems were extracted and evaluated with respect to DSM-5 criteria and content overlap, leading to 17 candidate items. This was further reduced to 8 items based on both item content and psychometric criteria, using data from an online panel of 1524 regular gamblers, with demographic characteristics similar to Australian population norms. Participants also completed measures of harm, problems, and subjective wellbeing. All three hypotheses were confirmed. BD was shown to be highly reliable and unidimensional, and measurably distinct from gambling harms. Harm mediated the negative relationship between BD and wellbeing. The harm + BD model yielded better predictions of personal wellbeing that a unidimensional, continuous problems measure-and explained about twice the variance of a simple contrast between problem and non-problem gamblers. We conclude that is psychometrically justified to specifically measure gambling BD, and this may be of particular use in theoretically-driven applications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper examines the significance of recent developments in research relating to gambling-related harm. Previous research, it is argued, has failed to capture gambling-harm in a way that is useful to inform public policy and regulation. This is because most standardised psychometric measures and the DSM classifications have conflated gambling behaviour and harm and mostly focused on serious harms. As a result, little has generally been known about the prevalence of harm in lower risk gambling groups. Here we summarise the findings from recent harm research, the methodologies used and their conceptual implications. It is argued that strong progress has been made in the categorization and measurement of gambling harm, but that caution must be applied when applying these measures to estimate the 'burden of disease' associated with gambling in the community. Particular issues discussed include: the differentiation of opportunity cost and harm; the validity of additive methods involving different severities of measured harm; using comparisons with unfamiliar disorders; and the validity of prevention paradox arguments in this area of research.

AB  - Responsible Gambling Codes of Conduct (CoC) are used around the world to describe electronic gambling machine (EGM) operator commitments to reducing harm from gambling. In addition to the provision of passive product information and warnings, CoC describe how venues should assist EGM users displaying signs of problematic gambling. The focus in this paper is on venue adherence to the active strategies described in these documents relating to supporting ‘responsible gambling’ and discouraging harmful, intensive and extended gambling. The paper triangulates data from aspirational statements by EGM operators published in CoC documents; structured, unannounced observations by the research team in 11 EGM venues; and interviews and focus groups conducted with 40 gamblers and 20 professionals in Melbourne, Australia. Results showed only isolated evidence of supportive interactions between staff and gamblers to address gambling harm. The weight of evidence demonstrated that venues often fail to respond to signs of gambling problems and instead encourage continued gambling in contradiction of their CoC responsibilities. Signs of gambling problems are a normalised feature of EGM use in these venues. To genuinely address this public health and public policy challenge, improved consumer protection for gamblers may be achieved through legislation requiring venues to respond to signs of gambling problems. This may include a range of measures such as banning food and beverage service at machines and limiting withdrawals of cash by gamblers, as well as using behavioural tracking algorithms to identify problematic gambling patterns and binding universal pre-commitment systems to complement supportive interventions by venue staff.

AB  - Reflecting international patterns, Aboriginal people in Victoria are more likely to gamble and to experience gambling harm than non-Indigenous Victorians. This paper describes experiences of gambling reported by 50 Aboriginal people interviewed in regional Victoria in 2016 and 2017 as part of studies initiated by two Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. Data were analysed using social practice theory (SPT) and coded to the elements of 'meaning', 'material', 'competence', and 'temporality'. Across each element we identified highly contradictory experiences. Gambling held meaning as an opportunity for community gatherings but was also regarded as a cause of domestic violence, conflict, isolation and shame. Materially, the venues that offered gambling were experienced by many Aboriginal people as safe and welcoming, but at the same time gambling produced a damaging affective sense of addiction for some. Gambling was a competency that some people valued and taught to children, but it was also seen as undermining cultural practices. While Aboriginal people were historically denied access to licensed venues offering commercial gambling, many participants now found opportunities to gamble inescapable. The intermingling of benefits and harms described above supports the need for a multi-faceted response to gambling in Aboriginal communities, which includes harm reduction as well as supply restriction and treatment. Some experiences of gambling related by our participants reflected those reported also by non-Indigenous Australians, while others were differently nuanced. Because SPT is used to understand collectively-shared practices, it facilitates the identification of gambling interventions at the level of the community, as recommended by our research participants.

AB  - Gambling exposes people to risk for harm, but also has recreational benefits. The present study aimed to measure gambling harm and gambling benefits on similar scales using two novel methods adapted from the Burden of Disease approach (McCormack et al. in Psychol Med 18(4):1007-1019, 1988; Torrance et al. in Health Serv Res 7(2):118-133, 1972) to find whether gambling either adds or subtracts from quality of life. A Tasmanian population-representative survey of 5000 adults (2534 female) from random digit dialling (RDD) of landline telephones in Tasmania (50%), as well as pre-screened Tasmanian RDD mobiles (17%) and listed mobile numbers (33%), measured gambling benefits and harms amongst gamblers (59.2%) and a non-exclusive set of people who were "affected" by someone else's gambling (4.5%). The majority of gamblers indicated no change to their quality of life from gambling (82.5% or 72.6% based on direct elicitation or time trade off methods, respectively). Nevertheless, a weighted average of all the positive and negative influences on quality of life, inclusive of gamblers and affected others, revealed that the quality of life change from gambling is either a very modest + 0.05% or a more concerning - 1.9% per capita. Gambling generates only small or negative net consumer surpluses for Tasmanians. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Understanding why some people experience problems with gambling whilst others are able to restrict gambling to recreational levels is still largely unexplained. One potential explanation is through salutogenesis, which is a health promotion approach of understanding factors which move people towards health rather than disease. An important aspect of salutogenesis is sense of coherence. Individuals with stronger sense of coherence perceive their environment as comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. The present study examined the relationship of individuals' sense of coherence on their gambling behaviour and experience of gambling related harm. This exploratory study utilised an archival dataset (n = 1236) from an online, cross sectional survey of people who had experienced negative consequences from gambling. In general, a stronger sense of coherence was related to lower problem gambling severity. When gambling behaviour was controlled for, sense of coherence was significantly related to the experience of individual gambling harms. A strong sense of coherence can be seen as a protective factor against problematic gambling behaviour, and subsequent gambling related harms. These findings support the value of both primary and tertiary prevention strategies that strengthen sense of coherence as a harm minimisation strategy. The present study demonstrates the potential value of, and provides clear direction for, considering sense of coherence in order to understand gambling-related issues. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Time-sampling methodology was implemented to examine the prospective associations between affect, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder. Thirty (9 male, 21 female) adults with a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study. Participants completed electronic diary entries of their current affective state, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior for 30 consecutive days. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior. Instead, affect predicted the desire to gamble, with high levels of sadness and arousal independently predicting an increased desire to gamble. Desire to gamble predicted actual gambling behavior. There were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of gambling motivations at baseline; however, during the 30-day period, participants with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often than did participants with depressive disorder, whereas those with depressive disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of positive affect. The present findings provide evidence that negative affect is not directly related to actual gambling behavior, and suggest that affective states rather impact the desire to gamble.

AB  - Previous research using the Gambling Outcome Expectancies Scale (GOES; Flack and Morris in J Gambl Stud, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s10899-014-9484-z ) revealed the instrument has excellent psychometric properties and differentially predicts gambling frequency and problem gambling scores. However, like the existing gambling motivation scales, the GOES psychometric properties and predictive utility have not been tested outside of cross sectional studies. The current study used a prospective survey design to redress this issue. Eight hundred and ninety-three participants, drawn from the general community, completed the second wave of the gambling survey. Temporal invariance testing revealed the GOES was reliable. Furthermore, the ability of the GOES to predict gambling behaviour using baseline and concurrent measures of gambling outcome expectancies was demonstrated. Specifically, consistent with the Wave 1 results, the gambling outcome expectancies that reflect diverse reasons for gambling (e.g., social, escape, and money) preferentially predicted gambling frequency whereas the narrower range of emotion focused reasons (e.g., excitement, escape, and ego enhancement) predicted gambling problems. Considered in light of the Wave 1 findings, these results underscore the need for gambling harm minimisation initiatives to take into account the emotion-oriented reasons for gambling.

AB  - Cognitive bias is prevalent among gamblers, especially those with gambling problems. Grounded in the heuristics theories, this study contributes to the literature by examining a cognitive bias triggered by the break streak pattern in the casino setting. We postulate that gamblers tend to bet on the latest outcome when there is a break-streak pattern. Moreover, three determinants of the betting decision under break-streak pattern, including the streak length of the alternative outcome, the frequency of the latest outcome, and gender, were identified and examined in this study. A non-participatory observational study was conducted among the Cussec gamblers in a casino in Macao. An analysis of 1229 bets confirms our postulation, particularly when the streak of the alternative outcome is long, the latest outcome is frequent, and the gamblers are females. The findings provide meaningful implications for casino management and public policymakers regarding the minimization of gambling harm. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Commercial gambling is expanding rapidly across the globe. However, the field of gambling research has not kept pace with this expansion, and continues to focus on prevalence studies and individuated treatment regimes, with little attention to the political, economic or technological underpinnings of commercial gambling. The implications of this lack of sophistication in the research agenda are that society is ill-equipped to understand the nature and underlying causes of gambling harms, and how these might best be avoided, minimized or ameliorated. Around the world, various levels of government benefit from gambling revenue, with consequences for the independent regulation of gambling. Further, there is considerable industry influence on the research agenda, often involving similar techniques to those employed previously by the tobacco and alcohol industries to engage researchers. This influence is compounded by a failure of many gambling researchers and journals to adopt traditional academic safeguards, such as the disclosure of conflicts of interest, and by many arguing for a 'partnership model' with industry to advance the research agenda. This paper identifies five basic principles to restore reasonable standards of integrity in gambling studies: (1) research should not be funded by the proceeds of gambling; (2) research priorities should not be influenced by the beneficiaries of gambling; (3) conferences and other research fora should not be influenced by industry; (4) funding sources should be disclosed in journals and at conferences; and (5) meaningful access to gambling products and environments must be part of licensing. We also propose a range of actions to promote greater transparency and independence in the gambling research field. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to develop an empirically based description of relapse in Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) problem gambling (PG) by describing the processes and factors that 'pull' the problem gambler away from relapse contrasted with the 'push' towards relapse. These conceptualisations describe two opposing, interacting emotional processes occurring within the problem gambler during any relapse episode. Each relapse episode comprises a complex set of psychological and social behaviours where many factors interact sequentially and simultaneously within the problem gambler to produce a series of mental and behaviour events that end (1) with relapse where 'push' overcomes 'pull' or (2) continued abstinence where 'pull' overcomes 'push'. Four focus groups comprising thirty participants who were EGM problem gamblers, gamblers' significant others, therapists and counsellors described their experiences and understanding of relapse. The groups were recorded, recordings were then transcribed and analysed using thematic textual analysis. It was established that vigilance, motivation to commit to change, positive social support, cognitive strategies such as remembering past gambling harms or distraction techniques to avoid thinking about gambling to enable gamblers to manage the urge to gamble and urge extinction were key factors that protected against relapse. Three complementary theories emerged from the analysis. Firstly, a process of reappraisal of personal gambling behaviour pulls the gambler away from relapse. This results in a commitment to change that develops over time and affects but is independent of each episode of relapse. Secondly, relapse may be halted by interacting factors that 'pull' the problem gambler away from the sequence of mental and behavioural events, which follow the triggering of the urge and cognitions to gamble. Thirdly, urge extinction and apparent 'cure' is possible for EGM gambling. This study provides a qualitative, empirical model for understanding protective factors against gambling relapse.

T1  - A Prospective Investigation of Affect, the Desire to Gamble, Gambling Motivations and Gambling Behavior in the Mood Disorders.

AB  - Time-sampling methodology was implemented to examine the prospective associations between affect, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder. Thirty (9 male, 21 female) adults with a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study. Participants completed electronic diary entries of their current affective state, desire to gamble, and gambling behavior for 30 consecutive days. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior. Instead, affect predicted the desire to gamble, with high levels of sadness and arousal independently predicting an increased desire to gamble. Desire to gamble predicted actual gambling behavior. There were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of gambling motivations at baseline; however, during the 30-day period, participants with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often than did participants with depressive disorder, whereas those with depressive disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of positive affect. The present findings provide evidence that negative affect is not directly related to actual gambling behavior, and suggest that affective states rather impact the desire to gamble.
