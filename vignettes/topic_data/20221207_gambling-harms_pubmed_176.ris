AB  - Jurisdictions around the world have a self-declared mandate to reduce gambling-related harm. However, historically, this concept has suffered from poor  conceptualisation and operationalisation. However, recent years have seen swift  advances in measuring gambling harm, based on the principle of it being a  quantifiable decrement to the health and wellbeing of the gambler and those  connected to them. This review takes stock of the background and recent  developments in harm assessment and summarises recent research that has validated  and applied the Short Gambling Harms Screen and related instruments. We recommend  that future work builds upon the considerable psychometric evidence accumulated  for the feasibility of direct elicitation of harmful consequences. We also  advocate for grounding harms measures with respect to scalar changes to public  health utility metrics. Such an approach will avoid misleading pseudo-clinical  categorisations, provide accurate population-level summaries of where the burden  of harm is carried, and serve to integrate gambling research with the broader  field of public health.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - This paper examines the significance of recent developments in research relating to gambling-related harm. Previous research, it is argued, has failed to capture  gambling-harm in a way that is useful to inform public policy and regulation.  This is because most standardised psychometric measures and the DSM  classifications have conflated gambling behaviour and harm and mostly focused on  serious harms. As a result, little has generally been known about the prevalence  of harm in lower risk gambling groups. Here we summarise the findings from recent  harm research, the methodologies used and their conceptual implications. It is  argued that strong progress has been made in the categorization and measurement  of gambling harm, but that caution must be applied when applying these measures  to estimate the 'burden of disease' associated with gambling in the community.  Particular issues discussed include: the differentiation of opportunity cost and  harm; the validity of additive methods involving different severities of measured  harm; using comparisons with unfamiliar disorders; and the validity of prevention  paradox arguments in this area of research.

AB  - Prior studies have identified self-regulatory strategies that are infrequently used by problem-gamblers, but which might be protective if used. However,  guidelines with evidence-based safe gambling practices (SGPs) that prevent  gambling-related harm are lacking. This study aimed to: 1) identify a  parsimonious set of evidence-based SGPs that best predict non-harmful gambling  amongst gamblers who are otherwise most susceptible to experiencing gambling  harm; 2) examine how widely are they used; and 3) assess whether their use  differs by gambler characteristics. A sample of 1,174 regular gamblers in Alberta  Canada completed an online survey measuring uptake of 43 potential SGPs, gambling  harms and numerous risk factors for harmful gambling. Elastic net regression  identified a sub-sample of 577 gamblers most susceptible to gambling harm and  therefore most likely to benefit from the uptake of SGPs. A second elastic net  predicted gambling harm scores in the sub-sample, using the SGPs as candidate  predictors. Nine SGPs best predicted non-harmful gambling amongst this  sub-sample. The behaviour most strongly associated with increased harm was using  credit to gamble. The behaviour most strongly associated with reduced harm was  'If I'm not having fun gambling, I stop'. These SGPs form the basis of  evidence-based safe gambling guidelines which can be: 1) promoted to consumers,  2) form the basis of self-assessment tests, 3) used to measure safe gambling at a  population level, and 4) inform supportive changes to policy and practice. The  guidelines advise gamblers to: stop if they are not having fun, keep a household  budget, keep a dedicated gambling budget, have a fixed amount they can spend,  engage in other leisure activities, avoid gambling when upset or depressed, not  use credit for gambling, avoid gambling to make money, and not think that  strategies can help you win. These guidelines are a promising initiative to help  reduce gambling-related harm.

TI  - Measuring Gambling Harm: The Influence of Response Scaling on Estimates and the Distribution of Harm Across PGSI Categories.
AU  - Delfabbro, Paul

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Recent research has shown that harm is not just a feature of problem gambling, but can also be observed in other lower risk categories. Some debates exist,  however, as to the distribution of harm across these categories and how harm  should be best measured. This study was designed to examine how estimates of  self-reported harm are affected by the methodology used. A particular focus was  on how harm estimates for low and higher risk gambling (as classified by the  PGSI) varied when respondents were able to make more graded attributions of their  harm to gambling. An online panel sample of 554 gamblers responded to a brief  survey that included the PGSI, measures of gambling harm drawn from Browne et al.  (Assessing gambling-related harm in Victoria: a public health perspective,  Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, Melbourne, 2016) as well as questions  about demographics and gambling habits. The recruitment was designed to obtain  good representation of each PGSI group, with 23% found to be problem gamblers;  36% moderate risk and 21% low risk gamblers. In support of Browne et al. (2016),  the findings showed that higher proportions of harm in low risk gamblers is  likely to be identified when one uses binary or 'any harm' scoring, but that this  effect mostly disappears when more graded scoring or attribution of harm measures  are used. Higher risk PGSI groups consistently reported more harms and more  serious harms than lower risk groups. It was concluded that the measurement of  gambling harm and its estimated distribution over PGSI categories is quite  sensitive to how it is measured.

T2  - Harm reduction journal
AB  - BACKGROUND: Harmful gambling is a complex issue with diverse antecedents and resulting harms that have been studied from multiple disciplinary perspectives.  Although previous bibliometric reviews of gambling studies have found a dominance  of judgement and decision-making research, no bibliometric review has examined  the concept of "harm" in the gambling literature, and little work has  quantitatively assessed how gambling research priorities differ between  countries. METHODS: Guided by the Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling  (CFHG), an internationally relevant framework of antecedents to harmful gambling,  we conducted a bibliometric analysis focusing on research outputs from three  countries with different gambling regulatory environments: Canada, Australia, and  New Zealand. Using a Web of Science database search, 1424 articles published from  2008 to 2017 were retrieved that could be mapped to the eight CFHG factors. A  subsample of articles (n = 171) containing the word "harm" in the title,  abstract, or keywords was then drawn. Descriptive statistics were used to examine  differences between countries and trends over time with regard to CFHG factor and  harm focus. RESULTS: Psychological and biological factors dominate gambling  research in Canada whereas resources and treatment have received more attention  in New Zealand. A greater percentage of Australia and New Zealand publications  address the gambling environment and exposure to gambling than in Canada. The  subset of articles focused on harm showed a stronger harms focus among New  Zealand and Australian researchers compared to Canadian-authored publications.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide preliminary bibliometric evidence that gambling  research foci may be shaped by jurisdictional regulation of gambling. Countries  with privately operated gambling focused on harm factors that are the operators'  responsibility, whereas jurisdictions with a public health model focused on  treatment and harm reduction resources. In the absence of a legislated  requirement for public health or harm minimisation focus, researchers in  jurisdictions with government-operated gambling tend to focus research on factors  that are the individual's responsibility and less on the harms they experience.  Given increased international attention to gambling-related harm, regulatory and  research environments could promote and support more diverse research in this  area.

TI  - Gambling as social practice: a complementary approach for reducing harm?
AU  - Gordon, Ross
AU  - Reith, Gerda
T2  - Harm reduction journal
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling is now a well-recognised public health issue and forms the focus of extensive harm reduction initiatives. Recent developments in policy,  practice and technology, such relaxation of regulations, the increasing influence  of global gambling corporations, and the development of devices such as mobile  phone apps and fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) mean that the landscape is a  complex, dynamic, and fast moving one. Gambling is now practiced using new  technologies, in various spaces and places, and features in a range of social  surroundings. Therefore, research is needed to inform appropriate gambling harm  reduction strategies that can respond to this complex domain. Yet, research and  policy approaches to the reduction of gambling harm are predominantly framed  through psychological and economic models of individual behaviour, addiction, and  'rational' action. This is beginning to change, with a growing corpus of  socio-cultural approaches to gambling research now emerging. METHOD: In this  article, we argue the case of recognising gambling as a social practice, the  performance of which draws upon multiple elements such as technology and  materials, spaces and places, language and discourse, and structures and agency.  We call for a practice theory approach to gambling research that joins efforts to  move beyond individual gamblers and their behaviour, to also acknowledge the  interaction of multiple elements shaping gambling practices. To achieve this, we  suggest that research methods such as visual ethnography can be helpful.  CONCLUSION: We set out how a social practice perspective to gambling research can  generate different insights and help inform more nuanced and appropriate gambling  harm reduction initiatives.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Problem gambling severity and gambling-related harm are closely coupled, but conceptually distinct, constructs. The primary aim was to  compare low-risk gambling limits when gambling-related harm was defined using the  negative consequence items of the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI-Harm) and  the Short Gambling Harms Scale items (SGHS-Harm). A secondary aim was compare  low-risk limits derived using a definition of harm in which at least two harms  across different domains (e.g. financial and relationship) were endorsed with a  definition of harm in which at least two harms from any domain were endorsed.  METHODS: Data were collected from dual-frame computer-assisted telephone  interviews of 5,000 respondents in the fourth Social and Economic Impact Study  (SEIS) of Gambling in Tasmania. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve  analyse were conducted to identify low-risk gambling limits. RESULTS: PGSI-Harm  and SGHS-Harm definitions produced similar overall limits: 30-37 times per year;  AUD$510-$544 per year; expenditure comprising no more than 10.2-10.3% of gross  personal income; 400-454 minutes per year; and 2 types of gambling activities per  year. Acceptable limits (AUC ≥0.70) were identified for horse/dog racing, keno,  and sports/other betting using the PGSI definition; and electronic gaming  machines, keno, and bingo using the SGHS definition. The requirement that  gamblers endorse two or more harms across different domains had a relatively  negligible effect. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although replications using  alternative measures of harm are required, previous PGSI-based limits appear to  be robust thresholds that have considerable potential utility in the prevention  of gambling-related harm.

AB  - Increasingly, gambling stakeholders communicate that minimizing gambling harm is a shared societal responsibility. Individual gamblers' beliefs about  responsibility for minimizing gambling harm are worthy of study because these  beliefs might influence gambling behavior. In this study, using a sample of  casino loyalty program subscribers (N = 4,795), we observed that respondents who  had a positive result on a brief gambling disorder screen were more likely than  those who screened negative to hold seven stakeholder groups (i.e., scientists,  clinicians, casino employees, government regulators, public health officials,  casino industry lobbyists, public safety officials) responsible for helping to  minimize gambling harm. The sum of stakeholder groups held responsible for  minimizing gambling harm, along with beliefs that casinos share responsibility  for encouraging responsible gambling behavior, predicted gambling disorder  screening status after controlling for established problem gambling risk factors.  These results replicated our previous study using a mostly independent sample.  Contrary to our expectations, beliefs about responsibility for mitigating  gambling harm were mostly unrelated to measures of gambling involvement. These  results provided additional support for the notion that those who are at risk for  gambling harm are especially likely to hold others responsible for minimizing  such harm. However, they call into question the role of gambling involvement in  this relationship.

AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Advancements in mobile- and web-based technologies proliferate everyday opportunities to gamble. The increased availability, popularity and  intensity of online gambling platforms and interactive gaming activities also  changes the way we construct gambling harm reduction interventions. Information  and communication technologies (ICT) provide potential opportunities to reduce  harm from online gambling through harm minimisation initiatives and currently  available services. The aim of this review was to firstly understand the scope of  peer-reviewed evidence on ICT-based strategies to reduce online gambling harm,  and secondly, what evidence exists specifically in relation to ICT-based harm  reduction initiatives for people who gamble online. METHODS: Scoping review  methods and a five-stage model of analysis were used to: identify the published  literature on ICT-based harm minimisation activities for online gambling; distil  models appropriate to address gambling harm in this setting; and synthesise all  available evidence, noting gaps and patterns. RESULTS: Sixteen gambling-specific  ICT-based interventions were reviewed in depth. The majority of included studies  focused on different components of computer-assisted or online therapy programs  for disordered gambling, specifically the development of individual skills in  managing problematic gambling behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The review found that  despite the widespread potential ICT represent for addressing gambling harm there  has been only limited published research to date. SO WHAT: There is a clear need  for further investigation into uptake, usage, focus and effectiveness of all  online gambling interventions on offer. The dearth of gambling-specific empirical  knowledge potentially indicates a serious resourcing and reporting issues in this  area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While the prevalence of women's participation in gambling is steadily increasing, there is a well-recognised male bias in gambling research and policy.  Few papers have sought to synthesise the literature relating to women and  gambling-related harm and provide practical suggestions to guide future research,  policy, and practice which take into account the specific nuances associated with  women's gambling. METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted to review  the evidence base on women's gambling behaviours and experiences of harm. Drawing  from strategies used effectively in other areas of public health, key elements  for a gendered approach to harm prevention were identified and adapted into  practical public health research, policy and practice strategies. RESULTS:  Results indicated a lack of research that explores women's gambling. Few studies  have examined the impact of gambling on the lives of women, with limited  understanding of the factors that influence women's engagement with gambling  products, and the impact of industry tactics. A gendered approach was identified  as a strategy used successfully in other areas of public health to shift the  focus onto women and to ensure they are considered in research. In tobacco  control, increasing trends in women's smoking behaviour were combatted with  targeted research, policy and practical initiatives. These key elements were  adapted to create a conceptual framework for reducing and preventing gambling  harm in women. The framework provides regulatory direction and a research agenda  to minimise gambling-related harm for women both in Australia and  internationally. Evidence-based policies should be implemented to focus on the  influence of gender and associated factors to address gambling-related harm.  Practical interventions must take into account how women conceptualise and  respond to gambling risk in order to develop specific harm prevention programs  which respond to their needs. CONCLUSION: A gendered approach to gambling harm  prevention shifts the focus onto the unique factors associated with women's  gambling and specific ways to prevent harm. As seen in other areas of public  health, such a framework enables harm measures, policies, and interventions to be  developed that are salient to girls and women's lives, experiences and  circumstances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Harm from gambling is known to impact individuals, families, and communities; and these harms are not restricted to people with a gambling  disorder. Currently, there is no robust and inclusive internationally agreed upon  definition of gambling harm. In addition, the current landscape of gambling  policy and research uses inadequate proxy measures of harm, such as problem  gambling symptomology, that contribute to a limited understanding of gambling  harms. These issues impede efforts to address gambling from a public health  perspective. METHODS: Data regarding harms from gambling was gathered using four  separate methodologies, a literature review, focus groups and interviews with  professionals involved in the support and treatment of gambling problems,  interviews with people who gamble and their affected others, and an analysis of  public forum posts for people experiencing problems with gambling and their  affected others. The experience of harm related to gambling was examined to  generate a conceptual framework. The catalogue of harms experienced were  organised as a taxonomy. RESULTS: The current paper proposes a definition and  conceptual framework of gambling related harm that captures the full breadth of  harms that gambling can contribute to; as well as a taxonomy of harms to  facilitate the development of more appropriate measures of harm. CONCLUSIONS: Our  aim is to create a dialogue that will lead to a more coherent interpretation of  gambling harm across treatment providers, policy makers and researchers.

AB  - Incarcerated populations across the world have been found to be consistently and significantly more vulnerable to problem gambling than general populations in the  same countries. In an effort to gain a more specific understanding of this  vulnerability the present study applied latent class analysis and criminal career  theory to gambling data collected from a sample of English and Scottish, male and  female prisoners (N = 1057). Theoretical links between gambling and crime were  tested through three hypotheses: (1) that prisoners in the UK would have higher  rates of problem gambling behaviour than the national population; (2) that if the  link between gambling and crime is coincidental, gambling behaviour would be  highly prevalent in an offending population, and (3) if connections between  gambling behaviour and offending are co-symptomatic a mediating factor would show  a strong association. The first of these was supported, the second was not  supported and the third was partially supported. Latent class analysis found six  gambling behaviour clusters measured by responses to the Problem Gambling  Severity Index, primarily distinguished by loss chasing behaviour. Longitudinal  offending data drawn from the Police National Computer database found four  criminal career types, distinguished by frequency and persistence over time. A  significant association was found between higher level loss chasing and high rate  offending in criminal careers suggesting that impulse control may be a mediating  factor for both gambling harm and criminal careers.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling moves beyond a symptoms-based view of harm and addresses a broad set of factors related to the  risks and effects of gambling harmfully at the individual, family, and community  levels. Coauthored by international research experts and informed by multiple  stakeholders, Gambling Research Exchange (GREO) facilitated the framework  development in 2013 and retains responsibility for regular updates and  mobilization. This review article presents information about the revised version  of the Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling completed in late 2018. METHODS:  We describe eight interrelated factors depicted in the framework that represent  major themes in gambling ranging from the specific (gambling environment,  exposure, gambling types, and treatment resources) to the general (cultural,  social, psychological, and biological influences). After outlining the framework  development and collaborative process, we highlight new topics for the recent  update that reflect changes in the gambling landscape and prominent discourses in  the scientific community. Some of these topics include social and economic  impacts of gambling, and a new model of understanding gambling related harm.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We address the relevance of the CFHG to the gambling  and behavioral addictions research community. Harm-based frameworks have been  undertaken in other areas of addiction that can both inform and be informed by a  model dedicated to harmful gambling. Further, the framework brings a  multi-disciplinary perspective to bear on antecedents and factors that co-occur  with harmful gambling.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is common for gambling research to focus on problem and disordered gambling. Less is known about the prevalence of gambling-related harms  among people in the general population. This study aimed to develop and validate  the 18-item version of the Short Gambling Harms Screen (SGHS-18). METHODS:  Population-representative web-based and postal surveys were conducted in the  three geographical areas of Finland (n = 7186, aged 18 or older). Reliability and  internal structure of SGHS-18 was assessed using coefficient omega and via  confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Four measurement models of SGHS-18 were  compared: one-factor, six-factor, a second-ordered factor model and a bifactor  model (M4). RESULTS: The analysis revealed that only the bifactor model had  adequate fit for SGHS-18 (CFI = 0.953, TLI = 0.930, GFI = 0.974, RMSEA = 0.047,  SRMR = 0.027). The general factor explained most of the common variance compared  to specific factors. Coefficient omega hierarchical value for global gambling  harm factor (0.80) was high, which suggested that SGHS-18 assessed the  combination of general harm constructs sufficiently. The correlation with the  Problem and Pathological Gambling Measures (PPGM) was 0.44, potentially  reflecting that gambling harms are closely-although not perfectly-aligned with  the mental health issue of problem gambling. SGHS-18 scores were substantially  higher for participants who gambled more often, who spent more money or who had  gambling problems, demonstrating convergent validity for the screen. DISCUSSION:  The SGHS-18 comprehensively measures the domains of gambling harm, while  demonstrating desirable properties of internal consistency, and criterion and  convergent validity.

TI  - Theoretically informed gender analysis for gambling harm reduction: a New Zealand study.
AU  - Palmer du Preez, Katie

T2  - Harm reduction journal
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling harm affects men and women relatively equally, and gender influences the social determinants of gambling harm. Responses to preventing and  minimising women's gambling harm have been shaped and constrained by population  research identifying male gender as a key risk factor for gambling problems.  Gender analysis in gambling studies is rare and has lacked theoretical  underpinning and coherence, limiting possibilities for gender-responsive and  gender-aware harm prevention and reduction activities. METHODS: Two influential  qualitative studies of gambling harm in New Zealand (involving total n = 165  people who gambled, affected others, community leaders, gambling and community  support service providers, policy makers and academics) neglected to explore the  role of gender. This study revisited data collected in these studies, using  thematic analysis informed by feminist social constructionist theory. The  overarching research questions were: How do gender-related issues, notions and  practices influence women's gambling related harm? What are the implications for  women's gambling harm reduction? RESULTS: Women's socio-cultural positioning as  primary caregivers for families and children constrained their ability to access  a range of recreational and support options and increased the attractiveness of  local gambling opportunities as accessible and 'safe' outlets for stress  reduction. Patriarchal practices of power and control within family contexts  operated to maintain gambling behaviour, shut down alternative recreational  opportunities, and limit women's autonomy. Consideration of these themes in  relation to current health promotion practice in New Zealand revealed that  national programmes and strategies appear to be operating without cognisance of  these gender dynamics and therefore have the potential to exacerbate or cause  some women harm. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the value of theoretically  informed gender analysis for gambling harm reduction research, policy and  practice. International guidelines for gender-aware and gender-responsive health  research and practice should be engaged as a foundation for strategic and  effective gambling harm reduction programmes, projects, research and policy, and  as an essential part of developing and implementing interventions for gambling  harm.

AB  - Background: Recent research evidence has suggested that gambling is a public health concern. A number of studies report the association between gambling  activity and increased instances of various other harms, including substance  misuse and psychological disorders. In parallel to alcohol misuse, it is also  becoming clear that gambling related harm is more of a continuum of harm, as  opposed to traditionally accepted categorisations of gambling behavior: safe and  responsible or "problem" and harmful. Previous effective treatment models for  alcohol misuse have considered a public health approach to develop interventions.  As such, the current research seeks to use a public health approach to both  investigate the extent of gambling harm across Wales, and to identify upstream  predictors of harm to inform future interventions. Method: A triangulation of  data collection methods was utilized across Wales, UK. Two hundred and  forty-eight participants completed a quantitative survey relating to gambling  behavior and related harm, which included the Problem Severity Gambling Index,  the Gambling Commission measure of frequency, The Gambling Motives Questionnaire  and the Fast Alcohol Screening tool. Ninety-eight of these participants completed  a qualitative subsection. Structured interviews were conducted with 20  individuals from 11 service providers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted  for the five case studies of individuals who had previously sought help for  gambling. The geographical density and distribution of Licensed Gambling Outlets  was also mapped in local areas. Results: The findings provide further evidence of  a continuum of gambling related harm. Twenty seven percent of survey participants  demonstrate some indicators of risk of gambling harm. Social, cultural and  environmental contexts play a role in initiation and maintenance of gambling  behavior and the subsequent related harm. Accounts from individuals corroborated  the quantitative findings. Conclusions: Findings from this Welsh sample are in  line with and add support to the growing international research evidence that  gambling harms are a universal issue that cross cultures. It is clear that action  is needed by legislators at a policy level and that broadening the focus of  intervention to a public health level is necessary to develop effective  strategies for harm reduction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This report is an overview of results from the 2016 Finnish Gambling Harms Survey covering the population and clinical perspectives. It summarises the  main findings on gambling participation, gambling habits, gambling-related harm,  and opinions on gambling advertising. METHODS: The population sample (n = 7186)  was collected from three regions and the clinical sample (n = 119) in a gambling  help clinic. RESULTS: Frequency of gambling in the population sample was  characteristically once a week, while in the clinical sample it was daily. Men  gambled more often than women only in the population sample. The most common  gambling environments were kiosks, grocery stores or supermarkets, and home. The  most typical gambling-related harms were financial or emotional/psychological  harms; the amount of experienced harm was considerable among the clinical sample.  The clinical sample also perceived gambling advertising as obtrusive and as a  driving force for gambling. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the clinical sample imply  that when gambling gets out of hand, the distinctions between gamblers' habits  diminish and become more streamlined, focusing on gambling per se - doing it  often, and in greater varieties (different game types). There is a heightened  need to monitor gambling and gambling-related harm at the population level,  especially amongst heavy consumers, in order to understand what type of external  factors pertaining to policy and governance may contribute to the shift from  recreational to problem gambling.

AB  - Esports betting and skin gambling involve betting on the outcomes of video game competitions and/or using virtual currencies for betting. The present study  evaluated a conceptual model linking video game involvement, video-game related  gambling, traditional gambling, and gambling problems and harm. Data were  collected via a cross-sectional online survey with 737 participants aged 18 + who  engaged in esports cash betting (n = 576), esports skin betting (n = 184), or  skin gambling on games of chance (n = 330). The findings highlighted the  distinctly different relationships esports cash betting versus skin gambling had  with traditional gambling involvement and harmful gambling. Gambling with skins  on games of chance was predictive of gambling problems and gambling harm after  controlling for participation in traditional gambling (OR = 1.32 and 1.17  respectively). Whereas betting on esports with cash was associated with betting  on a variety of other forms of gambling, and there was no unique contribution to  problems and harm over and above participation on these other forms (e.g., EGMs,  sports betting). Skin gambling is directly implicated in gambling problems and  harm, whereas cash betting on esports is only indicative of interest in many  forms of potentially harmful gambling. Greater research attention to skin  gambling is warranted, and particularly with respect to its role as a virtual  currency more easily accessible for gambling.

T2  - Zeitschrift fur Gesundheitswissenschaften = Journal of public health
AB  - AIM: Gambling harm is a serious public health issue affecting the health, financial security, and social well-being of millions of people and their close  relations around the world. Despite its population health implications, gambling  harm is not typically viewed and treated as a public health policy issue. This  paper critically reviews the evolution of the public health perspective on  gambling harm. It also considers how gambling harm can be operationalized within  a public health model. METHODS: A critical historical review of the emerging  public health perspective on gambling harm was conducted. Key documents covering  three decades of development were reviewed and appraised through a process of  deliberation and debate over source impact in the fields of research, policy, and  programming internationally. RESULTS: The first decade mainly focused on  identifying gambling harm and framing the public health issue. The second decade  featured the expansion of health assessment and emerging areas of policy and  program development. The third decade saw an increased focus on public health  frameworks that advanced understanding of harm mechanics and impact. As reflected  by the essential functions of a general public health model, gambling harm  prevention efforts emphasize health promotion over other key functions like  health assessment and surveillance. CONCLUSION: Gambling harm is a public health  issue requiring greater attention to health assessment and surveillance data  development.

TI  - Baby boomers as gamblers: recognizing and preventing gambling harm with intersectional approach.
AU  - Heiskanen, M. K.
AU  - Matilainen, R.
T2  - Public health
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to discuss and analyse the gambling habits and perceptions towards gambling cultures and problems among the large 'baby boomer'  generation in Finland from an intersectional approach. These people born between  1945 and 1955 in their retirement or approaching retirement may face new risks  regarding gambling. The results of this study support the designing of harm  prevention among this ageing generation. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-five people were  interviewed in six focus groups. Participants' gambling experience varied from  non-gambling to having experienced some problems. Three of the focus groups had  participants with second degree education the highest, and three of the groups  had participants with second degree education the lowest. Four interviews were  conducted in the capital area and two in rural environments. METHODS: The group  interview data were analysed with thematic content analysis. After initial coding  in accordance with the research questions, subthemes and final themes were  formed. Results are discussed through the final themes. RESULTS: The main results  concern the gambling habits on the participants' life course: from shared,  cultural experiences in their childhood to mostly minor gambling on the edge of  retirement; the mutual understanding of the enormous growth in gambling supply  during their lifetime, but emphasizing the importance of gambling monopoly for  the society; and framing gambling problems as an individual tendency.  CONCLUSIONS: The prevention of gambling harm within this generation needs to take  into account the historical changes they have lived: from few, harmless gambling  products framed as an instrument to support 'good causes' to the current world of  commercial gambling. The deterministic understanding of gambling problems as an  individual flaw may prevent recognizing problem gambling and seeking help to  tackle the problems. Risks for gambling harm relate more to the gambling  structures and cultures this ageing generation lives in, and the deterministic,  individual understanding of gambling harm they share, than to marginalized  positions they may have through gender or education.

TI  - The dangers of conflating gambling-related harm with disordered gambling.
AU  - Browne, Matthew
AU  - Rockloff, Matthew J.
T2  - Journal of behavioral addictions
AB  - In their critical review of the prevention paradox (PP) applied to gambling-related harm, Delfabbro and King (2017) raise a number of concerns  regarding specific assumptions, methods, and findings as well as the general  conceptual approach. Besides discussing the PP, the review also considers the  merits of considering a "continuum of harm," as opposed to the more traditional  categorical approach to classifying problem gamblers. Their critique is carefully  modulated and balanced, and starts a useful dialogue in the context of a public  health approach to gambling. Unfortunately, some of Delfabbro and King's (2017)  arguments rest on the treatment of gambling harm as a binary state and conflates  gambling-related harm with disordered gambling. In this reply, we argue that the  application of PP logic to gambling harm has not yet been addressed by us, and is  only indirectly related to the more important objective of understanding how  gambling can reduce ones' quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling-related harm is an increasing recognised problem internationally. Recent years have seen an explosion in opportunities to gamble,  both in person and online. Health and other care settings have the potential to  act as screening sites to identify and support gamblers who may be at high risk  of experiencing gambling-related harm. This study aimed to identify interventions  to screen for risk of gambling-related harm in the general population which may  be delivered in health, care and support settings. METHODS: Systematic review.  Searches of key databases and grey sources since 2012 were undertaken in October  2019. Electronic database searches generated a total of 5826 unique hits. Nine  studies published 2013-2019, along with thirteen grey literature documents met  our eligibility criteria. The criteria were setting (health, care and support  settings), participants (any attendee in help, care and support settings),  interventions (screening to identify risk of harm from gambling behaviours) and  outcome measures (gambling behaviours, service use). RESULTS: Three papers  evaluating screening interventions delivered in general practice (repeat visits  and written advice), mental health service (the use of screening tools to  identify risk of harm), and substance abuse treatment (intensive outpatient  treatment for substance use disorders or methadone maintenance) indicated  evidence of potential effectiveness. Six papers supported the feasibility and  acceptability of delivering interventions in various settings. Grey literature  reports described the implementation of interventions such as training materials,  and transfer of interventions developed for substance abuse populations by  practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: Health, care and support services offer potentially  important contexts in which to identify and offer support to people who are at  risk of gambling related harm. Screening interventions appear feasible and  acceptable in a range of community and healthcare settings for those at risk of  gambling harm. Evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening in  these populations should therefore be prioritised.

AU  - Livingstone, C.

T2  - Public health
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To address the current status of responsible gambling (RG) as the dominant discourse for reducing gambling harm. STUDY DESIGN: The article is a  narrative review of relevant literature analysed discursively. METHODS: We  identified significant texts describing the discourse of RG and analysed these to  extract major characteristics and themes of the discourse. These were then  subjected to a critique, using the public health discourses as an alternative  system for addressing gambling harm. RESULTS: The discourse of RG is inadequate  for preventing or minimising gambling harm. A public health-focused approach to  prevent and minimise gambling harm is likely to be far more effective but will be  opposed by vested interests. CONCLUSIONS: It is timely to consider abandoning the  discourse of RG. This discourse has been discredited because of its complicity  with vested interests and a lack of evidence to demonstrate its efficacy in  preventing or reducing harm. A public health response to the prevention of  gambling harm is feasible and practical and can and should be further developed  and implemented rapidly.

AU  - Johnstone, P.
AU  - Regan, M.
T2  - Public health
AB  - There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy  decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are  clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the  negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response  goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst  others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health  services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As  evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide  range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong  correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences  increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study  to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area.  This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue  identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to  be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels  require policy makers to adopt a 'health in all policy' approach and use the best  evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach  which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate  gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative  opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership  and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole  systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of  gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals,  their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling  gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in  strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to  partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public,  private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4)  raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and  involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience;  (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under  a 'whole council' approach.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - The prevalence of gambling harm among active duty military personnel is a largely unexplored topic. With different forms of social gambling often found within (or  in close proximity to) military bases around the world, understanding the extent  of gambling activities and consequent harms occurring within military contexts  warrants further attention. This review aims to identify, describe and  thematically synthesise published literature on gambling harm and related issues  among active duty military personnel. Scoping review methods were applied in  order to understand this relatively under-researched population and understand  appropriate avenues for future research. A systematic multi-database text word  search, incorporating search results from Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science,  PsychInfo, and the Journal Military Medicine, was conducted. A total of 11  sources met inclusion criteria, all originating from the United States of  America. The results suggest a distinct gap in the current international  literature on this topic. Despite gambling's long and colourful association with  defence downtime, research into gambling harm prevalence rates in relation to  what could be considered a high-risk group is limited. Findings reveal that  strategies to identify and address gambling harm within this population are  severely lacking from the published literature and non-existent outside North  America. Implications for understanding and addressing gambling harm among active  duty personnel and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling has quickly emerged as an important global public health issue. With new technologies used to develop high intensity gambling products and  promotions aimed at driving consumption, public health organisations and  researchers, community groups, and politicians have argued for a range of  regulatory and education measures aimed at reducing gambling harm. However, there  has been limited research seeking to understand community perceptions of the  harms associated with gambling products and environments, and the level of  community support for strategies designed to prevent and reduce gambling harm.  METHODS: An online study of 500 adolescents and adults (aged 16 and over) was  conducted with a representative sample (by age and gender) of individuals who  were current residents in the state of Victoria, Australia. Participants were  asked a range of questions about their own gambling behaviours, with the Problem  Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) used as a measure of problem gambling.  Participants were asked about their perceptions of harms associated with  electronic gambling machines (EGMs), sports betting, horse betting, and casino  gambling. They were also asked about the extent to which they agreed or disagreed  with gambling harm reduction strategies related to marketing and promotions,  restrictions on gambling products and venues, and public education campaigns.  Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and paired t tests,  with thematic analysis used to interpret qualitative responses to open-ended  questionnaire items. RESULTS: More than one third (n = 201, 40.2%) of  participants were at risk of experiencing some level of harm from gambling  (PGSI ≥ 1), with 83 participants (16.6%) recording scores that indicated problem  gambling (PGSI ≥ 8). One in five participants gambled on EGMs at least monthly  (n = 100, 20.0%). Those who gambled on sports did so frequently, with nearly 1 in  5 gambling on sport at least once a month (n = 87, 17.4%). Over half of the  sample rated casino gambling and EGMs as very harmful, while one third rated  these forms of gambling as extremely harmful. Over one third of the sample rated  horse and sports betting as very harmful, with one in five rating these products  as extremely harmful. There was strong agreement with the need to ban gambling  advertising during children's viewing hours, during sporting matches and at  sporting venues. The majority of participants agreed with reducing and  restricting EGMs, and providing more public education for both adults and  children about the negative consequences from gambling. CONCLUSIONS: The findings  suggest a strong perception in the Victorian community that gambling products are  harmful. While governments have been reluctant to implement a comprehensive  approach to reducing gambling harm, this study reveals significant community  support for a range of harm reduction and prevention measures associated with  gambling products. Public health practitioners can use this evidence in  advocating for a comprehensive public health approach to reducing the harms  associated with gambling promotions and products.

TI  - Prevalence of gambling-related harm provides evidence for the prevention paradox.
AU  - Browne, Matthew
AU  - Rockloff, Matthew J.
T2  - Journal of behavioral addictions
AB  - Background The prevention paradox (PP) describes a situation in which a greater number of cases of a disease-state come from low-risk members of a population,  because they are more prevalent than high-risk members. Past research has  provided only tangential and disputed evidence to support the application of the  PP to gambling-related harm. Aims To assess whether the PP applies to gambling,  the prevalence of a large set (72) of diverse harmful consequences from gambling  was examined across four risk categories for problem gambling, including no-risk,  low-risk, moderate-risk, and problem-gambling. Methods Respondents who had  gambled on non-lottery forms in the past 6 months completed an online survey  (N = 1,524, 49.4% male). The data were weighted to the known prevalence of  gambling problems in the Victorian community. Results The prevalence of gambling  harms, including severe harms, was generally higher in the combined categories of  lower risk categories compared to the high-risk problem-gambling category. There  were some notable exceptions, however, for some severe and rare harms.  Nevertheless, the majority of harms in the 72-item list, including serious harms  such as needing temporary accommodation, emergency welfare assistance,  experiencing separation or end of a relationship, loss of a job, needing to sell  personal items, and experiencing domestic violence from gambling, were more  commonly associated with lower risk gamblers. Conclusion Many significant harms  are concentrated outside the ranks of gamblers with a severe mental health  condition, which supports a public-health approach to ameliorating  gambling-related harm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women's participation in, and harm from gambling, is steadily increasing. There has been very limited research to investigate how gambling  behaviour, product preferences, and perceptions of gambling harm may vary across  subgroups of women. METHODS: This study surveyed a convenience sample of 509  women from Victoria and New South Wales, Australia. Women were asked a range of  questions about their socio-demographic characteristics and gambling behaviour.  Focusing on four gambling products in Australia-casino gambling, electronic  gambling machines (EGMs), horse betting, and sports betting-women were asked  about their frequency of participation, their product preferences, and  perceptions of product harms. The sample was segmented a priori according to age  and gambling risk status, and differences between groups were identified using  Chi-square tests and ANOVAs. Thematic analysis was used to interpret qualitative  data. RESULTS: Almost two thirds (n = 324, 63.7%) of women had engaged with one  of the four products in the previous 12 months. Compared to other age groups,  younger women aged 16-34 years exhibited a higher proportion of problem gambling,  gambled more frequently, and across more products. While EGMs were the product  gambled on most frequently by women overall, younger women were significantly  more likely to bet on sports and gamble at casinos relative to older women.  Qualitative data indicated that younger women engaged with gambling products as  part of a "night out", "with friends", due to their "ease of access" and  perceived "chance of winning big". There were significant differences in the  perceptions of the harms associated with horse and sports betting according to  age and gambling risk status, with younger women and gamblers perceiving these  products as less harmful. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that there are clear  differences in the gambling behaviour, product preferences, and perceptions of  product harms between subgroups of women. A gendered approach will enable public  health researchers and policymakers to ensure that the unique factors associated  with women's gambling are taken into consideration in a comprehensive public  health approach to reducing and preventing gambling harm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventing gambling harm has become a policy priority in many European countries. Adverse consequences related to problem gambling are well  known, but few studies have analyzed gambling-related harm in detail in general  population samples. We determined the extent and distribution of gambling harm in  Finland, as assessed by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and analyzed  gambling involvement, demographics and their association with various types of  harm. METHODS: A nationwide telephone survey was conducted among 4484 Finns aged  15-74 years in 2011-12. Gambling-related harms were based on the nine-item PGSI.  Gambling involvement was measured by gambling frequency and weekly average  gambling expenditure. Associations among harms, demographics and gambling  involvement were examined in logistic regression. RESULTS: During the previous  year, 13% of respondents experienced at least one gambling-related harm (males  18.1%, females 7.2%). The four commonest harms were 'chasing losses' (8.6%),  'escalating gambling to maintain excitement' (3.1%), 'betting more than could  afford to lose' (2.8%), and 'feeling guilty' (2.6%). The harm profile in  descending order was the same for both genders but differed in prevalence. Young  age (<25 years) was associated with increased likelihood of reporting harms. Both  monthly and weekly gambling and spending over €21 per week on gambling were  related to the harms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide support for the public  health approach to gambling: harms were reported even at low gambling  frequency-expenditure levels. In addition to the high-risk approach, adopting a  population-level approach to preventing gambling harm could shift the population  distribution of harm in a lower direction.

AU  - Browne, Matthew

AU  - Rockloff, Matthew J.
T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - It is common for jurisdictions tasked with minimising gambling-related harm to conduct problem gambling prevalence studies for the purpose of monitoring the  impact of gambling on the community. However, given that both public health  theory and empirical findings suggest that harms can occur without individuals  satisfying clinical criteria of addiction, there is a recognized conceptual  disconnect between the prevalence of clinical problem gamblers, and aggregate  harm to the community. Starting with an initial item pool of 72 specific harms  caused by problematic gambling, our aim was to develop a short gambling harms  scale (SGHS) to screen for the presence and degree of harm caused by gambling. An  Internet panel of 1524 individuals who had gambled in the last year completed a  72-item checklist, along with the Personal Wellbeing Index, the PGSI, and other  measures. We selected 10 items for the SGHS, with the goals of maximising  sensitivity and construct coverage. Psychometric analysis suggests very strong  reliability, homogeneity and unidimensionality. Non-zero responses on the SGHS  were associated with a large decrease in personal wellbeing, with wellbeing  decreasing linearly with the number of harms indicated. We conclude that weighted  SGHS scores can be aggregated at the population level to yield a sensitive and  valid measure of gambling harm.

AB  - Understanding why some people experience problems with gambling whilst others are able to restrict gambling to recreational levels is still largely unexplained.  One potential explanation is through salutogenesis, which is a health promotion  approach of understanding factors which move people towards health rather than  disease. An important aspect of salutogenesis is sense of coherence. Individuals  with stronger sense of coherence perceive their environment as comprehensible,  manageable and meaningful. The present study examined the relationship of  individuals' sense of coherence on their gambling behaviour and experience of  gambling related harm. This exploratory study utilised an archival dataset  (n = 1236) from an online, cross sectional survey of people who had experienced  negative consequences from gambling. In general, a stronger sense of coherence  was related to lower problem gambling severity. When gambling behaviour was  controlled for, sense of coherence was significantly related to the experience of  individual gambling harms. A strong sense of coherence can be seen as a  protective factor against problematic gambling behaviour, and subsequent gambling  related harms. These findings support the value of both primary and tertiary  prevention strategies that strengthen sense of coherence as a harm minimisation  strategy. The present study demonstrates the potential value of, and provides  clear direction for, considering sense of coherence in order to understand  gambling-related issues.

AB  - Problem gambling represents a significant public health problem, however, research on effective gambling harm-minimisation measures lags behind other  fields, including other addictive disorders. In recognition of the need for  consistency between international jurisdictions and the importance of basing  policy on empirical evidence, international conventions exist for policy on  alcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances. This paper examines the evidence of  best practice policies to provide recommendations for international guidelines  for harm-minimisation policy for gambling, including specific consideration of  the specific requirements for policies on Internet gambling. Evidence indicates  that many of the public health policies implemented for addictive substances can  be adapted to address gambling-related harms. Specifically, a minimum legal age  of at least 18 for gambling participation, licensing of gambling venues and  activities with responsible gambling and consumer protection strategies mandated,  and brief interventions should be available for those at-risk for and  experiencing gambling-related problems. However, there is mixed evidence on the  effectiveness of limits on opening hours and gambling venue density and increased  taxation to minimise harms. Given increases in trade globalisation and  particularly the global nature of Internet gambling, it is recommended that  jurisdictions take actions to harmonise gambling public health policies.

T2  - Journal of behavioral addictions
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Short Gambling Harm Screen (SGHS) is currently the most frequently applied dedicated measure of gambling-related harm (GRH), though  concerns relating to scale validity have been expressed. The current study aimed  to address criticisms that several SGHS items do not depict genuine harms that  may occur as a result of gambling, causing the scale to overestimate  harm. Specifically, we aimed to test convergence between the SGHS and its  constituent items with: (1) wellbeing, and (2) psychological distress. METHODS:  To test criterion validity of both the scale and the items, retrospective  analyses of survey data from 2,704 Australian adults (36% non-gamblers; 64%  gamblers) were conducted. Subjective wellbeing and psychological distress scores,  captured using the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) and the Kessler-6 Psychological  Distress Scale (K6), respectively, were used as external (non-gambling)  benchmarks. A total of 428 (16%) respondents scored at least 1 on the SGHS.  RESULTS: Monotonic decreases and increases, corresponding to poorer personal  wellbeing and higher psychological distress, were found with each additional SGHS  score increase. Gamblers endorsing a single SGHS item reported lower wellbeing  and higher psychological distress than both non-gamblers and gamblers who scored  zero on the SGHS. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results show that the SGHS is  a valid measure of GRH and contradict suggestions that low scores on the SGHS do  not indicate true harm. The SGHS represents a valid and innovative short  screening tool to measure GRH in population prevalence studies.

AB  - Background and aims Families play an important role in the evolution of gambling and are also adversely affected by the disordered gambling of any one of their  members. The aims of this study were to explore both the role families play in  gambling initiation, maintenance, and help-seeking, and the harm caused to  families by the gambling behavior using a qualitative approach. Methods Regular  older adult gamblers were included in the study. In-depth interviews were  conducted with 25 older adults to gain an understanding of gambling from their  perspective. Older adult gamblers described their lived experience of gambling  ranging from initiation to harm and attempts to cut down or limit gambling. Data  were analyzed using thematic network analysis. Results The mean age of the 25  participants was 66.2 years. The majority were male (n = 18), of Chinese  ethnicity (n = 16), had secondary education (n = 9), were married (n = 20), and  currently employed (n = 15). Four organizing themes related to the role of  families in initiation and maintenance of gambling, harm caused to family  members, and their role in help-seeking were identified. Discussion and  conclusions The study emphasizes the role of Asian families in both initiation  and maintenance of gambling. Hence, families must be involved in prevention and  outreach programs. Family members must be educated, so that they can encourage  help-seeking to ensure early treatment and recovery. There is a need for  interventional studies for reducing stress and improving coping among family  members.

AB  - Social casino games have achieved widespread popularity, and are accessed by more than 85 million people each day. Yet, why people play social casino games is  largely unknown. To address this gap, an inductive approach was taken to better  understand the motives for playing social casino games, as well as the motives  for transitioning from social casino gaming to gambling and vice versa. To this  end, 269 social casino gamers were asked to provide a ranked list of their  motives for playing social casino games. Additionally, we asked participants  their motivations for transitioning from gambling to social casino gaming  (n = 202) or vice versa (n = 67). A total of 795, 605, and 201 unique responses  describing motives for playing social casino games, transitioning from social  casino gaming to gambling, and transitioning from gambling to social casino  gaming, respectively, were analyzed using a thematic content analysis. The most  frequently endorsed motive for playing social casino games was for enhancement  (e.g., fun, challenge). Participants also noted playing to earn rewards,  including money, and for social reasons. Several motives linked social casino  game play to gambling. These included: to hone gambling-related 'skills', a  desire to transition to gambling to win real money, and as a gambling  harm-reduction strategy. Motives for playing social casino games did not differ  significantly between those who first gambled and then transitioned to social  casino gaming and vice versa, suggesting that once people begin playing social  casino games, they have similar motives for continued engagement. The present  study contributes to understanding the immense popularity of social casino games  and their links to gambling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling poses a global threat to public health due to its far-reaching impacts. Research has demonstrated a ripple effect of harmful  gambling on social network members and broader communities. While researchers  have documented extreme harms associated with an affected other, limited research  has qualitatively investigated how women describe their concerns about the  gambling of a social network member, and any subsequent negative impacts on their  own lives. METHODS: An online panel survey was conducted with women aged 18 years  and older, who gambled at least once in the last 12 months, and resided in the  Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales. This paper focused on the open  text responses of a subsection of the sample (n = 136) who reported being  negatively impacted by someone else's gambling. The study utilised reflexive  thematic analysis to interpret the data. RESULTS: Results indicated that women  were concerned about the gambling behaviours of a broad range of social network  members. Open text responses regarding the nature of these concerns mostly  related to individualised paradigms of gambling behaviour - including whether the  participant perceived their network member could afford to gamble, was being  responsible with their gambling, or were gambling too frequently. Participants  experienced a range of negative impacts including significant financial issues,  relationship difficulties, poorer emotional wellbeing as a result of worrying  about the gambler, and loss of trust. Some described the negative experiences  associated with growing up with a parent who gambled. CONCLUSION: The research  demonstrates the broad impacts of gambling on affected others. This study  enhances our understanding of how women are harmed by gambling and considers the  complexities of their experiences and relationships with the gambler. This  extends knowledge beyond quantitative descriptors of harm among affected others  and provides a critical reflection on the nuances of women's experiences with  gambling and gambling harm.

AB  - This paper investigates consumer perspectives of implemented and proposed gambling harm minimisation measures taken from a geographically stratified survey  of adult residents in Tasmania, Australia. Electronic gaming machine (EGM)  gamblers were asked whether current and proposed EGM harm minimisation measures  impacted on their actual or anticipated gambling expenditure and enjoyment.  Participants were analysed based on their endorsement of Problem Gambling  Severity Index criteria (scores 0-27), and categorised as non-problem gamblers  (score 0), low-risk gamblers (scores 1-2), and moderate/problem gamblers (scores  3+). Specifically, we wanted to identify harm minimisation policies that resulted  in the lowest decreases in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers and the highest  decreases in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers. Regarding current  policies, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was the ban  on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) in EGM venues (0.2 %) while the highest  decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was the reduction in  maximum lines (46.9 %). For the proposed measures, the lowest decrease in  enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was visible clocks (1.2 %) while the highest  decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was reducing cash  withdrawals (36.3 %). These results suggest universal EGM harm minimisation  measures can differentially target non-problem and moderate/problem gamblers.

AU  - Harris, Andrew
AU  - Parke, Adrian
AU  - Griffiths, Mark D.
T2  - International journal of mental health and addiction
AB  - Emotions typically exert powerful, enduring, and often predictable influences over decision-making. However, emotion-based decision-making is seen as a  mediator of impulsive and reckless gambling behaviour, where emotion may be seen  as the antithesis of controlled and rational decision-making, a proposition  supported by recent neuroimaging evidence. The present paper argues that the same  emotional mechanisms can be used to influence a gambler to cease gambling, by  focusing their emotional decision-making on positive external and personally  relevant factors, such as familial impact or longer term financial factors.  Emotionally stimulating messages may also have the advantage of capturing  attention above and beyond traditionally responsible gambling messaging. This is  important given the highly emotionally aroused states often experienced by both  gamblers and problem gamblers, where attentional activation thresholds for  external stimuli such as messages may be increased.

AU  - Marko, Sarah

T2  - BMC public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling has traditionally been conceptualised as an issue of addiction and personal responsibility. While there are now clear public health  models that recognise that gambling harm is caused by a range of socio-cultural,  environmental, commercial and political determinants, government and industry  messages about gambling are still largely personal responsibility focused. Given  the well-recognised issues associated with personal responsibility paradigms,  this study sought to understand how gamblers themselves conceptualised  responsibility for gambling harm. METHODS: A qualitatively led online panel  survey was conducted with 363 adult gamblers in New South Wales and Victoria,  Australia. Participants were asked to respond to what they thought were the  causes of gambling harm, and what could be done to prevent harm. A reflexive  thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Six common tropes were constructed from  gamblers' responses: (1) Gambling in moderation; (2) Personal responsibility for  rational behaviour; (3) Character flaws; (4) Personal responsibility to seek  help; (5) More education is needed; and (6) Governments are responsible for  action - but motivation and efficacy are questioned. Gamblers primarily  understood gambling harm as being a matter of personal responsibility, and  government responsibility was generally seen as limited to providing information  to facilitate informed gambling choices. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates  that gamblers' perceptions of gambling harm are similar to the personal  responsibility framings and tropes present in industry and government messaging  strategies. Refocusing public communication strategies away from 'responsible  gambling' messaging, and towards evidence-based approaches, will be an important  part of addressing the harms associated with gambling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The normalisation of gambling for young people has received considerable recent attention in the public health literature, particularly given  the proliferation of gambling marketing aligned with sport. A range of studies  and reports into the health and wellbeing of young people have recommended that  they should be consulted and engaged in developing public health policy and  prevention strategies. There are, however, very few opportunities for young  people to have a say about gambling issues, with little consideration of their  voices in public health recommendations related to gambling. This study aimed to  address this gap by documenting young people's perceptions about strategies that  could be used to counter the normalisation of gambling and prevent gambling  related harm. METHODS: This study took a critical qualitative inquiry approach,  which acknowledges the role of power and social injustice in health issues.  Qualitative interviews, using a constructivist approach, were conducted with 54  young people (11-17 years) in Australia. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to  interpret the data. RESULTS: Five overall strategies were constructed from the  data. 1) Reducing the accessibility and availability of gambling products; 2)  Changing gambling infrastructure to help reduce the risks associated with  gambling engagement; 3) Untangling the relationship between gambling and sport;  4) Restrictions on advertising; and 5) Counter-framing in commercial messages  about gambling. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that young people have  important insights and provide recommendations for addressing factors that may  contribute to the normalisation of gambling, including strategies to prevent  gambling related harm. Young people hold similar views to public health experts  about strategies aimed at de-normalising gambling in their local communities and  have strong opinions about the need for gambling to be removed from sport.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to identify possible regulatory, policy and program measures to address gambling harm to bingo players and their communities,  and in doing so extend existing public health approaches to gambling to better  include bingo. STUDY DESIGN: This was a qualitative case study of three  populations in Victoria, Australia where bingo was popular and structural  disadvantage common: Indigenous people in the state's east, Pacific people in the  north and older people on low or fixed incomes in the capital, Melbourne.  METHODS: Our study investigated experiences of bingo, including gambling harm and  recommendations for change. Data were generated through interviews with 53 bingo  players and 13 stakeholders as well as 12 participant observations of bingo  sessions. RESULTS: Five broad drivers of and influences on harm to bingo players  are identified: technological, regulatory and commercial changes eroding bingo's  protective factors; bingo being used to bolster other forms of gambling;  promotion of gambling interests over people's wellbeing; not recognising  experiences of different communities and; external structural influences such as  racialised poverty. We identify recommendations from bingo players and  stakeholders to address harm arising from bingo involving wagering. Based on  these recommendations and available evidence, we propose five sets of measures to  mitigate against gambling harm to bingo players and their communities, and so  extend existing public health approaches to gambling to better encompass bingo.  These sets of measures are: safeguarding bingo's protective features; delinking  bingo from the gambling eco-system; dismantling political protection of the  gambling industry; tailoring strategies for sub-populations and preventing  oppression and abuse. CONCLUSIONS: In the face of significant regulatory,  commercial and technological changes to bingo that risk increasing and  intensifying harm, a public health approach to bingo could help mitigate gambling  harm.

AB  - Individual differences in the risk of developing gambling-related harm play an important role in theoretical models and practical interventions. The present  study attempted comprehensive measurement and evaluation of 25 known risk factors  for gambling-related harm in order to determine which factors provided large and  unique explanatory power. We surveyed 1650 regular gamblers from an online panel,  screening in 1174 (466 male) who passed all checks of attention and response  consistency. We evaluated each risk factor based on bivariate correlations with  harms, then made separate multivariate evaluations of proximal (e.g., gambling  motivations) and distal (e.g., religiosity) risk factors. Almost all bivariate  correlations were significant, but most distal factors were not significant in  multivariate models. Trait impulsivity was the most important risk factor by a  large margin. Excessive consumption, less use of safe gambling practices, and  more fallacies were key proximal risks of harm. Many well-known correlates of  gambling harm (e.g., youth, lower educational attainment) do not show a direct  role in the development of gambling harm when controlling for other factors. The  results support theoretical models that emphasise early conditioning and  biological vulnerability (manifested through impulsivity). Since maladaptive  cognitive and behavioural schemas appear to be more important than motivations  (e.g., escape, excitement, ego), interventions may benefit by targeting these  proximal drivers of harm.

T2  - Journal of clinical medicine
AB  - Assessing the harmful consequences of gambling is an area of active investigation. One measure intended to capture gambling-related harm is the  10-item short gambling harm screen (SGHS). Although good psychometric properties  have been reported, it has been suggested that the screen's less severe probes  may not represent genuinely harmful consequences, but rather may reflect rational  opportunity costs. Consequently, it has been argued that the screen may lead to  overestimation of the extent of gambling-related harm in the population. The  current study sought to examine the psychometric performance of three less severe  suspect items in the SGHS. Associations between each of these items and a  specially constructed scale of relatively severe "unimpeachable" gambling harms  were calculated from archival data from 5551 Australian and New Zealand gamblers.  All three suspect items, both individually and upon aggregation, predicted  greater endorsement of "unimpeachable" harms, and indicated the presence of  gambling problems. Moreover, the SGHS as a whole is highly correlated with  "unimpeachable" gambling harms. Including suspect items in the SGHS was found to  improve predictions of low- and moderate-risk gambling status, but slightly  decreased predictions of severe gambling problems. The results are inconsistent  with the notion that SGHS harm probes capture either inconsequential consequences  or opportunity costs. They confirm prior findings that harm symptomatology is  unidimensional, and that the report of multiple more prevalent, but less severe,  harms serves as an effective indicator of the spectrum of experienced harm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bingo is often understood as a low-harm form of gambling. This view has been challenged by a growing body of literature identifying gambling harm to  bingo players in a range of countries. In this study, we aimed to identify which  conditions enabled, facilitated, intensified or mitigated gambling harm for bingo  players in three populations in Victoria in the context of corporate,  technological and regulatory changes. METHODS: Our qualitative study investigated  experiences of bingo-related gambling harm in three populations in Victoria,  Australia where bingo was popular and structural disadvantage common: Indigenous  people in the east, Pacific people in the state's north and older people on low  or fixed incomes in the capital. Data was generated through interviews with 53  bingo players and 13 stakeholders as well as 12 participant observations of bingo  sessions. RESULTS: We found that while bingo is overwhelmingly positive for many  players, a minority of bingo players and their families experience notable harm.  Harm was generated through traditional paper-based bingo games, new technologies  such as tablet-based bingo and by the widespread tactic of placing bingo sessions  in close proximity to harmful electronic gambling machines. Overall, the risk of  harm to bingo players appears to be escalating due to commercial, technological  and regulatory changes. CONCLUSIONS: These changes can be better managed by  regulators: reforms are needed to safeguard bingo's distinct character as a  lower-risk form of gambling at a time when it, and its players, are under threat.  Significantly, we found that harm to bingo players is intensified by factors  external to gambling such as racialised poverty and adverse life events.  Strategies that recognise these factors and grapple with gambling harm to bingo  players are needed.

TI  - Is gambling an emerging public health issue for Wales, UK?
AU  - Atherton, F.
AU  - Beynon, C.
T2  - Journal of public health (Oxford, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: Not all gambling exposes people to the same level of harm. Harm from gambling is found at the individual, social (family and friends) and community  levels. This includes financial hardship, psychological distress and  interpersonal conflict or relationship breakdown. The harm from gambling to wider  society includes fraud, theft, loss of productivity in the workforce and the cost  of treating this addiction. The annual estimated excess cost of gambling for  Wales is between £40 and £70 million. METHODS: This study reviews the existing  data sources and literature to ascertain if gambling is an emerging public health  issue in Wales. RESULTS: In Wales 61% of adults had gambled in the last year (1.5  million people). And 1.1% of the population (30 000 people) self-report as having  a problem with gambling using either the Problem Gambling Severity Index or the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of American Psychiatric Association tools. The  'ripple effect' of gambling harm can mean friends and family are highly impacted.  CONCLUSION: The existing data and literature together with the rapidly evolving  developments in infrastructure demonstrate that gambling is an emerging public  health issue in Wales. The impact on families and society warrants population  level interventions to tackle this public health issue.

AB  - Affected others impacted by someone else's gambling utilise numerous behaviour change strategies to minimise gambling-related harm but knowledge on what these  strategies are and how they are implemented is limited. This study aimed to  develop a comprehensive data-driven taxonomy of the types of self-help strategies  used by affected others, and to categorize these into high-level behaviour change  techniques (BCTs). Two taxonomies were developed using an inductive and deductive  approach which was applied to a dataset of online sources and organised into the  Rubicon model of action phases. These taxonomies were family-focused (how to  reduce the impact of gambling harm on families) and gambler-focused (how to  support the gambler in behaviour change). In total, 329 online sources containing  3536 different strategies were identified. The family-focused classification  contained 16 BCTs, and the most frequent were professional support, financial  management and planned consequences. The gambler-focused classification contained  11 BCTs, and the most frequent were feedback on behaviours, professional support  and financial management. The majority of family- and gambler-focused BCTs fell  under the actional phase of the Rubicon model. Grounded in lived experience, the  findings highlight the need for intervention and resource development that  includes a wide range of specific techniques that affected others can utilise.

AB  - While there is evidence for self-exclusion (SE) as an individual-level harm reduction intervention, its effects on reducing harm from gambling at the  population level remain unclear. Based on a review of national legal frameworks  and SE programs, including their utilization and enforcement in selected  high-income societies, the present analysis aims to explore the reach and  strengths of SE in the protection of gamblers in these jurisdictions. It places  particular emphasis on SE programs' potential to prevent and minimize gambling  harm at the population level. The overview examined SE in Finland, Germany,  Italy, Massachusetts (USA), Norway, Sweden, and Victoria (Australia). These  jurisdictions differ considerably in how gambling is regulated as well as in how  SE is implemented and enforced. The reach and extent of enforcement of SE  apparently vary with the polity's general policy balance between reducing  gambling problems and increasing gambling revenue. But in any case, though SE may  benefit individual gamblers and those around them, it does not appear to be  capable of significantly reducing gambling harm at the population level. To  render SE programs an effective measure that prevents gamblers and those linked  to them from financial, social, and psychological harm, utilization needs to be  substantially increased by reforming legal regulations and exclusion conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Examining risk-curves is important to understanding the degree to which indices of gambling consumption are associated with  gambling-related harm. Risk-curves have largely been described as J-shaped,  suggesting that at low levels of consumption harm remain constant but then  increase sharply at a certain threshold. Alternative methods in recent work,  however, have described risk-curves as linear and R-shaped, indicating that risk  of harm increases as consumption increases at all levels of consumption. The aim  of the current study is to estimate the shape of gambling risk-curves using  competing methods. DESIGN: Systematic comparison of gambling risk-curves using  categorical (via plots) and continuous (via bootstrapped regression analyses)  operationalizations of gambling consumption. Setting and participants Data were  2873 gamblers (1417 women) from the fourth Social and Economic Impact Study of  Gambling in Tasmania. MEASUREMENTS: Gambling-related harm was assessed using the  Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and Short Gambling Harm Screen (SGHS).  Gambling consumption was assessed as annual frequency, expenditure and  expenditure as a proportion of income. FINDINGS: Categorical gambling consumption  data plotted with equal magnitudes evidenced J-shaped risk-curves. When the  magnitude of gambling categories was re-scaled to the mid-points, risk-curves no  longer appeared J-shaped. Additionally, bootstrapped regression analyses using  the continuous gambling consumption data did not provide evidence for J-shaped  risk-curves. CONCLUSIONS: Gambling risk-curves in Tasmania appear not to be  J-shaped, but rather suggest that risk of gambling-related harm increases with  even small increases in gambling consumption.

TI  - Online Gambling Addiction: the Relationship Between Internet Gambling and Disordered Gambling.
AU  - Gainsbury, Sally M.
T2  - Current addiction reports
AB  - One of the most significant changes to the gambling environment in the past 15 years has been the increased availability of Internet gambling, including  mobile; Internet gambling is the fastest growing mode of gambling and is changing  the way that gamblers engage with this activity. Due to the high level of  accessibility, immersive interface and ease at which money can be spent, concerns  have been expressed that Internet gambling may increase rates of disordered  gambling. The current paper aimed to provide an overview of the research to date  as well as highlight new and interesting findings relevant to Internet gambling  addiction. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was conducted to  provide an overview of significant trends and developments in research that  relates to disordered Internet gambling. This paper presents research to inform a  greater understanding of adult participation in Internet gambling, features of  this interface that may impact problem severity, the relationship between  Internet gambling and related problems, as well as considering the role of the  wider spectrum of gambling behaviour and relevant individual factors that  moderate this relationship.

AU  - Delfabbro, Paul
AU  - King, Daniel L.
AU  - Georgiou, Neophytos
T2  - Journal of behavioral addictions
AB  - BACKGROUND: Engagement in responsible or 'positive play' strategies is known to be negatively associated with problem gambling, as indexed by measures such as  the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). Less is known about whether positive  play is associated with reduced harm or a greater ability to enjoy the  recreational benefits of gambling. AIMS: This study investigated the relationship  between positive play and gambling harm after controlling for PGSI scores and  whether positive play moderated the relationship between PGSI scores and harm. It  also examined whether positive play was related to perceived benefits associated  with gambling. METHODS: The study utilised an online panel sample of 554  respondents who completed a survey that included the PGSI, measures of gambling  harm drawn from Browne et al. (2016), and the newly developed Positive Play Scale  (Wood et al., 2019). The study involved predominantly monthly gamblers with  higher levels of gambling risk: 23% problem gamblers; 36% moderate risk; and 21%  low risk gamblers. RESULTS: The results indicated that positive play was  negatively associated with reduced gambling harm. The behavioural Positive Play  subscales relating to pre-commitment and honesty and control explained additional  variation in harm after controlling for PGSI scores. Higher levels of positive  play also moderated and reduced the relationship between the PGSI and gambling  harm. Perceived benefits were, unexpectedly, found to be higher in problem  gamblers and negatively related to positive play. CONCLUSION: Behavioural  measures of positive play appear to be useful moderating factors in understanding  the relationship between problem gambling and harm. Higher-risk gamblers appear  to experience both greater costs as well as benefits from gambling, which likely  reflects a stronger personal need to engage in the activity.

AB  - This study derived a set of Australian low-risk gambling limits and explored the relative and absolute risk associated with exceeding these limits. Secondary  analysis of population-representative Tasmanian and Australian Capital Territory  (ACT) cross-sectional (11,597 respondents) and longitudinal studies (2027  respondents) was conducted. Balancing sensitivity and specificity, the limits  were: gambling frequency of 20-30 times per year; gambling expenditure of AUD  $380-$615 per year (USD $240-$388 per year); gambling expenditure comprising  0.83-1.68% of gross personal income; and two types of gambling activities per  year. All limits, except number of activities, predicted subsequent harm, with  limits related to gambling expenditure consistently the best-performing.  Exceeding the limits generally conferred a higher degree of relative and absolute  risk, with gamblers exceeding the limits being 3-20 times more likely to  experience harm than those who do not, and having a 5-17% risk of experiencing  harm. Only 7-12% of gamblers exceeding the limits actually experienced harm.  Gambling consumption lower than the limits also conferred a considerable amount  of harm. Using a relative risk method, this study derived similar limits from  disparate Australian states and territories. These limits can serve as working  guidelines for the consideration of researchers, clinicians, and policy makers,  but need to be subject to further rigorous empirical investigation.

AB  - Gambling problems are increasingly understood as a health-related condition, with harms from excessive time and money expenditure contributing to significant  population morbidity. In many countries, the prevalence of gambling problems is  known with some precision. However, the true severity of gambling problems in  terms of their impact on health and wellbeing is the subject of ongoing debate.  We firstly review recent research that has attempted to estimate harm from  gambling, including studies that estimate disability weights using direct  elicitation. Limitations of prior approaches are discussed, most notably  potential inflation due to non-independent comorbidity with other substance use  and mental health conditions, and potential biases in the subjective attribution  of morbidity to gambling. An alternative indirect elicitation approach is  outlined, and a conceptual framework for its application to gambling is provided.  Significant risk factors for propensity to develop gambling problems are  enumerated, and relative risks for comorbidities are calculated from recent  meta-analyses and reviews. Indirect elicitation provides a promising alternative  framework for assessing the causal link between gambling problems and morbidity.  This approach requires implementation of propensity score matching to estimate  the counterfactual, and demands high quality information of risk factors and  comorbid conditions, in order to estimate the unique contribution of gambling  problems. Gambling harm is best understood as a decrement to health utility.  However, achieving consensus on the severity of gambling problems requires  triangulation of results from multiple methodologies. Indirect elicitation with  propensity score matching and accounting for comorbidities would provide an  important step towards full integration of gambling within a public health  paradigm.

AU  - Nikkinen, Janne
AU  - Marionneau, Virve
T2  - Nordisk alkohol- & narkotikatidskrift : NAT
AB  - AIMS: This article assesses the efficiency of six Nordic state-controlled gambling companies in raising revenue for their host societies, and the terms  under which they operate. Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have established  gambling monopolies on the grounds that they help to prevent fraud and money  laundering, and channel proceeds to their host societies. Within the last decade,  Denmark (2012) and Sweden (2019) have opened substantial parts of their gambling  markets to competition, whereas Finland and Norway continue to uphold monopolies.  DESIGN: The analysis is based on publicly disclosed income statements and  financial reporting concerning Nordic gambling operators for the year 2017. We  calculated how much they contribute to societies, what are the costs, and how  these figures compare among the companies. RESULTS: We found that Veikkaus raises  the highest amounts of surplus to society both in absolute terms and in relative  numbers, and that, overall, the companies vary in efficiency. We discuss the  reasons for these differences, focusing on their respective product portfolios,  institutional frameworks and competitive market positions. CONCLUSIONS: The  results problematise the measurement of efficiency in gambling companies in  monetary terms. Efficiency depends on high total consumption with little regard  to the principles of responsible gambling and the prevention of gambling  problems. Nordic countries have a strong commitment to the protection of health,  but in the case of gambling, protecting the monopoly seems to outweigh harm  prevention.

AU  - Livingstone, Charles
T2  - Drug and alcohol review
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Gambling research is characterised by widespread gambling industry involvement. It is likely (as with alcohol and tobacco industry  influence) that this will delay or divert effective harm prevention or  minimisation measures. Gambling harms are known to be significant and widespread.  Effective action to reduce these harms requires concomitant efforts to eliminate  industry influence. DESIGN AND METHODS: Gambling industry influence and activity  in three research forums is described. The influence of tobacco and alcohol  industry involvement in research directions and outcomes is discussed. Aspects of  the discursive elements of industry funded and/or directed research outputs are  analysed in the context of industry-friendly discourse and its effects. Industry  activity and participation at representative research forums is outlined.  RESULTS: The examples and background provided demonstrate that specific material  and discursive effects of gambling industry involvement can be discerned in the  gambling literature. The consequences of this for the gambling evidence base  around harm prevention and minimisation are presented. DISCUSSION AND  CONCLUSIONS: Industry influence operates at multiple levels within the gambling  research field. There is increasing awareness of this, and of the effects it may  have on the development and deployment of effective harm prevention and  minimisation efforts. Key reforms are proposed: (i) the elimination of industry  participation and sponsorship of gambling research associations and forums; and  (ii) the establishment where necessary of new research forums and international  scholarly associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Harmful gambling is a public health issue that affects not only adults but also children. With the development of a range of new gambling  products, and the marketing for these products, children are potentially exposed  to gambling more than ever before. While there have been many calls to develop  strategies which protect children from harmful gambling products, very little is  known about the factors that may influence children's attitudes towards these  products. This study aimed to explore children's gambling attitudes and  consumption intentions and the range of consumer socialisation factors that may  influence these attitudes and behaviours. METHODS: Children aged 8 to 16 years  old (n = 48) were interviewed in Melbourne, Australia. A semi-structured  interview format included activities with children and open-ended questions. We  explored children's perceptions of the popularity of different gambling products,  their current engagement with gambling, and their future gambling consumption  intentions. We used thematic analysis to explore children's narratives with a  focus on the range of socialising factors that may shape children's gambling  attitudes and perceptions. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the data.  First, children's perceptions of the popularity of different products were shaped  by what they had seen or heard about these products, whether through family  activities, the media (and in particular marketing) of gambling products, and/or  the alignment of gambling products with sport. Second, children's gambling  behaviours were influenced by family members and culturally valued events. Third,  many children indicated consumption intentions towards sports betting. This was  due to four key factors: (1) the alignment of gambling with culturally valued  activities; (2) their perceived knowledge about sport; (3) the marketing and  advertising of gambling products (and in particular sports betting); and (4) the  influence of friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that there is  a range of socialisation factors, particularly family and the media  (predominantly via marketing), which may be positively shaping children's  gambling attitudes, behaviours and consumption intentions. There is a need for  governments to develop effective policies and regulations to reduce children's  exposure to gambling products and ensure they are protected from the harms  associated with gambling.

AU  - McCarthy, Simone

T2  - Social science & medicine (1982)
AB  - Older women are vulnerable to the risks associated with some forms of gambling. While research has examined how individuals functionally interact with gambling  products, very limited research has investigated how individuals conceptualise  and interpret the risks associated with these products. Theorists suggest that  risk-taking is not based on a lack of knowledge but on the different ways people  make sense of their lives. As such, this study aimed to understand the factors  that may influence how older women who gamble on electronic gambling machines  (EGMs) perceive the risks associated with gambling on these products. It examined  how risk perceptions interacted with a range of complex social factors in women's  everyday lives to influence their risk behaviours. Semi-structured interviews  were conducted with 20 Australian women aged 55 and over who had been negatively  impacted by EGM gambling. This study found that older women's risk perceptions of  gambling were shaped by their early recreational experiences with gambling,  rather than their current regular and harmful gambling behaviours. Risk  perceptions of EGMs were often downplayed or ignored as women sought to maintain  valued social identities within the venues. Women went through a process of risk  negotiation whereby the benefits of this social interaction outweighed the  potential harms associated with the machines. This also led them to deflect or  ignore risk minimisation messaging which was completely focused on individual  behaviours. This study signals the importance of moving away from individualised  responsible gambling messages towards risk information about gambling products.  This research also provides evidence of the need for regulation addressing the  design features of EGMs that ultimately may make products safer and protect the  most vulnerable from gambling harm.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The gambling industry in Africa has seen substantial growth and evolution over recent years with a growing body of literature describing  these shifts. Here, we provide a narrative synthesis of the extant literature on  the origins, trends and consequences of the expansion and intensification of the  commercial gambling industry in sub-Saharan Africa with a reference for future  research on gambling as a growing public health concern. RECENT FINDINGS: The  historical shift and permeation of gambling in sub-Saharan Africa is diverse with  evidence of certain countries following a neo-colonial logic. Advances in  technology have made gambling more accessible and created new markets in Africa.  A key motive driving gambling on the continent is a lack of stable employment.  While the intensification and growth of Africa's gambling industry has brought  economic benefits to some African investors and individuals, this has been  accompanied by a range of gambling harms. Legislation and policies designed to  better regulate the gambling industry and redress these harms are needed. In this  context, a small number of services and campaigns designed to mitigate gambling  harms demonstrate promise, but more research is needed in this area. SUMMARY: The  gambling industry in sub-Saharan Africa has undergone a dramatic transformation.  While it is true that the growth of the African gambling industry has provided an  additional revenue stream to governments, it is also necessary to acknowledge the  concurrent rise in gambling addiction and the health-related and social harms  that it elicits. As such, designing effective regulatory measures and policy  interventions that can reduce the public health burden of gambling harms is  vital. However, these interventions need to take in to account the significance  of cultural differences that exist among countries on the continent.

AB  - The gambling industry has grown into a global business in the 21st century. This has created the need for a new emphasis on problem prevention. This article  highlights the core themes of the book Setting Limits: Gambling, Science and  Public Policy, taking a broad view of the consequences of gambling for society as  a burden on health, well-being and equality. The book covers the extent of  gambling and gambling-related problems in different societies and presents a  critical review of research on industry practices, policy objectives and  preventive approaches, including services to people suffering from gambling and  its consequences. It discusses the developments in game characteristics and  gambling environments and provides evidence on how regulation can affect those.  Effective measures to minimize gambling harm exist and many are well supported by  scientific evidence. They include restrictions on general availability as well as  selective measures to prevent gamblers from overspending. The revenue generated  from gambling for the industry, governments, and providers of public services  funded from gambling returns presents an obstacle to developing policies to  implement harm-reduction measures. A public interest approach must weigh these  interests against the suffering and losses of the victims of gambling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Britain, unprecedented restrictions on daily life associated with the Covid-19 pandemic included the suspension of professional sports events  during the initial 'lockdown'. This provides opportunities to observe changes in  sports bettors' behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and  assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. METHODS: In  July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet  regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n = 3866). Bi-variate  analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial  lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between  problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with  changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during  Britain's initial 'lockdown' (March-June 2020). RESULTS: 29.8% of male sports  bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the  initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new  form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem  gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown  (OR = 2.50 [95% CI 1.38-4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were  higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during  lockdown (OR = 4.21 [1.99-8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons.  Poorer wellbeing was associated with problem gambling for men and MRPG for women.  CONCLUSIONS: Those changing gambling behaviours during the initial Covid-19  lockdown (e.g. increasing gambling frequency or starting a new gambling activity)  are potentially vulnerable to gambling harms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe survey findings which measure broader gambling harms and provide benchmark data to evaluate an awareness and education program to minimise  harm; part of NZ's public health approach to problem gambling. To assess whether  previously reported ethnic and socio-economic disparities are evident when  researching broader gambling harms. METHODS: An in-home, nationwide survey  captured data from a multi-stage, random probability sample of 1,774 adults and  199 15-17-year-olds. Oversampling Māori (NZ's indigenous people), Pacific and  Asian peoples, and people in areas of deprivation, allowed analysis by ethnicity  and socio-economic status. RESULTS: Data show high participation levels; around 8  out of 10 people took part in at least one gambling activity in the previous 12  months. Type and frequency of activities was used to define four groups:  infrequent gamblers (60.9%); frequent, non-continuous gamblers (17.6%); frequent,  continuous gamblers (4%); and non-gamblers (17.5%). Self-reported knowledge of  the signs of gambling harm was high. Arguments about gambling and people going  without/unpaid bills provided two indicators of broader gambling harm. Around  one-sixth of New Zealanders experienced each of these harms. Impacts were  greatest for low-income groups, Māori, and Pacific peoples. CONCLUSIONS: The  proportion of New Zealander's experiencing broader gambling harms is much higher  than the prevalence for problem gambling. Consistent with other research, results  show the flow-on impacts of problem gambling - on family, friends and  communities. IMPLICATIONS: Measures can be developed to benchmark the wider harms  of gambling and evaluate public health programs addressing harm at population and  sub-population levels.

AB  - Advances in technology and increased usage of electronic mobile devices over the past decade have changed the way gamblers engage with online gambling. The  convenience of mobile electronic devices is understood to be a major contributor  to the increase of online gambling, which in turn has been implicated in the  growth of sports betting. Emerging evidence suggests several sources of  differentiation between mobile and other online gambling, which have important  psychological implications. Given the inherent differences, we cannot conclude  that evidence for the effectiveness of treatment for non-smartphone problem  gambling (PG) automatically translates to online smartphone sports betting PG.  The aim of this study, therefore, was to describe the feasibility and preliminary  effectiveness of cue exposure therapy (CET) to treat individuals presenting to a  community-based PG therapy service with an online smartphone sports betting  addiction, using a case series design. Six men (21-42 years old) received up to  10 weekly 60-min manualised CET sessions. Outcome measures were gambling harm,  gambling urge, gambling cognitions, psychological distress, and functional  impairment. All six participants completed a course of CET averaging 8.33  sessions (SD = 1.75) and reported improvement across each of the outcome  measures. Psychological distress scores had reduced to the non-clinical range for  all six participants and five participants scored below the cut offs for PG and  functional impairment at 1 month follow up. The findings provide preliminary  proof of concept evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of CET for online  smartphone sports betting addiction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Gambling Act 2003 mandated a public health strategy for preventing and minimising gambling harm in New Zealand. Aware Communities and  Supportive Communities are two public health programmes subsequently implemented  nationwide. These programmes differed from common health promotion initiatives  such as media or education campaigns as they were community-action based  (requiring community involvement in programme planning and delivery). We carried  out a process evaluation to determine their implementation effectiveness and  inform improvement and future programme planning. METHODS: Our qualitative  dominant mixed methods design comprised analysis of over a hundred implementer  progress reports (submitted July 2010 - June 2013), a staff survey and a staff  focus group interview. RESULTS: The programmes demonstrated capacity to not only  achieve expected outcomes (e.g. enhanced community awareness about harmful  gambling), but also to enhance social sustainability at the community level (e.g.  established trustful relationships) and achieve some programme sustainability  (e.g. community ownership over ongoing programme delivery). CONCLUSIONS: The  evaluation noted the potential for a sustainable gambling harm-minimisation  model. Community-action based harm-minimisation programmes offer programme  sustainability potential which in turn offers funding cost-effectiveness when  there are continual public health outcomes beyond initial funding. Although  resource intensive, the community-action based approach enables culturally  appropriate public health programmes suitable for societies where specific ethnic  groups have higher gambling risk. Recognition of such harm-minimisation  programmes' contribution to social sustainability is important considering the  potential for broader public health outcomes (e.g. better life quality, lesser  social problems) within socially sustainable societies.

AB  - Objective: Academics, gambling regulators, and the gambling industry increasingly espouse a shared responsibility view of preventing gambling harm, considering  individual gamblers and external stakeholders (e.g., gambling industry employees,  government regulators, and public health workers) to be jointly responsible for  this task. This study is the third in a series exploring gamblers' beliefs about  responsibility for preventing gambling harm. Method: A sample of 4,336  subscribers to MGM Resorts International (MGM)'s loyalty card program as of  January 2020 completed a web-based survey. Results: We observed that 58.1% of  participants only held individual gamblers responsible for helping prevent  gambling harm. However, two factors increased the likelihood of holding a shared  responsibility viewpoint and assigning responsibility to casinos for reducing  gambling harm: (a) scoring positive on the Brief Biosocial Gambling Screen (BBGS)  or an Expanded Problem Gambling Screen (EPGS) and (b) being aware of GameSense,  an onsite responsible gambling education program. Those who screened positive on  the BBGS or EPGS also were more likely than their counterparts to deny personal  responsibility for minimizing gambling harm to individual gamblers; that is, they  were more likely to hold a purely external responsibility viewpoint. A  meta-analytic year-over-year comparison revealed that compared to being aware of  GameSense, screening positive for problem gambling was more strongly associated  with assigning responsibility to casinos for minimizing gambling harm.  Conclusions: We discuss these findings in the context of self-determination  theory and suggest implications for health promotion and best practices for  message design in responsible gambling programs.

AB  - This study investigates the prevalence of being an affected other (AO) of a person with problem gambling; and the associations between being an AO and  socio-demographics, gambling behaviour, health-related correlates and the amount  and type of gambling-related harm (GRH) for the AOs. Furthermore, perspectives of  the affected family members (AFMs) and close friends (ACFs) were acknowledged.  Cross-sectional, random sample Finnish Gambling population-based survey data  (n = 3,994) were collected in 2019. AOs were identified using a question with  seven options. Information on GRH was sought using structured questions.  One-fifth (21.2 %) of all respondents were AOs, men being typically ACFs and  women being more often AFMs. Being an AO was associated with younger age,  gambling participation, having a gambling problem of their own and health  barriers such as psychological distress. AFMs experienced GRH more often and the  amount of different GRHs was greater among the AFMs. The most common harm  category experienced by the AOs was emotional harm. Both health-related issues  and the amount of GRHs was largest among the AFMs. A substantial amount of GRH  was also experienced by ACFs. The study suggests that support could be tailored  for AFMs and ACFs, based on their AO status and individual needs. A public health  approach for effective harm prevention in primary, secondary and tertiary levels  are discussed.

AB  - Gambling is recognized as a significant public health problem. However, there is little research exploring community attitudes towards gambling and the  development of advocacy initiatives. Engaging adults and young people in advocacy  efforts is recognized as being beneficial to the successful implementation of  harm prevention and reduction strategies. This study explored the attitudes of  young people and their parents towards the alignment of gambling with sport, and  the strategies they perceive could be used to prevent and reduce gambling related  harm. Using a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach, 30 family groups from  Melbourne, Australia participated in semi-structured interviews. Parents and  young people were asked about gambling and its promotion, alignment with sporting  codes, the potential impact on young people and strategies that may prevent or  reduce gambling harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken to interpret the data. The  sample comprised 29 parents, one grandparent and 48 young people. Themes emerging  from the data related to the use of imagery and appeal strategies in  advertisements, the normalization of betting in advertisements and the alignment  of betting with sport. Parents and young people also identified a number of  potential gambling harm prevention and reduction initiatives. Parents and young  people were able to describe a range of strategies used by gambling companies to  promote their products, understand the potential impact of these strategies, and  recommend strategies to reduce harm. Given this level of understanding there is  clearly an opportunity to engage young people and stakeholders in advocacy  initiatives aimed at reducing and preventing gambling harm.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Legacy gambling harms are negative consequences of gambling that extend past periods of low risk, moderate risk and problem gambling.  Gambling harm is typically measured within a 12-month timeframe and is often  restricted to examining harm amongst active gamblers. The present research aimed  to explore whether people experienced gambling harms 12 months or more after the  resolution of at-risk or problem gambling, and how long these legacy harms  lasted. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in New Zealand with past and  current gamblers and concerned significant others (CSOs) of gamblers, N = 1,240  (50.8% female), that asked them about both past and current gambling harms.  RESULTS: A majority of both gamblers and CSOs of gamblers indicated that they  still suffered from gambling harm even after most of their behavioural issues  with gambling had been resolved, 12+ months ago. Legacy gambling harms reduced  over time, with harms diminishing most quickly in the early years, and having an  average half-life of 4 years. Harms involving community-relationships, church  involvement, and domestic and other violence resolved more quickly than others.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Legacy harms are common among ex-problem gamblers and  should be considered in any full accounting of the impacts of gambling.  CONCLUSION: Understanding the time course and persistence of legacy harms from  gambling can provide gamblers, treatment professionals and public health experts  with insights into how to address gambling's long-term consequences.

T2  - Addictive behaviors
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the data on racial/ethnic associations with gambling disorder are limited, studies suggest that ethnicity may have associations with  both symptom severity and psychosocial impairment linked to gambling disorder.  Based on the current literature, we hypothesized that there would be a difference  in gambling symptom severity, and co-occurring disorders, as a function of  racial-ethnic group. METHODS: 475 adults (mean age = 47.6 (±11.6) years; 54.3 %  females) with gambling disorder who had participated in clinical trials on  pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy were included. Participants were assessed for  gambling severity, comorbidities, health issues, quality of life and psychosocial  functioning. Participants who self-identified as Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic  (BAME) were compared to those who self-identified as white Caucasian (non-BAME).  Significance was defined as p < 0.01. RESULTS: The BAME group had significantly  earlier age of first gambling. The two groups did not differ significantly in  terms of age when gambling first became problematic, disability, current gambling  disorder symptom severity, previous suicide attempt(s), quality of life, percent  of salary in past year lost to gambling, or likelihood of having received  treatment for gambling disorder in the past, nor in terms of having used Gamblers  Anonymous. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that having gambling disorder and being  from a minority racial-ethnic group was associated with significantly earlier age  at first gambling, in clinical trial settings. Future work should further examine  differences in the clinical features of gambling disorder in different minority  groups in larger sample sizes, ideally also longitudinally, across a range of  settings. Identification of the reasons/mechanisms for differences in earlier age  of first gambling may lead to new public health and treatment targets to minimize  gambling harms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In New Zealand, Pacific people continue to be more at risk of gambling harm than the general population, despite increasing public health  efforts and treatment service provisions introduced to address this social and  health issue. In looking at why this is so, our first concern was to ask why the  delivery of the prevailing gambling-focussed programmes was not influencing  Pacific gambling behaviours. In seeking to answer this question, it was important  to explore ethnic-Pacific-specific factors of gambling harm prevention and  reduction. METHODS: The research design was interpretivist/constructivist and  phenomenological, applied through the lens of a Tongan worldview. Participants  comprised Tongan male elders and youth. Recruitment of participants was through  snowball sampling from churches and kava-drinking circles. A total of 28 elders  and 18 youth participated through focus group talanoa and individual talanoa.  This study employed descriptive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants were not  aware of any policy document or problem-gambling preventative programmes. Four  key themes were raised, which include raising the awareness of existing gambling  harm treatment providers, the church influence in addressing gambling harm,  community-based strategies, and cultural-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This  study proposes several recommendations such as more awareness of gambling harm  providers in community, increasing cultural spaces and church engagements, and  calls for further research in addressing the prevention and reduction of gambling  harm amongst the Tongan community in New Zealand.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and the Short Gambling Harms Screen (SGHS) purport to identify individuals harmed by gambling.  However, there is dispute as to how much individuals are harmed, conditional on  their scores from these instruments. We used an experienced utility framework to  estimate the magnitude of implied impacts on health and wellbeing. METHODS: We  measured health utility using the Short Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D), and used this  as a benchmark. All 2603 cases were propensity score weighted, to balance the  affected group (i.e., SGHS 1+ or PGSI 1+ vs 0) with a reference group of gamblers  with respect to risk factors for gambling harm. Weighted regression models  estimated decrements to health utility scores attributable to gambling, whilst  controlling for key comorbidities. RESULTS: We found significant attributable  decrements to health utility for all non-zero SGHS scores, as well as  moderate-risk and problem gamblers, but not for PGSI low-risk gamblers. Applying  these coefficients to population data, we find a similar total burden for both  instruments, although the SGHS more specifically identified the subpopulation of  harmed individuals. For both screens, outcomes on the SF-6D implies that about  two-thirds of the 'burden of harm' is attributable to gamblers outside of the  most severe categories. CONCLUSIONS: Gambling screens have hitherto provided  nominal category membership, it has been unclear whether moderate or 'at-risk'  scores imply meaningful impact, and accordingly, population surveys have  typically focused on problem gambling prevalence. These results quantify the  health utility decrement for each category, allowing for tracking of the  aggregate population impact based on all affected gamblers.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Internet delivered interventions are accessible and easy to access and can be used to deliver brief interventions. These interventions can be tailored  according to individual need for the prevention and minimisation of gambling harm  or early intervention for those that are displaying some signs of problems. The  objective of this review was to summarise the existing literature on the  effectiveness of prevention, harm reduction and early intervention programs when  delivered online. A systematic review was conducted for peer-reviewed studies  that evaluated internet delivered interventions for the prevention, harm  reduction or early intervention for gambling problems. Four electronic databases  were consulted in the past 20 years (2000-2020) resulting in a total of 15  included studies. Across identified studies just one study provided prevention  with 7 harm reduction and 7 early interventions. The quality of the literature  was variable with just 8 randomised controlled trials with the remainder matched  controls or longitudinal cohort studies. The target group was predominantly  gamblers accessing betting and casino websites (n = 8). Studies administered four  types of interventions which included personalised and normative feedback, limit  setting, self-directed cognitive and behavioural therapy and self-exclusion.  These were delivered via customer gaming accounts, email, and self-learning  packages. The available literature shows promise in the effectiveness of internet  delivered interventions. However, the limited number of studies included in this  review highlight significant lost opportunities to leverage technology in the  prevention and reduction of gambling harm.

AU  - Hubert, Pedro

T2  - International journal of mental health and addiction
AB  - Over the past decade, gambling has become a very popular activity across Europe including the growth of Internet gambling. Portugal is one of the few European  countries where little research has been carried out. Given the lack of studies,  a Portuguese sample (N = 1,599) was surveyed concerning their online and offline  gambling habits. More specifically, the aim of this study was to identify and  compare from the total sample, online pathological gamblers (PGON) (n = 171) and  offline pathological gamblers' (PGOF) (n = 171) characteristics, and eventual  risk factors for the development of problem gambling. Results demonstrated that  PGON had different profiles compared to PGOF, although there were also  similarities. Situational characteristics were much more significant for PGON  than PGOF (e.g., availability, accessibility, affordability), but PGOF had higher  scores than PGON on factors concerning individual characteristics (e.g.,  intensity of feelings while gambling, depression, suicidal ideation, etc.).  Findings also showed differences concerning attitudes toward responsible gambling  measures. The fact that situational characteristics are more attractive to online  gamblers confirms differences between PGON and PGOF and suggests that this  preferred attractiveness may enhance problem gambling potential. Further research  is needed to better understand the interaction between Internet situational  characteristics and the individual characteristics of gamblers, as well as the  profile of the growing population of gamblers that uses both online and offline  modes to gamble.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gambling-related harm to concerned significant others (CSOs) is an important public health issue since it reduces CSOs' health and wellbeing  in numerous life domains. This study aimed to 1) estimate the first national  prevalence of CSOs harmed by gambling in Australia; 2) identify the  characteristics of CSOs most at risk of harm from another person's gambling; 3)  compare the types and number of harms experienced by CSOs based on their  relationship to the person who gambles; and 4) compare the number of harms  experienced by CSOs by self-identified gender. METHODS: Based on a national CATI  survey weighted to population norms, 11,560 respondents reported whether they had  been personally and negatively affected by another person's gambling in the past  12 months; and if so, answered detailed questions about the harms experienced  from the person's gambling who had harmed them the most. RESULTS: Past-year  prevalence of gambling-related harm to adult Australian CSOs was (6.0%; 95% CI  5.6%-6.5%). CSOs most commonly reported emotional harms, followed by  relationship, financial, health and vocational harms, respectively. Former  partners reported the most harm, followed by current partners, other family  members and non-family members, respectively. Female CSOs were more likely to  report more harm and being harmed by a partner or other family member, and male  CSOs from a non-family member. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide  new insights into the wider societal burden of gambling and inform measures aimed  at reducing harm to CSOs from gambling and supporting them to seek help.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to understand the factors that may influence how and why people with intellectual disability may engage in gambling. Method: Nineteen  people with intellectual disability were recruited from a disability advocacy  organization and participated in face to face, semi-structured qualitative  interviews. Open ended questions were used to explore participants' gambling  participation, recall of, and attitudes toward, different gambling products,  understanding of gambling harm, and awareness of responsible gambling messages.  Results: All participants could remember gambling in their lifetime and some  participants had recently engaged in gambling. Many participants were aware of  different gambling products, and a few participants could describe in detail the  technical aspects of electronic gambling machines. Most participants did not  specifically recall seeing gambling harm minimization messages, however some  described engaging in individual responsibility measures, such as limits and  control, as they perceived this reduced the risks of experiencing harm.  Conclusions: People with intellectual disability are engaging with gambling  products in a similar way to the general community. Therefore, it is important to  understand the different pathways that may lead people with intellectual  disability to initiate and continue gambling and to ensure that they are aware of  and protected from the potential risk. Implications for Public Health: Policy  makers and practitioners should seek to understand and implement a range of  strategies to reduce and prevent the harms associated with particular gambling  products and environments for this population sub-group.

AB  - Aims This study explores the prevalence of being a past-year affected other (AO) of a problem gambler by gender. The aims were to study the amount and type of  gambling-related harms (GRHs) for subgroups of AOs and to distinguish GRH  profiles for AO subgroups. Methods A total of 7186 adults aged 18 years and over  participated in the Gambling Harms Survey evaluating year 2016. The data were  analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Results Of  all respondents, 12.9% were defined as past-year AOs (women 13.7%; men 12.1%).  The proportion of affected non-family members (ANFs) was 8.4%, and 5.6% were  affected family members (AFMs). AFMs were usually women, and ANFs were usually  men. Emotional, relationship, and financial harms were the most common types of  harm. The odds of experiencing financial harm were highest for the 18- to  34-year-olds (OR 1.82) and for those whose partner/ex-partner had a gambling  problem (OR 3.91). Having a parent/step-parent (OR 1.93) and child/stepchild (OR  3.64) increased the odds of experiencing emotional harm, whereas male gender (OR  0.50) and being an ANF (OR 0.58) decreased emotional harm. Relationship harm was  evident for partners/ex-partners (OR 1.97-5.07). Conclusions GRH profiles for AO  subgroups varied, which emphasizes the need for effective harm minimization  strategies for those in need.

T2  - Journal of behavioral addictions
AB  - Objectives To examine whether the "prevention paradox" applies to British individuals in relation to gambling-related harm. Methods Data were derived from  7,756 individuals participating in the British Gambling Prevalence Survey 2010, a  comprehensive interview-based survey conducted in Great Britain between November  2009 and May 2010. Gambling-related harm was assessed using an adapted version of  the DSM-IV Pathological Gambling criteria. The previous year's prevalence of  problem gamblers was examined using the Problem Gambling Severity Index. Gambling  involvement was measured by gambling frequency and gambling participation  (gambling volume as expressed by time and money spent gambling). Results The  prevalence rates for past-year gambling harms were dependence harm (16.4%),  social harm (2.2%), and chasing losses (7.9%). Gambling-related harms were  distributed across low- to moderate-risk gamblers (and not limited to just  problem gamblers) and were reported by the majority of gamblers who were non-high  time and spend regular gamblers than high time and spend regular gamblers.  Conclusions The prevention paradox is a promising way of examining  gambling-related harm. This suggests that prevention of gambling might need to  consider the population approach to minimizing gambling harm.

AU  - Raybould, Jodie N.
AU  - Larkin, Michael

T2  - BMC public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Here we present a systematic review of the existing research into gambling harms, in order to determine whether there are differences in the  presentation of these across demographic groups such as age, gender, culture, and  socioeconomic status, or gambling behaviour categories such as risk severity and  participation frequency. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Inclusion  criteria were: 1) focus on gambling harms; 2) focus on harms to the gambler  rather than affected others; 3) discussion of specific listed harms and not just  harms in general terms. Exclusion criteria were: 1) research of non-human  subjects; 2) not written in English; 3) not an empirical study; 4) not available  as a full article. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search using the Web of  Science and Scopus databases in August 2020. Assessment of quality took place  using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria. RESULTS: A total of 59 studies  published between 1994 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria. These were  categorised into thematic groups for comparison and discussion. There were  replicated differences found in groups defined by age, socioeconomic status,  education level, ethnicity and culture, risk severity, and gambling behaviours.  CONCLUSION: Harms appear to be dependent on specific social, demographic and  environmental conditions that suggests there is a health inequality in gambling  related harms. Further investigation is required to develop standardised  measurement tools and to understand confounding variables and co-morbidities.  With a robust understanding of harms distribution in the population, Primary Care  Workers will be better equipped to identify those who are at risk, or who are  showing signs of Gambling Disorder, and to target prevention and intervention  programmes appropriately.

AU  - Sturgis, P.

T2  - Public health
AB  - Recent general population surveys have produced highly variable estimates of the extent of problem gambling in Great Britain, ranging from as low as 0.4% to as  high as 2.7% of adults. This level of uncertainty over the true level of problem  gambling creates difficulties for policy makers and those planning treatment and  support services for individuals and families affected by problem gambling. In  this article, we assess the extent to which differences in approaches to sampling  and measurement between surveys contribute to variability in estimates of problem  gambling. We compare estimates of problem gambling using the Problem Gambling  Severity Index across eight different surveys conducted at approximately the same  time but which use different sampling and measurement strategies. Our findings  show that surveys conducted online produce substantially higher estimates of  problem gambling compared with in-person interview surveys. This is because  online surveys, whether using probability or non-probability sampling,  overrepresent people who are more likely to gamble online and to gamble  frequently, relative to the proportions of these groups in the general  population.

AB  - Gambling exposes people to risk for harm, but also has recreational benefits. The present study aimed to measure gambling harm and gambling benefits on similar  scales using two novel methods adapted from the Burden of Disease approach  (McCormack et al. in Psychol Med 18(4):1007-1019, 1988; Torrance et al. in Health  Serv Res 7(2):118-133, 1972) to find whether gambling either adds or subtracts  from quality of life. A Tasmanian population-representative survey of 5000 adults  (2534 female) from random digit dialling (RDD) of landline telephones in Tasmania  (50%), as well as pre-screened Tasmanian RDD mobiles (17%) and listed mobile  numbers (33%), measured gambling benefits and harms amongst gamblers (59.2%) and  a non-exclusive set of people who were "affected" by someone else's gambling  (4.5%). The majority of gamblers indicated no change to their quality of life  from gambling (82.5% or 72.6% based on direct elicitation or time trade off  methods, respectively). Nevertheless, a weighted average of all the positive and  negative influences on quality of life, inclusive of gamblers and affected  others, revealed that the quality of life change from gambling is either a very  modest + 0.05% or a more concerning - 1.9% per capita. Gambling generates only  small or negative net consumer surpluses for Tasmanians.

T2  - Harm reduction journal
AB  - BACKGROUND: In New Zealand, a public health programme on gambling policy development is part of a national gambling harm reduction and prevention strategy  mandated by the Gambling Act 2003. Funded by the Ministry of Health, the  programme directs workplace/organisational gambling policies, non-gambling  fundraising policies, and local council policies on electronic gaming machines  (EGMs). We carried out a process evaluation of this programme to identify  practical information (e.g. advocacy approaches; challenges and ameliorating  strategies) that can be used by programme planners and implementers to reinforce  programme effectiveness and serve to guide similar policy-focused public health  initiatives elsewhere. METHODS: Evaluation criteria, based on the programme's  official service specifications, guided our evaluation questions, analysis and  reporting. To identify informative aspects of programme delivery, we thematically  analysed over 100 six-monthly implementer progress reports (representing 3 years  of programme delivery) and transcript of a focus group with public health staff.  RESULTS: Identified output-related themes included purposeful awareness raising  to build understanding about gambling harms and the need for harm-reduction  policies and stakeholder relationship development. Outcome-related themes  included enhanced community awareness about gambling harms, community involvement  in policy development, some workplace/organisational policy development, and some  influences on council EGM policies. Non-gambling fundraising policy development  was not common. CONCLUSIONS: The programme offers an unprecedented gambling harm  reduction approach. Although complex (due to its three distinct policy focus  areas targeting different sectors) and challenging (due to the extensive time and  resources needed to develop relationships and overcome counteractive views), the  programme resulted in some policy development. Encouraging  workplace/organisational policy development requires increased awareness of costs  to employers and society and appreciation of policy value. Although encouraging  non-gambling fundraising policies will likely remain challenging, public debate  on ethical aspects could stimulate policy consideration. Influencing council EGM  policy decisions will remain important for minimising EGM accessibility among  vulnerable communities. Public involvement in EGM policy decisions has strong  implications for policy effectiveness. Given the expanding range of gambling  activities (including online gambling) presently accessible to communities  worldwide, both organisational and public policies (as advocated through the  programme) are needed to minimise gambling harms.

AB  - Unlike in other Nordic countries, most of the electronic gambling machines (EGMs) are placed outside the Casino Helsinki and the gambling arcades in Finland. The  placement of EGMs in non-casino locations, such as supermarkets, kiosks, and  petrol stations, is matter of serious concern. We argue that availability and  accessibility of EGMs has led to normalisation and banalisation of gambling in  Finland. Exposure to EGMs also put at risk vulnerable populations and problem  gamblers, who already suffer from the negative consequences of gambling harms.  Gambling companies' self-regulation initiatives and corporate social  responsibility programmes are not enough to prevent and limit EGM related  gambling harms. We suggest that Finland should follow Norway's example and limit  the availability of EGMs and transfer them from non-casino locations to gambling  arcades. Finnish EGM policy should be a question of public policy guided by  public health concerns.

Utilizing survey data from  361 clients from 2009 to 2010, analyses revealed that client satisfaction with  treatment services is positively associated with perceived improvements in  social, functional, and material well-being, abstinence from gambling, reduction  in gambling thoughts and reduction in problems associated with gambling, even  after controlling for various respondent characteristics. These findings can be  useful to treatment program staff in managing program development and allocating  resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lower-risk recommendations for avoiding gambling harm have been developed as a primary prevention measure, using self-reported prevalence  survey data. The aim of this study was to conduct similar analyses using gambling  company player data. METHODS: The sample (N = 35,753) were Norsk Tipping website  customers. Gambling indicators were frequency, expenditure, duration, number of  gambling formats and wager. Harm indicators (financial. social, emotional, harms  in two or more areas) were derived from the GamTest self-assessment instrument.  Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were performed separately for  each of the five gambling indicators for each of the four harm indicators.  RESULTS: ROC areas under the curve were between 0.55 and 0.68. Suggested monthly  lower-risk limits were less than 8.7 days, expenditure less than 54 €, duration  less than 72-83 min, number of gambling formats less than 3 and wager less than  118-140€. Most risk curves showed a rather stable harm level up to a certain  point, from which the increase in harm was fairly linear. DISCUSSION: The  suggested lower-risk limits in the present study are higher than limits based on  prevalence studies. There was a significant number of gamblers (5-10%)  experiencing harm at gambling levels well below the suggested cut-offs and the  risk increase at certain consumption levels. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of harm occurs at  all levels of gambling involvement within the specific gambling commercial  environment assessed in an increasingly available gambling market where most  people gamble in multiple commercial environments, minimizing harm is important  for all customers.

METHOD: During 2001, prior to the passing of legislation to minimise gambling  harm, more than 500 students from six high schools completed a survey of their  participation in gambling during the previous 12 months, and completed three  problem gambling screens. RESULTS: Gambling, including under-age gambling, was a  common event. Up to one in five were identified as at risk for problem gambling  on at least one screen. Students who were non-European, or were from low  socioeconomic areas, were more likely to be at risk for problem gambling. Help  for gambling problems was preferred from friends and family rather than others,  while inclusion of information in the education curriculum about risk of gambling  problems was supported. CONCLUSIONS: The survey provided evidence for  pre-legislation baseline gambling behaviour, and risk for problem gambling, of  students attending high schools in Auckland. Levels of risk for problem gambling  paralleled the elevated risk found for youth in many countries. Raising  awareness, through a school curriculum, of risk for gambling problems among  adolescents may be explored as a strategy to reduce the high levels of risk for  gambling problems identified.

AB  - Background: Internet gambling may increase rates of gambling harm. This current study aimed to assess Internet poker players' views on various harm-reduction  (HR) strategies. It also examined differences in these views according to the  games played (poker only vs. poker plus other gambling activities), indebtedness,  and problem gambling severity. Methods: Internet poker players (n = 311; 94.2%  Male) recruited online between 2012 and 2014 were included in the analyses and  completed a survey on indebtedness, problem gambling severity index, and ten  statements regarding HR features. Results: Among the whole sample, the most  frequently endorsed HR strategy was setting money limits, specialized online  help, and peer support forums. People who play poker only (70%) are less prone to  endorse the utility of information on excessive gambling and specialized  healthcare centers. No differences were found between those people with debt  versus those without regarding HR assessment. Participants with severe problem  gambling were more skeptical about HR strategies based on information on  specialized healthcare centers. Conclusion: Setting money limits, online help,  and peer support forums are the most commonly endorsed strategies. Future  research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of online harm reduction  strategies.

AB  - Background As in many other countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Malawi's commercial gambling sector has grown considerably in recent years. Driven by the  widespread availability of internet through mobile devices, the industry has  penetrated both urban and rural settings. In Malawi the model commonly  implemented by gambling companies is similar to that used by mobile phone  operators. Agents equipped with cellular devices connect to providers' servers to  place wagers for customers and print receipts using simple printers attached to  their devices. This has produced lucrative returns for providers. While  increasing attention is being paid to this trend, most research focusses on  sports betting and there is a deficit of papers that document gambling-related  harms. Methods Here we present a narrative case report of a 16-year-old boy,  'Wati' (pseudonym), who lived in rural Malawi and took his own life after  gambling and losing money that did not belong to him. As his community is part of  a demographic surveillance site, a verbal autopsy was conducted, later  supplemented with interviews with Wati's close friend and uncle, to whom his  mother referred us. We triangulated data from these three sources to create a  narrative case report of Wati's suicide and its relationship to his gambling  practices. Results We found that the gambling harms leading up to Wati's suicide  were recurrent, that his gambling practices were diverse (lottery, football  betting, digital games and cards) and that signs of distress were apparent before  his suicide. Conclusions From this case report, we learn that underage  individuals participate in gambling in Malawi, can develop harmful habits and  that their gambling is not confined to sports betting. We also learn that there  is a lack of accessible services for people who develop harmful gambling  practices. Wati could have benefited from such services and they may have saved  his life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Responsible gambling (RG) is defined as gambling for pleasure and entertainment but with an awareness of the likelihood of losing, an understanding  of the associated risks and the ability to exercise control over one's gambling  activity. The current study describes a qualitative approach to explore RG among  older adults (aged 60 years and above) in Singapore and reports on the cognitive  and behavioural strategies employed by them to regulate their gambling. METHODS:  Inclusion criteria included Singapore residents aged 60 years and above, who  could speak in English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil and were current or past regular  gamblers. Participants were recruited using a combination of network and  purposive sampling. Socio-demographic information on age, age of onset of  gambling, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education and employment was  collected. The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) was used to collect information  on gambling activities and problems associated with gambling behaviour.  Qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 older adults (60 years and above)  who currently gambled. The data was analyzed using thematic network analysis.  RESULTS: This global theme of RG comprised two organising themes: self -developed  strategies to limit gambling related harm and family interventions to reduce  gambling harm. The basic themes included delayed gratification, perception of  futility of gambling, setting limits, maintaining balance, help-seeking and  awareness of disordered gambling in self or in others. Family interventions  included pleading and threatening, compelling help-seeking as well as family  exclusion order. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the significant role that  families play in Asian societies in imposing RG. Education of family members both  in terms of the importance of RG, and communication of the ways in which older  adults can incorporate RG behaviours including the use of exclusion in specific  scenarios is important.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Systematic mapping of evaluations of tools and interventions that are intended to mitigate risks for gambling harm. DESIGN: Scoping Review and z-curve  analysis (which estimates the average replicability of a body of literature).  SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched 7 databases. We also examined reference lists of  included studies, as well as papers that cited included studies. Included studies  described a quantitative empirical assessment of a game-based (i.e., intrinsic to  a specific gambling product) structural feature, user-directed tool, or  regulatory initiative to promote responsible gambling. At least two research  assistants independently performed screening and extracted study characteristics  (e.g., study design and sample size). One author extracted statistics for the  z-curve analysis. RESULTS: 86 studies met inclusion criteria. No tools or  interventions had unambiguous evidence of efficacy, but some show promise, such  as within-session breaks in play. Pre-registration of research hypotheses,  methods, and analytic plans was absent until 2019, reflecting a recent  embracement of open science practices. Published studies also inconsistently  reported effect sizes and power analyses. The results of z-curve provide some  evidence of publication bias, and suggest that the replicability of the  responsible product design literature is uncertain but could be low. CONCLUSION:  Greater transparency and precision are paramount to improving the evidence base  for responsible product design to mitigate gambling-related harm.

AB  - Reflecting international patterns, Aboriginal people in Victoria are more likely to gamble and to experience gambling harm than non-Indigenous Victorians. This  paper describes experiences of gambling reported by 50 Aboriginal people  interviewed in regional Victoria in 2016 and 2017 as part of studies initiated by  two Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. Data were analysed using  social practice theory (SPT) and coded to the elements of 'meaning', 'material',  'competence', and 'temporality'. Across each element we identified highly  contradictory experiences. Gambling held meaning as an opportunity for community  gatherings but was also regarded as a cause of domestic violence, conflict,  isolation and shame. Materially, the venues that offered gambling were  experienced by many Aboriginal people as safe and welcoming, but at the same time  gambling produced a damaging affective sense of addiction for some. Gambling was  a competency that some people valued and taught to children, but it was also seen  as undermining cultural practices. While Aboriginal people were historically  denied access to licensed venues offering commercial gambling, many participants  now found opportunities to gamble inescapable. The intermingling of benefits and  harms described above supports the need for a multi-faceted response to gambling  in Aboriginal communities, which includes harm reduction as well as supply  restriction and treatment. Some experiences of gambling related by our  participants reflected those reported also by non-Indigenous Australians, while  others were differently nuanced. Because SPT is used to understand  collectively-shared practices, it facilitates the identification of gambling  interventions at the level of the community, as recommended by our research  participants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, the provision of online gambling has intensified with increased access, enhanced betting markets, a broader product  range, and prolific marketing. However, little research has explored how this  intensification is influencing contemporary gambling experiences. This study  focused on two research questions: 1) What changes in online gambling have online  gamblers observed over the past decade? 2) How have these changes influenced the  online gambling experiences and behaviours reported by treatment-seeking and  non-treatment-seeking gamblers? METHODS: Two samples of Australian adults were  interviewed: 1) 19 people who had been gambling online for at least a decade and  with no history of treatment-seeking for online gambling, and 2) 10 people who  had recently sought professional help for an online gambling problem. Telephone  interviews were semi-structured, with questions that encouraged participants to  consider how their online gambling, including any harmful gambling, had been  influenced by changes in operator practices and online gambling environments.  Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Both treatment- and  non-treatment-seekers noted the increased speed and ease of online gambling,  which now enables instant access from anywhere at any time and increased their  gambling opportunities. Both groups highlighted the continued proliferation of  advertising and inducements for online gambling, particularly during televised  sports and racing events, in social media, and through targeted push marketing.  Many treatment- and non-treatment-seekers were aware of the vast range of  recently introduced bet types, particularly multi-bets. Treatment-seekers  disproportionately reported negative effects from these changes, and described  how and why they fostered their increased gambling, impulsive gambling,  persistence and loss-chasing. They reported limited uptake and effectiveness of  current harm minimisation tools. CONCLUSIONS: Counter to stated policy and  practice objectives to minimise gambling harm, industry changes that have made  online gambling easier, faster, and more heavily incentivised, and increased the  array of complex bets with poorer odds, unduly affect addicted and harmed  individuals - who are also the most profitable customers. Further consideration  is needed to ensure gambling policy, industry practices and public health  measures more effectively reduce gambling harm in contemporary settings.  Inducements and the poor pricing of complex bets such as multi-bets, and their  outsized attraction to players with problems, should be a key focus.

T2  - Public health
AB  - Problem gambling has not been a priority within either Leeds City Council or partnership plans. However, financial inclusion, licencing and public health  teams have been able to develop a cross-Council approach to problem gambling.  This has been aided by an upfront payment plus annual payments to the Council  that have been part of the licencing agreement for a new casino. As a result,  research has been commissioned on local prevalence. This showed a higher rate of  problem gamblers (1.8%) than national estimates with a similar level to  nationally of those 'at risk'. The research also showed that local services had  difficulties identifying problem gamblers and signposting for support. This had  led to a high profile communications campaign to coincide with 'Responsible  Gambling Week' complemented by training for frontline workers. The interviews  undertaken for the research, plus the findings themselves, have been a powerful  help in securing interest and commitment beyond the Council and to the health and  third sectors. The use of local stories has helped build momentum for partnership  working. For example, focus groups to explore how gambling affected migrants and  medical student interviews with university students. The article will describe  how increasing understanding across partners has helped build confidence to  provide cross city responses to national consultations and contribute to national  publications and conferences. Of even greater significance, the local National  Health Service has secured funding from GambleAware for a Northern Gambling  Service to be based in Leeds with satellites in the North East and Greater  Manchester. This will provide treatment for those with severe gambling addiction.  Additional support will come from a significant increased provision of GamCare  services working to identify, screen and support problem gamblers. The use of  Council premises for both of these services is testament to joint working.  Recognising that this is a new emerging agenda has led to the creation of a  Yorkshire and Humber Problem Gambling Working Group, endorsed by the Association  of Directors of Public Health. This has resulted in shared learning and  determining a consistent approach to harm. Even during a short time, the degree  of interest has risen substantially. A regional gambling harm reduction framework  has been produced that sets out a menu of actions. This intends to help local  areas determine their own priorities. There is increasing recognition that  problem gambling is a public health issue. Leadership requires a systems led, and  Health in All Policies, approach to ensure problem gambling is not seen as a  narrow niche issue led by public health staff. There is a need to recognise that  engagement takes time. However, this is a new and emerging issue. The solutions  to problem gambling are not clear and this allows for more creative, pragmatic  and coproduced approaches.

AB  - In Canada, up to 3% of individuals have or are at risk of gambling disorder. Among these individuals, a lack of awareness of their problem gambling is a  common barrier to treatment and negatively affects treatment adherence. A  secondary analysis was conducted on data from 1346 individuals (mean age = 43.4,  SD = 14.4; 54.3 % male) with problem gambling who did and did not perceive having  a problem with their gambling as assessed by the fifth item of the Problem  Gambling Severity Index, "In the past twelve months, how often have you felt that  you might have a problem with gambling?" Additionally, we investigated predictors  of increased general awareness at 12-month follow-up. At baseline, individuals  who perceived a problem with their gambling experienced more gambling-related  harms (OR = 1.714), had greater total gambling losses (OR = 1.067), were more  likely to have a family history of problem gambling (OR = 2.143), experienced a  greater loss of control (OR = 1.313) and more often gambled alone than with  others (OR = 0.879), accounting for 26.6 % of the variance in general awareness.  Baseline problem awareness was positively associated with attempts to cut down or  control gambling at follow-up (χ(2)=11.350,p<.001), but negatively associated  with remission (χ(2)=18.392,p<.001). Increases in awareness were related to an  increase in the number of gambling-related harms, gambling involvement, impaired  control, and lower educational attainment, explaining 35.5% of the variance in  increased general awareness. The results indicate that experiencing more  gambling-related harms increases the salience and awareness of problem gambling,  and that awareness is also associated with an individual's gambling context,  their loss of control, and their level of gambling involvement. The findings  highlight the importance of gambling harms as they pertain to general awareness  and suggest that improving the recognition of gambling harms could be beneficial  for the prevention and intervention of gambling disorder.

AB  - Internet gambling provides a unique environment with design mechanics and data-driven opportunities that can impact gambling-related harms. Some elements  of Internet gambling including isolation, lack of interruption, and constant,  easy access have been argued to pose specific risks. However, identifiable player  accounts enable identification of behavioral risk markers and personalized  private interfaces to push customized messages and interventions. The structural  design of the Internet gambling environment (website or app) can have a strong  influence on individual behavior. However, unlike land-based venues, Internet  gambling has few specific policies outlining acceptable and unacceptable design  practices. Harm minimization including responsible gambling frameworks typically  include roles and responsibilities for multiple stakeholders including individual  users, industry operators, government regulators, and community organizations.  This paper presents a framework for how behavioral science principles can inform  appropriate stakeholder actions to minimize Internet gambling-related harms. A  customer journey through internet gambling demonstrates how a multidisciplinary  nexus of collaborative effort may facilitate a reduction in harms associated with  Internet gambling for consumers at all stages of risk. Collaborative efforts  between stakeholders could result in the implementation of appropriate design  strategies to assist individuals to make decisions and engage in healthy,  sustainable behaviors.

T2  - Journal of behavioral addictions
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gambling education programs typically focus on promoting gambling as a high-risk activity with harmful effects; however, these programs  demonstrate limited effects on the prevention of gambling problems. This paper  proposes a clear theoretical framework to inform the content and delivery of  gambling education initiatives and draws on psychological and pedagogical  research to address some of the practical issues associated with its  implementation. METHODS: Literature was reviewed across fields of psychology,  public health, and pedagogy to provide key recommendations to improve the  outcomes of gambling education. RESULTS: Four key recommendations were made for  the development of future gambling education programs centering on theoretical  approach, specialized content, and delivery. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS:  Recommended advancements are as follows: (a) evidence suggests shifting away from  messages about gambling harms and instead applying a cognitive-developmental  framework of problem gambling that may improve youth engagement by increasing  personal relevance. (b) The cognitive model of problem gambling suggests that  misconceptions about the profitability of gambling games (e.g., the gambler's  fallacy) play an important role in the development of problems and should be a  key target for education. However, exposing such misconceptions requires the  challenge of teaching the mathematical principles that underpin them. (c) The  pedagogical field provides valuable insights into teaching complex concepts.  Research that applies the conceptual change model to science education suggests  misconceptions also facilitate learning new complex information, such as  gambling-related mathematical concepts (i.e., randomness and statistics). (d) In  addition, improvements in computer-assisted teaching methods provide  opportunities to use simulations and visualizations to help teach abstract  concepts and correct such misconceptions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that government and industry discussions of gambling may focus on personal responsibility for gambling harm. In Australia,  these discussions have largely excluded people with lived experience of problem  gambling, including those involved in peer support and advocacy. METHODS: We  conducted 26 in-depth interviews with people with current or previous problem  gambling on electronic gaming machines (EGMs) involved in peer support and  advocacy activities, using an approach informed by Interpretive Policy Analysis  and Constructivist Grounded Theory. RESULTS: Participants perceived that  government and industry discussed gambling as safe and entertaining with a focus  on personal responsibility for problem gambling. This focus on personal  responsibility was perceived to increase stigma associated with problem gambling.  In contrast, they described gambling as risky, addictive and harmful, with  problem gambling resulting from the design of EGMs. As a result of their  different perspectives, participants proposed different interventions to reduce  gambling harm, including reducing accessibility and making products safer.  CONCLUSIONS: Challenging the discourses used by governments and industry to  describe gambling, using the lived experience of people with experience of  gambling harm, may result in reduced stigma associated with problem gambling, and  more effective public policy approaches to reducing harm.

TI  - Gambling policy positions of Finnish newspapers between 2004 and 2020: An automated content analysis.
AU  - Selin, Jani

T2  - Nordisk alkohol- & narkotikatidskrift : NAT
AB  - Aims: The media can influence gambling policy formation and public opinion. Previous research has established that the tension between political or public  interest in gambling revenue and gambling harm is fundamental for understanding  gambling policy. There are two opposing gambling policy positions: (1) gambling  revenue or the economic benefits of gambling, and (2) the harmful impacts of  gambling. This study is the first study to estimate these gambling policy  positions of newspapers on a common scale. The objective is to estimate how the  gambling policy positions of major Finnish daily newspapers evolved between 2004  and 2020. This knowledge deepens our understanding about the changes in the  relative balance between harm and revenue in gambling policy. Methods and data:  The data consisted of newspaper editorials (N = 58) on gambling policy from five  major Finnish daily newspapers between 2004 and 2020. The data were analysed with  the automated content analysis algorithm Wordfish. Results: The results show that  there has been a clear shift in the gambling policy positions of the major  Finnish newspapers towards increased acknowledgement of the importance of  prevention and reduction of gambling harm. Conclusions: Due to the interplay  between the media, politics, and the public, it is likely that the importance of  prevention and reduction of gambling harm will be recognised and addressed to a  larger extent when gambling policy is formulated in Finland in the future. More  generally, if the gambling policy positions of media and other stakeholders  change, this can facilitate a promotion of harm prevention policies.

AB  - Mobile gambling differs from land-based and traditional forms of gambling in that the opportunity to place bets and engage with casinos is constantly present and  easily accessible. Instead of going to a physical bookmaker or casino, mobile  gambling is done quickly and swiftly, anytime, anywhere, with a few taps on a  mobile device. Previous studies reveal mobile gambling has managed to reach new  audiences especially amongst younger people. Gambling harms can have severe  adverse effects on individuals, families and society. However, for a subgroup of  highly involved individuals, gambling can be considered a harmonious passion that  permits frequent gambling without elevating individual's risks of experience  problem gambling manifestations. Combining the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) and  Dualistic Model of Passion (DMP) frameworks, the present study aims to determine  if and how the different gratifications sought from mobile gambling are  susceptible to explaining non-problematic versus problematic patterns in highly  involved gamblers. Data were collected over two waves from a global sample of  mobile gamblers (N = 327). Results emphasize that the motivational underpinnings  of mobile gambling (as measured by the U&G) differ in obsessive versus harmonious  passion. Obsessive passion is associated with poor mood and problematic gambling.  In contrast, harmonious passion for mobile gambling is associated with positive  mood but is unrelated to problematic gambling. Based on these findings, and given  that problematic gambling is an internationally relevant public health issue (the  prevalence of problem gambling is estimated to range from 0.1% to 5.8% in  different countries), we suggest interventions focusing on specific uses and  gratifications associated with an obsessive passion for mobile gambling may be  effective in reducing problematic usage patterns.

T2  - The European journal of neuroscience
AB  - Video slot machines are associated with both accelerated transition into problematic forms of gambling, as well as psychosocial harm above and beyond  other forms of gambling. A growing body of evidence is uncovering how key design  features of multiline slot machines produce an inflated experience of reward,  despite the fact that these features offer no overall financial benefit to the  player. A pernicious example of this are 'losses disguised as wins' (LDWs), which  occur when simultaneous bets placed on multiple lines result in a winning  combination that returns an amount greater than zero, but less the total wager.  These events are usually accompanied by the same celebratory sounds and  animations that accompany true wins. We argue that LDWs may leverage  neuropsychological phenomena that underlie reinforcement learning and contribute  to extended or repetitive use and gambling-related harm. While other  characteristics of slot machine gambling have been examined by cognitive  neuroscientists, this feature has not yet received attention. Neuroscientific  methods can be used to assess the impact of LDWs on the human reward system, to  assess the claim that these events are a reinforcing and contributing factor in  the development of harmful play. Positive findings would provide further  persuasive evidence in support of strategies to minimise gambling harm through  the regulation of machine design.

T2  - Addictive behaviors
AB  - The Pareto effect (also known as the 80/20 rule) describes a skewed distribution of engagement that is observed for many products. In this study, we investigated  Pareto estimates for online casino gambling, and tested their association with  voluntary self-exclusion (VSE) as a marker of gambling harm, and examined their  sensitivity to varying time windows. We used one year of betting data from the  eCasino section of a provincially-run gambling website in British Columbia,  Canada. The data contained 30,920 account holders who placed at least one bet on  the platform from October 2014 to September 2015. The top 20% most engaged  gamblers accounted for 92% (based on total number of bets) and 90% (based on net  losses) of eCasino gambling activity over the year. The top 20% of online  gamblers displayed higher levels of VSE enrolment than the remaining 80% (total  bets: 13% vs 7%; net losses: 16% vs 6%, respectively). Pareto estimates increased  with longer time windows, from one month to one year (total bets: 80% to 92%; net  losses: 81% to 90%, respectively). This accumulation was driven by the relative  loyalty of the most engaged gamblers, coupled with the influx of new and more  transient gamblers on a month-to-month basis. These data strengthen links between  concentrations of engagement with online products and measures of harm, but also  highlight the dynamic nature of these estimates. One year estimates are  preferable for estimating the degree of concentration.

T2  - BMC public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Harmful gambling is a significant public health issue. There has been widespread discussion in the Australian media about the extent and impact of  sports betting on the Australian community, particularly relating to young men  and children. Given the role that the media plays in influencing policy change  and political agendas, and the acknowledgement that media based advocacy is a  fundamental component of successful advocacy campaigns, this research aimed to  investigate how different stakeholder groups discuss sports betting within the  Australian print media. The study uses this information to provide  recommendations to guide public health media advocacy approaches. METHODS: A  quantitative content analysis of print media articles was conducted during two  significant Parliamentary Inquiries about sports betting - (1) The Joint Select  Committee Inquiry into the Advertising and Promotion of Gambling Services in  Sport (2012/2013), and (2) 'The Review of Illegal Offshore Wagering (2015/2016).  A total of 241 articles from 12 daily Australian newspapers were analysed.  Statistical analysis was used to compare frequency of, and changes in, themes,  voices and perspectives over time. RESULTS: Discussions about the marketing and  communication of sports betting was a main theme in media reporting (n = 165,  68.5%), while discussions about gambling reform decreased significantly across  the two time periods (p < 0.0001). The presence of sports betting industry  (p < 0.0001), sporting code (p < 0.0001) and public health expert (p = 0.001)  voices all increased significantly across the two time periods. There were very  few (n = 11, 4.6%) voices from those who had experienced gambling harm. Finally,  while there were significantly fewer articles taking the perspective that  regulation changes were needed to protect vulnerable sub-populations  (p < 0.0001), articles that had a neutral perspective about the need for  regulation change increased significantly across the two time periods  (p < 0.0001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Mapping the media reporting of sports  betting is important in developing effective public health advocacy approaches.  This study indicates that discussions about the marketing strategies utilised by  the sports betting industry was still a main theme in media articles. However,  discussions relating to sports betting reforms, in particular to protect  individuals who may be vulnerable to the harm associated with these products and  their promotional strategies (for example children and young men) decreased  during the time periods. Public health advocates may seek to address the decrease  in media reports about reform by developing clear evidence-based messages about  why regulatory reform is needed, as well as the potential consequences of not  implementing reforms. Working with organisations to build capacity for people who  have experienced gambling harm may help ensure that individuals with a lived  experience of harm have an increased voice in the media.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Speed of play has been identified as a key structural characteristic in gambling behaviour, where games involving higher playing speeds enhance the experience of  gambling. Of interest in the present study is the consistent finding that games  with higher event frequencies are preferred by problem gamblers and are  associated with more negative gambling outcomes, such as difficulty quitting the  game and increased monetary loss. The present study investigated the impact of  gambling speed of play on executive control functioning, focusing on how  increased speeds of play impact motor response inhibition, and the potential  mediating role arousal and dissociative experience play in this relationship.  Fifty regular non-problem gamblers took part in a repeated-measures experiment  where they gambled with real money on a simulated slot machine across five speed  of play conditions. Response inhibition was measured using an embedded Go/No-Go  task, where participants had to withhold motor responses, rather than operating  the spin button on the slot machine when a specific colour cue was present.  Results indicated that response inhibition performance was significantly worse  during faster speeds of play, and that the role of arousal in this relationship  was independent of any motor priming affect. The implications of these findings  for gambling legislation and gambling harm-minimisation approaches are discussed.

AU  - Hagfors, Heli
AU  - Castrén, Sari
AU  - Salonen, Anne H.
T2  - Journal of behavioral addictions
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aims were to examine how socio-demographics and gambling behavior relate to both primary and additional gambling motives, and whether the  gambling motives change during a one-year-period. METHODS: The Finnish Gambling  Harms Survey data was used. Gambling motives were measured with a categorical  question. Gambling severity was measured using the Problem and Pathological  Gambling Measure (PPGM). Using the first-wave data including only past-year  gamblers (n = 5,684), five logistic regression models were utilized to explore  the associations of gambling motives with socio-demographics and gambling  behavior. The stability of gambling motives was assessed with McNemar's test  using longitudinal data (n = 2,078). RESULTS: Gambling for positive feeling was  associated with younger age, high income, high gambling involvement and at-risk  gambling. Monetary motive was associated with female gender, high gambling  involvement, online or mixed-mode and at-risk gambling. Supporting worthy causes  was associated with older age, monthly and weekly gambling, and land-based  gambling. Socializing was associated with younger age and gambling occasionally  on land-based venues with multiple game types. Finally, the motive to escape was  intensified among 25-34-year-olds, homemakers, and those with high gambling  involvement and at-risk or problem gambling. Gambling motives remained relatively  stable for one year. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Gender and age profiles varied  in different motives. Positive feeling, socializing and escape motive was  heightened among younger respondents while supporting worthy causes was  heightened among the oldest. Women gambled for money more often than men. Escape  motive was associated with problem gambling. Longer follow-up is needed to  confirm the longitudinal results.

AB  - Pacific people in New Zealand are a minority ethnic population identified in national prevalence studies as having the highest risk of developing gambling  problems. As earlier studies identified some links between culture and gambling  for this population, our study aimed to deepen understanding of these links and  their role in explaining the disproportionate gambling harms experienced by  Pacific people. To achieve this aim we employed intersectionality as a  theoretical framework to explore the culture-gambling intersection for this  population group. We analysed data from a subset of focus groups conducted for a  broad study of gambling harms in New Zealand. The subset was selected based on  the presence of individuals knowledgeable about Pacific people's gambling  behaviours, including staff from Pacific problem gambling treatment services who  provided examples from a cultural perspective. We identified themes at a latent  level via an interpretive process to identify underlying cultural contexts of  gambling harms. Findings indicated that whilst harms experienced by Pacific  people were similar to those identified amongst the general population, the  cultural contexts in which some harms manifested were complex. This paper  contributes to the existing knowledge base about gambling harms for Pacific  people in relation to six culture-gambling intersecting themes that emerged from  the data: collectivism, gift-giving, gambling-based fundraising, patriarchy,  beliefs about blessings, and sports celebrities. Findings are discussed in  relation to the current knowledge of gambling and conceptualisations of gambling  harm within Pacific communities. Implications for culturally appropriate harm  minimisation strategies and prevention interventions for this population are  suggested.

TI  - Proximal and Distal Risk Factors for Gambling Problems Specifically Associated with Electronic Gaming Machines.
AU  - Hing, Nerilee
AU  - Russell, Alex M. T.
T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Electronic gaming machines (EGMs) are widely used and the gambling product most commonly associated with harmful gambling. Understanding factors that increase  the risk of problematic EGM play is therefore important. Previous studies into  risk factors for EGM gambling have used measures of problem gambling based on an  individual's total gambling activity, which therefore do not distinguish harmful  gambling specifically associated with EGMs. This study used an EGM-specific  measure (PGSI-EGM) to achieve its aim of identifying risk factors specifically  associated with problematic EGM play. By removing nuisance effects from other  gambling forms that higher-risk gamblers typically engage in, this approach  provides a more accurate assessment of the determinants of EGM-related problems.  An online survey was completed by 1932 at-least monthly EGM players in Australia.  It measured demographics, EGM gambling behaviour, motivations, gambling urges,  gambling fallacies, trait self-control, alcohol misuse, and the PGSI-EGM. A  penalised regression model identified the most important proximal predictors of  higher-risk EGM gambling as: higher gambling urges, higher levels of erroneous  cognitions, playing EGMs more frequently, higher session expenditure, longer  sessions, usually playing EGMs alone, and playing EGMs in more venues. Lower  trait self control was the strongest distal determinant. Higher-risk EGM players  tended to be younger, male, more educated, never married, to have higher  (although still modest) incomes, and be more likely to have alcohol problems.  These findings can inform interventions such as treatment, consumer education and  venue interventions.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - A proliferation of wagering advertising has raised concerns about its effects, especially on vulnerable gamblers. This study examined exposure to wagering  advertisements and inducements, and their reported influence on the size,  frequency and riskiness of bets placed-amongst regular bettors and by gambler  risk group. An Ecological Momentary Assessment design minimised recall bias.  After completing a baseline survey, 722 regular bettors completed up to 15  surveys administered on 5 days per week over three non-consecutive weeks. Data  were analysed for the 316 race bettors and 279 sports bettors completing at least  one survey. The results indicate that regular bettors have almost daily exposure  to wagering advertising, including for inducements. The most frequently seen and  influential advertisement types were direct messages (emails, texts and/or phone  calls from wagering operators, which, in Australia, bettors are automatically  opted-into when opening a betting account) and advertisements on betting websites  or apps. Participants reported the most influential inducements to be: stake-back  offers, multi-bet offers, match your stake or deposit offers, better  odds/winnings inducements, happy hours, rewards programs, and cash out early  offers. The findings indicate that wagering advertisements, including for  inducements, are likely to be having powerful effects on regular bettors. On each  day that respondents saw these advertisements (most days for most advertisement  types), substantial minorities reported increased size and frequency of betting.  Results did not vary by gambler risk group. Understanding which types of wagering  advertising are associated with most gambling-related harm can inform advertising  regulations, targeted public health interventions, and future research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gambling is a public health concern, given the multiplicity of harms for individuals, families and communities. This article reports on the  commissioning and delivery of a problem gambling treatment service in a  metropolitan area in England, where the concentration of problem gambling is  often higher than the national average. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional  study, using purposively sampled 'experts' and stakeholders involved in the  conception and set-up of the service. METHODS: Individual semistructured  interviews were used to ascertain the depth of information required to fully  appreciate the nuances and complexities of the service. Eight participants took  part in the interviews, with an additional respondent providing written comments  in relation to the interview schedule as a workaround to accommodate the  organisational impacts of COVID-19. RESULTS: The article identifies several  factors contributing to the successful delivery of the service. Well-managed  collaborative provision with expertise from across sectors is critical, but this  needs to be balanced against the challenges faced by bridging cultural variances  in practice and language. Adopting evidence-based models of delivery was central  to practice, and moreover, geographical location is a key consideration to  encourage access for those facing gambling problems and discourage feelings of  stigma. CONCLUSIONS: This article offers a unique contribution to understanding  more about the provision of gambling treatment services. This is crucial, given  that a greater number of people face challenges as a consequence of gambling  harms, and such services should be seen part of forming a coherent public health  response.

AB  - ISSUES ADDRESSED: Research is needed to understand young people's perspectives about public health promotion strategies relevant for their health and wellbeing.  This study provides suggestions from young male gamblers about sports betting  harm prevention and reduction strategies. METHODS: In-depth interviews were  conducted with 16 young men aged 18 to 24 years, from Melbourne, Victoria, who  regularly engaged in sports betting. A critical qualitative inquiry approach,  using methods of constructivist grounded theory guided the study. Reflexive  thematic analysis was used to interpret and construct themes from the data.  RESULTS: Participants indicated three main harm prevention strategies. These were  online consumer protection and regulatory strategies, public education campaigns  that highlighted sports betting risks and harms and the creation of formal and  informal support networks to reduce stigma and encourage help seeking. They also  supported being engaged in the development of harm prevention strategies and  suggested ways to help reduce barriers to engagement. CONCLUSION: Young men  recognise the need for regulatory, education and engagement responses to counter  the risks posed by new gambling products. Young men may be difficult to engage in  formal prevention activities, however, youth-led and informal interactive  mechanisms may help to overcome this barrier, and contribute to a comprehensive  public health approach to gambling harm prevention. SO WHAT?: Young men can draw  upon their lived experiences of gambling to provide insights relevant for public  health promotion. Mechanisms should be developed to engage young people in the  co-production of strategies and policies aimed at gambling harm prevention and  reduction.

AB  - Gambling in the modern era is pervasive owing to the variety of gambling opportunities available, including those that use technology (eg, online  applications on smartphones). Although many people gamble recreationally without  undue negative effects, a sizeable subset of individuals develop disordered  gambling, which is associated with marked functional impairment including other  mental health problems, relationship problems, bankruptcy, suicidality, and  criminality. The National UK Research Network for Behavioural Addictions (NUK-BA)  was established to promote understanding of, research into, and treatments for  behavioural addictions including gambling disorder, which is the only formally  recognised behavioural addiction. In this Health Policy paper, we outline the  status of research and treatment for disordered gambling in the UK (including  funding issues) and key research that should be conducted to establish the  magnitude of the problem, vulnerability and resilience factors, the underlying  neurobiology, long-term consequences, and treatment opportunities. In particular,  we emphasise the need to: (1) conduct independent longitudinal research into the  prevalence of disordered gambling (including gambling disorder and at-risk  gambling), and gambling harms, including in vulnerable and minoritised groups;  (2) select and refine the most suitable pragmatic measurement tools; (3) identify  predictors (eg, vulnerability and resilience markers) of disordered gambling in  people who gamble recreationally, including in vulnerable and minoritised groups;  (4) conduct randomised controlled trials on psychological interventions and  pharmacotherapy for gambling disorder; (5) improve understanding of the  neurobiological basis of gambling disorder, including impulsivity and  compulsivity, genetics, and biomarkers; and (6) develop clinical guidelines based  on the best contemporary research evidence to guide effective clinical  interventions. We also highlight the need to consider what can be learnt from  approaches towards mitigating gambling-related harm in other countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with gambling problems frequently report repeated unsuccessful attempts to change their behavior. Although many behavior change techniques are  available to individuals to reduce gambling harm, they can be challenging to  implement or maintain. The provision of implementation support tailored for  immediate, real-time, individualized circumstances may improve attempts at  behavior change. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and evaluate a Just-In-Time  Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for individuals who require support to adhere to  their gambling limits. JITAI development is based on the principles of the Health  Action Process Approach with delivery, in alignment with the principles of  self-determination theory. The primary objective was to determine the effect of  action- and coping planning compared with no intervention on the goal of  subsequently adhering to gambling expenditure limits. METHODS: Gambling Habit  Hacker is delivered as a JITAI providing in-the-moment support for adhering to  gambling expenditure limits (primary proximal outcome). Delivered via a  smartphone app, this JITAI delivers tailored behavior change techniques related  to goal setting, action planning, coping planning, and self-monitoring. The  Gambling Habit Hacker app will be evaluated using a 28-day microrandomized trial.  Up to 200 individuals seeking support for their own gambling from Australia and  New Zealand will set a gambling expenditure limit (ie, goal). They will then be  asked to complete 3 time-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) per day  over a 28-day period. EMAs will assess real-time adherence to gambling limits,  strength of intention to adhere to goals, goal self-efficacy, urge self-efficacy,  and being in high-risk situations. On the basis of the responses to each EMA,  participants will be randomized to the control (a set of 25 self-enactable  strategies containing names only and no implementation information) or  intervention (self-enactable strategy implementation information with facilitated  action- and coping planning) conditions. This microrandomized trial will be  supplemented with a 6-month within-group follow-up that explores the long-term  impact of the app on gambling expenditure (primary distal outcome) and a range of  secondary outcomes, as well as an evaluation of the acceptability of the JITAI  via postintervention surveys, app use and engagement indices, and semistructured  interviews. This trial has been approved by the Deakin University Human Research  Ethics Committee (2020-304). RESULTS: The intervention has been subject to expert  user testing, with high acceptability scores. The results will inform a more  nuanced version of the Gambling Habit Hacker app for wider use. CONCLUSIONS:  Gambling Habit Hacker is part of a suite of interventions for addictive behaviors  that deliver implementation support grounded in lived experience. This study may  inform the usefulness of delivering implementation intentions in real time and in  real-world settings. It potentially offers people with gambling problems new  support to set their gambling intentions and adhere to their limits.

AB  - This paper presents an integrative review of research on domestic and family violence (DFV), including intimate partner violence (IPV), experienced by victims  and perpetrators with a gambling problem. It aims to review, critique, and  synthesize research on this topic to generate fresh and alternative perspectives  to guide future research. Based on a systematic search of the academic literature  and a targeted search of gray literature, the paper summarizes findings from  empirical studies pertaining to the prevalence of perpetration and victimization,  characteristics of perpetrators and victims, and explanations for this violence.  Based on this review, the paper suggests several potential improvements that can  be considered in future studies. These include a shift from focusing on  situational violence to also include coercive control; greater sensitivity in  research design and interpretation to gender differences in experiences of  violence; and the need to include economic abuse as a form of DFV/IPV. Adopting a  public health lens is also recommended to broaden the research focus from victims  and perpetrators to also consider contextual factors. In particular, gambling  research should examine the contribution of gambling products, practices,  environments, and marketing to DFV/IPV and how this might be ameliorated. While  research to date has drawn much needed attention to the risks that gambling  presents for DFV/IPV, this review provides some suggestions for future research  so that it can provide more nuanced findings to inform policy and practice.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Cognitive bias is prevalent among gamblers, especially those with gambling problems. Grounded in the heuristics theories, this study contributes to the  literature by examining a cognitive bias triggered by the break streak pattern in  the casino setting. We postulate that gamblers tend to bet on the latest outcome  when there is a break-streak pattern. Moreover, three determinants of the betting  decision under break-streak pattern, including the streak length of the  alternative outcome, the frequency of the latest outcome, and gender, were  identified and examined in this study. A non-participatory observational study  was conducted among the Cussec gamblers in a casino in Macao. An analysis of 1229  bets confirms our postulation, particularly when the streak of the alternative  outcome is long, the latest outcome is frequent, and the gamblers are females.  The findings provide meaningful implications for casino management and public  policymakers regarding the minimization of gambling harm.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - This paper aimed to analyze the harms arising from gambling and gambling-related help-seeking behaviour within a large sample of Indigenous Australians. A  self-selected sample of 1,259 Indigenous Australian adults completed a gambling  survey at three Indigenous sports and cultural events, in several communities and  online. Based on responses to the problem gambling severity index (PGSI), the  proportions of the sample in the moderate risk and problem gambler groups were  higher than those for the population of New South Wales. Many in our sample  appeared to face higher risks with their gambling and experience severe gambling  harms. From PGSI responses, notable harms include financial difficulties and  feelings of guilt and regret about gambling. Further harms, including personal,  relationship, family, community, legal and housing impacts, were shown to be  significantly higher for problem gamblers than for the other PGSI groups. Most  problem gamblers relied on family, extended family and friends for financial help  or went without due to gambling losses. Nearly half the sample did not think they  had a problem with gambling but the results show that the majority (57.7 %) faced  some risk with their gambling. Of those who sought gambling help, family,  extended family, friends and respected community members were consulted,  demonstrating the reciprocal obligations underpinning traditional Aboriginal  culture. The strength of this finding is that these people are potentially the  greatest source of gambling help, but need knowledge and resources to provide  that help effectively. Local Aboriginal services were preferred as the main  sources of professional help for gambling-related problems.

AB  - This study explored women's gambling in response to male intimate partner violence (IPV). Twenty-four women were recruited through service providers and  online advertising. All women had been victimised by IPV and all experienced  problems relating to the gambling on electronic gaming machines (EGMs). Thematic  analysis of their in-depth interviews identified three major themes. The main  pattern of gambling and IPV (Theme 1) was where ongoing coercive control preceded  the woman's gambling. Situational violence in response to gambling was also  observed. Regardless of temporal sequence, a self-perpetuating cycle of gambling  and IPV victimisation was typically apparent, with both issues escalating over  time. Reflecting severe traumatic violence, push factors from IPV that motivated  the women's gambling (Theme 2) included physical escape, psychological escape,  hope of regaining control over their lives, and gambling to cope with the legacy  of abuse. Pull factors attracting these women to gambling venues (Theme 3)  appeared to have heightened appeal to these victims of IPV. These included  venues' social, geographic and temporal accessibility, allowance for  uninterrupted play on EGMs, and the addictive nature of EGMs. These push and pull  factors led to these women's prolonged and harmful gambling while exacerbating  their partner's violence. Concerted efforts are needed to assist women in this  cycle of IPV and gambling, prevent violence against women, and reduce harmful  gambling products and environments.

AB  - AIMS: To derive low-risk gambling limits using the method developed by Currie et al. (2006) applied to longitudinal data. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from  the Quinte Longitudinal Study (n = 3054) and Leisure, Lifestyle and Lifecycle  Project (n = 809), two independently conducted cohort studies of the natural  progression of gambling in Canadian adults. SETTING: Community-dwelling adults in  Southeastern Ontario and Alberta, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3863 adults  (50% male; median age = 44) who reported gambling in the past year. MEASUREMENTS:  Gambling behaviours (typical monthly frequency, total expenditure and percentage  of income spent on gambling) and harm (experiencing two or more consequences of  gambling in the past 12 months) were assessed with the Canadian Problem Gambling  Index. FINDINGS: The dose-response relationship was comparable in both studies  for frequency of gambling (days per month), total expenditure and percentage of  household income spent on gambling (area under the curve values ranged from 0.66  to 0.74). Based on the optimal sensitivity and specificity values, the low-risk  gambling cut-offs were eight times per month, $75CAN total per month and 1.7% of  income spent on gambling. Gamblers who exceeded any of these limits at time 1  were approximately four times more likely to report harm at time 2 [95%  confidence interval (CI) = 2.9-6.6]. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal data in Canada  suggest low-risk gambling thresholds of eight times per month, $75CAN total per  month and 1.7% of income spent on gambling, all of which are higher than  previously derived limits from cross-sectional data. Gamblers who exceed any of  the three low-risk limits are four times more likely to experience future harm  than those who do not.

T2  - BMC public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: While problem gambling does not directly cause intimate partner violence (IPV), it exacerbates that violence significantly. Women experiencing  both gambling harm and IPV often find themselves in challenging situations;  furthermore, stigma and shame frequently act as barriers to seeking help from  health and social service agencies. Despite the links between problem gambling  and IPV, little is known about women's experiences of using support services for  both IPV and gambling related issues. This paper explores positive experiences of  help-seeking for gambling-related IPV in Australia by adopting a strengths-based  research approach. METHODS: Qualitative, unstructured interviews were conducted  for a larger study exploring the nature of the relationship between problem  gambling and IPV. To gain new insights into the service experiences of women  impacted by gambling related IPV, interviews with 48 women with lived experience  of IPV relating to a male partner's gambling, and 24 women with lived experience  of IPV relating to their own gambling were reanalysed using thematic analysis.  RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data signifying or demonstrating  strength-based responses: 'Commitment to Integrated and Collaborative Responses';  'Therapeutic Support'; and 'Instrumental Support'. The themes highlight the  importance of recognising the intersectionality of gambling related IPV and  supporting the person 'at the centre of the service'. Tangible and instrumental  supports, such as emergency accommodation and financial assistance, were also  central to the recovery process. CONCLUSION: Effective service responses are  dependent on understanding how problem gambling and IPV intersect. Importantly,  service providers must recognise and address the many facets of each woman's  situation and the shame associated with resolving interdependent and complex  issues. Responding to the needs of women impacted by gambling related IPV  requires both individual-level awareness and organisational support;  recommendations to strengthen service provision are provided.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Loot boxes are a common feature in video games where players win, buy or are gifted a virtual box or other container that is unwrapped to  reveal virtual items of value, such as skins, weapons, in-game currency or  special abilities. The current study aimed to relate the use of loot boxes to  gambling problems and harm. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with 1,954  adolescents and young adults from NSW Australia, 59.9% female (aged 12-24),  recruited by online panel aggregator, Qualtrics. RESULTS: Buying and selling loot  boxes was associated with higher 12-month gambling frequency and gambling  problems in young adults, aged 18-24 (Problem Gambling Severity Index). Young  adults who bought loot boxes additionally had more gambling-related harms (Short  Gambling Harms Screen). Young women, aged 18-24, who opened, bought and/or sold  loot boxes spent more money in the last 12 months on gambling. In adolescents,  aged 12-17, buying loot boxes was similarly associated with gambling problems  (DSM-IV-MR-J). Furthermore, adolescent girls who bought and/or sold loot boxes  viewed gambling more positively than other girls (Attitudes Towards Gambling  Scale). There was no evidence, however, that longer-term experience in opening or  purchasing loot boxes, a differentiating feature of the survey, is associated  with current gambling problems. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests  that loot boxes may be attractive to people who are already predisposed to engage  in other gambling, and females who use loot boxes may have unique vulnerabilities  to gambling problems that could be explored in future research.

AB  - RATIONALE: Gambling and alcohol use are recreational behaviours that share substantial commonalities at a phenomenological, clinical and neurobiological  level. Past studies have shown that alcohol can have a disinhibiting effect on  gambling behaviour, in terms of bet size and persistence. OBJECTIVES: This study  was conducted in order to characterise how alcohol affects biases in judgment and  decision-making that occur during gambling, with a focus on sequential  decision-making including the gambler's fallacy. METHODS: Sequential biases were  elicited via a roulette-based gambling task. Using a standard between-groups  alcohol challenge procedure, male participants played the roulette task 20 min  after receiving an alcoholic (0.8 g/kg; n = 22) or placebo (n = 16) beverage. The  task measured colour choice decisions (red/black) and bet size, in response to  varying lengths of colour runs and winning/losing feedback streaks. RESULTS:  Across both groups, a number of established sequential biases were observed. On  colour choice, there was an effect of run length in line with the gambler's  fallacy, which further varied by previous feedback (wins vs losses). Bet size  increased with feedback streaks, especially for losing streaks. Compared to  placebo, the alcohol group placed higher bets following losses compared to wins.  CONCLUSIONS: Increased bet size after losses following alcohol consumption may  reflect increased loss chasing that may amplify gambling harms. Our results do  not fit a simple pattern of enhanced gambling distortions or reward sensitivity,  but help contextualise the effects of alcohol on gambling to research on  decision-making biases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The broadcast of wagering advertisements during televised sports matches has been associated with various adverse outcomes. In order to  counter these effects, legislative bodies require wagering operators to include  responsible gambling messages in their advertisements; however, the effectiveness  of these messages is unclear. This study sought to examine the extent to which  responsible gambling messages are looked at, in the wider context of gambling  advertisements. METHODS: Forty-nine regular sports bettors and 10 non-gamblers  viewed a series of sports betting advertisements, while an eye-tracker recorded  the number of fixations placed on responsible gambling messages, as well as other  text-based wagering content. RESULTS: Responsible gambling messages were,  generally, presented in a non-conspicuous manner. Eye-tracking data revealed that  significantly fewer fixations were placed on responsible gambling messages,  compared to wagering information (p < .001); however, this effect did not differ  according to level of gambling risk (p = .169). The number of fixations placed on  the different types of responsible gambling messages was found to vary, based on  gambling risk (p = .006), as well as, what appears to be, the physical  characteristics of these messages. DISCUSSION: Very few fixations were placed on,  or near, responsible gambling messages, compared to other wagering information,  meaning that, in their current form, they are unlikely to be effective in  protecting against gambling harm. Preliminary evidence shows that presenting  messages on a high-contrast/block-color background increases the number of  fixations on these. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to identify ways of  increasing the effectiveness of responsible gambling initiatives in the sports  betting context.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the attitudes and opinions of public health experts in gambling and related unhealthy commodity industries towards the tactics used by  the gambling industry to prevent reform and the advocacy responses to these  tactics. METHODS: In-depth interviews (30-60 minutes) with a convenience sample  of 15 public health experts and stakeholders with a public health approach to  gambling (n=10), or other unhealthy commodity industries (food, alcohol, tobacco,  n=5). RESULTS: Participants described the influences of political lobbying and  donations on public policy, and industry framing of problem gambling as an issue  of personal responsibility. Industry funding of, and influence over, academic  research was considered to be one of the most effective industry tactics to  resist reform. Participants felt there was a need to build stronger coalitions  and collaborations between independent academics, and to improve the utilisation  of media to more effectively shift perceptions of gambling harm away from the  individual and towards the product. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Gambling  industry tactics are similar to the tactics of other unhealthy commodity  industries. However, advocacy initiatives to counter these tactics in gambling  are less developed than in other areas. The formation of national public health  coalitions, as well as a strong evidence base regarding industry tactics, will  help to strengthen advocacy initiatives.

AU  - Latvala, Tiina

AU  - Roukka, Tomi
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling is associated with many conditions that can compromise young people's health and wellbeing, such as substance use and poor school achievement.  Conversely, low school achievement can be linked to lower socio-economic  position. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine whether compulsory school  achievement is linked with gambling participation and gambling expenditure (GE)  later in youth and whether GE is linked with lower socio-economic position.  METHODS: The Finnish Gambling Harms survey data (n = 7186) were used. The data  were collected in three regions during spring 2017. Participants aged 18-29 years  old were selected from the data. Past-year GE was examined using two measures:  weekly gambling expenditure (WGE, in €) and relative gambling expenditure (RGE,  in %). Logistic regression and log-linear regression models for past-year  gambling, WGE and RGE were created. RESULTS: Persons who had no more than a  mediocre grade point average (GPA) had a 25% higher WGE and 30% higher RGE in  2016 than those who had an outstanding GPA in the compulsory school. Compared  with persons with an outstanding GPA, those with a satisfactory to very good GPA  spent 13% more on gambling, and their RGE was 17% higher. Additionally, those  with lower socio-economic status (SES) had a higher WGE and RGE compared with  higher SES. CONCLUSIONS: Even after controlling for other crucial background  characteristics, early life success, in the form of compulsory school outcomes,  seems to correlate with gambling expenditures later in youth. This suggests that  the gambling behaviour can be linked to the cognitive ability of an individual.  Our findings also imply that gambling could be more heavily concentrated on  individuals that are already more socially disadvantaged. However, it is worth  noting that individual factors such as traumas, antisocial personality, anxiety  and depression are all associated with gambling and poor academic achievement.  Overall, this suggests that various educational tools at a younger age can be  effective in preventing gambling-related problems in later life.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Prevention Paradox (PP) suggests that a large proportion of aggregate harm from gambling occurs to people who do not have a gambling  disorder. However, it has not yet been tested using a population-representative  sample. We aimed to test whether the PP applies to gambling in Finland. The  prevalence rates of diverse harmful consequences from gambling were surveyed  amongst a population-representative sample of past-year gamblers. METHODS: The  study used first wave data (N = 7,186) of Finnish Gambling Harms survey,  collected via online and postal surveys in 2017. A subset of 3,795 adults (≥18  years), who had gambled at least monthly in 2016, were selected for analysis.  MEASUREMENTS: Gambling-related harms were evaluated with the 72-item Harms  Checklist. Problem and Pathological Gambling Measure (PPGM) measured respondents'  probable disordered gambling from the subset of items for impaired control (4  questions) and other issues (3 questions). FINDINGS: Consistent with previous  findings, the majority of harms were reported by those in the less severe PPGM  categories (i.e. scoring <5). However, considering each domain separately, this  was true only for financial, emotional/psychological, and work/study harms. The  PP was not supported for health, relationship, or social deviance harms.  CONCLUSIONS: The population prevalence of the most serious harms (e.g. unsafe  living conditions) is concentrated among those with severe impaired control  issues. However, even excluding the ∼15% of harms occurring to occasional  gamblers, most financial, emotional and work/study impacts occur to those with  lower levels of control issues. Efforts at harm reduction should focus on the  entire spectrum of issues that people experience from their gambling.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe gambling practices and trends in Quebec between 2009 and 2012 given that, in Canada, public funding allocation to address the risks  associated with gambling practices should be based on valid prevalence data and  knowledge of patterns and trends in vulnerable populations. METHODS: The study  data were taken from the 2009 and 2012 cross-sectional waves of the Enquête sur  les habitudes de jeu des Québécois (ENHJEU-Québec). The analytical sample  consisted of 11,888 respondents in 2009 and 12,008 respondents in 2012. RESULTS:  The prevalence of lifetime non-gamblers in the adult population of Quebec  increased from 13.6% in 2009 to 16.4% in 2012, and past-year gambling  participation decreased from 70.5% to 66.2%. Changes in gambling patterns were  not contingent on demographic characteristics; gambling prevalence decreased in  all subcategories. The proportion of problem and low-risk gamblers remained  unchanged, whereas the prevalence of non-problem gamblers decreased significantly  from 66.1% in 2009 to 61.5% in 2012. CONCLUSION: Gambling participation in Quebec  is decreasing, though the proportion of problem gamblers remains stable. Given  these findings, allocation of public resources for health care services should be  maintained. Secondary and primary prevention efforts need to be initiated or  maintained to prevent gambling harm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how children and adults recall the content and promotional channels for sports wagering marketing. METHODS: A mixed methods  study of 152 parent/child (8-16 years) dyads was conducted at AFL (Australian  Football League), NRL (National Rugby League), and soccer sporting sites in New  South Wales and Victoria, Australia. Questions related to the frequency of  viewing AFL and NRL matches, sports wagering promotions and perceptions of the  normalisation of wagering in sport. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis  were used to analyse data. RESULTS: Children recruited from NRL (n=75, 96.2%) and  AFL (n=46, 92.0%) sites were significantly more likely to have recalled having  ever seen a promotion for sports wagering as compared to children from Soccer  sites (n=18, 75.0%) (p<0.05). Children and adults identified seeing sports  wagering promotions in similar environments, most commonly on television, and at  stadiums. Three-quarters of children (75.0%) and the majority of adults (90.0%)  perceived that sports wagering was becoming a normal part of sport. CONCLUSION  AND IMPLICATIONS: This research shows that children engaged in particular sports  have high awareness of wagering marketing, particularly as seen on television or  at sporting matches. Regulation should comprehensively address the placement,  quantity and content of wagering marketing aligned with sport to prevent current  and/or future gambling harm.

AB  - Objectives: The ability to accurately recall past gambling behavior and outcomes is essential for making informed decisions about future gambling. We aimed to  determine whether online gambling customers can accurately recall their recent  gambling outcomes and betting frequency. Method: An online survey was distributed  to 40,000 customers of an Australian sports and race wagering website which asked  participants to recall their past 30-day net outcome (i.e., total amount won or  lost) and number of bets. We compared responses to these questions with  participants' actual outcomes as provided by the online site. Results: Among the  514 participants who reported their net outcome, only 21 (4.09%) were accurate  within a 10% margin of their actual outcome. Participants were most likely to  underestimate their losses (N = 333, 64.79%). Lower actual net losses were  associated with greater underestimation and overestimation of losses. Of the 652  participants who reported their gambling frequency, 48 (7.36%) were accurate  within a 10% margin of their actual frequency. Most participants underestimated  their number of bets (N = 454, 69.63%). Higher actual betting frequencies were  associated with underestimating betting and lower actual frequencies with  overestimating betting. Conclusions: The poor recall accuracy we observed  suggests public health approaches to gambling harm minimization that assume  people make informed decisions about their future bets based on past outcomes and  available funds should be reconsidered. Findings also question the reliability of  research outcomes predicated on self-reported gambling behavior. Research is  needed to determine the best methods of increasing people's awareness of their  actual expenditure and outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all  rights reserved).

AB  - This study compared the experience of gambling related harms between gamblers and spouses, whilst taking into account gender and problem gambling severity.  Participants (N = 5036, 2603 females) from Australia and New Zealand completed a  retrospective survey that probed the prevalence of specific harms from gambling  within six harm domains (financial, work/study, health, emotional/psychological,  relationship, and social deviance). Overall there was a similar count of total  harms reported across all domains experienced by spouses (vs gamblers), however  the types and patterns of harms reported were markedly different. Spouses  reported the highest number of harms within the emotional/psychological and  relationship domains, whereas gamblers experienced a higher number of harms in  all other domains. Spouses were five to six times more likely to report increased  conflict in their relationship due to gambling, greater relationship tension,  and ending a relationship. In comparison, gamblers reported more severe  health-related harms, such as suicide attempts and increased alcohol consumption.  The findings highlight the unique ways in which gamblers and their spouses each  respond to the presence of gambling problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2008, Australia has seen the rapid emergence of marketing for online and mobile sports wagering. Previous research from other areas of public  health, such as tobacco and alcohol, has identified the range of appeal  strategies these industries used to align their products with culturally valued  symbols. However, there is very limited research that has investigated the  tactics the sports wagering industry uses within marketing to influence the  consumption of its products and services. METHOD: This study consisted of a mixed  method interpretive content analysis of 85 sports wagering advertisements from 11  Australian and multinational wagering companies. Advertisements were identified  via internet searches and industry websites. A coding framework was applied to  investigate the extent and nature of symbolic appeal strategies within  advertisements. RESULTS: Ten major appeal strategies emerged from this analysis.  These included sports fan rituals and behaviours; mateship; gender stereotypes;  winning; social status; adventure, thrill and risk; happiness; sexualised  imagery; power and control; and patriotism. Symbols relating to sports fan  rituals and behaviours, and mateship, were the most common strategies used within  the advertisements. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that the  appeal strategies used by the sports wagering industry are similar to those  strategies adopted by other unhealthy commodity industries. With respect to  gambling, analysis revealed that strategies are clearly targeted to young male  sports fans. Researchers and public health practitioners should seek to better  understand the impact of marketing on the normalisation of sports wagering for  this audience segment, and implement strategies to prevent gambling harm.

AU  - Livingstone, Charles

T2  - Addiction (Abingdon, England)
AB  - Commercial gambling is expanding rapidly across the globe. However, the field of gambling research has not kept pace with this expansion, and continues to focus  on prevalence studies and individuated treatment regimes, with little attention  to the political, economic or technological underpinnings of commercial gambling.  The implications of this lack of sophistication in the research agenda are that  society is ill-equipped to understand the nature and underlying causes of  gambling harms, and how these might best be avoided, minimized or ameliorated.  Around the world, various levels of government benefit from gambling revenue,  with consequences for the independent regulation of gambling. Further, there is  considerable industry influence on the research agenda, often involving similar  techniques to those employed previously by the tobacco and alcohol industries to  engage researchers. This influence is compounded by a failure of many gambling  researchers and journals to adopt traditional academic safeguards, such as the  disclosure of conflicts of interest, and by many arguing for a 'partnership  model' with industry to advance the research agenda. This paper identifies five  basic principles to restore reasonable standards of integrity in gambling  studies: (1) research should not be funded by the proceeds of gambling; (2)  research priorities should not be influenced by the beneficiaries of gambling;  (3) conferences and other research fora should not be influenced by industry; (4)  funding sources should be disclosed in journals and at conferences; and (5)  meaningful access to gambling products and environments must be part of  licensing. We also propose a range of actions to promote greater transparency and  independence in the gambling research field.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Direct messaging via text messages (texts) and emails is a widely used method to advertise sports and race-betting offers. However, they  have attracted little research, as this advertising is not in the public domain.  This study aimed to determine whether betting expenditure is related to receiving  direct wagering messages, and the specific inducements they promote. We  hypothesized that receiving direct messages, particularly texts, would be related  to betting expenditure within 24 hr. METHODS: In this ecological momentary  assessment study, regular sports (n = 98) and race (n = 104) bettors from  Australia completed short daily surveys over 1 week that captured exposure to  direct messages, betting behavior in the previous 24 hr, and betting intention  for the next 24 hr. Respondents were asked to forward any texts and emails  received to the researchers, who coded them for inducement content. RESULTS:  Longitudinal analyses found that receiving emails was positively associated with  betting intention, whereas texts were positively associated with higher  likelihood of betting and betting expenditure. These effects persisted when  controlling for problem gambling status and signature betting events. Refund  stake and bonus odds inducements were positively associated with likelihood of  race betting (although not in multivariate models), as were bonus winnings  inducements for sports betting. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Direct messages,  particularly texts, are powerful marketing tools, encouraging a nearly immediate,  and arguably impulsive, betting response, which may increase gambling-related  problems. Overseeing this private form of advertising presents challenges to  regulators, and to public health efforts that aim to reduce gambling harm.

AB  - Gambling and sports are entangled in a close relationship. However, little remains known about gambling behaviors and perceptions in sports. Drawing on  normalization theory, this study explores the prevalence and predictors of  problem gambling as well as the normalization of gambling (including its  availability and accessibility, prevalence, and socio-cultural accommodation) in  sports clubs. A cross-sectional study design was implemented, based on an online  survey completed by 817 Belgian sports club actors. This survey consisted of the  Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and questions about personal and  socio-cultural factors regarding gambling. Data were analyzed with SPSS 26  software, using descriptive statistics and an ordinal logistic regression  analysis. These analyses exposed being male, being aged 26-35 years old, and  being involved in football (soccer) as factors that might be linked with higher  levels of problem gambling in sports. Furthermore, sports betting is especially  shown to be normalized in sports clubs given its prevalence, and its frequently  organized and discussed character. Moreover, respondents disclosed a lack of  formal rules (96%) and education initiatives (98.7%) on gambling in their sports  club. Given the indicated support for gambling regulations and educational  measures, this study may inform sports organizations about how to help  denormalize gambling.

T2  - Addictive behaviors
AB  - Children of problem gamblers are at risk of harm, however, there are no population level estimates as to how many children are currently exposed to  parental problem- and at-risk gambling. The current study analysed data from the  Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, a nationally  representative survey, to derive the first ever national estimates of the  proportion of problem, moderate, and low risk gamblers (as measured by PGSI) in  the Australian parent population. It also reports how many children under  15 years of age in Australia are exposed to parental gambling across the gambling  risk categories. The results show that 13.7% of all Australian families with  dependent children are currently exposed to some level of gambling risk due to  parental gambling, and nearly 4% of families with children are exposed to  parental moderate risk or problem gambling. This corresponds to almost 200,000  children each year. The results and approach of this study will guide future  examination of child wellbeing in families where parents experience problems with  gambling. The results are discussed in the context of public health approaches to  familial gambling harm.

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - A number of studies have explored the relationship between religious beliefs and gambling (including gambling fallacies and gambling harm) but report seemingly  contradictory findings. While some studies have found religious belief to be  positively associated with gambling fallacies, others have found it to be a  protective factor from gambling harms. One explanation for these differing  effects is that gambling fallacies and metaphysical religious belief share  properties of supernatural and magical thinking. Nevertheless, social support and  moral strictures associated with religion might help protect against an unhealthy  engagement with gambling. Using a multidimensional measure of religiosity, we  hypothesised that only the supernatural facet of religious adherence would  present a risk for gambling fallacies. We analysed two archival data sources  collected in Canada (Quinte Longitudinal Study: N = 4121, M(age) = 46,  SD(age) = 14, Female = 54%; Leisure, Lifestyle and Lifecycle Project: N = 1372,  M(age) = 37, SD(age) = 17, Female = 56%). Using the Rohrbaugh-Jessor Religiosity  Scale, we confirmed that the supernatural theistic domain of religion was a  positive risk factor for gambling fallacies. However, participation in ritual  (behavioural) aspects, such as churchgoing, was negatively associated with risk,  and no effect was observed for the consequential (moral) domain. We conclude that  multidimensional aspects in religious measures may account for conflicting prior  findings.

AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Older adults are at an increased risk of experiencing gambling harm, which may be due to their use of high-intensity gambling products such as  electronic gambling machines (EGMs). However, little research has explored the  motivations behind older adults' engagement with EGMs, their understanding of the  structural characteristics of EGMs, or their perceptions of risk associated with  EGM gambling. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. METHODS:  Focus groups were conducted in Melbourne, Australia with n = 126 adults aged 55+,  who had attended a club or pub in the last 12 months. Topics included EGM  attitudes and behaviours, structural characteristics of EGMs, and the potential  risks associated with EGM gambling. Thematic analysis was used to interpret the  data. RESULTS: For most participants, EGM gambling was secondary to their  participation in other activities available within venues. Participants  identified structural characteristics of EGMs; however, there were some  misconceptions about how EGMs operated, including how or why machines paid out.  Most participants perceived that they were not at risk of gambling harm because  they engaged in "responsible" gambling practices such as setting limits.  CONCLUSIONS: Older adults often engaged in EGM gambling because of its  availability in community-based venues. Older adults' perception that they are  implementing responsible gambling practices may be increasing their  susceptibility to harm. SO WHAT?: There is a need to reduce the availability and  accessibility of EGMs in community settings and develop public education programs  that are tailored to the needs of older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Excessive time and money spent on gambling can result in harms, not only to people experiencing a gambling problem but also to their close  family and friends ("concerned significant others"; CSOs). The current study  aimed to explore whether, and to what extent, CSOs experience decrements to their  wellbeing due to another person's gambling. METHODS: We analysed data from The  Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA; N = 19,064) and  the Canadian Quinte Longitudinal Study (QLS; N = 3,904). Participants either  self-identified as CSOs (QLS) or were identified by living in a household with a  person classified in the problem gambling category by the PGSI (HILDA).  Subjective well-being was measured using the Personal Wellbeing Index and  single-item questions on happiness and satisfaction with life. RESULTS: CSOs  reported lower subjective wellbeing than non-CSOs across both countries and on  all three wellbeing measures. CSO status remained a significant predictor of  lower wellbeing after controlling for demographic and socio-economic factors, and  own-gambling problems. There were no significant differences across various  relationships to the gambler, by gender, or between household and non-household  CSOs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Gambling-related harms experienced by CSOs was  reliably associated with a decrease in wellbeing. This decrement to CSO's  wellbeing was not as strong as that experienced by the person with the  first-order gambling problem. Nevertheless, wellbeing decrements to CSOs are not  limited to those living with a person with gambling problems in the household and  thus affect many people.

AB  - PURPOSE: Harms due to excessive gambling can be experienced by gamblers and those close to them. Family gambling problems (FGPs) are currently under-researched,  particularly in population-representative samples. This study aimed to identify  prevalence, risk factors, and the complex of stressors and health-related  consequences associated with FGPs, as well as isolating the impact of FGPs on  physical and psychological health problems. METHODS: We analysed data from the  National Health Survey 2011-13, a large (N = 15,475) nationally representative  sample of Australian adults. Participants reported on the presence of 14 family  stressors (including FGPs), self-assessed health status, and risky health  behaviours. Psychological impact was measured by the Kessler Psychological  Distress Scale-10, as well as several indicators of the presence of mental health  problems. RESULTS: Overall, 1.7% of households reported a FGP. Interviewees in  these households reported three times the number of other stressors than those  without a FGP. In addition, they were around eight times more likely to be  experiencing other addictions (drug and alcohol related problems) and stressors  associated with socially deviant behaviours (trouble with police, abuse or  violent crime, and witness to violence). Once age, gender, socioeconomic  disadvantage, and other stressors were controlled for, FGPs significantly  predicted lower self-assessed health and higher psychological distress.  CONCLUSIONS: FGPs occur within a complex of other addictions and stressors,  impacting the quality of life of people close to problem gambling. The findings  are discussed in relation to their support for General Strain Theory (Agnew,  Criminology 30:47-87, 1992).

T2  - Frontiers in psychiatry
AB  - Internationally, Internet gambling is increasingly permitted under regulated licensing conditions; however, the specific products that are legal varies  between jurisdictions. Online sports and race wagering are now legal in many  jurisdictions, but in-play betting (also referred to as "live action" or  "in-the-run" betting) is often restricted. In-play betting enables bets to be  placed on an event after it has commenced. Prohibitionist policies often cite the  potential for this type of betting to increase risk of gambling problems. This  study aimed to identify which online bettors are most likely to engage in in-play  betting, and to investigate the relationship between in-play betting and gambling  problems. Online survey responses were collected from 501 Australian past-month  online sports bettors in the context of in-play betting only being available on  offshore gambling sites or via telephone betting. Thirty-four percent of  participants had placed a bet in-play in the past month. Participants placing  in-play bets differed from those who had not in terms of education, employment  status, ethnicity, age, and gambling involvement. Those who bet in-play had  higher problem gambling severity scores than those who did not bet in-play.  Problem gambling severity significantly predicting in-play betting, holding other  variables constant. Findings are consistent with previous research indicating  that the relationship between in-play gambling and problems holds across  jurisdictions which have prohibited and legalized in-play betting. The findings  suggest that in-play betting should warrant specific regulatory attention and  interventions to minimize gambling harms among individuals that engage with this  activity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between socio-demographic factors, gambling behaviour, and the level of gambling expenditure. The data were  drawn from the population-based Gambling Harms Survey 2016 and 2017 conducted in  Finland. The data were linked to register-based variables. Past-year gamblers  were included (Wave 1; n = 5 805, both Waves; n = 2 165). The study showed that  of the 4.2 % of gamblers that produced 50.0 % of the total GE in 2016, 33.1 % of  the GE was produced by those with a gambling problem and 43.3 % by those with  at-risk gambling pattern. Compared to gamblers in the lowest GE group, those in  the highest GE group were more likely to be men, aged 25 or older, with upper  secondary education, have a high income, be on disability pension or sickness  allowance, be frequent gamblers, gambling at least six game types, and showing  at-risk and problem gambling patterns. Cumulative weekly GE by income tertiles  remained fairly stable between the years. The results suggest that GE is highly  concentrated. Among the small group of high-intensity consumers, the majority of  the revenue comes from at-risk and problem gambling. Participants in the low GE  group differ from those in the intermediate and high GE groups in terms of  socio-demographics and gambling behaviour.

AB  - The burden of harm from problem gambling weighs heavily on those experiencing poverty and homelessness, yet most problem gambling prevention and treatment  services are not designed to address the complex needs and challenges of this  population. To redress this service gap, a multi-service agency within a shelter  setting in a large urban centre developed and implemented a population-tailored,  person-centred, evidence-informed gambling addiction program for its clients. The  purpose of this article is to report on qualitative findings from an early  evaluation of the program, the first designed to address problem gambling for  people experiencing poverty and/or homelessness and delivered within a shelter  service agency. Three themes emerged which were related to three program outcome  categories. These included increasing awareness of gambling harms and reducing  gambling behaviour; reorienting relationships with money; and, seeking, securing,  and stabilizing shelter. The data suggest that problem gambling treatment within  the context of poverty and homelessness benefits from an approach and setting  that meets the unique needs of this community. The introduction of gambling  treatment into this multi-service delivery model addressed the complex needs of  the service users through integrated and person-centered approaches to care that  responded to client needs, fostered therapeutic relationships, reduced  experiences of discrimination and stigma, and enhanced recovery. In developing  the Gambling Addiction Program, the agency drew on evidence-based approaches to  problem gambling treatment and extensive experience working with the target  population. Within a short timeframe, the program supported participants in the  process of recovery, enhancing their understanding and control of their gambling  selves, behaviours, and harms. This project demonstrates that gambling within the  context of poverty requires a unique treatment space and approach.

T2  - European journal of public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns that Internet gambling has elevated the prevalence of problem gambling have not been substantiated; however, evidence suggests a  subgroup of Internet gamblers do experience higher rates of gambling harms.  Greater overall involvement in gambling appears to be predictive of harms. The  purpose of this study was to examine differences between Internet gamblers with a  single or multiple online gambling accounts, including their gambling behaviours,  factors influencing their online gambling and risk of experiencing gambling  problems. METHODS: Internet gamblers (3178) responding to an online survey that  assessed their gambling behaviour, and use of single or multiple online gambling  accounts. RESULTS: Results revealed that multiple account holders were more  involved gamblers, gambling on more activities and more frequently, and had  higher rates of gambling problems than single account holders. Multiple account  holders selected gambling sites based on price, betting options, payout rates and  game experience, whereas single account holders prioritized legality and consumer  protection features. CONCLUSION: Results suggest two different types of Internet  gamblers: one motivated to move between sites to optimize preferred experiences  with a tendency to gamble in a more volatile manner; and a smaller, but more  stable group less influenced by promotions and experiences, and seeking a  reputable and safe gambling experience. As the majority of Internet gamblers use  multiple accounts, more universal responsible gambling strategies are needed to  assist gamblers to track and control their expenditure to reduce risks of harm.

TI  - Measuring Behavioural Dependence in Gambling: A Case for Removing Harmful Consequences from the Assessment of Problem Gambling Pathology.
AU  - Browne, Matthew
AU  - Rockloff, Matthew J.
T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Behavioural dependence (BD) for gambling has traditionally been subsumed under the concept of 'problems': a hybrid construct that includes both indicators of  BD, and adverse consequences (harm) arising from excessive time and money  expenditure. Although progress has been made towards specific measurement of  harm, dedicated measures of BD do not exist. Theory led us to expect that (1)  dependence and harm are measurably distinct constructs, (2) harm mediates the  relationship between dependence and wellbeing, and finally, that (3) separate  measures should be more effective than a unidimensional problems measure in  predicting wellbeing. Candidate BD items from six existing measures of gambling  problems were extracted and evaluated with respect to DSM-5 criteria and content  overlap, leading to 17 candidate items. This was further reduced to 8 items based  on both item content and psychometric criteria, using data from an online panel  of 1524 regular gamblers, with demographic characteristics similar to Australian  population norms. Participants also completed measures of harm, problems, and  subjective wellbeing. All three hypotheses were confirmed. BD was shown to be  highly reliable and unidimensional, and measurably distinct from gambling harms.  Harm mediated the negative relationship between BD and wellbeing. The harm + BD  model yielded better predictions of personal wellbeing that a unidimensional,  continuous problems measure-and explained about twice the variance of a simple  contrast between problem and non-problem gamblers. We conclude that is  psychometrically justified to specifically measure gambling BD, and this may be  of particular use in theoretically-driven applications.

Thirty (9 male, 21 female) adults with a lifetime diagnosis  of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and  lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study. Participants completed  electronic diary entries of their current affective state, desire to gamble, and  gambling behavior for 30 consecutive days. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed  that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior. Instead, affect predicted  the desire to gamble, with high levels of sadness and arousal independently  predicting an increased desire to gamble. Desire to gamble predicted actual  gambling behavior. There were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of  gambling motivations at baseline; however, during the 30-day period, participants  with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often  than did participants with depressive disorder, whereas those with depressive  disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of  positive affect. The present findings provide evidence that negative affect is  not directly related to actual gambling behavior, and suggest that affective  states rather impact the desire to gamble.

TI  - The Temporal Stability and Predictive Ability of the Gambling Outcome Expectancies Scale (GOES): A Prospective Study.
AU  - Flack, Mal

T2  - Journal of gambling studies
AB  - Previous research using the Gambling Outcome Expectancies Scale (GOES; Flack and Morris in J Gambl Stud, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s10899-014-9484-z ) revealed the  instrument has excellent psychometric properties and differentially predicts  gambling frequency and problem gambling scores. However, like the existing  gambling motivation scales, the GOES psychometric properties and predictive  utility have not been tested outside of cross sectional studies. The current  study used a prospective survey design to redress this issue. Eight hundred and  ninety-three participants, drawn from the general community, completed the second  wave of the gambling survey. Temporal invariance testing revealed the GOES was  reliable. Furthermore, the ability of the GOES to predict gambling behaviour  using baseline and concurrent measures of gambling outcome expectancies was  demonstrated. Specifically, consistent with the Wave 1 results, the gambling  outcome expectancies that reflect diverse reasons for gambling (e.g., social,  escape, and money) preferentially predicted gambling frequency whereas the  narrower range of emotion focused reasons (e.g., excitement, escape, and ego  enhancement) predicted gambling problems. Considered in light of the Wave 1  findings, these results underscore the need for gambling harm minimisation  initiatives to take into account the emotion-oriented reasons for gambling.

T2  - Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the impact of gambling problems on quality of life. Specifically, we generated disability weight estimates for gambling  problems in New Zealand, and compared these results with (i) Australian figures  (J Gambl Issues, 10.4309/jgi.v0i36.3978, 2017) and (ii) other health states  (Lancet, 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61680-8, 2013); such as anxiety and alcohol use  disorders. METHOD: The 324 participants (48 experts and 276 general population  members) evaluated a series of gambling harm vignettes. The participants rated  the decrement to one's quality of life using Visual Analogue Scale and Time  Trade-Off protocols (Br Med Bull, 10.1093/bmb/ldq033, 2010). These evaluations  enabled the calculation of disability weights for three categories of gamblers  (low-risk, moderate-risk, and problem gamblers). RESULTS: Disability weight  estimates for low-risk, moderate-risk, and problem gamblers in NZ were  consistently higher than the Australian weights: low (0.18 vs. 0.13), moderate  (0.37 vs. 0.29), and problem (0.54 vs. 0.44). The quality of life impact for  problem gambling in NZ (0.54) was comparable to that experienced in severe  alcohol use disorder (0.55) (Lancet, 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61680-8, 2013).  CONCLUSIONS: This study represents one of the first attempts to assess  gambling-related harm through a public health perspective. The results of this  study are informative for policy-making, resource allocation, and service  planning. These estimates now allow for the population-level impact of gambling  in NZ to be calculated and tracked over time, which is essential for informing  harm-minimisation initiatives.

TI  - The politics and fantasy of the gambling education discourse: An analysis of gambling industry-funded youth education programmes in the United Kingdom.

T2  - SSM - population health
AB  - BACKGROUND: The provision of commercialised gambling products and services has changed radically in recent decades. Gambling is now provided in many places by  multi-national corporations, with important implications for public health and  policymaking. The United Kingdom is one of the most liberalised gambling markets  globally, however there are few empirical analyses of gambling policy from a  public health perspective. This study aims to provide a critical analysis of a  core element of UK gambling policy, the provision of industry-funded youth  gambling education programmes. METHODS: Adopting a commercial determinants of  health lens, a discourse theoretical analysis was conducted using the logics of  critical explanation. The data comprised resources provided by three gambling  industry-funded charities (GambleAware, GamCare and the Young Gamers and Gamblers  Education Trust) and their partners. RESULTS: The resources present a gambling  education discourse that serves to reproduce the 'responsible gambling' agenda,  while problematising children and young people. While the resources appear to  offer educational content and opportunities for debate, the dominant focus is on  teaching about personal responsibility and on the normalisation of gambling and  gaming and their industries, while constraining the concept of agency. The  resources encourage young people to act as individuals to control their impulses,  and to correct what are portrayed as faulty cognitions with the aim of becoming  responsible consumers. Our findings demonstrate how the gambling education  discourse aligns with wider industry interests, serving to deflect from the  harmful nature of the products and services they market while shifting  responsibility for harm onto children, youth and their families. CONCLUSIONS:  Despite being delivered in the name of public health, the resources construct a  discourse favourable to corporate interests. Educators, parents, policymakers,  and others need to be empowered to address the conflicts of interest that exist  in the delivery of gambling industry-funded resources. The promotion of such  industry-favoured interventions should not be allowed to undermine efforts to  implement regulations to prevent gambling harms.

AB  - This study aimed to develop an empirically based description of relapse in Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) problem gambling (PG) by describing the processes  and factors that 'pull' the problem gambler away from relapse contrasted with the  'push' towards relapse. These conceptualisations describe two opposing,  interacting emotional processes occurring within the problem gambler during any  relapse episode. Each relapse episode comprises a complex set of psychological  and social behaviours where many factors interact sequentially and simultaneously  within the problem gambler to produce a series of mental and behaviour events  that end (1) with relapse where 'push' overcomes 'pull' or (2) continued  abstinence where 'pull' overcomes 'push'. Four focus groups comprising thirty  participants who were EGM problem gamblers, gamblers' significant others,  therapists and counsellors described their experiences and understanding of  relapse. The groups were recorded, recordings were then transcribed and analysed  using thematic textual analysis. It was established that vigilance, motivation to  commit to change, positive social support, cognitive strategies such as  remembering past gambling harms or distraction techniques to avoid thinking about  gambling to enable gamblers to manage the urge to gamble and urge extinction were  key factors that protected against relapse. Three complementary theories emerged  from the analysis. Firstly, a process of reappraisal of personal gambling  behaviour pulls the gambler away from relapse. This results in a commitment to  change that develops over time and affects but is independent of each episode of  relapse. Secondly, relapse may be halted by interacting factors that 'pull' the  problem gambler away from the sequence of mental and behavioural events, which  follow the triggering of the urge and cognitions to gamble. Thirdly, urge  extinction and apparent 'cure' is possible for EGM gambling. This study provides  a qualitative, empirical model for understanding protective factors against  gambling relapse.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Harmful gambling has been identified as an important public health issue that affects individuals, families and the broader community. One gambling  product, electronic gambling machines (EGMs), has been associated with  significant gambling harm in Australia. There has been limited research that has  explored community perceptions of EGMs and attitudes towards reform. This study,  conducted in NSW, Australia, aimed to explore community use of EGM venues (clubs  and hotels containing EGMs), attitudes towards EGMs and whether the use of these  venues influenced attitudes towards EGM reform. METHODS: An online survey was  conducted with 500 adults aged 16 years and over, representative of the  population for age and gender. Discrete choice and open-ended questions were used  to gather data on gambling behaviours, use of and attitudes towards EGMs and EGM  venues and support for gambling harm reduction measures. RESULTS: Three quarters  of participants had visited an EGM venue in the previous year. Participants who  had attended such venues were significantly more likely to use EGMs at least once  per month. Participants attended EGM venues for a range of reasons including use  of non-gambling facilities such as restaurants, the social aspects of the venue  and ease of access to the venue. Some participants also attended EGM venues  specifically for the gambling facilities. Most participants identified some  negative impacts of EGMs for local communities and were supportive of measures to  reduce the number of EGMs and prevent children's exposure to EGMs in such venues.  CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high level of support for EGM reform amongst both  individuals who attend EGM venues and also those who do not. There is potential  for government to further regulate EGMs and the environments where they are  located.

AB  - Survey responses from a sample of nearly 15,000 Australian sports fans were used to study the determinants of: (i) gambling behaviour, including if a person does  gamble and the type of gambling engaged with; (ii) the number of sports and  non-sports bets made over a 12-month period; and (iii) attitudes towards betting  on sports. The probability of betting on sports decreased with increasing age and  was lower for women and people with a university education. This gender  difference varied with age, with the greatest difference found among the young.  Similar effects were observed for the number of sports bets made, which declined  with age. The gender difference in the number of sports bets also varied with age  with the greatest difference found among the young arising from the high  propensity of young men to bet on sports. Attitudes to sports betting were also  analysed, with a key finding that, within friendship circles, the views that  sports betting is perceived as harmless, common and very much a part of enjoying  sports were stronger among young men. These permissive attitudes were stronger  among people who bet on sports and those who bet on sports more frequently. The  analysis of sports fans provides insights into the characteristics of the target  market most likely to bet on sports, which can be used to inform public health  initiatives and harm reduction campaigns.

AB  - Gambling is rapidly emerging as an important public health issue, with gambling products causing considerable health and social harms to individuals, families  and communities. Whilst researchers have raised concerns about online wagering  environments, few studies have sought to explore how factors within different  gambling environments (both online and land-based) may be influencing the  wagering, and more broadly the gambling risk behaviours of young men. Using  semi-structured interviews with 50 Australian men (20-37 years) who gambled on  sport, we explored the ways in which online and land-based environments may be  risk-promoting settings for gambling. This included the appeal factors associated  with gambling in these environments, factors that encouraged individuals to  gamble, and factors that encouraged individuals to engage in different, and more  harmful types of gambling. Interviews were conducted over the course of a year  (April 2015 - April 2016). We identified a number of situational and structural  factors that promoted risky gambling environments for young men. In the online  environment, gambling products had become exceedingly easy to access through  mobile technologies, with young men subscribing to multiple accounts to access  industry promotions. The intangibility of money within online environments  impacted upon risk perceptions. In land-based environments, the social rituals  associated with peer group behaviour and sport influenced risky patterns of  gambling. The presence of both gambling and alcohol in pub environments led  individuals to gamble more than they normally would, and on products that they  would not normally gamble on. Land-based venues also facilitated access to  multiple forms of gambling under the one roof. We identified a number of factors  in both land and online environments that when combined, created risk-promoting  settings for gambling among young men. By exploring these contextual conditions  that give rise to gambling harm, we are better able to advocate for effective  public health responses in creating environments that prevent harmful gambling.

T2  - Scandinavian journal of public health
AB  - AIMS: This study investigates the proportion of concerned significant others (CSOs) of problem gamblers at population level and describes the extent and type  of gambling harms for CSOs. METHODS: Cross-sectional random sample data ( n =  4515) were collected in 2015. The data were weighted based on age, gender and  residence. CSOs were identified using a question including seven options.  Gambling harms were inquired using structured questions. Descriptive statistics  and Chi-Squared and Fischer's exact tests were used. RESULTS: Overall, the  proportion of CSOs was 19.3%. Males had close friends with gambling problems more  often than females, while females had family members with gambling problems more  often than males. Of the CSOs, 59.5% had experienced one or more harms. Females  experienced more harms than males. Typical harms were worry about health or  well-being of close ones, emotional distress and problems in interpersonal  relationships. CSOs with a problem gambler in the family, particularly a partner,  child/children or mother, experienced harms more often than CSOs with a problem  gambler as a close friend. CONCLUSIONS: Female gender was associated with a  larger extent of harms. The extent of harms was greatest if the problem gambler  was a family member; however, a substantial amount of harms were experienced when  the problem gambler was a close friend. CSOs and their position in evaluating  gambling harms in general should be acknowledged. Persons beyond the nuclear  family and the harms they encounter should be better acknowledged in prevention  and harm minimisation. Early identification and a clear referral path to tailored  support in occupational, social and healthcare settings may be considered.

AB  - Gambling harms can impact the health and wellbeing of both individuals who gamble and those close to them. While harms occur across a spectrum of gambling risk  levels, most research is conducted on people close to those gamblers who have  severe problems. This study examined the health and wellbeing of people living  with gamblers across the entire spectrum of gambling risk levels, via secondary  analysis of the nationally-representative Household Income and Labour Dynamics in  Australia Survey (HILDA). The subsample of interest comprised 13,698 respondents  without a gambling problem of their own, aged between 15 and 84, and who lived in  households where all residents completed the Problem Gambling Severity Index  (PGSI). Health and wellbeing were measured via the SF-6D, the SF-36, and  subjective wellbeing measures. Compared to those living in non-problem gambling  households, participants living in problem-gambling households reported  significantly lower mean SF-6D scores, lower scores on the SF-36 mental health  domain, and significantly less satisfaction with both their financial situation  and with feeling part of their local community. Participants living in  moderate-risk gambling households also reported less satisfaction with their  financial situation than those in non-problem gambling households. Conclusions:  The results indicate that measurable impacts to the health and wellbeing of those  living with gamblers occur predominantly at the more severe end of the risk level  spectrum, except for financial dissatisfaction, which is also evident in those  residing with gamblers categorised as moderate-risk.

AB  - AIMS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many treatment or help services for gambling were closed or moved online. At the same time, closures of gambling opportunities  impacted gambling availability and practices. This study investigates gamblers'  and their concerned significant others' (CSOs) experiences and views on treatment  and help services during this exceptional time and perceptions on how to develop  services further after the pandemic. DESIGN: Three online questionnaires to  elicit gambler and CSO experiences were conducted during the spring 2020 in  Finland. In total, 847 respondents answered and shared experiences on how the  situation had impacted their gambling behaviour and service needs, how service  closures or the moving of services online had impacted them, and how they thought  the prevention and treatment of gambling harms should be organised during and  after COVID-19. RESULTS: Changed gambling practices reduced overall service  needs. Service closures had negative impacts, but online services were considered  positively, as these provided a low-threshold option. Respondents also shared  insights into how the service provision for gamblers should further be developed  during and after COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling can cause significant health and social harms for individuals, their families, and communities. While many studies have explored  the individual factors that may lead to and minimise harmful gambling, there is  still limited knowledge about the broader range of factors that may contribute to  gambling harm. There are significant regulations to prevent the marketing of some  forms of gambling but comparatively limited regulations relating to the marketing  of newer forms of online gambling such as sports betting. There is a need for  better information about how marketing strategies may be shaping betting  attitudes and behaviours and the range of policy and regulatory responses that  may help to prevent the risky or harmful consumption of these products. METHODS:  We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 50 Australian men (aged  20-37 years) who gambled on sports. We explored their attitudes and opinions  regarding sports betting marketing, the embedding of marketing within sports and  other non-gambling community environments, and the implications this had for the  normalisation of betting. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that most of the  environments in which participants reported seeing or hearing betting  advertisements were not in environments specifically designed for betting.  Participants described that the saturation of marketing for betting products,  including through sports-based commentary and sports programming, normalised  betting. Participants described that the inducements offered by the industry were  effective marketing strategies in getting themselves and other young men to bet  on sports. Inducements were also linked with feelings of greater control over  betting outcomes and stimulated some individuals to sign up with more than one  betting provider. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that marketing plays a  strong role in the normalisation of gambling in sports. This has the potential to  increase the risks and subsequent harms associated with these products.  Legislators must begin to consider the cultural lag between an evolving gambling  landscape, which supports sophisticated marketing strategies, and effective  policies and practices which aim to reduce and prevent gambling harm.

TI  - The 'Merry-Go-Round' of Habitual Relapse: A Qualitative Study of Relapse in Electronic Gaming Machine Problem Gambling.

T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our understanding of gambling relapse is limited despite the damaging consequences affecting many aspects of the gambler's life. Paradoxically,  regardless of these negative consequences problem gamblers (PGs) continue to  relapse, seemingly unable to stop this cycle of harm. This paper addresses the  phenomenon of repeated gambling relapse shedding some insights into why gamblers  continue to relapse. METHODS: The study comprised of (n = 54) participants  purposefully selected who participated in either 1 of 5 focus groups (n = 35) or  in-depth interviews (n = 19). The new knowledge obtained was from PGs,  significant others, and workers with direct experience of gambling relapse.  Interview recordings were analysed using thematic, textual analysis. RESULTS: The  avoidance of negative emotions from the consequences of the destructive behaviour  associated with repeated relapse leads to a hopeless "merry-go-round". Once on  this "merry go round", relapse becomes a habitual way of life where behaviour  change and learning from the devastation of a gambling relapse is challenging.  Exiting this cycle means PGs must face the consequences of their gambling which  for many is overwhelming, and relapse is a way to avoid despair. CONCLUSIONS:  These findings provide insights into relapse which has implications for gamblers  seeking treatment, assessment and treatment "drop-outs".

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented restrictions on people's movements and interactions, as well as the cancellation of major sports events and social  activities, directly altering the gambling landscape. There is urgent need to  provide regulators, policy makers and treatment providers with evidence on the  patterns and context of gambling during COVID-19 and its aftermath. This protocol  describes a study addressing the following three questions: (1) How has COVID-19  changed gambling practices and the risk factors for, and experience of, gambling  harms? (2) What is the effect of COVID-19 on gambling marketing? (3) How has  COVID-19 changed high risk groups' gambling experiences and practices? This  mixed-method study focuses on two groups, namely young adults and sports bettors.  In workpackage-1, we will extend an existing longitudinal survey of gambling in  young adults (aged 16-24 years) (first wave conducted June-August 2019), adding  COVID-19-related questions to the second wave (July-August 2020) and extending to  a third wave in 2021; and undertake a survey of sports bettors in the UK  (baseline n = 4000, ~July-August 2020), with follow-ups in ~October-November 2020  and ~February-March 2021. In workpackage-2, we will examine changes in  expenditure on paid-for gambling advertising from January 2019 to July 2021 and  undertake a mixed-method content analysis of a random sample of paid-for gambling  advertising (n ~ 200) and social media marketing (n ~ 100) during the initial  COVID-19 "lockdown". Workpackage-3 will involve qualitative interviews with a  purposive sample of (a) young adults (aged 18-24 years) and (b) sports bettors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic gambling machines (EGMs) are amongst the most harmful forms of gambling. The high availability of EGMs is also linked to increased  consumption. To reduce the burden of EGMs on public health, policies to reduce  their numbers have recently been introduced in Italy and Finland. This study  compares the aims and justifications of these legislative changes, as well as  their overall impacts on total consumption. METHODS: The objectives and  justifications of policies to reduce the number of EGMs were based on qualitative  media analysis. The impacts on total consumption were measured using financial  figures provided by gambling providers in Italy and Finland. RESULTS: Results  show that the reductions in EGM numbers were justified in terms of public health  concerns in both countries, but the amplitude of policies varied. In Italy, the  reductions were more ambitious than in Finland, and included reductions in the  number of gambling locations. The financial data nevertheless indicated that the  reductions may not have been significant enough. CONCLUSIONS: Public health  concerns were initially highlighted in the media discussions, but eventually in  both countries reduction policies were less ambitious due to industry lobbying  and state revenue interests. The reductions therefore do not appear to have been  effective in reducing total consumption and the burden on public health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many people who experience harm and problems from gambling do not seek treatment from gambling treatment services because of personal and resource  barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are widely used across diverse  health care areas and populations. However, there are few in the gambling harm  field, despite their potential as an additional modality for delivering treatment  and support. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the needs, preferences, and  priorities of people experiencing gambling harms and who are potential end users  of a cognitive behavioral therapy mHealth intervention to inform design,  features, and functions. METHODS: Drawing on a mixed methods approach, we used  creators and domain experts to review the GAMBLINGLESS web-based program and  convert it into an mHealth prototype. Each module was reviewed against the  original evidence base to maintain its intended fidelity and conceptual  integrity. Early wireframes, design ideas (look, feel, and function), and content  examples were developed to initiate discussions with end users. Using a  cocreation process with a young adult, a Māori, and a Pasifika peoples group, all  with experiences of problem or harmful gambling, we undertook 6 focus groups: 2  cycles per group. In each focus group, participants identified preferences,  features, and functions for inclusion in the final design and content of the  mHealth intervention. RESULTS: Over 3 months, the GAMBLINGLESS web-based  intervention was reviewed and remapped from 4 modules to 6. This revised program  is based on the principles underpinning the transtheoretical model, in which it  is recognized that some end users will be more ready to change than others.  Change is a process that unfolds over time, and a nonlinear progression is  common. Different intervention pathways were identified to reflect the end users'  stage of change. In all, 2 cycles of focus groups were then conducted, with 30  unique participants (13 Māori, 9 Pasifika, and 8 young adults) in the first  session and 18 participants (7 Māori, 6 Pasifika, and 5 young adults) in the  second session. Prototype examples demonstrably reflected the focus group  discussions and ideas, and the features, functions, and designs of the Manaaki  app were finalized. Attributes such as personalization, cultural relevance, and  positive framing were identified as the key. Congruence of the final app  attributes with the conceptual frameworks of the original program was also  confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Those who experience gambling harms may not seek help.  Developing and demonstrating the effectiveness of new modalities to provide  treatment and support are required. mHealth has the potential to deliver  interventions directly to the end user. Weaving the underpinning theory and  existing evidence of effective treatment with end-user input into the design and  development of mHealth interventions does not guarantee success. However, it  provides a foundation for framing the intervention's mechanism, context, and  content, and arguably provides a greater chance of demonstrating effectiveness.

AB  - This article examines gambling harms from both gamblers and affected others' perspectives. Participants (3076 gamblers and 2129 affected others) completed a  retrospective survey that elicited information on harms they experienced from  gambling across their lifetime. Their responses were analyzed through testing  measurement invariance, estimating item-response theoretic parameters,  calculating percentages, confidence intervals, and correlations, as well as  regressions. The results indicated large commonalities in the experience of harms  reported by gamblers and affected others. Further, gamblers appeared to 'export'  about half of the harms they experienced to those around them. The findings also  provided detailed profiles of evolving harms as problem gambling severity varies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gambling problems appear to be more prevalent in the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population than in the non-Indigenous  population. Although gambling harms can be significant, treatment-seeking rates  are low. The Delphi expert consensus method was used to develop a set of  guidelines on how a family or community member can assist an Aboriginal or Torres  Strait Islander person with gambling problems. METHODS: Building on a previous  systematic review of websites, books and journal articles a questionnaire was  developed that contained items about the knowledge, skills and actions needed for  supporting an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person with gambling problems.  These items were rated over three rounds by an expert panel comprising  professionals who provide treatment to or conduct research with Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander people with gambling problems. RESULTS: A total of 22  experts rated 407 helping statements according to whether they thought the  statements should be included in these guidelines. There were 225 helping  statements that were endorsed by at least 90% of participants. These endorsed  statements were used to develop the guidelines. CONCLUSION: Experts were able to  reach substantial consensus on how someone can recognise the signs of gambling  problems and support an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person to change.
